			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 39m rights issue will give Lyonnaise 12% of McAlpine THE SHARE price of Alfred McAlpine, the construction and house building group, fell by almost a tenth yesterday after the company announced a 1-for-2 rights issue to raise Pounds 38.8m. As a result of the issue Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, one of Europe's biggest construction companies, would increase its stake in McAlpine from 6 per cent to 12 per cent. Mr Graeme Odgers, McAlpine's chief executive, said the two companies had previously agreed that Lyonnaise could increase its share holding to 12 per cent. He had been assured that the French group had no intention of making a bid for McAlpine. Lyonnaise will increase its stake by buying the bulk of the new shares issued to the McAlpine family trust by the rights. The family's stake in the business would fall from 25.6 per cent to 19.5 per cent. It was the second day running that a cash call from a construction company had been poorly received by the stock market. On Thursday the share price of YJ Lovell fell by 18.5 per cent to 145p following the announcement of a 2-for-5 rights issue to raise Pounds 30m. Yesterday Lovell's share price fell further to 143p, only 13p more than the offer price for the new shares. Alfred McAlpine's share price fell from 286p to 258p. The company is offering one new share at 225p for every two already owned. This would give a theoretical ex-rights price of 265p - 8p more than last night's closing price. Institutional investors may have become disenchanted with the volume of paper which has been issued by construction, building materials and property companies. These have sought to raise more than Pounds 1bn, accounting for a third of all rights issues since the beginning of January. Mr Odgers said the company needed the money to reduce its high level of borrowing and to strengthen its UK house building and contracting businesses. It would also be looking to invest in its US contracting and building materials operations. Group borrowings were averaging Pounds 80m, equivalent to more than 60 per cent of shareholders funds. Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to the end of October fell by 61 per cent to Pounds 9.2m. The group has reorganised its businesses, reduced its workforce by 8 per cent and strengthened its management following the appointment of Mr Odgers. See Lex</p>

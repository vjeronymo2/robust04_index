			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] According to a TIME magazine article, the Clinton  administration is concerned because a narcodemocracy could be  forming. The article stated Cali Cartel money is available for  use in the election campaign. According to the magazine, the  situation has reportedly led top Clinton administration  officials to meet with presidential candidates Ernesto Samper  and Andres Pastrana to warn them about Cali Cartel attempts to  infiltrate their campaigns. Pastrana has denied such a meeting  was held.    [Begin Pastrana recording] That is information which is  published in EL TIEMPO today and which was published by TIME  magazine, but I have no knowledge of this. I am now sending a  letter to the overseer and to the U.S. ambassador because I  believe the situation must be clarified. [end recording]    Ernesto Samper, meanwhile, admits he did discuss the topic  with White House officials.    [Begin Samper recording] During several meetings I have held  with State Department officials, we discussed various topics.  We also talked about campaign financing. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KAISER NURSES WALK OUT; 2 FACILITIES ARE AFFECTED  </P> <P> More than 900 registered nurses walked off the job Sunday at two Kaiser  Permanente facilities, including the company's flagship hospital on Sunset  Boulevard in Hollywood, where officials said they were forced to slash their  patient load by two-thirds.  </P> <P> Responding to the strike, officials at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital -- the  major referral hospital for serious illness and injury in Kaiser's Southern  California network -- postponed all elective surgeries. They also shut down  their cardiac surgery and neonatal intensive care units, making arrangements  for patients requiring such specialized services to be treated at medical  centers outside the Kaiser network.  </P> <P> Sunday's walkout, which began just after midnight, marked the second time in  six weeks that Kaiser employees in Southern California have struck the nation's  largest health maintenance organization.  </P> <P> But unlike last month's sweeping strike by 11,200 technicians, maintenance  workers and licensed vocational nurses in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura  counties, Sunday's walkout affects only the 632-bed Kaiser Foundation Hospital  and the 40-bed Skilled Nursing Care Facility in Inglewood.  </P> <P> Neither side expects a quick resolution to the strike. Kaiser officials Sunday  predicted that the walkout could last a month.  </P> <P> David Bullock, southern regional director of Local 535 of the American  Federation of Nurses, which represents the 925 striking employees, said, "We  will be out here for as long as it takes to get them to change their offer."  </P> <P> Union officials added that a severe nursing shortage should make it easier for  Kaiser nurses to stay off the job. During the strike, the union is permitting  its members to work at other area hospitals on a fill-in basis.  </P> <P> Both monetary and professional issues are at stake in the labor dispute. The  nurses say the wage hikes Kaiser has offered would be severely offset by  overtime cutbacks. They also complain that the company is trying to create a  two-tiered system in which nurses with less experience receive lower wage hikes  than more experienced employees.  </P> <P> In addition, the nurses contend that Kaiser has refused to seriously address  the problem of nurses handling non-nursing duties, such as housekeeping,  clerical work and serving meals to patients.  </P> <P> Union members voted overwhelmingly last week to reject Kaiser's final offer --  a three-year contract that called for salary increases of between 7% and 12.5%  during the first year and hikes in each of the next two years of either 4% or  4% above the average wages at area hospitals, whichever is greater. The package  also called for a joint union-management committee to study the issue of  non-nursing duties.  </P> <P> Al Bolden, Kaiser's vice president of human resources, said the package is  "designed to keep us in the forefront of the industry and to allow us to  attract qualified health care professionals."  </P> <P> But union officials branded the committee plan a stalling tactic. Bullock said  the proposed overtime cutbacks would be so severe that, by union calculations,  some nurses would suffer a 1% reduction in salary, even with the raises.  </P> <P> "We have to look at the bottom line -- how much money our members take home,"  he said.  </P> <P> While striking nurses were picketing both the hospital and the Inglewood  clinic, Kaiser officials were relying on management nurses -- including some  from facilities in Northern California and Oregon -- to care for those patients  who had not been sent elsewhere in anticipation of the strike.  </P> <P> "It's disruptive to our patients, who need to be diverted," said Joseph Hummel,  administrator of the Sunset Boulevard hospital, where the normal patient load  of 425 had been reduced to 120 by Sunday. But, he said, "we have not  compromised the quality of care at all."  </P></p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Spain's INI hails wage deal SPAIN'S loss-making public sector industrial holding company claimed yesterday it had signed a breakthrough agreement with unions that will control inflationary wage agreements and break down rigid job classifications. The three-year agreement negotiated by the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI) comes in the wake of a surprisingly strong stand at the EC's Copenhagen summit by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, in favour of salary moderation and of deregulating labour markets to combat economic recession. INI's agreement with the unions holds 1993 wage increases for some 70,000 steel workers below the inflation rate and pegs them to the rise in the cost of living for the next two years.</p>

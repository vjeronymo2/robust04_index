			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Rowland assaults biography with fax barrage MR TINY ROWLAND, joint chief executive of Lonrho, and his wife Josie last night issued statements criticising an unauthorised biography, A Rebel Tycoon. The book is by Mr Tom Bower, whose last book was The Outsider, an acclaimed account of the life of Robert Maxwell. Mr Rowland dealt yesterday with his unsolicited biography in just three sentences. 'I very much regret that a boring and unrecognisable account of my life should have been published today,' he said in a faxed statement to the media. 'None of the interesting bits are in. I know many people, but, thank God, not the author.' Mr Bower laughed last night when told of the Lonrho chief's statement and added: 'It's his way of trying to minimise something that he would have preferred hadn't happened.' Mr Rowland's fax was followed by a more threatening one from Mrs Josie Rowland. 'Apart from the fact that I love my husband every other reference to me is untrue and denigratory,' it said. She was demanding an apology from Mr Bower and publishers Heinemann within 48 hours or she would issue writs. Mr Rowland's statement did not threaten legal action. To avoid the possibility of an injunction to prevent publication the book was printed in Finland and copies were brought into the UK and distributed only last Thursday. The book makes serious allegations about how Lonrho is run and behaves in Africa. In Sunday's Observer, Mr Rowland published an account of his life and also swiped at Mr Bower. 'My life has been my own, and I feel that it's copyright,' he wrote. 'A man I have never met or spoken to, to my knowledge, is going to exhibit me for commercial gain on his part, smearing and distorting everything that belongs to me and giving me a character of his own choosing.' Mr Bower said last night there was nothing new in the 'rather fanciful' Observer account, 'except I didn't know he was so high up in the Hitler youth.' Mr Rowland wrote in the Observer that he had reached the rank of troop leader in charge of 150 boys.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Allianz banks on a short-term loser - Chief executive Uwe Haasen talks about a return to east Germany Since the second half of 1990, Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, has spent hundreds of millions of D-Marks on the former east German state insurance monopoly, Deutsche Versicherungs (DVAG). Munich-based Allianz acquired DVAG in two stages from the Treuhand privatisation agency, and though the second stage still awaits finance ministry approval, it has de facto management control. Allianz laid out DM711m (Dollars 433.5m) to buy the business which, it now forecasts, will lose more than DM1.5bn before starting to make operating profits at the beginning of 1996. Not included in the purchase price is a further DM600m already deployed on capital investment. Together with the projected losses, this makes a total cost of more than DM2.8bn, which represents nearly three times Allianz's consolidated earnings for 1990. And the cost will probably grow even bigger as Allianz moves to build up DVAG's financial reserves. Perhaps Allianz will never make a return on its investment if the 'time value' of money is taken into account. If it does, it is unlikely to be until early next century. Is this willingness, then, to take on such losses, over so many years, an example of the legendary German 'long-termism'? Or is the deal simply misguided, driven by Allianz's desire at any price to be number one in the east of Germany as well as in the west? Mr Uwe Haasen, chief executive of the group's main domestic insurance subsidiary, argues that the losses and the investments have to be seen as part of the purchase price for a business which will give Allianz a strong position in the fast-growing market for insurance in the east. For Mr Haasen, short-term pay-back criteria are secondary to the long-term strategic benefit of getting back into a market which Allianz, and other western insurers, were forced to quit after the second world war. He also maintains that however expensive the acquisition may look now, it will cost rival insurance companies considerably more to establish themselves in eastern Germany at a later stage in its economic recovery. Before reunification, east Germans spent an average of Dollars 127 per head a year on insurance - about a 10th of the amount spent by their west German counterparts. Allianz, and the more than 300 other insurance companies which have sought to establish themselves in the east since the state monopoly there was broken up in July 1990, believe that east German spending on insurance will eventually catch up with that in the west. The Allianz view is that this will take place over the next five to eight years, by which time the east German market will have come to represent about a quarter of the German total. 'We were there in the past - up until the (second world) war our headquarters were in Berlin and the main part of our business used to be in the east,' recalls Mr Haasen. 'And it is very important for us to reoccupy this market segment. 'In 1990 (when Allianz bought its first 51 per cent stake in DVAG) we decided that the best way to do this was to occupy the infrastructure of the old monopoly - to get the offices, the telephones, all these little but important things. 'The priority is to get the same market share in the east as in the west - maybe a little more - and to become established as a settled and well-known insurer, to make sure that the structure for doing business is in place. These operational reasons are more important for the time being than short-term earnings.' However, Mr Haasen's 'for the time being' means at least four years from now: four years before the acquisition begins to make even operating profits. Meanwhile, market share objectives have already been achieved. For example in the motor sector, Allianz's share in the east is more than 20 per cent compared with 15 to 16 per cent in the west. Mr Haasen rejects the suggestion that Allianz is having to wait too long for a return. 'Other insurance companies interested in the east will have to go the same way eventually. Insurance is a local business - you have to be in the east if you want to do business there. You have to build up a salesforce and administration, and that means that (our rivals) will have to pay the same amount of money. In fact, I feel that it is cheaper to invest now, rather than in three or four years' time when prices will have gone up.' Although profits are not the priority, Allianz is taking steps to cut costs. It has long-term plans to bring the number of offices in the east down from more than 200 to between 10 and 20. This year it plans to shed 1,400 employees, approximately 10 per cent of DVAG's workforce, and staff numbers will be whittled down further over the years to come. Although Mr Haasen refuses to be drawn on precise numbers, he does say that the DM2bn of business handled by the 14,000 DVAG staff would need only 5,000 to 7,000 people in the west. He says DVAG productivity will never rise to western levels. Business in the east involves small sums of money and is thus more work-intensive. Therefore, in the long term, staff cuts will exceed the 10 per cent announced already. While costs in the east are higher than in the west, the premiums Allianz charges on its eastern policies are lower - considerably lower in some cases. Motor rates, the most important non-life sector, stand at about 80 per cent of what they are in the west, despite claims experience which is worse - and is likely to get worse still as east Germans drive their newly-acquired western cars around the east's inadequate roads. Property premiums are only 10 per cent of rates in the west, household insurance rates only a third. Allianz cannot simply adjust rates to economic levels; Mr Haasen reckons that if motor rates were doubled, half the existing clients would cancel their policies. Summing up, Mr Haasen says there is a misunderstanding among analysts about the costs of tidying up DVAG - that they tend to assume that DVAG was just a badly-run company which could be rationalised through the application of textbook management procedures. He points out that the required restructuring is much more fundamental than that. 'You've got to transfer the company from the old monopoly structure to our type of economy - and pay for the transition period and all the expenses of getting people used to our systems, to the market, to competition, to the western legal system.' It is possible that Allianz is exaggerating its woes in the east - flaunting the very scale of its commitment to the east - to ensure that the finance ministry does grant approval for the second part of the transaction. However analysts consider that, by normal short to medium-term financial criteria, the deal does not make sense. Mr Peter Constable at Robert Fleming Securities in London, for example, is recommending that investors take advantage of the recent rise in the German stock market to sell shares in Allianz before the full impact of the eastern operations feeds through to the bottom line. Most of the shares in Allianz, however, are held by a small number of German financial institutions - for example Dresdner Bank, Deutsche Bank and Munich Re - whose investment horizons are every bit as long-term as those of the Allianz itself.</p>

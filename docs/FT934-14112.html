			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Expansion of gas production in the southern North Sea LIBERALISATION of the British gas market has persuaded Amoco, the US oil company with extensive North Sea operations, to embark on a Pounds 160m investment programme to expand gas production in the southern North Sea, Robert Corzine writes. The company said the investment would extend the life of the Indefatigable field 60 miles off Norfolk. It would also open up four smaller gas fields in the same area. Mr Mike Ambrose, Amoco commercial manager, said the expansion was only made possible because British Gas was willing to renegotiate the original depletion contract, which gave it sole access to all the gas in the area. The new arrangement guarantees British Gas additional supplies, while allowing Amoco to sell surplus gas in the open market.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATO CHIEF AND BUSH DISCUSS ROLE FOR A UNITED GERMANY  </P> <P> NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner emerged Sunday from talks with President  Bush to suggest that a reunified Germany could be a part of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization without extending NATO's military reach over the territory  that is now East Germany.  </P> <P> Woerner said a way can and will be found to keep a united Germany in NATO while  recognizing "the legitimate security interests of the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> After two days of talks at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., both  Bush and Woerner hailed what the White House called West German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl's "extraordinarily successful" talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow.  </P> <P> Kohl said Saturday that he received "unequivocal" assurances from Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that Moscow would respect the right of the two  Germanys to decide for themselves the timing and structure of their  reunification.  </P> <P> The White House said Bush and Woerner agreed that NATO "should adopt new  political roles," including helping shape U.S. policies toward the East Bloc  nations now moving toward democracy.  </P></p>

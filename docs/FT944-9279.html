			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hydro gets Pounds 10.5m value from placing The placing shares in Hydro International, which is coming to market, have been priced at 80p, valuing the maker of control systems for storm water control and sewage separation at about Pounds 10.5m. Some 4.63m shares are being placed by Allied Provincial Securities. Of these, 4m are new and the balance are being sold by Mr Tim Lamb and Mr Bob Smisson, founding directors and chief executive and deputy chairman respectively. Mr Lamb and Mr Smisson are being paid dividends totalling Pounds 200,000, conditional on the listing. The board does not intend to declare a dividend for the year to December 31: subsequently a dividend policy will be introduced 'broadly reflecting growth in the group's underlying profit'. Of the Pounds 2.75m raised in the placing, some Pounds 2.3m is to be used marketing Hydro's products, investing in information technology, constructing a further test facility, and recruiting additional staff, particularly in research and development. Mrs Elizabeth Kennedy, a director in Allied Provincial's corporate finance department, said that Hydro was a development type company, though not a 'blue sky' company, in that it has patented products bringing in revenue and profit. In 1993 it made Pounds 156,000 on Pounds 4.1m turnover and in the six months to June 30, profits were Pounds 154,000 on Pounds 2.4m turnover. She said that the pricing therefore fell between what the company thought it was worth and what the institutions were prepared to pay. Ten 'mainline' institutions have taken shares, including Scottish Amicable, Friends Provident and Legal &amp; General. Mrs Kennedy said Dollars 3.7m (Pounds 2.25m) orders from Columbus, Georgia, had acted as one of the triggers behind Hydro's decision to come to market.</p>

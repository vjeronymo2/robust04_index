On the last day of a three-day regular session of the  Vienna-based UN organization, Ronald Walker, the chairman of the  IAEA's board of governors, said that the IAEA also welcomes  DPRK's February 15 agreement to let IAEA inspect seven of its  nine nuclear facilities.    Meanwhile, a DPRK spokesman told the press here that DPRK's  agreement on nuclear inspections has pre-conditions, and that  his country definitely rejects inspection of the other two  nuclear facilities located in Yongbyon.    The DPRK has delayed the issuing of visas to IAEA inspectors  because of what it called position shifting by the United States.    The DPRK and the United States have been holding talks on  DPRK's nuclear issues in New York.</p>

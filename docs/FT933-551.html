			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (16): Sly scourge of the unions / Economics/Industry CONFESSIONS OF A UNION BUSTER By Martin Jay Levitt with Terry Conrow Crown Publishing Dollars 22.50 302 pages THOSE WHO believe that unions are the source of all evil in the workplace should read this book. They will find that managements can stoop to far dirtier tricks than organised labour. 'Marty' Levitt seemed to have the most caricatured of American lives: at 25 in 1969 he had founded an executive recruitment firm billing Dollars 100,000 a year, was paying himself Dollars 25,000 a year, had been married, divorced and was in a psychiatric hospital sinking into depression. Then he noticed a job advertisement in the Wall Street Journal for an 'employee relations consultant'. He had next to no relevant qualifications, but managed to talk the top executives at John Sheridan Associates into hiring him for their office in his home town of Cleveland, Ohio. From then on, whenever there was an attempt to organise labour to vote for the creation of a union, Levitt was vying to be there, plotting campaigns, speaking to staff, developing strategies. His responsibility was to senior executives, his job to keep collective action out. In the next 20 years he worked on some 200 campaigns around the US, apparently losing just five to the unions. During that time he generated - and frittered away - vast sums in billings and expenses from managements all too eager to pay. The surprise of this book is just how organised and ruthless the anti-union industry has become. Since the 1960s, it has grown into a sector estimated to be billing more than Dollars 1bn a year, which the author now thinks of as unscrupulous. In Levitt's case, it meant using telephone taps, spreading malicious and often untrue gossip, intimidating staff and gaining access to their personnel files regardless of ethics. His favoured strategy was to divide the workforce, alienating supervisers or other middle-grade employees and forcing them to be the anti-union mouthpieces on threat of losing their jobs. While union staff had to meet secretly at anti-social hours and away from the workplace, he would have the advantage of offices on the premises, and the right as a management person to demand that staff carried out his commands. Much of that time was idled away, and the evenings spent in hard drinking sessions with his paymasters. He learns how supposedly objective employee attitude surveys are manipulated  -not only to win new business by identifying signs of apparent staff discontent, but even by identifying from among the 'anonymous' respondents those likely to be the union sympathisers. There are many frustrations with the book. The style - no doubt heavily influenced by the ghost-writer - is at times banal and repetitive. It is also suspiciously rich in detail, to the extent of apparently recalling perfectly descriptions and events from the 1970s and 1980s. Levitt's ego shines through. Even as a 'convert' with union sympathies, he cannot resist boasting about his expertise in bashing labour or even his more recent prowess as a defector for unions. It would have been useful to read a little about the campaigns which he lost instead of a list of 'victories'. The explanation for his switch in allegiance is given less than a chapter in the book, offering little insight into what motivated the change. The reader never really gets much of the author's inner thoughts about unions and management. What comes across is a rather unthinking, unreflective individual motivated by earning large sums - and yet, ironically, someone unable to manage his money, his personal relationships or any aspect of his life outside work as he degenerated into alcoholism. His partial candour is nonetheless a valuable and rare glimpse at an ill-explored activity.</p>

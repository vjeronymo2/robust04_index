			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Amato challenges critics with confidence vote MR Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, will seek a vote of confidence in parliament later this week to force the four parties in his coalition to publicly demonstrate their support following the weekend cabinet reshuffle. Such support is needed to allay fears of waning enthusiasm for Mr Amato from elements with the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties, the two main partners in the fragile coalition. These fears, accentuated by Mr Amato's inability to move Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister, in the reshuffle, led to further falls in the lira yesterday. The Socialist prime minister has used the confidence vote to good effect to bring his fragile coalition into line on several occasions during his eight months in office. Yesterday he challenged parliament to come up with an alternative government, adding: 'If this is not possible, then it is both necessary and urgent that the government be able to get going again with all its energy in a climate of certainty.' This approach is a reversal of his stand immediately after the reshuffle on Sunday when he ruled out such a vote. He argued the ministerial changes were limited and policy was unaltered since the former communists of the Democratic Left unsuccessfully brought a motion of no confidence at the beginning of the month. Mr Amato must also contend with a cabinet which contains a minister clearly identified as the odd man out - Mr Guarino, the independent-minded constitutional lawyer in the industry portfolio. Mr Amato sought at the weekend to move him because he was holding up privatisation. Mr Guarino was offered the education or science ministries but refused to budge. An Italian premier can only sack ministers in a complete change of government. This is the first occasion a minister has not resigned under such circumstances. Yesterday, Sole 24 Ore, the leading financial daily, said it was so disgusted by Mr Guarino's behaviour that in future the minister would not be referred to by name. Mr Guarino yesterday stressed his willingness to work with the cabinet, but his position remains anomalous. It is also potentially destabilising as he has the backing of some powerful members of the old-guard in the Christian Democrat party.</p>

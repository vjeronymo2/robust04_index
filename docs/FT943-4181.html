			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Major attacks 'yob culture' in fresh law and order drive Mr John Major yesterday called for a drive to dispel public despair over crime as he declared war on 'yob culture' and indicated a growing inclination towards identity cards. While insisting that Britain is safer, more civilised and more secure than most countries, the prime minister admitted: 'When I talk to people I sense that the fear of crime is greater than I can ever remember.' Mr Major advocated the building of 'a huge national partnership against the criminal, in every city and county, every workplace, every school and every home'. The prime minister underlined the importance attached by the Conservative party to regaining its lead on law and order issues. In the run-up to next month's Tory conference, the prime minister was also keen to address the Tory activists' favourite issue. But Mr Major's call for a crime crackdown was greeted with scepticism in some quarters. Mr Peter Cadbury, the former head of Westward Television, who announced he would no longer give financial support to the Conservative party after his home was burgled last month, was far from enthusiastic. He doubted whether it would be possible to build a partnership against crime and forecast that the Tories would be 'wiped out' at the next general election. Mr Major called on magistrates to make full use of their powers to give tougher sentences for so-called 'petty offences'. The prime minister said he looked for 'a real national effort to build an anti-yob culture', ruled out legalising cannabis and other soft drugs and hinted that the government was close to being persuaded that identity cards should be introduced. He said: 'Anything that could check crime and cut fraud must be worth a look. It is crime and the fear of crime that most violate our civil liberties.' Outlining measures already in place, he said they would cut down the 'scandalous over-use of cautioning for persistent offenders' and tighten the bail rules. Mr Major accepted that the public wanted 'tough and challenging penalties for persistent young offenders, not visits to safari parks'. Alleged offenders should be remanded in custody rather than bailed if there was any risk of repeating the kind of violent crimes for which they were awaiting trial, he said. He said the public want a clampdown on those who make the streets frightening. Mr Alun Michael, Labour spokesman on home affairs, accused Mr Major of giving 'the illusion of action' while offering little comfort to victims of crime.</p>

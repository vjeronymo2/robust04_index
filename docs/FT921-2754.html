			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Recovery under way as Savage makes Pounds 676,000 Savage Group, the shelving manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 676,000 for the half year to December 31 compared to a loss of Pounds 300,000 from continuing businesses in the equivalent period of 1990, and a total deficit in that period of Pounds 816,000. The result included a loss of Pounds 198,000 for discontinued operations in Belgium and the Netherlands. There were extraordinary costs of Pounds 2.58m relating primarily to the group's departure from some of its Benelux operations. The disposals meant that interim turnover was down from Pounds 62.5m to Pounds 37.8m and net assets were down to Pounds 15.3m against Pounds 17.4m at June 30, the reduction being primarily due to the Belgian closure. Borrowings fell to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 7.8m), taking gearing down to 38 per cent. Operating margins improved from 2.2 per cent to 3.8 per cent. Losses per share amounted to 0.3p (3.7p). There is no interim dividend but directors anticipated a payment later this year.</p>

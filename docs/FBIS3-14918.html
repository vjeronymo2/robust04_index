He qualified the  recent Azeri radio allegations that Armenia is holding 3500  Azeri prisoners of war, as "another lie."    According to Martoian, 5 Azeris were captured "when staging  armed encroachment on Armenia's borders," and 11 when trying to  cross Armenian territory from Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan.    Moreover, the Defence Ministry spokesman denied the Azeri  Foreign Ministry's assertions that there are concentration camps  in Armenia.    As Martoian said, last year Armenia unilaterally returned to  Azerbaijan 16 prisoners of war and 60 civilians from Kelbajar  District in Azerbaijan, who had taken refuge in the canyons of  Vardeni District in Armenia.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Books: Pleasure in the south - Updike writes with panache in a new setting BRAZIL by John Updike Hamish Hamilton, 261 pp, Pounds 14. Not to he confused with the film of the same name, John Updike's new novel is a retelling of the Tristan and Iseult story. The setting, however, is Brazilian not Breton and the period covered is the 1960s to now. Yes, this is a departure for the man who has been taking his scalpel to the American East Coast middle-class and their sexual mores for 30 years. His skills, however, have not deserted him; first and foremost, his fluency with words (page succeeding page, it never ceases to amaze); and second, his facility for structure, for architecture. The novel starts on Copacabana beach with the first meeting of the ill-starred couple: Tristao is a black shanty-town dweller, Isabel is the white upper middle-class daughter of a Brazilian diplomat. Fleeing from her father (who disapproves of miscegenation), they go west (in the time-honoured tradition of American fiction) to the Chilean border, where they meet their nemesis in the form of an Indian shaman. Tejucupapo, as he is named, turns Tristao white, and Isabel black. Knowing that daddy can't object now that his son-in-law is the same colour as he is, the couple retrace their steps through the very terrain through which they had earlier fled, until at last they arrive at Copacabana, at the very spot where they met 20-odd years earlier. The narrative then draws to its melancholy conclusion. And this being Updike, there is naturally a corresponding emotional symmetry. When the couple first meet, Isabel, is in awe of her 'bit of black rough' with his 'swelling yam', while Tristao is gentlemanly and humble. She wants to submit and to serve; meanwhile, he can't believe his luck. Once their colouring is reversed, she becomes aggressive, while Tristao, eschewing chivalry, wrestles her into submission and then partakes with her (some people aren't going to like this) 'of the criminal bliss of rape'. Which brings this reviewer to that other Updike hallmark: his interest in sex because of what it reveals about character, and the unflinching virtuosity with which he describes the many and varied private acts of couples - all without ever becoming titillating or striking a false note. Yes, again this is a typical Updike book; there is a lot of sex in it, but it is emphatically not a work which one would describe as 'sexy'. In Brazil, one finds Updike as he always is; and those who like him should like this novel, although maybe not quite as much as those books in which the old wordsmith is describing his native habitat. The North American settings, because they are familiar to the author, obviously come easier to him. In Brazil, he has had to marshal an enormous amount of research and then represent it in Updike-speak. His energy, however, is unstinting and his panache is extraordinary. Whether he's writing about Brazilian flora and fauna (his descriptions of natural history in this book are superb) or the miserable gold mining area in the Dourada, he's always engaging. While Updike is always Updike the question remains: why South America, why Brazil? Well, why not, is one answer. Nabokov changed from old to new world, switching languages in the process. Graham Greene may have been Berkhamsted born and bred, but that didn't not stop him writing about Indo-China and South America. But those writers had an aptitude for such an endeavour, whereas Updike is not a chameleon who can change his colouring to suit his locale. Another answer is that writers need new worlds and they are perfectly entitled to carve them out. Perhaps Updike is bored with his usual milieu and wants a change. Maybe, but I suspect that what lies behind Brazil is something deeper and more important. North America, for white writers at any rate, is no longer the epic canvas that it once was. Everything's been conquered; there's nothing left to discover. The world Updike trawled in the Rabbit series and Couples has been over-fished. White middle-class America is also getting smaller and, as it shrinks, it becomes - at least for a writer of Updike's particular intelligence - a less congenial place. Updike can use the 'R' word to describe the love-making (sic) of two Brazilians and get away with it. However, relocate the narrative to say, New Hampshire, and chances are the Thought Police from the Ministry of Political Correctness are going to go nuts. 'Hey,' I can hear them saying after reading the passage referred to, 'he supports rape in marriage.' He doesn't. But if you're one of those sexual hygiene freaks who believe the world should conform to your beliefs and can't bear it being messy, untidy and contradictory, you could easily persuade yourself that he does. Given these factors (and the pressure on writers to conform is only one part of this picture), it should come as no surprise that Updike has moved south to give himself more room in which to operate. Perhaps this is also a signal of a larger change that white middle-class American writers are about to make. If it is, the world will not be any the poorer for it - so long as Updike's high standards are maintained - for Brazil is a fine and memorable achievement. Novelist and film-maker Carlo Gebler's fifth novel, The Cure, will be published next February.</p>

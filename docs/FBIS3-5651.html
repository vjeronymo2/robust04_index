However, Morgan Bengtson [name as  published], president of Ericsson Japan (located in Xinato Ward,  Tokyo) said: "With regard to cellular phones, the Japanese  market is open. The highest priorities should be given to  technological capabilities and prices in an open, competitive  system. It is not good that (the market principle) is twisted  by political pressures." His remarks can be seen as "coming to  Japan's rescue."    Bengtson also said: "A trade imbalance surely exists between  Japan and the United States. However, there is a possibility  that U.S. policies (on the cellular phone issue) will work  against the free trade system. It is not desirable for American  companies to have an advantage in the Japanese market because of  such policies." He questioned the U.S. strategy of demanding  numerical targets by threatening the possibility of sanctions  against Japan.    Ericsson Japan is a subsidiary of the major Swedish  electrical manufacturer Ericsson Company. Ericsson Japan has  succeeded in receiving orders for radio base stations for  cellular phones worth about 40 billion yen from NTT Mobile  Communications Network Company and Tokyo Digital Phone Company  (located in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo; president, Susumu Ochiai).  Thus, it is believed that Ericsson cannot remain indifferent to  this Japan-U.S. friction.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Easy summit ride for Major Mr John Major had nothing to fear in Essen. The European Union, the most dangerous element in his domestic political troubles, was treading water. Grand initiatives await the outcome of next spring's French presidential elections. The summit communique had plenty with which Mr Major could agree. The free-market language on competitiveness, the Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) in aid to Northern Ireland, endorsement of the United Nation's efforts in Bosnia, and backing for initiatives to promote subsidiarity and combat fraud were signs Britain's voice was being heard. But Mr Major has only six months to end the civil war in the Conservative party over Europe and to prepare a credible negotiating position for the 1996 intergovernmental conference. Ministers will soon discuss a series of position papers around which Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, believes the bulk of the Conservative party can unite. The papers set two priorities: the first is to contain - and in some cases roll back - the independence of EU institutions; the second is to promote a 'positive' agenda to reinforce and expand the inter-governmental dimension to the Union put in place at Maastricht. A central idea is for a slimmed-down Commission concerned more with enforcing existing rules than with producing new legislation. It might well retain the power to initiate legislation but could see its freedom of action circumscribed by an obligation to work to a programme laid down by the council of ministers. The focus of the Strasbourg parliament should be on more extensive scrutiny  -particularly over the EU's financial operations - rather than on extending its authority vis-a-vis national governments. MEPs should be ready also to share that role with committees of national parliaments. Britain wants institutional advances concentrated on inter-governmental co-operation. Mr Hurd has drawn up proposals for a more cohesive EU approach to security and defence designed to provide a distinctive European role within the Atlantic alliance. There is no guarantee that such a strategy will re-unite the Tory party. The Eurosceptics might yet bring down Mr Major. To meet the threat the odds are that any British package for the IGC will be accompanied by the promise from the prime minister of a referendum on the next stage of EU integration.</p>

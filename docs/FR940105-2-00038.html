Osborne (``proposed respondents''). All of the proposed respondents are located in Danville, California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Hairbow Company and Rainbow Productions disseminate advertising seeking individuals to assemble craft items at home. The Hairbow Company sells instructional kits and craft materials, and/or charges registration fees, to individuals wanting to perform such assembly work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complaint alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented the weekly earnings that are regularly realized by The Hairbow Company's home assemblers, through performing such assembly work and submitting it to The Hairbow Company for compensation. The complaint further alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented that there is a significant marketplace demand for the demand for the products they offer for assembly. The complaint alleges that these misrepresentations violate Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. &sect;45(a)(1)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order requires proposed respondents to cease making any material misrepresentations, including specifically misrepresentations regarding past, present or future earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity. The order further prohibits misrepresentations regarding the marketplace demand for any product or service for which proposed respondents are offering a work opportunity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order also prohibits proposed respondents from making any earnings-related or profit-related claims through using phrases such as ``up to,'' or through stating any dollar amount, unless the stated earnings or profit figures can be achieved by an appreciable number of participants. The latter prohibition also requires disclosure of the class of consumers who can achieve stated earnings or profit levels, where factors or conditions affecting earnings or profits are not reasonably foreseeable by prospective workers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order additionally requires proposed respondents to retain specified records relating to their advertising of work opportunities, the persons who paid money to participate in any work opportunity, and the earnings or profits of participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the proposed order requires the corporate respondent to notify the Commission of changes in corporate structure, the individual respondent to notify the Commission of his discontinuance his present business or employment and each new business or employment affiliation, and all proposed respondent to file compliance reports with the Commission. Proposed respondents would be subject to civil penalties if they did not comply with any of the above order provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order also requires proposed respondents to pay to the Federal Trade Commission $1,900,000 for consumer redress or disgorgement. This liability is suspended, however, on the basis of financial disclosures made by proposed respondents to the FTC, with the proviso that the Commission can reopen the proceeding if it subsequently determines that there are material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial disclosures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Benjamin I.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video of Russian nuclear submarines introduced </F> by journalist Aleksandr Ostrovskiy; from the "Poligon" program]    [Excerpt] [Ostrovskiy] Thoughts about the future of the  Russian Navy are on the minds of naval servicemen, and they are  not alone in this. Here are two reports by Igor Kondo and Jim  Stuart, a U.S. military observer.    [Kondo over video of submarines in bay, attributed to  VoyenTV] Because of the sharp reduction in Russia's military  arsenals, the Navy's responsibility for ensuring Russia's  security and sovereignty has increased. This applies in  particular to our nuclear submarine fleet, since, in the near  future, around 50 percent of Russia's strategic nuclear  potential will be based on submarines. This nuclear potential  will essentially be concentrated on the latest Typhoon-class  submarines armed with strategic missiles. It is possible to  claim with confidence that these submarines embody the best  achievements of our modern science and technology. Saturated  with modern electronics and armed with various types of missiles  and torpedoes, designed to protect both underwater and surface  targets from enemy attacks, these submarines are fitted with 20  strategic missiles. They can strike from any position, from any  part of the world ocean, and against any target. They have no  fear of ocean depths or Arctic ice. These submarines are  constantly in alert duty mode, irrespective of whether they are  at sea or moored at base. Despite their huge dimensions -- they  are more than 180 meters long and around 30 meters wide -- they  have excellent maneuverability and their survivability is some  40 percent higher than that of similar NATO-country submarines.  In short, the Typhoon-class strategic nuclear missile-armed  submarines are the pride and joy of our Navy and the guarantor  of Russia's security. No other country in the world has such  powerful modern submarines in its arsenal. It is no accident  that foreign intelligence services watch these submarines  closely. A Typhoon only has to put to sea and, in addition to  enemy ASW ships, two U.S. Los Angeles-class multirole strike  submarines immediately mount a search.    The Navy has more than enough problems at the moment. They  include fuel and spare part shortages and expired overhaul  deadlines. The very future of the Russian Navy is uncertain.  New ships are not being built. All this is affecting  navigational safety and places an additional burden on naval  servicemen. [passage omitted]</p>

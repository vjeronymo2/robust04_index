			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Gloom over prospects for property companies BANKS expect the number of property companies going into receivership to rise, according to a survey carried out by Chesterton Financial, a property adviser, and Chartered Surveyor Weekly magazine. Three quarters of the lenders polled expect a higher rate of receiverships over the next six months, and half of them expect the upward trend to continue for at least a year. The survey showed a sharp drop in confidence about the prospects of a quick recovery. Only four of the 60 lending institutions surveyed expected an improvement in the market over the next six months. Last July most banks thought the market had bottomed out. However, more than half expected it to improve over the year, while only three thought it would get worse. Lenders have increased their average bad debt provision by 8.5 per cent. Provisions against bad debts are likely to be the norm for at least the next six months. The proportion of borrowers from the 60 lenders who breached their loan covenants has fallen by more than a fifth to 13.7 per cent. Lenders remain pessimistic about problem debts, with 40 per cent expecting more borrowers to break their loan covenants over the next year, contrasting with 25 per cent who had that expectation last July. Banks have delayed putting companies into receivership because of the difficulties of selling into a depressed market. Mr Mike Riley, managing director of Chesterton Financial, said: 'We expect to see an increased number of receiverships as the market improves.' The largest proportion of the banks and financial institutions surveyed was based in the UK with the others based on the Continent, in Japan and the US.

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram transactions THE TAKEOVER Panel is likely to give a rap on the knuckles to Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management, a US investment adviser which yesterday belatedly disclosed 24 transactions in the shares of Spring Ram, the UK kitchens and bathrooms group. The transactions dated from late August to mid-October, and all should have been declared within 48 hours under rule 8 of the UK Takeover Code. Spring Ram was in bid talks until the end of last month with Masco Corporation, the US building products firm, but these have now ended. Mitchell Hutchins' stake in Spring Ram peaked at 1.74 per cent in mid-September and stood at just over 1 per cent after its most recent disposal, on October 13.</p>

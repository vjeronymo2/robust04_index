			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Russia's MPs impose chaos on order: Leyla Boulton looks on, bemused, as parliament opens in Moscow to a medley of decisions about decisions 'This is a disgrace,' muttered Mr Sergei Kovalyov, a leader of Russia's Choice, the radical reform bloc set up by leading reformist ministers. 'This is a joke,' fumed Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, as the morning session of Russia's first multi-party parliament dissolved into four hours of chaotic argument over whether to take a break. President Boris Yeltsin's new legislature was suspiciously like the disgraced Soviet-era parliament - unruly. But yesterday it was democracy in action. 'It's the beginning of democracy, of something like a parliament. The west had 200 to 300 years to develop democracy while we have had just a few,' said Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the head of the reformist Yabloko bloc. 'This is not a joke.' Meanwhile, stung by accusations that he represents a serious threat to democracy, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader, tried hard to project an image of respectability, but finally gave up and began shouting. To the applause of his Liberal Democrats, the second largest group in parliament after Russia's Choice, Mr Zhirinovsky ordered the chamber to stop trying to remove Mr Georgy Lukava - a member of his party who by virtue of being the oldest deputy was serving as temporary speaker.' We'll go away and discuss the new speaker until midnight or six in the morning if necessary,' he cried at the top of his voice. 'But he won't go away until a legally elected speaker comes to take his place.' But Mr Zhirinovsky's help was not enough to stop the 68-year-old academic in military uniform from sinking into the parliamentary quicksand. Error followed error and Mr Lukava finally agreed to share his job with senior citizens from the other factions. Not that the parliament is short of experienced deputies, with the chamber reading like a Who's Who from its two predecessors. Most prominent was Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, speaker of the Soviet parliament accused of masterminding the 1991 coup against Mr Gorbachev. As Mr Lukava floundered away, many saw Mr Lukyanov as an ideal speaker, for all his past sins. But after two years in jail and with possible charges still pending after the failure of the coup trial to come to any conclusions, he looked tired and fragile and said he had no desire to return to the speaker's chair. Meanwhile, the shadow of Mr Zhirinovsky and his likely alliance with the Communists, Agrarians, and ultra-nationalists, had the pro-democracy forces on high alert, resorting to every filibuster they could think of to influence events. As the Liberal Democrats tried to hurry along procedural votes, Russia's Choice first threatened to walk out and then refused to register its deputies, successfully depriving the assembly of a quorum and ensuring that the logistics of the new parliament were as chaotic as its first deliberations.</p>

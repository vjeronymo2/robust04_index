			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLANVILLE HAS BEEN HIRED TO COACH LAST-PLACE FALCONS, PAPER REPORTS  </P> <P> The Atlanta Falcons will announce today that Jerry Glanville, who recently  resigned as coach of the Houston Oilers, has been hired as Falcon coach,  according to a published report.  </P> <P> The Atlanta Journal and the Atlanta Constitution reported in a copyright story  that the announcement would be made at a news conference. Falcon officials  weren't available to comment on the report.  </P> <P> Glanville, an assistant coach with the Falcons from 1977 to 1982, would succeed  Marion Campbell, who retired with four games left in the season. Jim Hanifan  served as interim coach, but was told that no member of the current staff would  get the job.  </P> <P> The Falcons finished 3-13, and have the first selection in the 1990 NFL draft.  The Falcons have finished last in the NFC West five of the last six seasons.  </P> <P> Glanville, 48, resigned from the Oilers Jan. 6 after Houston lost the AFC  wild-card game at home to the Pittsburgh Steelers.  </P> <P> Glanville had a 35-35 record in four seasons at Houston, after going 0-2 in  1985 when he was hired as interim coach. His playoff record with the Oilers was  2-3.  </P> <P> The newspaper said it couldn't reach Taylor Smith, Falcon executive vice  president, or Ken Herock, vice president for player personnel, Saturday night.  </P> <P> The newspaper said sources close to Glanville and high-ranking league sources  in Denver for Sunday's AFC Championship game confirmed he had been offered and  accepted the job.  </P> <P> Glanville's wife, Brenda, told the newspaper only that her husband was "out of  pocket" for the evening.  </P> <P> Glanville had an interview in Atlanta two days before he left the Oilers. The  Falcons also interview Joe Bugel, an assistant with the Washington Redskins,  and were thought to be interested in Mike Holmgren, offensive coach of the San  Francisco 49ers, who play host to the Rams in the NFC Championship game today.  </P></p>

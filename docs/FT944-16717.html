			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Management: Business schools set out their stall Business schools in Europe have been making cautiously optimistic noises about a revival of interest in the MBA. A reception in London next Monday evening organised by the UK-based Association of MBAs will put their confidence to the test. Altogether, 41 schools from the UK, continental Europe and the US will be available to answer questions from prospective students. Those who attend will be able to find out about the availability and suitability of courses and about various methods of financing their studies. All modes of MBA 'delivery' - full-time, part-time and 'distance learning'  - will be represented. According to Roger McCormick, director general of AMBA, would-be students 'will be able to speak directly not only to admissions directors and business school faculty, but also to graduates about what it was really like'. The participating schools include 23 from the UK (including London, Ashridge, Cranfield, Manchester and Henley), 10 from continental Europe (eg, IESE of Barcelona, Insead in France and Rotterdam of the Netherlands) and top US institutions such as Harvard, Wharton, Stanford and MIT. The reception will be held at the Institute of Directors, 116 Pall Mall, London W1. Details from AMBA on 071-837 3375.                        *       *       * The European Foundation for Management Development in Brussels has announced that this year's European Case Writing competition winner is Dr Morgan Gould from IMD in Switzerland. The prize - intended to improve and expand the availability of European-based teaching and training materials - was awarded for the case Revolution at Oticon. Robert Brown of Cranfield University was winner of the entrepreneurship category for his case Dockspeed.</p>

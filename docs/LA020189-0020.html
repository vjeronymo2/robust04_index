			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVING ENERGY  </P> <P> Southern California Edison has maintained a leadership role in energy  conservation for more than a decade, and our commitment is no less today.  Reporter Jill Stewart's article "Utilities Shun Energy Savings, Critics Assert"  (Part I, Jan. 15) ignores several important facts about Edison's extensive  conservation programs.  </P> <P> Edison has the most successful electric utility conservation operation in the  country, encompassing over 50 programs for customers ranging from low-income to  agricultural to large industrial users. We have more than 300 employees working  on conservation and over the years have helped our customers save more than 25  billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.  </P> <P> In 1988 alone we assisted over 75,000 residential customers to conserve their  in-home energy use, more than in any past year. Our conservation  accomplishments have been widely recognized, including more than 15 awards for  excellence in the past two years, and both U.S. and foreign utilities come to  us for advice.  </P> <P> In just the three years 1985-1987, Edison spent nearly $200 million on energy  conservation programs that saved our customers 3.5 billion kilowatt-hours of  electricity. This is the equivalent of conserving almost 6 million barrels of  fuel oil per year. Our efforts have already enabled us to eliminate the need to  construct two major power plants.  </P> <P> At Edison, we are continually investigating state-of-the-art conservation  technologies, phasing out less effective programs, and initiating and updating  others. In this dynamic process, a cardinal tenet is that all programs result  in using electricity wisely. This does not mean using less electricity is  always the best option. Electric conservation decisions must be weighed  alongside considerations of air quality benefits, fossil fuel preservation and  cost-effectiveness for customers.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District, for example, calls for  increased use of electricity throughout the Los Angeles basin because  electricity is less polluting than some alternatives. Replacing combustion  engines with electric motors or installing electric industrial processes on a  selective basis may increase electric consumption. But at the same time, it  will improve air quality.  </P> <P> As always, Southern California Edison's energy conservation efforts will be  pro-active and responsive to customers' needs.  </P> <P> ROBERT H.

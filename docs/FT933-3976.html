			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: BAe offshoot in merger talks BALLAST Nedam, the Dutch construction subsidiary of British Aerospace, is holding talks with Boskalis, another large Dutch construction company, to explore possible forms of co-operation, including a merger. The companies said the talks, which have been going on for several weeks, are taking place in consultation with BAe. A spokesman for Boskalis said it was too early to say what the conclusions of the talks might be. However, he added that potential co-operation could be far-reaching, with a merger among the possibilities. The companies will not comment on the progress of the talks until they are completed. Ballast Nedam's future has been uncertain for some time, partly because of BAe's own restructuring. In December, Ballast Nedam chairman, Mr Willem Maeyer, resigned after BAe decided against hiving off the company through either a buy-out or a bourse flotation. Ballast Nedam, with annual turnover of Fl 2.2bn (Dollars 1.2bn), and Boskalis, with turnover of nearly Fl 1bn, described themselves as companies which 'potentially complement and strengthen each other's market position'. Boskalis, a leading international dredging company and a specialist in marine construction, generates 80 per cent of its business outside the Netherlands. Ballast Nedam, traditionally strong in the Middle East, does about half of its business overseas. Ballast Nedam's expertise in the Middle East - it built the causeway linking Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - was the main reason why BAe acquired the company in 1987.</p>

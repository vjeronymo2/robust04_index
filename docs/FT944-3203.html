			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Union Miniere delays share issue Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group, yesterday postponed the flotation of its Swedish subsidiary, Ammeberg Mining, because it failed to achieve the pricing it wanted. The delay again highlights the weak state of the new issues market. 'The mine is not part of our core business, but it is a valuable asset and we are not prepared to sell at a give-away price,' UM said. However, bankers associated with the issue said the flotation would have had problems at any price because international investment institutions were tired and nervous after a difficult year. 'They are just not interested. They want to start afresh in January,' said one. Apart from a general malaise in the new issues market, the Ammeberg flotation also suffered because of what Mr Nick Hatch, analyst at Ord Minnett, an associate of Jardine Fleming, describes as 'indigestion' in the resources sector. He calculates that resource companies so far this year have raised Dollars 8.7bn and, by the year-end, the total will be nearly twice the Dollars 5bn raised in 1993. Other recent resource casualties include Samax, the UK company with African mining interests which shelved a Pounds 16m flotation two weeks ago, and Alumax, the US aluminium group, which postponed indefinitely the issue of 8m new shares worth about Dollars 250m. Kymmene, Finland's second largest forestry group, last week unexpectedly called off plans to raise more than FM1.5bn (Dollars 307m) in a domestic and overseas share issue. Two other resources companies are touring institutions in the hope of raising money before the year-end: Banesto, the Spanish bank, wants to sell 39 per cent of Asturiana de Zinc, which owns the largest zinc smelter in the world; while Stillwater Mining of the US, the only primary platinum group metals producer outside South Africa, is looking for about Dollars 70m. UM planned an initial public offering of nearly 11m Ammeberg shares, or 95 per cent of the company, at between SKr112 and SKr130 each. This valued Ammeberg at between SKr1.26bn and SKr1.46bn (Dollars 167.3m and Dollars 193.9m). Ammeberg, which was to be quoted on the Stockholm stock exchange, operates the Zinkgruvan zinc-lead-silver underground mine in south-central Sweden, which produces about 10 per cent of the western world's zinc. UM said last year it wanted to give up its role as the world's biggest zinc producer. It has closed its zinc refining plant at Overpelt in Belgium and cancelled plans to double capacity at its Balen zinc refinery, also in Belgium. In February, UM sold its Union Zinc subsidiary in the US to Savage Resources, a small Australian company, for USDollars 200m. Flotation of the Swedish zinc subsidiary would have rounded off the rationalisation process.</p>

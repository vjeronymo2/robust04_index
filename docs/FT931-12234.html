			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Modest Dow gain on mixed economic data Wall Street US EQUITIES edged higher yesterday, although the gains were relatively modest in the wake of mixed economic news, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 14.86 up at 3,306.25, although the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was only 0.55 firmer at 438.66. Secondary stocks continued to slip, with the Nasdaq composite closing 3.23 lower at 694.67. New York SE volume was 257m shares. There was encouraging news from the Commerce Department, which reported that gross domestic product was up 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, above market predictions of 3.1 per cent. Enthusiasm for the GDP numbers, however, was tempered by a report that initial claims for state unemployment insurance had risen by 2,000 in the week ended January 16 to 364,000; a decline of 9,000 had been expected. American Express declined a further Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 22 3/8 in active trading. Investors remained concerned about turmoil within the group's top management - three key members of the board of directors resigned on Wednesday over the decision of Mr James Robinson to remain chairman of the group and to take over the running of its Shearson Lehman brokerage subsidiary. Trading was also heavy in Service Merchandise, a catalogue and showroom merchandiser. The stock plunged Dollars 4 to Dollars 11 1/8 after the company posted flat fourth-quarter net earnings of 88 cents a share. Analysts had expected earnings of 99 cents in the latest quarter. Delta Air Lines eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 51 following a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 3.04 a share against a deficit of Dollars 3.89 a year earlier. The airline also cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share from 30 cents. UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 122 1/4 on a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 9.27 a share compared with Dollars 10.69 last year. The company also said it was cutting 2,700 jobs. On the Nasdaq market, technology issues continued to run into profit-takers, with Intel retreating Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 109. Sun Microsystems receded Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 in early trading before recovering to end a net Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 38 5/8 . Some analysts have reduced their ratings on the stock following disappointing second-quarter earnings. Lotus Development, the personal computer software maker, climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 23 3/4 in the morning on news of fourth-quarter net income of 35 cents a share, but fell back to end only Dollars  1/8 ahead at Dollars 21 7/8 . Canada TORONTO again finished slightly softer following active trading. The TSE 300 index lost 3.7 at 3,307.9 and declines led advances by 316 to 289 after volume of 46.2m shares. Moore, down CDollars 2 at CDollars 19 1/2 , said it will take a pre-tax restructuring charge of about CDollars 77m in fiscal 1992 and implement various programmes to reduce personnel and eliminate redundant assets.</p>

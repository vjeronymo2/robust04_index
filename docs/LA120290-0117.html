			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DISPLAY THEIR ANTI-GULF WAR SENTIMENTS  </P> <P> I read the article on high school students protesting our nation's efforts in  the Middle East with great disappointment ("High Schoolers Demonstrate Anti-War  Sentiments," Nov. 22).  </P> <P> As a retired secondary school teacher, I can remember the pride expressed by my  history students for their country's stands for justice and democracy.  </P> <P> It appears that this present generation no longer possesses this quality.  </P> <P> Of course, no sane, reasonably adjusted person is in favor of war, but there  are worse things.  </P> <P> Doesn't the quality of life count for anything anymore? Or is it simply the  quantity that matters, regardless of its meaning or quality?  </P> <P> These students should be exposed to historically proven long-term results of  appeasing and rewarding military dictators. The consequences are far worse, in  terms of human degradation and loss of life, than following our President's  present course could ever be.  </P> <P> This is true, even if this course results in a short-term war, if this war  destroys Saddam's ability to be an even greater threat to the whole world in  the future.  </P> <P> Have their teachers failed them? Or is this simply an indication of a whole  generation that no longer sees quality, pride, reputation, justice and  meaningful existence as important?  </P> <P> IRVING E. FRIEDMAN, Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

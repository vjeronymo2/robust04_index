			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Dairy Crest ahead to Pounds 17m Dairy Crest, the Milk Marketing Board's dairy products division which is due to float in the new year, recorded a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 17m for the half year to September 30. Profits were struck after Pounds 2m (Pounds 4.4m) of exceptional rationalisation costs. Mr John Houliston, chief executive, said Dairy Crest was 'very much looking forward to industry deregulation and flotation.' The flotation is expected to value the group at between Pounds 250m and Pounds 300m. Mr Houliston said details of the move were under active discussion. In the past three years much had been done to prepare the business to be 'a robust and sustainable' company when it was exposed to a free market in milk, when the MMB is abolished on April 1, and to being a public company. Mr Houliston said that although he believed that Milk Marque, the buying group the MMB has proposed to succeed itself, was the safest way of moving into the new system, the company's prime consideration was to guarantee its milk supplies at competitive prices. In the half year turnover fell from Pounds 575m to Pounds 526m, as the volume of milk available for manufacture fell by 6 per cent and Dairy Crest had to absorb price increases of 12.8 per cent for liquid milk. Turnover from continuing operations rose 1 per cent to Pounds 412m (Pounds 409m). The group sold five bottling dairies which supplied doorstep milk deliveries, a market currently down by more than 10 per cent. Operating profits from continuing businesses rose 14 per cent to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 15.5m). The consumer foods division increased operating profits by to Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 6.6m), but the food services side fell from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 8.5m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ivan Hladkiy] </F>   [Excerpts] The dire socioeconomic situation in which  Belarus has fallen of late -- constant price hikes, falling  production, the specter of mass unemployment -- are threatening  our very well-being. I am convinced that we will overcome the  economic carnage, but it will be more difficult to overcome the  aftermath of the Chernobyl accident.    I have invited Natalia Masherova, chairman of Public Fund  for  Chernobyl Issues, to comment on this problem.    [Begin Masherova recording, in Russian] [passage omitted]  Belarusian children are the ones who have suffered most from the  Chernobyl catastrophe. I am addressing the Belarusian  legislature: It is easier to convince the international  community than our state financial structures that we are going  through a critical period. In Belarus, we have witnessed a  dramatic increase in (?aggressive) thyroid cancer among  children. Currently, Ukraine and Russia are lagging behind in  these statistics. These statistics demonstrate that currently  0.1 percent out of one million children suffer from thyroid  cancer. In Belarus, in Gomel Oblast in particular, this figure  is 13 percent. Why do we keep silent about these tragic  figures? In my opinion, all the work of our legislature and the  government should stem from the addressing of Chernobyl issues.  [end recording]</p>

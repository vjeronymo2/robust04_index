			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Ewart's 21% downturn intensifies war of words AS EWART, the Belfast-based property company, reported a 21 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 254,000 to Pounds 201,000 for the year to April 30, the war of words over its control increased in intensity. Mr Philip Monahan, who holds a 29.22 per cent stake and is attempting to replace four existing directors, said that the company's existing strategy was not successful and the present management had no ideas for recouping shareholder value. Mr Barry Gilligan, managing director, said he was pleased to report a profitable year in 'extremely difficult' market conditions. He added that the view of the majority of the directors was that the board changes should be rejected. Mr Monahan is seeking to replace four directors with Mr Patrick Whyman, who holds a 6.38 per cent stake and Mr Edward Sweeney, development director of Mr Monahan's Dublin-based Monarch Properties. When asked if he considered whether Mr Monahan and Mr Whyman were acting in concert Mr Gilligan said he could not comment but the company would be sending its views on the move to shareholders soon. He added that he thought Mr Monahan was trying to take control of Ewart without making a full bid. Mr Monahan's view was that as they were existing shareholders there was no requirement to make a full bid. He is seeking to replace Capt Bill Henderson, a former chairman, Sir William Ewart, Mr Dominic Deeny, development director and Mr David Robinson, finance director. The year's profit was achieved on turnover of Pounds 3.7m against Pounds 12.6m, which was boosted by the sale of a development. The net interest charge increased from Pounds 5,800 to Pounds 718,000 as a result of the non-capitalisation of interest. In the previous year interest on the sold development had been capitalised. Earnings per share were 1.18p (0.34p) and the proposed final dividend is maintained at 0.5p for a total of 0.75p (1p).</p>

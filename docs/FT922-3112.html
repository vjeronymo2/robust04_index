			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Welsh Water rises to Pounds 138m - Pledge to limit price rises below regulator's target WELSH WATER yesterday became the first of the ten privatised water and sewerage companies to pledge to raise prices by less than already allowed by Ofwat, the water regulator, until 1995. The company said it would limit price increases to 5 per cent above the rate of inflation, unless the situation changed 'exceptionally.' The original price cap, set during the 1989 privatisation, was 6.5 per cent above inflation until Ofwat's review in 1995. All the water companies have agreed to limit price increases this year, often in response to Ofwat pressure, but Welsh Water is the first to extend its pledge. Mr John Elfed Jones, chairman, said the new cap was a reward for customers. Ofwat welcomed the move. 'It will help consumers' pockets,' the regulator said. But the decision was poorly received on the stock market, where the shares fell 16p to 451p. SG Warburg, the broker, estimated that the price cap would reduce profits by Pounds 4m-Pounds 5m a year. Pre-tax profits increased 8 per cent from Pounds 128m to Pounds 138m in the year to March 31. Turnover increased 17 per cent to Pounds 342m (Pounds 293m), mainly due to average price rises of 16.2 per cent. Prices are set to rise a further 9.3 per cent this year. At the interim stage, Welsh profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds 78m (Pounds 72.7m) Net interest income fell from Pounds 33.2m to Pounds 18.2m due to increased capital investment of Pounds 189m. Earnings per share rose to 88.4p (82.2p). The proposed final dividend of 14.27p (13p) raises the total for the year to 21.4p (19.5p). The company's non-regulated businesses, which were developed aggressively following privatisation, performed poorly. There was a Pounds 600,000 trading loss from an environmental services associate, and a Pounds 300,000 loss on its disposal. Hamdden, its hotel and leisure group, had a 'disappointing' year. Dividend income of Pounds 3.5m was earned from the 15 per cent stake in South Wales Electricity. The electricity company regards the stake as unwelcome and is refusing to discuss possible joint ventures. COMMENT Will Welsh's price cap be enough to pre-empt the regulator, or is it simply further proof of how generously the company's K allowance was set? Certainly the regulator may decide that if Welsh can forego 1.5 per cent price rises voluntarily, it can do without at least that much again without causing any damage. Equally worrying was Welsh's insistence that its diversification policy has been 'cautious' when most in the City would describe it as anything but. If Welsh is merely paying lip-service to the regulator, so be it. But if the company has really changed its mind about the non-core business, some of the premium accorded in expectation of higher, non-core growth must now be reviewed. Forecast profits for this year of Pounds 144m put the shares on 4.9 times, with a yield of 6.5. But until such questions are answered, and the re-jigged management is up and running, Welsh may continue to see selling pressure.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Arts: Hamlet - Oxford Playhouse Theatr Clwyd's colourful, energetic and uneven Hamlet is the company's first British touring production of this scale and scope (Glasgow, Blackpool, Oxford, Chichester, Brighton), and one of its five shows now on tour. It is worth seeing for Geraint Wyn Davies' Hamlet, but the rest of Toby Robertson's production drains one's patience. The plain set, bronze panels bearing latin inscriptions and funeral/marriage flowers, opens onto a glass that holds the mirror up to nature; for the most part, the action is uncluttered. However, the costumes are a visual distraction. They turn the Danish court into an apres-ski theme party, all lycra, leather and velvet in ocres and reds. The contrast with Hamlet's black 'suits of woe' is the evening's best visual thrill. White masks are painted on the faces of the courtiers, signifying complicity (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive barefaced, and end up white); when Hamlet feigns madness, he opts for white stripes. The acting is patchy. The tense opening scene so much praised by Coleridge is dissipated by over-emphasis: intensity is not conveyed only by panic. The Ghost (Robert Arnold) has strayed in from a Las Vegas revue trailing plumes, shimmer and smoke; only when he speaks does the seriousness emerge. The same actor plays Polonius as by turns silly and wise, flapping like a winged plover. Horatio (Howard Antony) is dependable but ponderous, well short of even having a philosophy, let alone one with dreams. The King (David Keller) is a horror of jollity, both spiteful and vicious. Martin Mckellan, successfully cast as Gertrude, maintains a chilly distance from Hamlet, and adds a new strangeness to the play; but Ophelia (Sonia Forbes Adam) seems slight. Perhaps an all-male casting policy would have been more rigorous. The Cheek By Jowl Company's As You Like It recently showed how good an all-male Shakespeare could be, if a director takes that option. The production's shortcomings are redeemed by Geraint Wyn Davies' Hamlet. He plays him as a sane, intelligent, depressive overwhelmed by events and facing difficulties as if for the first time: 'Oh what a rogue and peasant slave am I' treads an exact line between the depressive's self-distraction and the need to get things done. 'To be, or not to be' (spoken as Davies bounds on stage) comes as a revelation, the discovery of a way out; and 'Get thee to a nunnery' finds a cool, level hate for Ophelia. Elsewhere, Davies is exact, losing the power of action in the energy of resolve. This Hamlet, at just over three hours, has been cut for action; but the point of Shakespeare's play (his longest) is in its digressions. Robertson's cuts, particularly in Horatio's lines, make the play less lyrical, eschewing the compensations of reflection: out go Horatio's haunting lines abut the dawn together with his final catalogue of accidental murders and casual slaughters; the tragedy earns these insights, and a traditional performance like this one is incomplete without them. The ending lacks an ending. (Oxford until January 25, then Chichester Festival Theatre, January 27 - February 1; Brighton Theatre Royal, February 3 - 8.)</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Switched on to suicide - Radio SOCIAL PROBLEMS liable to affect the young people who listen to Radio 1 (sex, drugs and so on) are sometimes treated there with the same understanding as they pay to more everyday concerns. On Wednesday of this week, Mark Goodier presented the first of four sessions on the current problem: suicide. This is now the third commonest cause of death among our under-25s, and for every death there are 20 attempts. Two examples were examined, a boy and a girl, neither of whom had given any warning. Wisely, we heard not psychiatrists' but family voices, the kind of voice that would be easily accessible to the sufferer. The programme centred on the need to discuss distress with others - if not a friend or relation, then the Samaritans. The Samaritans' number was given constantly during the programme, 0345-909090. It is always available. Older listeners should have heard New Men into Wild Men (Radio 4, Thursday). Nigel Farrell bravely joined a weekend test of the principles laid down by Robert Bly for the American Men's Movement. They seek to restore the masculinity men lose by subjection to parents, fathers especially. Physical exercise is evidently not the answer, but day-long drumming and dancing, blowing out, hard, 'to expel the angry child', and, most of all, listening to stories. Stories about the faults of fathers, mostly, but also made-up stories, like the long saga of the pig-herder and the princess. Well, there were 110 men with Farrell, and each paid Pounds 300, so watch out for the new masculine men. Rachel Yorke (feminine) was producer. Sydney Smith, the subject of Radio 4's four-part Wednesday feature by Roderick Graham, Trumpets and Foie Gras, was called 'one of the best of men', not for drumming but mainly for his wit. He rates a page and a half in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, and he made sure that his wit reached the right people, inviting them if necessary to such items as his lectures on Moral Philosophy ('the most successful swindle of the season,' as he put it). Wit is an ideal latchkey into a radio feature; but there was more to Smith than fun. In the first programme alone, he has been to Winchester and Oxford (hating both), been a tutor, a curate or better in three counties (as compelled by the Clerical Residency Act), married, worked on the Edinburgh Review, begun campaigns against the game laws and for Catholic emancipation. Never a statesman, not even a bishop, Smith was listened to and admired, as he still is, in Robert Lang's convincing performance. Jane Morgan directs these enjoyable programmes. Of Hamlet I have already written. Perry Pontac's absurd Hamlet Part II (Radio 3, Monday) had nothing in common with it but iambic pentameters and all those names. Seltazar, a Danish ambassador, returns after absence abroad to find everyone he (and we) knew is dead. He marries Claudius's bastard daughter and resolves to seize the throne. Enter the Ghost, still alive and keen to resume his reign. So Seltazar re-murders him; but the Ghost, having foreseen this, has poisoned him. If they really needed a Part II, why not Alethea Hayter's Horatio's Version (Faber, 1972), very funny, and actually based on Hamlet? A Different Woman (Radio 4, Tuesday) was by Perry Pontac in a slightly better vein. Ageing plastic surgeon Dr Bratcher (Peter Jeffrey) marries his ugly, stupid servant Melda (Alison Steadman), intending to turn her surgically into a beauty and so earn himself a reputation. Successfully beautified, however, she naturally elopes with the first more attractive chap to ask her. Not a bad joke, though only extended to 30 minutes by Pontac's way of making lists of everything. Richard Wortley directed both of these.</p>

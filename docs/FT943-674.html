			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Observer: French leave Fun and games at the International Organisation of Consumers Unions' 14th world congress, currently beavering away at Montpellier, France, under the title 'Consumers in the global market'. Edmond Alphandery, French economy minister, graced the meeting with his presence, giving the opening address at a gathering of 250 consumer organisations from 80 countries. The gist of his speech was that successful cross-border trade depends on two factors: information and the resolution of disputes. 'To reconcile global free trade with consumer rights, public authorities must push for better consumer information,' he said. Right on. Trouble is, Alphandery then announced a press conference - for French journalists only. The scribes from everywhere else complained - didn't that rather contradict his speech? Maybe, but tough luck. Alphandery's staff told them: 'None of you are allowed in.' The French hacks all meekly trooped off, while their international colleagues fumed. Ah, the sweet smell of international co-operation.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): French invasion repulsed - Speculation about agency takeovers is over The world of French advertising is nothing if not melodramatic. There are the writs that fly from agency to agency. There is a rumpus over the publication of Le Grand Bluff, a book accusing France's leading ad agencies of everything from bribing politicians to fiddling their finances. This spring the drama has centred on Carat, France's biggest media buying business, and on the advertisements it has been running in Le Figaro and Les Echos attacking the rest of the Paris advertising establishment. Carat's competitors try to dismiss the campaign as a defensive gesture from a company under pressure. Yet it comes at a sensitive time when the French advertising industry is trying to come to terms not only with a slowdown in growth but also with the financial problems of some of France's most powerful agencies. 'We are facing a slowdown in the rate of growth, rather than an actual fall in expenditure,' says Maurice Levy, chairman of Publicis, the biggest single French agency. 'But the market is undoubtedly getting tougher.' The instability of the Dollars 7.87bn (Pounds 4.6bn) French advertising market clearly poses problems for the large Paris agencies, but it also has implications for the rest of the international advertising industry. First, France, as the world's fifth largest advertising market, is a significant source of revenue for the multinational advertising networks based in New York and London. Second, the slowdown in their domestic market may inhibit the international ambitions of the Paris agencies which have recently emerged as aggressive players in the global advertising arena. The main reason for the slowdown in French advertising is, unsurprisingly, the corresponding slowdown in France's economy - now thought to be on the brink of recession - and the uncertainty on the political scene. The French agencies' problems have been aggravated by the instability of the international advertising industry. Earlier this year the Gulf war cast a cloud over advertising worldwide. France was not affected to the same extent as some markets, notably the US, but the conflict did put pressure on certain sectors such as travel and tourism. Moreover, the US recession has prompted some US-based multinationals - responsible for roughly 30 per cent of all French ad expenditure - to cut their budgets in France, and in other European markets, in an attempt to counter their financial problems in the US. 'It is too soon to say what the outcome for 1991 will be,' says Pierre de Plas, chairman of TBWA. 'At first everyone expected growth of 6 per cent, but the eventual level of growth will certainly be lower than that.' The market has also been destabilised by the developments within the ad industry itself. First, the wave of media deregulation in France, such as the television privatisation programme, which was an important catalyst for the industry's growth in the 1980s, has ground to a halt. Second, the media buying market is becoming increasingly competitive. One of the main developments in French advertising during the 1980s was the growth of Carat, which expanded rapidly to become the biggest single force in media buying with roughly 20 per cent of the market. Carat's growth has imposed intense pressure on the French agencies. In the past year the agencies have battled back by banding together into buying groups - such as The Media Partnership which includes J Walter Thompson, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, BBDO and DDB:Needham - to become more competitive with Carat. The consensus in the industry is that the formation of these groups is already squeezing media buying margins. Even Charles Hochman, chairman of Carat, accepts there is 'a definite trend' for margins to shrink. Third, some leading French agencies are in an unstable state after two years of active international expansion. Eurocom, the largest French marketing group, has suffered a series of senior management departures. It is also still in the throes of reorganising its interests after taking control of the old WCRS advertising agencies and more recently buying out the European arm of the HDM network. At the same time Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit and Roux Seguela Cayzac Goudard have been left with heavy debts after their international activities. BDDP completed a series of deals culminating in last year's investment in Wells Riche Greene of the US. RSCG acquired two UK companies: Conran in design and KLP in sales promotion. Despite a growing reluctance by banks to lend to agencies at a time of recession, Publicis is still pressing ahead with its expansion. Earlier this week it announced the acquisition of Overad, one of the larger Dutch agencies. Next month it is expected to finalise plans for a second pan-European advertising network. However, Maurice Levy is swift to quash rumours that Publicis is planning a full-scale bid for Foote Cone &amp; Belding, its US partner. The other French agencies are expected to adopt a more moderate approach, although Eurocom is mooted as a potential purchaser for Scali McCabe Sloves in the US. The days when other international agencies speculated feverishly about the threat of a 'French invasion' are over. Even Jean-Claud Boulet, chairman of BDDP, generally seen as the most ambitious of all the Paris agencies, now talks in cautious terms. 'The next few years will be a time of consolidation,' he said. 'It is time to build on the businesses we already own.'</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK electricity The run-up in electricity shares this week suggests the market appreciates the likely outcome to the British Coal conundrum. Assuming the government can bribe the generators into taking subsidised coal, perhaps 12 pits will be saved. If Tory back-benchers can then be persuaded to accept such a plan, National Power and PowerGen will be free to sign five-year contracts with the regional electricity companies. There will be some cost to the generators as coal stocks are run down more slowly than planned. But that is a small price for a deal which guarantees earnings and dividend growth up to 1998. The danger is that a change in the regulatory status quo could upset the apple cart. By opting not to delay the planned liberalisation of the electricity market, the government appears eager to avoid conflict with Mr Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator. With a 40 per cent stake in the generators and hopes of privatising British Coal, it has good reason to be cautious. Equally, Mr Littlechild has already indicated that he will not stop the Recs from signing five-year contracts with the generators, but he could yet decide prices offered by the generators are unfair. The generators' shares have risen more than 12 per cent this year and yield no more than the market average. Having recently been mauled by the Commons Select Committee for being too soft, Mr Littlechild may be in the mood to get tough. If so, that share price rating will be hard to justify.</p>

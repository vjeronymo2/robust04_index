			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Smith backs bid to restart Irish talks MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, said in Dublin yesterday he fully supported efforts by the UK and Irish governments to restart round-table talks on Northern Ireland. He said the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement and reunification of Ireland by consent remained the central pillars of his party's policy on the province. Mr Smith is on a two-day visit to the republic, accompanied by Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour spokesman on Northern Ireland. Mr Smith said that any renewed political talks in the north 'should be on the basis of the three strands of the previous talks, and on the principle that nothing should be agreed until all is agreed'. He rejected a suggestion made in the Commons this week by Sir Edward Heath, a former Conservative prime minister, that the talks should be held without the participation of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), led by the Rev Ian Paisley. He is now viewed as the main obstacle to the talks' resumption because of his insistence that the republic must drop its territorial claim to the province. Mr Smith said: 'The DUP won 17 per cent of the vote in the recent local elections and that has to be accepted as a reality.' He said Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, could also be accepted into the talks process, 'but they must first renounce violence'. Labour 'would not want to have any talks with Sinn Fein'. But Mr Smith respected the recent moves by Mr John Hume, the leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland, to hold a series of discussions with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to find a way of bringing an end to the IRA violence. Mr Smith said this 'took a great deal of personal courage and bravery'.</p>

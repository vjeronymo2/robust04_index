The  document regulates issues concerning the committee's structure,  operation and relations with other departments. The committee  will help ministries and departments publicize opportunities to  move and requirements for priority environmental protection  projects.    The ministers approved draft agreements on trade and  economic  cooperation between Bulgaria and Armenia, Azerbaijan and  Uzbekistan as a basis for negotiations. They also approved a  draft agreement on reciprocal investment protection and  promotion between Bulgaria and Poland. At the suggestion of the  Minister of Industry Rumen Bikov the cabinet gave consent to  admit Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus as full members of the  International Centre for Scientific and Technical Information in  Moscow.    The government decided to propose to President Zhelyu Zhelev  to appoint Bulgaria's ambassador to Spain Mikhail Petkov also  ambassador to Andorra. The Council of Ministers gave permission  to the Embassy of Tunisia to open a polling station here during  the presidential and parliamentary elections in that country due  to be held on March 20, 1994.    The cabinet returned a proposal to open new border  checkpoints, one on the River Danube, and two on the Black Sea,  for a reconsideration of its expediency and of ways to fund them.    After the meeting the Cabinet held a lengthy closed-door  discussion, said national radio tonight, quoting Acting Prime  Minister Evgeni Matinchev. [passage omitted]    In a televised interview tonight Deputy Prime Ministers  Evgeni Matinchev and Valentin Karabashev dwelled on the problems  of privatization and expressed their dissatisfaction with its  progress.    The privatization of major units such as hotels and banks is  bound to provoke heated disputes in Bulgaria, Mr. Karabashev  said. The Government should support those interests which are in  defence of the national economy.    In response to a question, Mr. Matinchev denied having  pursued at government level the interests of certain circles in  the privatization of tourism, interested in the preservation of  the old structure of this economic branch. This year  privatization in tourism may yield revenues exceeding 2 billion  leva, Mr. Matinchev said.    According to Mr. Karabashev, the government is to take  measures for speeding up the process of privatization.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 9 (CTK) -- The opposition Communist  Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) and the Left Bloc (LB) party  are opposed to the further restitution of church property, while  the Bohemian-Moravian Center Party (CMSS) holds the opposite  position. The Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) disagrees  with the restitution of church property by an executive act,  that is, by the resolution adopted by the government.    The KSCM strongly disagrees with the return of any capital  assets to the Catholic Church, all the more so in an executive  form, KSCM spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova told CTK today.    The KSCM considers such proposals a mockery of democratic  principles, and demands that a real and legal full stop is  immediately made to end restitutions which would at the same  time put an end to endless property claims from the Church, she  said.    The Communists believe that a further considerable  concession  to the Catholic Church will likely be made by the Civic  Democratic Party (ODS), the strongest party in the government  coalition, which would make possible a return of property which  was put into national management after the war on the basis of  the decrees directed against collaborators. "It is  characteristic that the current government is more interested in  claims from collaborators and their heirs than in compensating  Nazi victims," Zezulkova said.    The LB party rejects further property restitutions because  they would wind further a "spiral of changes in ownership  relations," Jaroslav Ortman, chairman of the LB deputies' group,  told CTK. "Besides, nobody has ever specified the scale of  property to be returned and which present owners the  restitutions would concern," he said. Ortman said that the  restitution of church property through a government decision  would be by-passing the parliament.    CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman said that his party was basically  opposed to the restitution of church property through an  executive act as it would means the transfer of the  responsibility from the parliament to the government and would  thus weaken parliamentary democracy.    CMSS Chairman Jan Krycer said that his party, on the  contrary, considered the restitution of church property to be an  undisputable moral obligation of the state towards the Church.  He pointed out that the CMSS had already proposed that the  Finance Ministry assess property to be returned. The government  should issue bonds at the overall property value and hand them  over to the Church with five percent annual interest. It should  guarantee that the nominal value of the bonds will be paid by  the state after fifteen years, he said.    According to the resolution adopted at a meeting of the ODS  Executive Council last weekend in Teplice nad Becvou, north  Moravia, the government should adopt a decision providing for  the return to churches of certain property which serves their  mission and goals.    ODS Chairman and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists  after the meeting that after this the parliament should say that  it will pass no more laws redressing the injustices committed  under the communist regime. The law to wind up restitution and  rehabilitations would de facto rescind all articles of the  existing restitution and rehabilitation laws blocking  privatization, Klaus said.</p>

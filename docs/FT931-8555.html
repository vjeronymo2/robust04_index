			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fragile Opec deal leaves credibility gap - Sticking to quotas will be even harder than agreeing them ALTHOUGH IT proved harder for the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reach its agreement on second quarter output than most member countries had expected, the hardest part is still to come: sticking to it. By the time ministers gathered in Vienna last Saturday, the oil market had already discounted the main elements of the deal reached late on Tuesday. Strong signals from Saudi Arabia and Iran during a pre-meeting tour by Mr Alirio Parra, the Opec president, that they wanted to remove at least 1m b/d from the cartel's first quarter ceiling of 24.58m b/d had added more than Dollars 1.5 to the price of a barrel. Opec will largely succeed in its aim of shoring up prices, therefore, if it can hold that premium. But this will rely entirely upon member countries holding hard to their respective allocations and actually delivering a ceiling of 23.58m b/d from March 1 - thus taking 1.4m b/d off the market, given Opec's leakage earlier in the year. Saudi Arabia, the architect of the deal, and Iran both said in Vienna that they would immediately begin notifying customers of their allocated cuts under the agreement - statements the cartel's two biggest producers hoped might add some credibility to the Vienna deal. The kingdom has said it will cut by 400,000 b/d to 8m b/d, while Iran is to trim to 3.34m b/d from 3.49m b/d. Industry analysts attending the meeting were unanimous that the agreement would offer real support to prices only once it became clear in mid-March if Opec members were keeping their word. Several suggested that even with some leakage, perhaps to a real output figure of 23.7m b/d or even 23.8m b/d, prices might still find support. European traders did not seem impressed yesterday, however, and nearby prices for Brent crude slipped back below Dollars 18 a barrel. The agreement's fragility was signalled clearly by Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Kuwait oil minister. After having bowed with enormous reluctance and only after four days of stern pressure from Saudi Arabia and Iran to cut Kuwaiti production to 1.6m b/d for the second quarter, he said: 'I'm going to watch this market; and any additional barrel or two and I am at liberty'. If there was any cheating elsewhere, he said, Kuwait would immediately pump to what it claims will be a 2.1m b/d capacity in the second quarter. The tough wrangling that finally brought Kuwait back within a regime of Opec allocations for the first time since the Gulf war revealed a more serious flaw in the latest agreement, however. Kuwait agreed to its cut only on condition that at the next Opec meeting in June it will be accorded a third quarter ceiling 'in parity with the production allocation to other countries with similar production capacity, historical market share and quota'. It took eight hours of negotiation for Opec members to agree this wording on Tuesday and thus enable a deal-finalising communique. But it became apparent soon after the communique's release that there was no real agreement on what it meant. Mr al-Baghli said immediately after the meeting that this represented an 'explicit agreement' that Kuwait would be awarded parity with the United Arab Emirates when allocations for the third quarter are decided at Opec's next meeting in June. Kuwait and the UAE were both awarded quotas of 1.5m b/d under Opec's last formal quota system, agreed in July 1990, just before the Gulf war. Before the war both countries had roughly similar production capacity of around 2.5m b/d. Under the present deal the UAE will pump 2.1m b/d. Kuwait was determined above all at the latest meeting that it should re-establish its claim to its pre-Gulf war share of Opec output, even though its oil industry had not yet physically reached the point where it could sustain pre-war capacity. Mr al-Baghli said on Tuesday that he considered that battle won. Minutes after Mr al-Baghli spoke, however, his Iranian counterpart, Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh said that the communique gave absolutely no guarantee that Kuwait would be given any sort of parity when ministers met again in June, with the UAE or anyone else. 'Maybe that's Kuwait's perception,' he said curtly. Iran opposed any mention of parity or any overt reference to Kuwait's special post-war circumstances largely because it already had its eyes on Iraq's eventual return to the oil market. Before the Gulf war, and under a hard-bargained Opec compromise between the two big Gulf neighbours reached during the Iran-Iraq war, both countries were awarded exact parity at a quota of 3.14m b/d. Above all things, Iran now wants there to be no precedent set that might tie them back into parity with Iraq. Iran says it has already spent Dollars 3.5bn on raising output capacity towards a target of 4.5m b/d by March and hopes to go on to achieve an eventual sustainable capacity of 6m b/d. Whenever Iraq returns to the market, once the UN agrees that it has met all the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire and sanctions are lifted, it will do so with considerably lower output capacity than Iran - even given that most industry estimates say Tehran's claims for present capacity are inflated. Iraq is certain to latch firmly on to any precedent Opec has set for Kuwait during its post-war reconstruction and Iran fears this means it will seek to achieve agreement that it should once again be tied into an equivalent quota to its neighbour. Indeed, Iraq said firmly after the latest deal that it regarded the July 1990 quota system, with its entrenched parity between Iran and Iraq, as the sole benchmark for Opec allocations. However successful Opec is, therefore, in achieving its target for the second quarter, its members have already drawn the battle lines for a far tougher fight in June over market share. Iraq's return to the market is still somewhat distant - indeed Saudi Arabia is confident that the country will never re-enter the market fully while Saddam Hussein remains in power. But the arguments to accommodate Iraq have begun and are likely to detain Opec delegates for much longer than four days when they next meet in June.</p>

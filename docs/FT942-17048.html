			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Railtrack meets council today over threat to fees Talks will be held today between Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority, which operates the largest suburban rail network outside London, and Railtrack in an attempt to resolve a threat to the financing of suburban railways. Strathclyde announced on Tuesday that it would be withholding its Pounds 33m subsidy for this year to ScotRail, which operates the railway network around Glasgow, until it had more information on the increase in fees it must pay for the use of track. The authority calculates that the increase in track access fees announced by Railtrack in February will increase the subsidy needed from Pounds 33m to Pounds 95m. Strathclyde wants more details of how this sum is arrived at, said Mr Charles Gordon, vice-chairman of Strathclyde Regional Council's transport committee. Strathclyde is concerned that it would be unable to justify the payment to its auditors until it has a breakdown of the numbers involved. Railtrack said it would be happy to provide Strathclyde with the details at today's meeting. Seven passenger transport authorities in Britain met Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, last week, and appeared to accept a government assurance that higher track access charges would be matched by a higher subsidy, the Department of Transport said.</p>

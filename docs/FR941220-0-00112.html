For purposes of this section, ``workday'' shall mean any day on which one or more H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants perform any work at any worksite(s) within the area of employment. For example, one ``workday'' would be counted for a day on which seven H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants worked at three worksites within one city, and one ``workday'' would be counted for a day on which one H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant worked at one worksite within a city. The employer may rotate such workers into worksites within such area of employment or may maintain a constant work force. However, on the first day after the accumulation of 90 workdays, the employer shall not have any such H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at any worksite(s) within such area of employment not included on a certified LCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) At the accumulation of the 90 workdays described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the employer shall have ended its placement of all H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at any worksite(s) within the area of employment not listed on the labor condition application,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> shall have filed and received a certified labor condition application for the area(s) of intended employment encompassing such worksite(s) and performed all actions required in connection with such filing(s) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> determination of the prevailing wage; notice to collective bargaining representative or on-site notice to workers). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) At any time during the 90-day period described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the employer may file a labor condition application for the area of intended employment encompassing such worksite(s), performing all actions required in connection with such labor condition application. Upon certification of such LCA, the employer's obligation to pay Federal per diem rates to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) shall terminate.

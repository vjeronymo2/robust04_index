			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the sinful attempt on the life of brother  struggler Dr. Hasan Muhammad Makki, first deputy prime minister,  in which he was severely wounded and his chauffeur, Ahmad Saghir  Abu-Bakr, and his companions First Lieutenant Salih 'Abdallah  Ghayban and Lt. Ahmad Muhammad al-Ahdam were martyred, after  having put up an heroic resistance and having hit a number of  the assailants, the Interior Ministry officials chased the  attackers, who fled to the home of Shaykh Naji 'Abd-al-'Aziz  al-Shayif, who, in turn, handed over five persons to the  ministry as the perpetrators. However, upon questioning these  five, it emerged that the real assailants were still at Shaykh  al-Shayif's, who, it turned out was harboring them.    Accordingly, the Interior Ministry issued an arrest warrant  for Shaykh al-Shayif as the suspected instigator of the crime  and for harboring its perpetrators. Other arrest warrants were  issued against the perpetrators.    Eight suspects are now in custody. The investigation  revealed that the shaykh is also harboring other suspects.  Instead of heeding the orders issued by the Interior Ministry  and turning himself in as mandated by law, he barricaded himself  in his home, along with a large number of his friends. At dawn  on Monday, he managed to sneak out of the capital, along with a  number of the suspects.    The Interior Ministry condemns this reckless behavior, and  holds Shaykh al-Shayif responsible for incitement to commit this  hideous crime and for harboring its perpetrators. They have to  present themselves to the law enforcement authorities so justice  can take its course. The ministry will take all the security  and legal measures required to bring the accused to justice.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Euro Disney stars as Paris clears 2,000 level Late-closing markets had the best of the day's trading, writes Our Markets Staff. Frankfurt was closed. PARIS rose above 2,000, a semblance of confidence returning after a brief sojourn below the support level on Wednesday. The CAC-40 index finished 27.70, or 1.4 per cent, up at 2,007.38, with help coming from the futures exchange and a 10 basis-point cut, albeit expected, in the Bank of France's intervention rate at midsession. Euro Disney was once again on investors' minds follow-ing the news that Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, was to buy between 13 and 24 per cent of the troubled theme park, and invest a further Dollars 100m in the construction of a conference centre. Coming just a few days before Euro Disney's extraordinary general meeting, at which it was due to announce the terms of its FFr6bn rights issue, the news was welcomed with a rise in the shares of FFr1.85, or 6 per cent, to FFr32.00. As James Capel noted, the shareholding of Walt Disney, the US parent, could fall as low as 36 per cent if the rights issue is heavily subscribed by existing shareholders. In that eventuality, Walt Disney has said that it would be prepared to sell part of its own stake, up to a maximum of FFr1bn. Mr Nigel Reed of Paribas Capital Markets commented that the impact of this news would be felt following the rights issue since it was now less likely that there would be an overhang of shares. Schneider suffered a difficult day, with the shares losing FFr21.60 to FFr368.90 following their suspension on Wednesday as investors reacted to news that the group's chairman had been kept in custody in Belgium pending further investigations over allegations of fraud, and that French police had searched the group's Paris headquarters. AMSTERDAM was encouraged by better than expected results from both KLM and ING, the financial services group. As a result the AEX index, which had suffered a fright on Wednesday, recovered most of the lost ground, closing 2.24 higher at 399.76. Hoare Govett said it expected the market's consolidation to continue in the short term, particularly as cyclical stocks had outperformed the average by between 20 to 50 per cent in the year to date. 'This period of consolidation will allow relative gains in defensive stocks, such as food and beverages, publishers and (when the bond market recovers) financials,' they added. The financial sector came into play as ING's first-quarter results exceeded analysts' expectations and moved the shares 80 cents higher to Fl 76.10. The group noted that it had lost some Fl 99m from trade in emerging market debt and foreign exchange arbitrage, compared to a profit of Fl 261m the previous year. KLM was down by the end of trading, off 50 cents at Fl 51.40 after a day's high of Fl 52.70, with traders noting profit-taking following gains in recent days. The airline, which turned a loss in the same year-ago period of Fl 562m into a profit of Fl 103m, said that in spite of the results it would be proposing to omit the dividend when shareholders meet in August. ZURICH showed some resilience, but it closed too early to enjoy the final kick which was seen in later closing bourses. The SMI index eased 5.6 to 2,725.9. Volume was thin, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer of Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich, reckoning on between SFr600m and SFr700m against Wednesday's SFr1.05bn. Weakness in cyclicals continued and an early rise in Roche, a major index component, turned to weakness in the afternoon as the certificates closed SFr10 lower at SFr6,790. Among the cyclicals, BBC Brown Boveri lost another SFr20 to SFr1,215 and Holderbank SFr16 at SFr929. At Sulzer, down SFr10 at SFr905 and SFr74 lower over the past five trading days, a heart valve scandal in Germany has been a drain on sentiment. However, said Mr Hasslauer, Sulzer's US subsidiary, which makes the valves, has only had a presence in the German market since January of this year. MADRID's general index ended higher after a see-saw day, up 2.78 at 324.16 after a low of 319.57. Santander lost out on the technical and bond market considerations which took most blue chips higher, falling another Pta155, or 3.2 per cent to Pta4,730. HELSINKI closed higher following four-month figures from Nokia, the electronics and industrial conglomerate which was a major outperformer in the share price charts, both in 1993 and early in 1994. Nokia reported a 136 per cent jump in operating profits, and its share price rise of FM11 to FM419 was almost entirely responsible for taking the Hex index out of the doldrums early in the day to close 8.25 higher at 1,779.6, in turnover of FM147m. TEL AVIV fell to an 18-month low, the Mishtanim index losing 6.51, or 3.6 per cent to 176.21 as turnover rose from Shk219m to Shk273m. On Wednesday Mr Sam Bronfeld, director general of the Tel Aviv stock exchange, dismissed hopes of a Middle East 'peace dividend', describing as an 'illusion' the Israeli government theory that the peace deal with the PLO will bring about investment and increased growth.

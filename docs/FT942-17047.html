			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Concession offered on school tests External marking for national curriculum tests in England and Wales could be introduced next year, Baroness Blatch, the education minister, announced yesterday. Her announcement was greeted with applause from the annual conference in Blackpool of the NASUWT teaching union, which last year took the lead in enforcing a boycott of the tests supposed to be taken by all seven-year-olds and 14-year-olds. It was the most cordial reception the union has given a Tory education minister for more than a decade and signalled a big shift in its position since cuts to the tests were announced in January by Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief curriculum adviser. It also deepened the split between NASUWT and the National Union of Teachers, which will continue its boycott of all tests. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, called on Lady Blatch to have the tests marked externally this year. He dismissed as 'codswallop' claims by NUT leaders that external marking would reduce teachers to 'technician' status and undermine their professionalism. Lady Blatch said she would consult next term on possible changes for the 1995 tests and also gave support for Wandsworth Borough Council's decision to use supply teachers as external markers. She said: 'It is open to schools to draw on supply cover as you yourselves have suggested, and where schools do make such arrangements that is to be welcomed.' But Mr de Gruchy said: 'Surely if you think tests are so important for standards, it is not beyond the wit of this government to organise external markers and make sure that the tests take place this summer.' Without external markers, the NUT boycott will probably prevent tests in several thousand schools. However, there were warning notes for ministers from the third teachers' union, the traditionally moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which yesterday opened its conference in Bournemouth. The ATL last night took a card vote on a motion condemning its executive for not holding a second ballot on the boycott. The result is expected this morning. Mr Peter Smith, ALT general secretary, said the government was 'on probation' this year. If Sir Ron's exercise proved 'cosmetic or expedient', he could not rule out a boycott next year.</p>

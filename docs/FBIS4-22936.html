S. Gurin, V. P. Poroshkov, K. N. Kasparov, </F> Ye. A. Tyavlovskaya, and N. I. Kuntsevich, Physico-Chemical  Problems SRI; Belorussian State University, Minsk;  UDC541.138:543.022]    [Abstract] The known possibility of selective chemical and  electrochemical deposition of metals on surface films of  titanium dioxide from aqueous solutions containing the  corresponding metals is governed by the fact that the deposition  process rate, both chemical and electrochemical, increases  markedly on those portions of the surface modified with metallic  particles (Ag, Pd, Ni, and others). At 10[.sup]14[/] -  10[.sup]16[/] atoms per cm[.sup]2[/] silver content, it  becomes possible to realize selective electrochemical deposition  of a metal phase onto modified portions of the film. In this  case, the rate of electrochemical deposition on them is 10 or  more times greater than that on film portions not containing  silver. The properties of microheterogeneous systems of the  oxide-metal particle type, in which the oxide acts as a carrier,  largely depend on the specifics of particle-carrier interaction.  An important role is also played by the oxygen adsorbed from the  atmosphere on the surface of a semiconductor and on the metal  particles. In the case of the system TiO[.sub]2[/]-Ag  particles, the selectivity of the electrochemical deposition  process, as manifested in changes in the process kinetics and a  drop in overvoltage in comparison with deposition on  TiO[.sub]2[/] films not containing silver, may be due to  special features in the interaction between the silver particles  and the TiO[.sub]2[/] film. Previous research concerned  mainly the electro- and photoelectro-chemical characteristics of  the system, and the status of silver on the TiO[.sub]2[/]  surface remained unclear. In the present work these properties  of silver particles in a Ag-TiO[.sub]2[/] system were studied  employing electochemical methods, electron microscopy, and X-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy. At 10[.sup]14[/]-10[.sup]16[/]  atoms per cm[.sup]2[/] silver concentration on the surface,  the presence of 5-100 nm sized silver particles was confirmed,  and a marked a marked interaction between the silver and the  TiO[.sub]2[/] surface was observed.

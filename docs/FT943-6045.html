			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Building boost for Japanese economy Evidence of a modest recovery in Japanese domestic demand emerged yesterday in the form of an optimistic official forecast for industrial output and good construction industry figures. Industrial output, representing just under a third of the economy, fell by 1.7 per cent from June to July, but manufacturing probably perked up again by 1.6 per cent in August, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. Overall production in the year to July was all but stagnant, with a 0.6 per cent decline. Production has wavered all this year (it rose by 2.7 per cent in June) as the economy has bumped along in the early stage of a weak recovery. But Miti believes the latest result confirms a general trend for output to strengthen. That view was supported yesterday by a 17.8 per cent rise in orders received by Japan's top 50 construction groups in the year to July, the first such jump in 18 months. An encouraging feature was a 24.1 per cent rise in private sector orders, two-thirds of the total, showing that the industry is becoming less dependent on public works, a one-off boost financed by previous governments' economic stimulation packages. Public sector orders grew 12.1 per cent over the same period. Separately, housing starts grew 5.8 per cent in the year to July, the fourth monthly rise running, and confirmation of a recovery in unit sales, though not prices, in the market for condominiums.</p>

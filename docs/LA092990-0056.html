			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KENNEDY ROLLS OVER CRENSHAW  </P> <P> Less than 25 minutes before the opening kickoff Friday, Kennedy High Coach Bob  Francola voiced his fears as he eyed the potholes and several crooked chalk  lines on the Crenshaw football field.  </P> <P> He feared that the Golden Cougars might commit crucial turnovers -- something  they had avoided in two previous games. He also disliked the sunlight, worrying  that the 3 p.m. start -- Kennedy's only day game of the season -- would dampen  his team's intensity.  </P> <P> But Francola's concerns proved groundless. The Golden Cougars continued to play  stingy defense and relied on the running of Ontiwaun Carter, who rushed for 181  yards and three touchdowns, to post a 34-0 nonleague victory over Crenshaw  (0-2). In three victories this season, Kennedy has outscored its opponents,  106-2.  </P> <P> Carter, a senior running back who rushed for 250 yards and scored six times in  the Golden Cougars' first two games, scored a touchdown in each of the first  three quarters on runs of 12, one and three yards, respectively.  </P> <P> Kennedy wasted no time taking control of the ball and the game.  </P> <P> Billy Sanders picked off a tipped pass from Crenshaw quarterback Daryl Loper  and returned it seven yards to Crenshaw's 23-yard line on the third play of the  game. Three plays later, Carter bolted 12 yards for a touchdown on the first of  his 30 carries.  </P> <P> Quarterback Mike McMullen, who played just three quarters, completed nine of 17  passes for 191 yards. Keith West caught six passes for 107 yards, including a  42-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Kennedy's defense was exceptional, forcing six turnovers -- four interceptions  and two fumble recoveries -- to give the defense 15 in three games. Kennedy  allowed only 67 yards, just two through the air.  </P> <P> Sanders, a strong safety, intercepted two passes, returned one 50 yards for a  touchdown and recovered a Crenshaw fumble on the Cougars' 10-yard line in the  third quarter to set up Kennedy's fourth touchdown.  </P> <P> Still, Francola remained unimpressed, pointing to Kennedy's two turnovers.  </P> <P> "I don't think we played well, I thought we were flat," he said. "And I don't  care how much we stressed this week that this was an important game, they're  thinking about Granada Hills. These kids have that on their mind."  </P> <P> Kennedy opens Northwest Valley Conference play next week against Granada Hills  (2-1), the Valley's top-rated City Section team.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Spaces that have been fumigated, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Spaces containing materials or residues that could create an oxygen-deficient atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule adopts the language from the NPRM to require competent persons to test atmospheres of these spaces for ``oxygen content'' rather than just ``oxygen deficiency.'' Paragraph (a)(2) of final &sect;1915.12 addresses the maximum permissible oxygen concentration within confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. Therefore, the testing to be performed must be for content rather than for oxygen deficiency alone. (The rationale for adopting a requirement for maximum permissible oxygen exposure is discussed under the summary and explanation of final &sect;1915.12(a)(2).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the previous rule &sect;1915.12(c)(1) required tests to be conducted ``[b]efore employees are initially permitted to enter'' any of the regulated spaces. Paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) contain this identical language for pre-entry testing for flammable gases and vapors and for toxic substances. The NPRM used the language ``prior to initial entry'' in proposed &sect;1915.12(a)(1) and the language ``prior to entry'' in proposed &sect;1915.12 (b)(1) and (c)(1). The preamble to the proposal noted that questions had arisen regarding what was intended by ``initial entry'' in the previous standard and that the Coast Guard had interpreted the OSHA standard to require retesting if more than 24 hours had elapsed since the previous testing. The NPRM raised the issues of whether ``initial entry'' should be defined in Subpart B and, if so, what that definition should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters believed that OSHA should not specify the maximum time permitted to elapse before additional testing is required (Ex. 6&hyph;3, 6&hyph;6, 6&hyph;8, 6&hyph;12, 6&hyph;18). They argued that the length of time between testing and entry could vary depending on the space and the possible hazards involved. For example, Mr. Charles K. Klein, representing Newport News Shipbuilding, stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA should not specify a time limit regarding re-certification of spaces after ``initial entry'' certification has been given. The Coast Guard's interpretation for re-certification is based on a 24-hour lapse period since a tank has been previously determined safe for entry. However, we feel that as long as conditions have not changed since the space was certified for ``initial entry'', additional certification is not required. Periods longer than 24 hours may be appropriate in cases where a confined space does not contain a hazardous substance, is not connected to a system which contains a hazardous substance and has not been closed except for an air or hydrostatic test. However, certain evolutions involving hazardous substances in or near confined spaces may require testing on a shift basis or more often. A time limit imposed on ``initial entry'' is unnecessarily restrictive and reduces the employer's flexibility in providing a safe and healthful work environment in an effective, cost-efficient manner. [Ex. 6&hyph;6]  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters maintained that the certificate issued by a Marine Chemist would control whether or not a space had to be retested beyond a certain period (Ex. 6&hyph;8, 6&hyph;18). They believed that retesting was unnecessary unless conditions changed or unless the Marine Chemist's certificate required it. Sound Testing, Inc., expressed this position as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be made clear that a Marine Chemist's certificate is voided not by the passage of time, but by the change of conditions. Therefore, if a competent person can ascertain that conditions have not drastically changed, the chemist's certificate remains in force, regardless of how long between competent person inspections. The corollary of this is that there should be no explicit time limit on the chemist's certificate unless the chemist himself sees a reason for such a limit. [Ex. 6&hyph;8] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other rulemaking participants argued that the regulation should clarify what constitutes initial entry or when additional testing is required before the first entry into the space (Ex. 6&hyph;4, 6&hyph;5, 6&hyph;10, 6&hyph;13, 6&hyph;21, 6&hyph;22, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;27, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;33, 6&hyph;34, 6&hyph;37, 6&hyph;38). Several of these commenters stated that the standard should specify the maximum interval permitted before additional testing would have to be performed (Ex. 6&hyph;4, 6&hyph;5, 6&hyph;10, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;27). The intervals suggested ranged from immediately before the entry (Ex. 6&hyph;24) to 24 hours (Ex. 6&hyph;27). For example, the U.S. Coast Guard stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been our experience that if a minimum is not set the retesting is not done or is done infrequently because of the competent person's other work obligations. Our policy does not prohibit the inspector from requiring additional testing if he feels the conditions warrant. We have required additional retesting because of rises in temperature, excess quantity of cargo residues, and lack of confidence in the competent person. [Ex. 6&hyph;4] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

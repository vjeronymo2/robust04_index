			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (14): Manchester's paradox encourages relocation - Ian Hamilton Fazey examines the regional capital's imbalance between supply and demand / The North-west A SURPRISING frisson of anxiety is rippling through north-west England's property community, particularly in Greater Manchester. Some specialists are beginning to talk about shortages - in spite of more than 1m square feet of overhanging, unlet new office space from the 1980s. This paradox arises because the market is not homogeneous. Pockets of increasing demand do not coincide with pockets of oversupply. Demand is rising in the city centre; the area around Manchester Airport continues to be attractive, because of the airport's growth; and Chester remains one of the most pleasant parts of England to live and work. All three pockets are short of good, new, high quality space. The region's most concentrated bulk of this, however, is in the old Manchester Ship Canal docklands at Salford Quays and Trafford Park, where two expiring enterprise zones encouraged a spate of rapid building in the late 1980s. About 1m sq ft of modern space can be had at relatively soft rents. Some of the mismatch between supply and demand is encouraging modest relocation within the region, with parts of Cheshire hoping to benefit, and some take-up at Salford Quays. But it seems unlikely to knock on much into Merseyside, which is still trying to put right its promotional problems and where demand is relatively poor and supply modest anyway. The effect is likely to be most obvious in the next 18 months on rents in Manchester's city centre. This prime area sets the region's rental standard  -a headline range between Pounds 20 and Pounds 23 a sq ft - with demand driven by the city's financial and professional services sector, which grew steadily throughout the 1980s, making Manchester Britain's foremost banking centre outside London. This is part of an ever more obvious regional trend echoed elsewhere in Europe. Self-standing regional financial centres are developing to service regional economies, as these local markets become too small to offer economies of scale to national centres. This intrinsic source of demand is now being augmented as a result of the north-west's suffering less than elsewhere in the recession and showing signs of recovering faster. The region's rate of economic growth more than doubled to 3.2 per cent a year in 1986-90 - about the national average - but shrunk by only 1.7 per cent in 1991. By contrast, UK gross domestic product declined by 2.4 per cent in 1991, with regions like the West Midlands (3.0 per cent), the East Midlands (1.8 per cent) and East Anglia (2.9 per cent) suffering much more than the north-west - their downturn being accentuated further by growth rates of 4 per cent or more in the 1980s. But while these last three regional economies continued to shrink last year, north-west England's stood still at zero growth. In other words, it turned earlier. The net impact of the north-west's suffering a shallower recession than the Midlands and south is a stirring of demand now. As Simon Reynolds, partner in charge of business space at the Manchester office of Grimley JR Eve, the chartered surveyors, puts it: 'Third-quarter inquiries were 23 per cent up on the second quarter and well ahead of last year. Our problem is we have no tower cranes. Top-quality property at the top end of the market is a rarity. We have decreasing supply and rising demand.' What top-quality space there is in Manchester city centre is filling and changing hands. Some had its end user lined up from the outset, as with the new Manchester headquarters of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountant. Trinity Court, developed by Barlows, the Chester property company, has already attracted Hammond Suddards, the Leeds law firm now expanding in Manchester, and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank. Although top-of-the-range headline rents are said to be holding, Mr Reynolds points out: 'True market rents are realistically around Pounds 14 or Pounds 15, because of the deals that are being done.' Deals might include several months of rental holidays - usually enough to pay for fitting out and furnishings - and the developer paying for a relocater's old leases for a limited period, or until they can be assigned. The hope is that markets will pick up in time to save both parties embarrassment when the period runs out. As the economy improves, most property professionals expect no growth in headline rents, but rather an improvement in effective rents as deals tighten up. However, what is happening now is adding to potentially difficult problem. Mr Reynolds says: 'The dark side of the market is second-hand space. The real millstone is 1.33m sq ft of it in Manchester. This will rise to 1.75m sq ft in about two years' time. The deals that are being done now to get big tenants to move are leaving behind a potential glut of second-hand space that will be increasingly difficult to shift. 'The hope is that the lack of new space will mean good second-hand space will start to go, but it takes four to five years to let buildings dating from the 1960s and 1970s. You have to thoroughly refurbish them to have any chance.' With no shortage of potential foreign investors, the hope is more tower cranes will start to appear soon as developers replace old offices, a process that usually takes a couple of years per building. In the meantime, The Quays - a couple of miles from Manchester city centre - offer the north-west's only concentration of good space. The three schemes there - the Anchorage, Harbour City and Exchange Quay - were developed respectively by Amec, Manchester Ship Canal Company, now absorbed into Peel Holdings, and the Charter Group, which went down in the recession. About 230,000 sq ft should be let by Christmas - 50,000 sq ft was let in the summer, 100,000 sq ft is in legal process and 80,000 sq ft went last year. This leaves about 945,000 sq ft to go, but at around Pounds 15 a sq ft with incentives thrown in as well, it offers good value, given its quality, waterside location and links to the motorway system and the airport. Mr Reynolds says the Quays needs one of its three schemes to be fully let and another about 60 per cent full for rents to start hardening. Meanwhile, confidence is rising among retailers. Peel last month cleared the final legal hurdle in the way of the Trafford Centre, a 300-acre regional shopping centre on the banks of the ship canal near the convergence of five motorways. About 7m people will be within an hour's drive. It should open in 1997.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Only a short wait now for the big cheque: Leonard Barden and David Spanier analyse the manoeuvres on and off the board at the world championships BOOKMAKERS have stopped quoting odds on Gary Kasparov's victory in the world chess championship, and an international guess-their-moves competition has been abandoned because of lack of interest. Kasparov leads Nigel Short 4-1 before today's sixth game at London's Savoy Theatre, and watching grandmasters are worried that the match will be finished far quicker than its scheduled 24 games spread over a leisurely eight weeks. Short has lacked confidence when the game reaches its crisis, usually in the fourth hour of play when the time limit approaches. In game one, he lost on time in a good position; in game three, he missed two easy draws; in game four, he caught Kasparov with a prepared opening but failed to create a decisive attack and lost. Only in Thursday's fifth game, where his homework put him an hour ahead on the clock and obliged the champion to concede an 18-move draw as White, was there a glimmer of hope. Kasparov is confident, even patronising at the post-game press conferences which Short never attends after a defeat. Kasparov claims that the Briton has big psychological problems and lacks the experience for a world championship. This is from a man aged 30 talking about a rival aged 28. The Times has put up a prize fund of Pounds 1.7m, the largest ever purse for British sport outside boxing. Costs of administration and a publicity campaign are estimated at between Pounds 1m and Pounds 5m. At first the newspaper expected to recoup much of its outlay through sales of tickets at between Pounds 45 and Pounds 150. A full house for every game in the 1,000-seat Savoy Theatre would have raised Pounds 2m. But two months before the match, sales figures were disastrous in spite of campaigns on LBC radio  -'It's war on 7 September' - and on London buses - 'Only room for one on top'. The minimum seat price was reduced to Pounds 20, and there were special Pounds 10 offers to readers of the News of the World 'the newspaper most read by chessplayers' and The Sun. Prices could fall again if Short keeps losing. Audiences for the first four games were between 500 and 800, but fell to about 300 on Thursday. At the last title match in New York in 1990 seat prices were Dollars 50 at the start, yet near the end tickets were given away to schoolchildren. Channel 4 bought the television rights and is screening two hours a day. BBC2 is devoting only half an hour with no live pictures or Kasparov interviews, but has better graphics and less frenetic commentaries than C4's soccer-style approach. Both channels attracted encouraging audiences of nearly 1m for their early programmes, but Kasparov's current pace would crush Short and reach a winning score of 12 1/2 points after only 16 or 18 games. Normal championship matches stop when one player reaches a winning score, but The Times has said all 24 games will be played. Nicholas Chesworth, of the event organisers CPMA who took over marketing the match in July, is considering a switch to rapid chess, at one hour for all the moves, to maintain interest. In 1921 Lasker conceded a best of eight wins match to Capablanca when the score was 0-4 and Robert Huebner, one of Short's aides, twice withdrew from candidates matches. But at Pounds 60 a move and with a contract to honour, Short would have to be broken by continued defeats to take such a course, and as of this weekend he looks resilient. Jan Timman trails Anatoly Karpov 2 1/2 -3 1/2 at the rival Fide championship in the Netherlands, which has attracted audiences of nearly 1,000, even though both contestants were earlier defeated by Short. All the Pounds 900,000 prize money for Timman and Karpov is being provided by the Sultan of Oman. Oman will stage the second half of the match when, it is said, only the grandmasters and the royal family will be allowed into the playing hall. Money is always a problem in chess. Most professionals only scrape a living. It is a perennial struggle to conjure up commercial support for chess in Britain. Many British players play for French, Belgian or Dutch clubs at weekends. This year a UK club league has begun, but it has only six teams and has yet to prove its viability. In contrast, Kasparov has earned Pounds 2.8m in his career, from tournaments, matches and simultaneous exhibitions against amateurs where his normal fee is Pounds 20,000. Short has so far won Pounds 150,000 from world championship qualifiers, and however badly he is crushed at the Savoy, will pick up Pounds 637,500 as loser. Two world championships and two rival organisations in chess have caused dissension among the top players. Short and Kasparov broke with Fide, the governing body of world chess, after it awarded the match to Manchester's Pounds 1.2m bid. Short claimed he was not consulted. Kasparov, who had long disliked Fide and its president Florencio Campomanes, jumped at the chance to create the Professional Chess Association after the two players had turned down an increased Manchester offer. Along with the PCA, a new name has come to the fore in international chess. Bob Rice, a New York tax lawyer, opened a small chess club in Wall Street and found a shoal of investment brokers and bankers keen to play. One of his legal clients was Kasparov, so Rice, a relaxed and entertaining man, emerged as Commissioner of the PCA, registered in Delaware like the tennis and golf professional groups on which it is modelled. Rice says the PCA is not a rival to Fide. 'We are a professional organisation to help chess players,' he says. 'Fide will continue to do what it always has, for amateur players around the world.' Others view it differently. John Nunn, the respected UK grandmaster, fears that the PCA will fail and that hardliners in Fide will then overturn reforms which have allowed players to become more involved. Nunn believes that Kasparov lacks business sense he says the champion promised, but failed to deliver, US and Japanese sponsors. A critical test for the PCA is its Groningen qualifier in December for its 1995 title match. Many grandmasters will enter, though there will also be significant absentees. The prize fund is Pounds 150,000, but no sponsor has been announced. Some in the chess world believe that The Times has an exclusive agreement with the PCA until the end of the London match, and that the Groningen sponsor will then be revealed as Intel, the microprocessor maker. Back at the Savoy, Short needs to avoid a wipeout, stabilise the score with a series of draws, then dig into his reserves of courage. The hype and controversy has been more of a strain for him than for the ebullient Kasparov, and the chess schism has made some of his old friends among players unwilling to help him. Many believe that he would have put up a better fight, and safeguarded his chess future, if he had accepted Manchester's offer. The jury is also out on whether Kasparov v Short will stimulate British chess by attracting players or will damage it by discouraging sponsors who see only huge costs and uncertain returns. Perhaps this controversial match will do both.</p>

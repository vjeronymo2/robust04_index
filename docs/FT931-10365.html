			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / US intends to push for fair trade says Espy THE US agriculture secretary, Mr Mike Espy, said yesterday that the Clinton administration's decision to slap duties on billions of dollars of imported steel was just the start of its push to open markets and seek fair trade, Reuter reports from Washington. 'This administration will insist that our trading partners and competitors comply with trading rules that are fair and equitable,' Mr Espy told a conference of the US Feed Grains Council. 'You've already seen some of the tough actions on steel import quotas and other areas from our new trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and you can expect more such decisions. The door to trade must swing both ways, and we will tighten the hinges,' he said. Mr Espy said that in agriculture he would 'move forcefully' to convince countries protecting their grain markets that they should change those polices. He also restated - in stronger terms - that he wants to use US farm export programmes full tilt until a global trade reform deal is struck under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said 'it would be in my judgment a serious mistake' to cut those programmes to try to reduce the deficit unless the Gatt agreement is reached. Nancy Dunne in Washington adds: US trade officials yesterday assured Mr Michael Wilson, Canadian trade minister, of their determination to pursue an early conclusion to Gatt's Uruguay Round and side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). After meeting Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, Mr Wilson said that the Clinton administration would soon seek an extension of the 'fast track' negotiating authority, which expires in May. 'It is being discussed with Congress right now,' Mr Wilson said. The authority blocks Congress from amending trade agreements.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Arts: An aerobics class in hell - Forsythe's 'In the Middle, somewhat elevated' WILLIAM Forsythe is the most fashionable choreographer of our time. His ballets are staged for many companies and, as we have reported, his own Frankfurt troupe plays two regular seasons in Paris every year. He is a purveyor of large, curiously grey-toned and determinedly earnest theatre-pieces to which audiences and commentators love to ascribe deep philosophic meaning. (The journalism surrounding Forsythe's work is of stunning pretensiousness and obscurantism - like the pieces being described). He is also a manufacturer of dances which rupture and derange the classic vocabulary, speeding it viciously up, driving it to the verge of physical breakdown. This, of course, inspires parrot cries of 'The new Balanchine' from observers who presumably neither know nor care about the Balanchine academy and style. (They may well also confuse a circus knife-throwing act with Olympic fencing). What catches audiences is Forsythe's skilled admixture of menacingly oblique drama - dark stages littered with anxious, arcane activity - and brutally unbalanced movement. Probably the best, and saddest, thing to be said about Forsythe's current work is that he offers a dance recipe exactly attuned to our times. In 1988, Forsythe staged In the Middle, somewhat elevated at the Paris Opera. On Thursday night it arrived at Covent Garden, a fact perhaps not unconnected with the presence of Sylvie Guillem as guest with the Royal Ballet, since she created a leading role in Paris, together with Laurent Hilaire, who is also now in London to take part in performances. The choreography is cast in Forsythe's most extreme and distorted style, like an aerobics class in hell. Six women, three men, tastelessly garbed in leotards of an unfortunate green shade, fling themselves on to a stage bare, dark, with characteristic Forsythe lighting which both illuminates and obscures (there's a message here]), with two gold cherries above the stage, in the middle, somewhat elevated (ah] the other message), while an electronic score by Thom Willems, Forsythe's favoured composed, clanks and bangs like a dyspeptic radiator. There ensue sequences of choreography in which the academic language is pushed towards its physical edges, tilted angrily off balance, driven onward with fierce muscular pulses. Patterns are dispersed, fragmentary. The dancers move in an out of their character as performers - sometimes sauntering away from the scene of the crime, or standing as observers at the side of the stage - as a further example of the piece's degage and disingenuous attitude. What is most remarkable is that the dance-language is so blatant, so essentially dull, and so fundamentally unadventurous. For someone hailed as a classic innovator, Forsythe provides brutalism on the most obvious terms by mugging academism, instead of evolving the new writing claimed for him - and also claimed by him: 'The vocabulary is not, and never will be, dated. What dates is the writing'. But Forsythe's view of dance is of unrelenting, undifferentiated physical stress, of harshness and deformation, of dynamics unleashed but aimless. It taxes its interpreters. It also degrades them, cheapens their identity in making them appear like demented and hyperactive gymnasts. That said, the Royal Ballet's casts perform magnificently well. Sylvie Guillem and Laurent Hilaire are entirely at home - Mlle Guillem too revealingly so - and Darcey Bussell, in the other leading role, is a marvel of Mach-one speed and laser precision, through the task is unworthy of her. To Peter Abegglen (who finds prodigies of energy and clarity for his solos), Michael Nunn, Bonnie Moore, Deborah Bull, Deborah Jones, Gillian Revie, all praise. The nice irony of the programme is that In the Middle is preceded by two of Ashton's most assured and beautiful classic dances: Scenes de ballet and Monotones. There is, I think, more truth about classic dancing in our century in the first five minutes of Scenes than in all the Forsythe choreography I have seen, for it is a marvel - though it will look more marvellous this season when its casts are fully adjusted to its demands. A welcome for Sergiu Pobereznic as the male lead - easy, quietly noble, with elegant feet - and for the return of Monotones and its lunar felicities, with Bryony Brind also happily returned to the stage. No welcome at all to the Opera House's short commons: this programme comprises 70 minutes of dancing and 60 minutes of interval. With today's uncomfortable seat prices, more could - should - be given to an audience faced with harsh choices on how to spend money in a recession.</p>

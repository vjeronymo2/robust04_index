			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): EETPU's return to TUC eased MR NORMAN WILLIS, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, gave a strong indication yesterday that he did not expect the EETPU electricians' union to face stiff financial penalties if it reaffiliated to the TUC. The EETPU was expelled from the TUC three years ago amid warnings that if it rejoined it would have to pay affiliation fees for all the time it was outside the organisation. The total already amounts to more than Pounds 1m. Mr Willis told the TUC general council yesterday that a merger between the EETPU and the AEU engineering union, which is likely in March and has prompted the reaffiliation discussion, was to be welcomed. The possible return of the EETPU has prompted letters of concern from eight unions: the probation officers' union Napo, the National Union of Journalists, the Prison Officers Association, the Civil Service union NUCPS, the construction union Ucatt, the general technical union MSF, the Fire Brigades Union and the breakaway electricians' union EPIU. The primary concern is not money, although some unions are likely to press for the full back-affiliation fees to be paid, but rather the existence within the EETPU of several organisations that have broken away from TUC-affiliated unions. Union leaders are also seeking guarantees that the EETPU in the merged union would abandon what they see as membership poaching. The EETPU was expelled after failing to obey a TUC ruling to withdraw from two single-union deals.</p>

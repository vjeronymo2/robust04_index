			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK pre-election budget doubles deficit to Pounds 28bn MR NORMAN LAMONT, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday launched the Conservative party's general election campaign with a budget that stole some of the pet economic policies of the opposition Labour party. Mr John Major, prime minister, is expected to announce today that the election will be held on April 9, capitalising on the government's surprise fiscal package targeted at low income voters. Mr Lamont unveiled a new 20 per cent lower band of income tax on the first Pounds 2,000 (Dollars 3,500) of taxable income and extra help for poorer pensioners in a budget that also extended help to smaller businesses and the car industry. But he held back from widely tipped moves such as cutting the basic income tax rate from 25 per cent or raising personal allowances by more than the inflation rate. Mr Lamont forecast higher budget deficits than City of London analysts had expected. For 1992-93, Mr Lamont forecast a public spending borrowing requirement of Pounds 28.1bn (nearly Dollars 50bn), or 4 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product. This is more than twice the PSBR of Pounds 13.8bn, or 2 1/4 per cent of GDP, Mr Lamont now expects for 1991-92. The City had expected a 1992-93 deficit of Pounds 25bn, and the government had forecast one of about Pounds 18bn in November's autumn statement. For the current year, the City had expected a deficit of about Pounds 12bn, and Mr Lamont had forecast Pounds 7.9bn in his first budget a year ago. The package provoked a mixed initial reaction on financial markets, with equities moving higher. But sterling and government gilt-edged securities fell on concern about the high deficit. While market reaction implied no early fall in interest rates, Mr Lamont later indicated that he did not rule out an interest rate cut during the election campaign. Although such action would be virtually unprecedented, he said that would be 'a matter for me and the Bank of England'. Mr Lamont limited the overall budget 'giveaway' to Pounds 1.5bn in 1992-93, compared with Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn forecast by many commentators, by raising taxes on tobacco and leaded petrol and vehicle excise duty by more than the rate of inflation. Mr Lamont described his package as a 'budget for the recovery'. But its immediate impact was to present a challenge to Labour. The party has long advocated the introduction of a reduced rate band to help the lower paid. But if it accepted it now, it would be unable to sustain its claim that the Conservatives were guilty of electoral bribery. Mr John Smith, who would replace Mr Lamont as chancellor if Labour won the election, said his party would oppose the lower rate band at the core of the budget package, prompting Mr Lamont to promise a formal House of Commons vote on the issue later this week. Senior ministers voiced confidence that the package - a careful political balancing act designed to steal Labour's most attractive clothes while deflecting charges of bribery - would hand back the political initiative to the Conservatives. Mr Lamont's measures were designed to win over key groups of voters in the key election battlefields. Changes in the uniform business rate, a property tax, are aimed at boosting Conservative support among small businessmen in marginal constituencies in southern England. The halving of car tax should benefit the motor manufacturing industry in the Midlands. Inheritance tax changes are designed to win votes from farmers in rural areas as well as from small businessmen across the country. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, said tax cuts paid for by public borrowing represented a 'panic-stricken, pre-election political sweetener', but party leaders privately acknowledged the package had left it with awkward choices. In his budget speech, Mr Lamont painted a picture in which economic recovery had effectively been postponed for a year. He described a path of recovery that would be very similar to that first outlined in last year's budget. He forecast 1 per cent growth in GDP this year with the rate quickening as the year progresses. Retail price inflation is expected to fall to 3 3/4 per cent at the end of this year and 3 1/4 per cent by mid-1993 from 4 1/4 per cent in the final quarter of 1991. Mr Lamont started his speech by announcing a surprise plan to combine the government's autumn statement spending plans and the spring budget into a comprehensive December budget from December 1993, itself a Labour policy. Mr Kinnock sought to reinforce the contrast between Labour's long-term commitment to economic revival and a short-term Conservative 'fix'. Mr Lamont, however, said British voters would be presented with a clear choice between a party committed to cutting taxes - particularly for the lower paid - while maintaining good public services and one committed to increase the tax burden on everyone. Both sides admitted that voters' reaction would be critical in shaping the course of the election. The Conservatives, currently fractionally behind in the opinion polls, are relying on the budget to push them into the lead. Ministers acknowledged, however, that there were still doubts over how a package widely acknowledged at Westminster to be politically astute would 'play' with the electorate. 'I am not sure whether they (the voters) will grasp it quickly', one minister said.

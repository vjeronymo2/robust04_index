			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["NATION report" by James Fahn] </F>   [Text] The companies planning to build a pipeline to  transport natural gas from an offshore field in Burma to  Thailand have for the first time revealed the route the pipeline  will take.    Human rights and environmental groups fear that its  construction will lead to extensive deforestation and the  displacement of villagers and refugees in order to secure the  route.    Several refugee camps in the area have already been burnt  down and their inhabitants ordered out, although no explanation  was given by the Thai authorities.    North of the route, Mon rebel leaders are coming under  increasing pressure to sign a ceasefire with the Burmese  government. Mon troops are at present skirmishing with Burmese  soldiers.    Assuming that the national oil companies of Burma and  Thailand -- the Myanmar [Burma] Oil &amp; Gas Enterprise (MOGE)  and  the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) -- can come to an  agreement on the price Thailand will pay for the gas, the  pipeline will come ashore between the towns of Ye and Tavoy in  Burma and follow the Tavoy and Zinba river valleys up toward the  border of Thailand.    It will then cross highlands of dense virgin forest to enter  Thailand at Ban I-Tong (Nai Et Taung in Burma) in Kanchanaburi  Province.    From Ban I-Tong, the pipeline will follow a road down to  Thong Pha Phum and then head south to a new power plant to be  built in Ratchaburi.    Total, a French state-owned oil company which has signed a  production-sharing agreement with the Burmese government for the  offshore field in the Gulf of Martaban, will be responsible for  constructing the pipeline in Burma while PTT will build it on  the Thai side.    The pipeline's chosen course was revealed in a letter dated  Jan 12 from Joseph Daniel, Total's director of communications,  to Yvette Pierpaoli, a French refugee worker. A copy of the  letter has been obtained by THE NATION.    The letter claims that by following the river valleys in  Burma -- where there are only "scattered shrubs" -- and the  existing road in Thailand, the pipeline's environmental impact  would be minimized. "Only the very last (two to three)  kilometres in Burma... will require cutting some trees," it says.    "No population displacement is required on the Total  pipeline  course which follows a region which as far as we have seen is  perfectly quiet," it adds. The letter claims that surveys along  the course have been carried out by foot, car and helicopter  since last April.    The route was confirmed by a PTT source who wished to remain  anonymous. The source said a decision on the route was made  several months ago. Talks between Burma, Thailand and Total  were being held yesterday in Bangkok over the price of the gas.    The route is significant in that it helps to explain recent  events at the border. On April 7, last year, the 9th Division  of the Royal Thai Army reportedly burned down two villages --  Aung Tha Pye and Democracy Village -- just south of Ban I-Tong,  displacing 500 people in all, most of them ethnic Tavoyar  refugees.    At the time, the PTT denied knowing about the evictions and  claimed the pipeline would follow the old "Death Railway" route  from Amherst in Burma through Three Pagoda Pass, well north of  Ban I- Tong.    More recently, Mon and Karen groups have come under  increasing pressure to sign a ceasefire with the State Law and  Order Restoration Council (Slorc) which rules Burma. Both Mon  and Karen soldiers are active in the area where the pipeline  will be laid.    Sources claim that Burmese troops from Kaleinaung approached  the border on Feb 20 near Sangkhla Buri, roughly 30 kms north of  Ban I- Tong and 10 kms south of Three Pagoda Pass. Over the  last few weeks, the Mon National Liberation Army, which has its  headquarters in the area, has reportedly fought intermittent  battles with Slorc soldiers, who gained control of Three Pagoda  Pass and Nai Et Taung several years ago.    At the same time, the 7,000 Mon refugees in the Loh Loe  refugee camp near Sangkhla Buri have been ordered by Thai  military authorities to move to Hlakhani -- located on the  border around five kms from the Slorc military camp at Three  Pagoda Pass -- by the end of this month.    Phisan Phalatsing, a leader of the Mon community in  Thailand,  fears that this will leave the refugees extremely vulnerable to  attacks by Slorc.    "It's quite clear that the Mon are being pressured to agree  to a ceasefire so that the pipeline can be built," he said at a  protest held two weeks ago in front of the UN building in  Bangkok.    A leaflet handed out by the Thai-Mon protesters stated that  "Onshore and off-shore natural resources -- such as timber,  fish, oil and gas -- left over by Mon forefathers in posterity  are being sold at a pittance by the Slorc to benefit a small  military clique. Mons, who are the real owners, have no voice  whatsoever in the disposal of this inheritance."    Meanwhile, within Burma, 20,000-30,000 villagers have been  conscripted to build a railroad from Ye to Tavoy and to upgrade  the road which runs between the two coastal towns. The railroad  is considered important for Burma's national development but  will also make it easier for Slorc troops to secure the area  where the pipeline will be laid.    Conditions at the worksites are reported to be appalling and  have led many villagers to escape to Thailand, adding to numbers  in refugee camps.    The PTT source contacted yesterday said Thailand had  preferred a more southerly route for the pipeline but Burmese  authorities consider the chosen route to be the best in terms of  security. He admitted to being ignorant, however, of the  measures being taken to secure the route.    "If the pipeline's impact is too harmful, the project will  have to be dropped," he said. But he expressed hope that the  money paid by Thailand for the gas would be spread among the  Burmese people and used to develop the country.    "Funding of the pipeline will have to come from outside  sources, so the Myanmar government will be under pressure to  develop the pipeline in a proper way," he said. Talks over  financing have yet to take place, he added.</p>

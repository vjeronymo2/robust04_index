			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Two Constitutions Will Be </F> Drafted; President for Himself, the Parliament for Itself"]    [Text] On Tuesday [22 February] the president stopped  cooperating with the parliament in the creation of the  constitution. He recalled his representative Lech Falandysz from  the Constitutional Committee, and withdrew his constitution  bill, which was drafted during the term of the previous  parliament. He wants to draft a new constitution along with  "social forces" and he does not intend to submit it in the  parliament," we were told by President's Spokesman Andrzej  Drzycimski.    "The president would really like to be reelected and so he  thought that he might treat the Constitution as game factor in  the fight for reelection," Aleksander Kwasniewski, head of the  Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly, commented on  the decisions of the president.    "As for the Constitution, it was the parliament, not me, who  rejected the possibility of cooperation. I tried to cooperate,"  declared Lech Walesa in his statement for the Polish Press  Agency [PAP].    In line with the 1992 Law on the Procedures for Preparation  and Passing of the Constitution, the president may prepare his  own constitution bill, independently of the parliament; however,  he must submit it in the National Assembly by 9 May.    President's spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski told us on Tuesday  that the president would not forward the constitution bill,  prepared with the participation of the people, to the parliament.  <H5>  ``He Will Embark on a Campaign </H5>   for the bill. Political life will show which bill -- the one  prepared by the parliament or the one prepared by the president  -- is stronger. The point is that it should be recalled that  the creator of all laws is the nation,'' said Drzycimski.    In his 23 February statement for PAP, the president said  that  he would not deprive the parliament of the right to work on the  constitution. "I have always thought, and I will still think  that the verdict of democracy (election results) should be  honored and respected. However, I will not submit to conditions  that are unfavorable and defective. Nonetheless, all of us must  submit to democracy."    He also said that the adoption of the basic law a little  later may favorably affect the quality of this law. By taking  part in its creation, the nation will understand "what is going  on."    Walesa explained that he had recalled his representative  from  the Constitutional Committee...  <H5>  Because the Sejm Rejected </H5>   on Friday his legislative initiative, which granted groups  of  100,000 people the right to submit their own constitution bills;  according to this proposal, if the nation does not approve of  the bill passed by the National Assembly in a referendum, the  parliament is dissolved.    Lech Walesa declares that he will no longer hold talks with  the parliament on the constitution or take part in its creation.    However, the law on the procedures for passing the  constitution imposes concrete duties on the president. Once the  constitution has been adopted by the National Assembly, the  president has 60 days to submit a proposal with amendments to  it. His amendments are then adopted by the definite majority of  the votes; another condition is that at least 50 percent of the  overall number of the National Assembly members are present.  Then the president would have 14 days to order a referendum on  the Constitution. It must be held no later than four months  after it was ordered. Lech Walesa will have to do all these  things, regardless of the declared refusal to cooperate with the  parliament in the creation of the constitution. The members of  the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms did not withdraw from  the Constitutional Committee. Therefore, Lech Walesa will be  able to follow its work indirectly. Lech Falandysz, who has  been recalled, had the right to submit motions, but he did not  take part in the ballots.</p>

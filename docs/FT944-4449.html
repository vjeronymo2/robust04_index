			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: British Telecom is able to deliver cable services Sir, Contrary to the impression Tony Young creates (Letters: December 1), BT is not prevented from using its network to deliver the same services as cable. When the government created the cable licensing regime in 1984, it envisaged that BT would run one-third of all cable franchises and could use its existing network to deliver broadband services in these areas. BT could have been the largest cable operator, but it spurned the opportunity. Even now, BT could fill its ducts with fibre and deliver its current services more efficiently, offer extra services (such as those on France's Minitel system) and invest in an entirely new market - that of interactive communications. Instead BT, Britain's biggest and most profitable company, wants a new monopoly. The cable industry is investing billions of pounds in Britain, creating new local companies and with them tens of thousands of jobs. Why does Tony Young want to destroy this? The government has created a new market and Britain is leading the world. Tony Young and BT should recognise and accept this. Richard Woolam, director general, Cable Communications Association, Fifth Floor, Artillery House, London SW1P 1RT</p>

The sources said that they had obtained the information from  circles close to the command of the French battalion of the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) stationed in Coralici near Cazin.    SRNA recalled that the Serb side was immediately accused of  being responsible for the death of the French soldier at one of  the UNPROFOR observation posts on the Bihac front although the  circumstances and motives for the killing remained unclarified  until this very day.</p>

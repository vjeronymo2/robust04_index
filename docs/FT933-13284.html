			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sycamore in loss and rationalisation under way REPORTING a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.78m for the half year to March 31, directors of Sycamore Holdings conceded that the state of the business was 'far from satisfactory'. However, a completely new senior management team is in place and since April 'we have been addressing energetically all of the major problems,' they said. The loss compared with a profit of Pounds 314,000 last time, and included a one-off reduction in the carrying values of stock and work-in-progress of Pounds 1.9m. Turnover expanded to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 9.69m). Warwill continued to incur large losses in the iron foundry operation. Urgent action was planned which was expected to lead to a significant exceptional deficit in the second half, somewhat exceeding the surplus already realised on two disposals. They were Ashworth Instrumentation for Pounds 1.47m, a premium of Pounds 1.27m over book value, and Ashworth Diecasting for Pounds 1.2m subject to a retention of Pounds 75,000. A rationalisation and cost reduction programme had been implemented, including closure of the former head office in Derby and removal of 'an unnecessary layer of divisional management'. Since March the number of employees had been cut from 660 to 471, of which 94 went with the businesses sold. The two largest businesses, Ashworth Living, a maker of laboratory, hospital and accommodation furniture, and Deanes Furniture (office systems), enjoy good market bases and were capable of long term development once the group was on a sounder footing.</p>

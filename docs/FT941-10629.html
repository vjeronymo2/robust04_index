			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / GKN makes hostile Pounds 496m offer for Westland group GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, launched a hostile Pounds 496m takeover bid yesterday for Westland, the helicopter manufacturer at the centre of a cabinet crisis over its ownership eight years ago. The bid was announced after GKN said it had agreed to acquire the 18.7 per cent stake in Westland held by United Technologies (UTC), the US parent company of Sikorsky helicopters. The takeover would transform GKN - which already manufactures light armoured vehicles - from a group dominated by automotive components and industrial services into a company led by military sales. Sir Leslie Fletcher, Westland chairman, was informed of the move in a dawn telephone call yesterday from Sir David Lees, his GKN counterpart. Combined with GKN's existing 28.3 per cent stake, the extra holding would give GKN 47 per cent of Westland on a fully converted basis. Westland responded coolly, calling GKN's overture an 'unwelcome offer'. It advised shareholders to take no action until it discussed the offer with Schroders, its financial advisers. The bid comes after the 1986 cabinet row which prompted the resignations of Mr Michael Heseltine and Sir Leon Brittan, then defence and industry secretaries. GKN has offered Westland shareholders 290p per ordinary and preferred share, 354.8p for each convertible preferred share and 208.3p for each warrant, all payable in cash with a partial share alternative. It also reassured Westland shareholders they would receive a share of any damages won in its lengthy legal action against the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation over an alleged breach of contract in 1980. GKN said the bid would be funded by a one-for-five rights issue of non-interest bearing convertible loan stock at 490p each in two equal instalments, the second conditional on 75 per cent acceptance of the bid. The rights would raise a net Pounds 248m, while the balance of Pounds 118m would be financed from its own resources. GKN shares closed up 2p at 582p. Although the 290p price represented a discount on Westland's 307p closing price yesterday, Sir David said: 'The offer is a fair one', representing a 7 per cent premium on the average share price in January. UTC, which has opted to take Pounds 75m in cash for its stake, said existing licensing agreements to build Sikorsky Black Hawk and Sea King helicopters at Yeovil would be unaffected by the deal. Sir David warned that GKN's pre-tax profits were expected to decline by more than 20 per cent to Pounds 97m in the year ended last December 31. It would pay an unchanged dividend.

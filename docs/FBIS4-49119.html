			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 3 (CNA) -- The Taipei-based Chinese  National Federation of Industries and the Hong Kong General  Chamber of Commerce Tuesday [3 May] signed a memorandum of  understanding [MOU] to forge closer trade ties.    Under the memorandum, both sides pledge to join hands to  help  promote trade exchanges among Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland  China and push for the opening of the mainland's service markets.    Meanwhile, Taiwan asks Hong Kong to give a helping hand to  Taiwan's efforts to become an Asia-Pacific business operations  center, to grant seven-day visa-free stay to Taiwan visitors who  will proceed to other countries, and to simplify visa  application procedures for Taiwan visitors.    On the other hand, the Hong Kong side suggests that Taiwan  accelerate opening of its financial market to Hong Kong  investors, further relax restrictions on merchandise trade among  Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Taiwan, and open the flight route  between Taipei's Sungshan Airport and Hong Kong.    Federation Chairman Kao Ching-yuan and Chairman Paul Cheng  of  the General Chamber of Commerce inked the document during the  fourth Taiwan-Hong Kong trade cooperation conference at the  Howard Plaza Hotel.    More than 100 representatives from the two organizations  took  part in the one-day meeting, during which panel discussions on  manufacturing, banking, and service industries were held.    Vice Chairman Hsueh Chi of the Council for Economic Planning  and Development, Vice Chairman Su Chi of the Mainland Affairs  Council, and Director-General Ricky Y. S. Kao of the industrial  development and investment center were invited to deliver  speeches at the meeting.    Taiwan has maintained close economic ties with Hong Kong,  which has been the entrepot of cross-strait indirect trade.  Two-way trade totaled US$20.4 billion last year, in which  Taiwan enjoyed a surplus of US$16.9 billion.    In 1993, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade accounted for 12 percent of  Taiwan's total foreign trade.</p>

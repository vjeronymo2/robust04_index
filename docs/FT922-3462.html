			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Banks in focus in varied day for bourses IN A VARIED day for bourses, Paris seemed to find plenty to talk about while Frankfurt remained quiet, writes Our Markets Staff. Elsewhere, there was a focus on the financial sectors of four countries, partly after the Copenhagen effect on bond markets last week, and partly ahead of results in Sweden and Finland. PARIS saw a continuation of some themes begun on Tuesday, as Schneider and its related companies again came into the spotlight. At yesterday's annual meeting the company reiterated what analysts had heard the day before by forecasting a 1992 net profit of some FFr400m against a previous estimate of FFr650m. The shares slid another FFr26.00 to FFr682.00, but off the day's low of FFr662.00. Among its subsidiaries, Merlin weakened FFr16.00 to FFr530.00 while theholding company, SPEP, shed FFr14.50 or 4.4 per cent to FFr315.50. The CAC-40 index had a slightly easier day, closing down 8.50 at 1,953.73, having earlier touched 1,951. News that Euro Disney had to close its gates on Sunday because the theme park was full was one reason for a pick-up in its shares, which finished FFr5.00 higher at FFr114.00. However, some analysts noted that the price had fallen so much that it was ripe for an upturn. News earlier in the day that Nestle was the buyer of Exor's remaining stake in Suez left the latter down FFr3.20 at FFr315.20 while Exor was unchanged at FFr1,401.00. Nord Est improved FFr4.50 to FFr133.70 after the sale of a construction group in which it was the majority shareholder to Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez. Lyonnaise lost FFr11.00 to FFr537.00. FRANKFURT's activity level improved from derisory to quiet, German stock market turnover climbing from DM3.8bn to DM4.9bn as equities recovered from a 1.77 decline to 711.83 in the FAZ index at midsession to a 3.50 gain to 1,789.76 in the DAX at the close. Share price volatility stayed in the second liners with Deutsche Babcock, weak recently on poor results and prospects, recovering DM6 to DM162.50 but Lufthansa, in similar case, falling another DM3 to DM130. Continental, the tyremaker, rose another DM2 to DM278 on speculation about merger and/or profit prospects within the industry. Meanwhile, Escada, the fashion company, fell another DM13.50 to a new 1992 low of DM332.50 on the death last week of its co-founder, Ms Margaretha Ley. Its high for the year was DM585. In retailing, Karstadt rose DM7.50 to DM639 ahead of its 1991 results. Banks came into the frame in Italy and Sweden, where they were selectively higher, and in Switzerland and Finland where they were weak. MILAN linked further gains in Credito Italiano and Mediobanca, L17 to L1,687 and L135 to L13,355 respectively, with those in other blue chips like Fiat, Olivetti and Generali as the Comit index rose 1.03 to 481.07. Volume was dulled again by technical problems. In STOCKHOLM, banks staged a partial recovery after their recent losses, SE Banken A gaining SKr1.50 to SKr31 and Handelsbanken A SKr0.50 to SKr50.50. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 3.7 to 959.8. ZURICH said that the financial sector was under more pressure than industrials as the SMI index fell 11.1 to 1,888.5. Banks were under pressure from interest rate worries, CS Holding bearers falling SFr40 to SFr1.860 and insurers from an upcoming Zurich Insurance rights issue, although Winterthur bearers led the way down with a fall of SFr60 to SFr3,190. HELSINKI's banks led the fall as the Hex index dropped 15.1, or 1.9 per cent to 783.7. The banks and finance index was down 3.8 per cent. AMSTERDAM featured KLM and Fokker while the CBS Tendency index slipped 0.1 to 130.3. The airline group was 60 cents weaker at Fl 39.90 following the cut in transatlantic air afares by the US airline, Delta. Fokker improved 90 cents to Fl 35.10 on news that the government may keep part of its stake under terms being negotiated with DASA. BRUSSELS followed other markets lower with retailers moving in heavy trade. The Bel-20 index lost 4.1 to 1,219.78 with Delhaize losing BFr25 to BFr1,785 and GIB down BFr2 to BFr1,452. Solvay went against the trend, rising BFr75 to BFr13,575. MADRID's general index improved 0.37 to 251.34 with turnover of some Pta11bn in spite of Telefonica not being traded.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 10                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10 am     11 am   12 pm    1 pm      2 pm     3 pm    close 1172.84  1173.33  1174.43  1175.37  1175.80  1175.72  1174.57  1174.58                Day's High  1175.95    Day's Low  1172.60         Jun 9         Jun 8       Jun 5       Jun 4      Jun 3        1174.96     1177.48***    1181.18    1184.92**   1186.81  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). *** Partial ** Indicative.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Shell and Unilever in Indian joint ventures Two Anglo-Dutch groups have announced plans for joint ventures in India. Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil concern, is returning after an absence of 17 years with a joint venture for the production and marketing of lubricant oils. Shell, which left India in response to Mrs Indira Gandhi, the former prime minister's autarchic economic policies, is taking a 51 per cent stake in a Rs1.3bn (Dollars 41m) venture with Bharat Petroleum, the Indian state-owned oil company. Shell brand products went on sale yesterday at 250 garages in northern and western India. The company hopes to expand across the country and estimates the Indian market for lubricant oils to be worth Rs40bn a year. Other international oil groups which have taken advantage of the government's economic liberalisation to re-establish themselves in India include Mobil and Pennzoil, the US groups. Hindustan Lever, the Indian subsidiary of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, yesterday announced a 50-50 joint venture with Kimberly-Clark of the US, to manufacture personal care products in India. Kimberly-Clark Lever the new company, will invest Dollars 10m in a plant in the state of Maharashtra to manufacture disposable nappies and feminine care products. The plant will employ 100 people and go into production in 1996. Hindustan Lever said the company would use its Indian sales force to market the new products, with Kimberly-Clark contributing its brand-name and technological expertise. India's burgeoning middle classes provide an untapped market for personal products, which are still considered luxury items, and not the necessities they are in the West. The opening up of the economy has widened the market, giving Indian consumers a choice for the first time in 40 years.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Brussels poised to scrap rescue plan for steel The European Commission is expected to abandon its rescue plan for the steel industry today. That would represent belated recognition that steelmakers in the European Union are unwilling to make the minimum 19m-tonne capacity cuts to keep the plan alive. The move - backed by the plan's two chief architects, Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner - would remove the loose framework for curbing state aid to the steel sector. But the impact of Brussels' withdrawal is likely to be softened by the steady recovery in steel prices and the fact that most private and state-owned steelmakers have increasingly sought market solutions to the industry's troubles. Commission officials last night defended the two-year effort to conclude the steel rescue plan, which involved financial incentives and import relief for Europe's steelmakers in return for cuts of between 19m and 26m tonnes in their steelmaking capacity. Overall effective capacity is about 150m tonnes. The first stage of the plan was agreed last December when industry ministers approved subsidies for state-owned producers in Spain, Italy and Germany in return for capacity cuts. 'Without the political framework of this plan, we risked having a free-for-all on state aid in a very fragile steel market,' said one official. If the rescue plan is abandoned today, the December subsidies agreement will remain in place, but the Commission would drop its quarterly guidelines for production and delivery volumes; withdraw approval of private companies using industry levies to finance closures; and claw back relief offered against cheap imports. However, some Ecu240m (Pounds 189m) aid offered to redundant steelworkers under the EU's social plan is not expected to be affected. Also, the Commission intends to monitor each case where it has approved state aid in return for plant closures before judging whether to continue, a Brussels official said. That would apply to current restructuring packages such as the effort to eliminate steel mills in the northern Bresciani region in Italy. Meanwhile, Germany's economics ministry and the Treuhand privatisation agency said they would reduce their DM1.2bn rescue for Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's largest steel mill.

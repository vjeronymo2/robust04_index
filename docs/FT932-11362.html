			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / ADB chief in bid to secure rise in capital MR Kimimasa Tarumizu, president of the Asian Development Bank, yesterday defended the bank's record in the face of US reluctance to subscribe to a proposed capital increase and said new funds were needed to alleviate poverty, preserve the environment and finance investment in infrastructure. Addressing the opening session of the ADB's annual meeting, Mr Tarumizu said the bank expected to raise about Dollars 14bn (Pounds 8.9bn) on international financial markets over the next four years to finance its loans to developing Asian countries. The ADB's borrowings rose to Dollars 3.1bn last year from Dollars 1.3bn in 1991. The ADB wants to double its subscribed capital from the present Dollars 23bn, both to secure its future borrowings on international markets and because its charter limits the amount it can lend to the sum of its capital and reserves. US representatives have suggested a reinterpretation of the charter to allow further lending without the capital increase, arguing that the limit should be on loan disbursements rather than commitments. But if the existing interpretation is accepted - and the ADB insists that it should be - the bank will probably have to stop granting new loans some time in 1994, unless they are covered by incoming repayments of previous credits. Mr Tarumizu yesterday described an early consensus on the capital increase as 'critical'. Responding to concerns about the rising failure rate of ADB projects, he said measures had been taken and 'task forces' established to increase the effectiveness of the bank's assistance. He said the ADB needed resources because it was expanding - the six former central Asian republics of the Soviet Union are expected to join soon, although they are also members of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - and because further outside support for economic reform in Asia was essential despite the success of many Asian economies. 'The overwhelming majority of the world's poor - and the extremely poor - still live in Asia, almost entirely in the bank's member countries,' he said. At one point Mr Tarumizu emphasised the need to tackle Asian infrastructure problems such as power shortages, particularly severe in the Philippines where the ADB annual meeting is being held; as if on cue, the lights in the convention centre went out.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Allen ends growth record with 39% fall to Pounds 3.21m IN THE year to March 29, Allen, the USM-quoted housebuilder, contractor, plant hirer and property developer based in Wigan, Lancashire, saw the end of its 23-year record of growth. Pre-tax profits fell 39 per cent to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 5.25m) on turnover almost 13 per cent down at Pounds 58.9m (Pounds 67.5m). Although housebuilding had held up better in the north, Mr Donald Greenhalgh, chairman and managing director, described Allen's performance as 'creditable' - indeed, the final dividend is lifted to a proposed 3.35p (3p) for a total of 5p, up from 4.9p. Forecasts for margins and operating profits on the contracting side had been too pessimistic - the former improved a 'comfortable' 4.26 per cent and the latter 2.2 per cent to Pounds 1.4m, though turnover declined 18 per cent to Pounds 32.9m. Although bad debt in plant hire was reduced, operating profits fell 55 per cent to Pounds 745,000. Beskab hired out more site offices thanks to price reduction. Housebuilding profits were down 25 per cent at Pounds 2m on turnover 4 per cent lower at Pounds 15.4m. Servicing the bottom third of the market and building to exchange of contract rather than reservation helped the division, where completions rose by 5 to 271 at an average price of Pounds 56,000 (Pounds 60,000). Mr Greenhalgh said the company had 'not ducked the question' of provisions on its 3-year landbank, but had concluded none was necessary. Provisions of some Pounds 340,000 were made on the property development side, where profits tumbled 67 per cent on turnover down 15 per cent at Pounds 1.6m. Group earnings fell to 9.69p (15.47p) per share.</p>

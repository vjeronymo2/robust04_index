			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 3 NORTHWEST PILOTS FLEW 'HIGH' -- JURY;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: THE CONVICTIONS ARE THE FIRST UNDER A TOUGH FEDERAL  ANTI-DRINKING AND DRUG LAW.  </P> <P> Three former Northwest Airlines pilots were found guilty today of flying while  intoxicated, the first convictions under a new federal law cracking down on  drinking and drug use in commercial transportation.  </P> <P> A federal jury convicted former pilots Norman Lyle Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.;  Robert Kirchner, 36, of Highland Ranch, Colo., and Joseph Balzer, 35, of  Antioch, Tenn.  </P> <P> The felony charge carries a maximum 15 years in prison and $250,000 fine.  Sentencing will not be decided until authorities complete a pre-sentencing  investigation.  </P> <P> "I came into this expecting the worst. In that sense I had no surprise," said  Prouse after the verdicts were announced. In his defense, he had argued that he  was an alcoholic and thus had a higher tolerance for alcohol than most people.  His lawyer said he will appeal.  </P> <P> The three were arrested March 8 after flying a Boeing 727 from Fargo, N.D., to  the Twin Cities. The plane, carrying 91 passengers, landed safely.  </P> <P> Witnesses said they had consumed numerous drinks at a bar several hours before  the early morning flight.  </P> <P> In tests about two hours after the plane arrived at Minneapolis-St. Paul  International Airport, Kirchner showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06%,  Balzer showed 0.08% and Prouse 0.13%.  </P> <P> Prouse was the captain on the flight, Kirchner the first officer and Balzer the  flight engineer.  </P> <P> The pilots had been drinking the night before at a lounge in Moorhead and a  customer reported them to the Federal Aviation Administration.  </P> <P> According to bills from the bar introduced as evidence, Prouse ordered 15 rum  and colas while Kirchner and Balzer shared seven pitchers of beer over about  six hours.  </P> <P> An FAA official came to the airport, but the plane left while he was  telephoning a supervisor to ask what to do. Another FAA official made a  citizen's arrest when the plane landed at Minneapolis-St. Paul International  Airport.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers argued that the apparently smooth operation of the 40-minute  flight showed that the pilots were not impaired by alcohol.  </P> <P> But Assistant U.S. Atty. Elizabeth de la Vega questioned whether the pilots  could have handled an emergency if one had developed.  </P></p>

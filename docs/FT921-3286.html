			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Allied Radio cuts deficit to Pounds 1.57m Allied Radio, the former Third Mile Investment which, last September, acquired County Sound and Radio Mercury, covering Surrey, north Sussex and north Hampshire, reduced its pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.74m to Pounds 1.57m in the year to December 31. However the merger was completed only a few days before September 30, the traditional year-end for UK commercial radio companies, and the date to which Allied will change its year-end. These results therefore, reflect only the activities of TMI, rather than the trading results of both radio stations, which are now the core business. The accounts do show, though, corporate costs and interest due on the loan stock since the merger. Allied also owns 24.9 per cent of Fox FM in Oxfordshire and 20 per cent of Pirate FM in Cornwall. Trading profits came to Pounds 66,000 (losses Pounds 484,000) and there was an exceptional loss of Pounds 764,000 (Pounds 1.54m) relating to a provision for the permanent diminution in value of the group's non-radio investment portfolio. Losses per share were cut to 23.8p (83.4p).</p>

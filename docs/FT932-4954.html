			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Daf Vans reports sales recovery LEYLAND Daf Vans, a division of the Anglo-Dutch vehicle maker which went into receivership in February, said yesterday its sales had recovered strongly since a management buy-out rescued it from receivership two months ago. The Birmingham-based manufacturer saw half its market share disappear after its Dutch parent sought protection from its creditors earlier this year. Mr Allan Amey, managing director and chief executive, said yesterday that it had now made up nearly all the lost ground. Figures for May, the first full month's trading since the buy-out of the vans division, showed the company's market share, which had fallen to less than 7 per cent, had risen to 14.4 per cent. 'The increased share is a very positive trend and puts us back where we need to be,' said Mr Amey. 'There is no doubt many of our customers have held back until the management buy-out was completed and we are now seeing our future order book grow,' he added. The likely management buy-out at Leyland Daf Trucks is expected to be agreed this week in spite of reports that Mr Ian McKinnon, a former director of the company, is about to make a rival offer. Receivers Arthur Andersen are understood to be close to an agreement with the buy-out team, which is supported by Pounds 5m of equity capital from Barclays Development Capital. Although a bid by Mr McKinnon might feature a larger 'headline' price for the truck division, it is unlikely to be considered viable by the receivers. Under the terms of the proposed sale to the buy-out team - led by Mr John Gilchrist, former managing director of the assembly plant - the Leyland site would be acquired by the development arm of Lancashire County Council.</p>

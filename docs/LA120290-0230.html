			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE DIVISION I VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR GETS JOB DONE IN FOURTH GAME  </P> <P> It wasn't so much a question that Corona del Mar High School would beat  Mountain View St. Francis in the State Division I girls' volleyball  championship game Saturday night.  </P> <P> The question was when .  </P> <P> The Sea Kings blew a 6-2 lead in the third game and needed seven match points  in the fourth for a 15-3, 15-5, 11-15, 15-8 victory at Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> "That team just wouldn't go away," Corona del Mar Coach Dale Flickinger said of  St. Francis.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar (28-1) won its second state title since 1984 and extended its  winning streak to 26 matches.  </P> <P> Outside hitter Tracy Schriber had 13 kills and was named the tournament's most  valuable player.  </P> <P> Joining her on the all-tournament team were teammates Lara Carlsen (14 kills),  Stacy Petersen (12 kills) and Prentice Perkins (42 assists). Brita Schwerm came  off the bench to lead St. Francis (29-2) with 19 kills.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar's hitting percentage of .354 set the State Division I record,  breaking the previous mark of .350 set last year by Mira Costa.  </P> <P> After winning the first two games, the Sea Kings appeared ready for a sweep,  leading, 6-2, in the third game. But St. Francis capitalized on eight Corona  del Mar hitting errors and six kills by Schwerm to win the game.  </P> <P> The Sea Kings were better prepared in the fourth game as they raced to a 14-0  lead. But again St. Francis came back, fighting off six match points and  cutting the deficit to 14-8. The match ended on the seventh match point, when  St. Francis committed a hitting error.  </P> <P> Carlsen said the Sea Kings were nervous in the fourth game. "It was so hard to  do it at the end," she said. "I was dizzy I was so overwhelmed."  </P> <P> The victory capped a somewhat frustrating season for the Sea Kings. Their  coach, Charlie Brande, was suspended in August in the wake of a Southern  Section investigation into his coaching of club-team players with high school  eligibility remaining.  </P> <P> Brande said Saturday his hearing before the Southern Section had been postponed  indefinitely.  </P> <P> The Sea King players dedicated their victory over Mira Costa in the Southern  Section 5-A final to Brande. They were thinking of him during Saturday's  victory, too.  </P> <P> "The thing with Charlie made us stronger," Carlsen said.  </P></p>

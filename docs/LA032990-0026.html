			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Another Platform for Jackson: Actress Glenda Jackson is running for Britain's  Parliament and says she'll give up acting if elected. The Oscar-winning star of  such films as "A Touch of Class" and "Women in Love" beat three other  contenders late Tuesday for the right to run for a Labor Party seat in an area  of north London. "Its quite wonderful that I've won and it's a humbling  experience," said Jackson, who pledged to give up acting and devote herself to  politics if she wins the parliamentary election that will be held before  mid-1992.

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Move to ban more directors - Government plan to clamp down on insolvency practitioners The government is clamping down on insolvency practitioners who fail to provide the information which would lead to the directors of collapsed companies being disqualified. The move is part of a series of initiatives designed to increase the number of director disqualification orders sought through the courts. The number of criminal prosecutions is also to be raised. The aim is to give a boost to the number of directors disqualified during the current year. The provisional plan is to raise the total number of disqualifications sought during 1994-95 by about one third from the target of 500 for 1993-94. The moves follow publication last year of a highly critical report from the National Audit Office, the Whitehall watchdog. This suggested that the government was failing to take adequate steps to disqualify sufficient numbers of company directors criticised for poor business conduct. Action is now being taken by the Insolvency Service, the Department of Trade and Industry agency which launches disqualification petitions. Officials at the Insolvency Service argue that many insolvency practitioners - including some within the UK's large accountancy firms  - have been failing to provide sufficient and timely information on the directors whose conduct they examine. They have launched discussions with several firms and plan to raise lack of compliance with the Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit, the self-regulatory body set up under pressure from the Service. The NAO report said that many insolvency practitioners were failing to submit detailed returns. As part of its efforts to increase the rate of disqualification, the Service is planning to issue a simplified version of the 'D-form". This is the return required at the completion of insolvency cases conducted by practitioners.</p>

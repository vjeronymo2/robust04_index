Ambassador Carlos Portales signed the  document for the president of the Republic.    The Chilean Government also has joined the organization  supervising the treaty -- the Organization to Ban Nuclear  Weapons in Latin America, OPANAL. The ceremony took place in  Mexico City. Argentina joined the treaty during the same  ceremony.    Portales said on the occasion that Chile emphasizes its  complete renunciation and repudiation of the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction, adding that the country will  contribute with initiatives seeking to prevent the proliferation  of these types of weapons.    Chile ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty in October 1974, seven  years after signing it. Its implementation, however, was  suspended because Chile considered that all countries with  nuclear programs in the region had to become an effective part  of the agreement.</p>

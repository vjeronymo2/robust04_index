			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. met with PLO representative Hakem  Balawi in Tunis, the fifth such meeting since December, when the United States  agreed to reopen contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Although  the meeting was held at the PLO's request, Pelletreau used the occasion to  criticize two recent attempts by guerrillas from the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine, a PLO radical faction, to carry out attacks inside  Israel, a State Department spokesman said. Both attempts failed when Israeli  troops intercepted the raiders inside Lebanon. The PLO had agreed to renounce  terrorism, leading to the U.S. decision to reopen talks.  </P></p>

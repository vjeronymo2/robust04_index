			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (8): Investment picks up - Doubts about strategy may be confounded WHEN Mr Chris Farrow became the new chief executive of the Merseyside Development Corporation (MDC) late last year, he might well have felt he was jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. He came from London Docklands Development Corporation, which was set up at the same time as its Merseyside counterpart in 1981. The well-publicised problems of Olympia &amp; York in finding tenants for London's Canary Wharf have underlined the dangers of putting the cart of speculative office building before the horse of proper access and infrastructure. But while many parts of Docklands have attracted private sector investment, Merseyside Development Corporation by contrast has failed, so far, to amass significant similar interest. By 1990, nine years into its supposed life of a decade, the MDC had spent Pounds 180m of public money but had generated only Pounds 43.5m of private sector investment. The efforts of the corporation had been accompanied throughout most of the 1980s by a chorus of criticism that the Merseyside waterfront would never become financially viable because the corporation had adopted a misguided strategy. It had spent a great deal of its funds on reclaiming and gentrifying the Albert Dock as a tourist complex. But although 5m visit the Albert Dock each year it does not provide a great number of jobs. Critics argued that the corporation should have developed industrial and office sites which would have attracted small high technology companies and other manufacturing concerns. These would have provided jobs for the main category of unemployed - male manual workers. The debate about strategy came to a head with the resignation from the board of the MDC in 1989 of Professor Patrick Minford, the monetarist economist, over the MDC's rejection of a project for a power station and deep water jetty at Birkenhead, across the Mersey from Liverpool, at a cost of Pounds 250m and offering the prospect of 1,000 manual jobs. The scheme, which would also have involved the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, was the kind of investment Merseyside needed, Prof Minford argued, providing a growth point to mop up some of the unemployed. He contended that 60,000 unemployed men were not about to join the tourist industry as waiters and barmen. The MDC rejected the project because it conflicted with the upmarket image it was trying to develop for the waterfront on both sides of the Mersey. In this, the MDC also had an argument, for since that low point its record has improved. Private sector investment is now put at Pounds 250m - just slightly more than the cumulative total of government expenditure. Although much of this is accounted for by investment in residential property, the MDC has also secured its first big office relocations: Customs and Excise is building an office block to accommodate 2,000 staff eventually, and the Inland Revenue is also moving into the MDC area with several hundred jobs. In addition, the site of the 1984 International Garden Festival site has been reopened again, and looks like flourishing as a leisure centre. For all these reasons, Mr Farrow does not feel he faces a hopeless task and says that there is definite, committed investment in the pipeline. 'It is true that the levels of attainment were not very good in the 1980s, but my predecessors did not stand a chance. The political climate was hostile to any kind of investment,' he says. Mr Farrow adds that all the councils on Merseyside and not just Liverpool realise that something must be done to give the area a boost. 'All the councils and the private sector are now pointing in the right direction.' A recent visit to the eastern seaboard in the US with industrialists and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic created great interest, he says. The turning point came in 1988, Mr Farrow believes. 'The government had a chance to close the development corporation down then. Instead, it increased the corporation's area from 800 to 2,400 acres. This was a sure sign it was going to keep the corporation going beyond the original 10 years. We now have a new chairman in Sir Desmond Pitcher, the chief executive of Littlewoods, and a new management team,' he says. Like other development corporations, the MDC owns some land and has planning powers over all its area. Besides the Liverpool waterfront, the corporation's area covers Birkenhead across the Mersey and parts of New Brighton, the seaside resort on the Wirral peninsula. Mr Farrow says there are 1,000 acres which could be developed. 'Merseyside is not going to attract a company such as Toyota or Honda, capable of employing thousands because there is not the room in the corporation's area. But there will be 10- and 15-acre sites where smaller businesses could come.' The keys to attracting investment are the strategic waterfront sites close to the Albert Dock and Pier Head, places like Prince's Dock, Queen's Dock and George's Dock. 'There is room for 3m sq ft of development on these prime sites. There will be office development and also what Merseyside is proving itself very good at - tourism and leisure facilities.' Mr Farrow envisages that the number of jobs within the corporation's area could almost double from a current 35,000 to 60,000, with many of these jobs coming from the service industries. 'Liverpool is very competitive in terms of wages and property costs. It is now where Glasgow was in l980. The political climate is improved and there are lots of cultural attractions which are not known about. Liverpool has more listed buildings than Bath,' he says. Mr Farrow does not put a time scale on when the investment will arrive but believes the sites will be developed in the 1990s despite the continuing recession. He is supported in his view by Mr Trevor Furlong, the managing director of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. His company, which owns Prince's Dock, has received planning permission from the corporation to develop 1.5m sq ft of offices there in conjunction with P&amp;O. 'We are not building speculatively. We are only going to build for pre-lets. But I feel confident there will be the demand for these offices,' Mr Furlong says. Originally a critic of the corporation for concentrating on what he calls 'cosmetics', Mr Furlong now feels that small companies in services and even manufacturing will want to come to Merseyside. He believes it will take about five years for Prince's Dock to be built and let or sold. Even Prof Minford has changed his mind somewhat. He feels that the male manual workers which concerned him three years ago are now exporting themselves to work as far afield as Warrington and Widnes and even London, while Liverpool is beginning to pick itself up through the growth in service industries. He worries that Merseyside will lag behind as the UK recovers from recession, but says the underlying economic situation in Merseyside is looking better than it was.</p>

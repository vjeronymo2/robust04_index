			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Ibragim Shukurov: "Peace Policy: Results of the </F> Working Visit of Azerbaijani President Gaydar Aliyev to Turkey  9-10 June"]    [Text] Istanbul-Baku--Istanbul is a giant maze of  streets, pierced, like steel needles, by bridges, avenues, and  expressways. A city in which two continents are neighbors and  the elemental forces of two seas meet.... Only from a birds' eye  view did it acquire for me the clarity and completeness of its  quaintly subdividing formation. Looking out the aircraft window  at Istanbul, which was turning pinkish in the rays of the  setting sun, I finally understood where was Asia, and where was  Europe, where the Black Sea, and where the Sea of Marmora, where  the Bosphorus, and where the Golden Horn.... Truly, great things  are seen from afar!    The dimensions of the working visit to Turkey of  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev also revealed themselves in  all their fullness after a certain interval of time. It was  later, in Baku, when a number of important summit meetings had  been held, that the import and the logic of the visit become  clear.    The most complex situation that has come about in Azerbaijan  as a result of the Armenian aggression, the search for ways to  achieve a just and all-embracing peace, the return of the  occupied territories to the bosom of Azerbaijan, and the  creation of sure guarantees of the safety of the peaceful  population in these parts, the settlement of certain questions  of military cooperation with Russia, and the strengthening of  partner relations with countries of East and West, which implies  not only political alliances but also the realization of joint  economic projects--this in summarized form constituted the  purposes and tasks of Geydar Aliyev's visit to Turkey.    It was truly a working visit, in the sense that it was  filled  to the maximum with meetings, conversations, and consultations  on the most important policy issues.    The work began at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, even, where  the  president of Azerbaijan was met by Turkish President Suleyman  Demirel. The leaders of the two countries issued a statement for  journalists representing newspapers and agencies of Turkey,  Azerbaijan, and a number of other countries.    Both leaders noted how great the danger of an expansion of  the boundaries of the military conflict unleashed by Armenia  was. According to Geydar Aliyev, its inordinate territorial  claims are creating a threat to peace and security throughout  the region. Today the focal point of the war is blazing in  Azerbaijan, but there is no guarantee that it will not tomorrow  spread to contiguous countries. In this situation not only  Azerbaijan but all states of the region are concerned to see a  stimulation of the efforts of the CSCE and other European and  international organizations aimed at interdicting the aggressor.    This speech to the journalists set the tone for the whole  series of Geydar Aliyev's meetings, which took place at a time  when the North Atlantic Cooperation Council was in session. The  city on the Bosphorus was greeting many important guests at that  time. An Azerbaijani delegation, headed by Foreign Minister  Gasan Gasanov had also arrived for a CSCE [as published] Council  session.    Politicians of many countries sought meetings with Geydar  Aliyev. The limited time of his stay in Turkey constricted,  naturally, the range of persons with whom the leader of the  republic had a dialogue. But the choice of partners was not  fortuitous, it was dictated by both tactical and strategic tasks  of grand policy.    On the first day of his stay in Turkey, the president of  Azerbaijan received at his residence in the Sheraton Hotel  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who had initiated the  meeting. They dealt with the situation in the zone of combat  operations, problems of a humanitarian nature, and the prospects  of cooperation in the economy, particularly in the oil industry.  Both sides emphasized the importance of contacts and the  continuation of political consultations for the resolution of  Azerbaijan's main problem--a winding down of hostilities on the  territory of the republic, the restoration of peace, and  people's return to their native haunts. Peace in the region is  the goal and the condition and the means of Azerbaijan's  cooperation with foreign countries.    The same day the president met with Gen. Dogan Gures, chief  of the General Staff of Turkey's armed forces.    The second day of the visit contained a full program. At  nine  in the morning the president met in his rooms Swedish Foreign  Minister Margaretha af Ugglas. Geydar Aliyev greeted his guest  warmly. He said, in particular, that he valued highly her work  as chairman of the CSCE and her efforts for a settlement of the  Armenian- Azerbaijani conflict.    "The problems have, unfortunately, become even more  complex,"  Geydar Aliyev said, "but I am once again counting on the support  of the CSCE. I hope that the authority that you have gained in  Europe and the efforts of your compatriot Jan Eliasson, who is  currently head of the Minsk Group, will permit the achievement  of the desired results."    Margaretha af Ugglas thanked Geydar Aliyev for the high  evaluation of her work as leader of the CSCE. She said that she  was pleased to have the meeting and recalled with great  satisfaction her stay in Baku. "I realize," she declared, "that  not all problems have been resolved, but I am reassured by the  fact that the Minsk Group is headed by the experienced diplomat  Eliasson. He is in productive contact not only with both sides  but also with Moscow, where he recently held important meetings."    A key event of the program of President Geydar Aliyev's  visit  was his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.  It took place at the Ciragan Hotel, in which the session of the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council was being held at this time.    Experienced politicians, Geydar Aliyev and Warren  Christopher, having exchanged greetings and pleasantries,  immediately got down to an ascertainment of positions in the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. President Geydar Aliyev  enumerated the problems that Azerbaijan had encountered in the  course of the Armenian aggression that has been going on for six  years now. He said that as a result of the Armenian offensive,  20 percent of Azerbaijani territory had been occupied and that  the republic had 1.2 million refugees.    "I believe," Geydar Aliyev said, "that the war should be  brought to an end. Since I became president, I have sought a  settlement of the conflict by peaceful means. We have cooperated  with the CSCE and its Minsk Group and with the United Nations  from the very outset. As you know, the Security Council has  adopted four resolutions demanding an immediate withdrawal of  forces from the captured Azerbaijani territory. The Armenian  side is not complying with these resolutions. I would like to be  completely sincere: The hopes that we placed in the CSCE have  yet to be justified. The Minsk Group has been unable in four  years, unfortunately, to do anything of substance.    "We would like to see a stimulation of the activity of the  CSCE and the Minsk Group and are very much counting on the  support of the United States here. It seems to me that a  principal condition of a settlement of the conflict is the  active position of the United States in untying its knots."    In his answering remarks, Warren Christopher thanked Geydar  Aliyev for the information and for the "graphic," as he put it,  presentation of the picture of the conflict. The secretary of  state observed that the United States supported Azerbaijan's  peace initiatives. The leadership of his country was impressed  by the fact that the republic was working with the CSCE and was  helping realize the peacemaking program being undertaken by this  organization. "We will always support your commitment to the  CSCE," Warren Christopher declared.    He sounded out Azerbaijan's readiness to agree, up to  certain  limits, to compromise and could see for himself that our peace  initiatives are not an empty declaration, they are backed by  practical actions, which could in the future be even more  vigorous. W. Christopher emphasized the importance for a  strengthening of Azerbaijan's economy of the signing of the oil  contracts. Concluding the conversation, W. Christopher assured  the leader of Azerbaijan that the United States would do  everything to ensure that the conferees and interested parties  operate within the framework of international standards.    The foreign ministers of Turkey and Azerbaijan--Hikmet Cetin  and Gasan Gasanov--and state counselors Vafa Gulizade and Gabil  Guseynli took part in the meeting.    Ninety minutes later there was a meeting in the same hotel  with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. It pursued the  accomplishment of a two-in-one task: on the one hand outlining a  program of cooperation with Greece, and on the other, entering  into contact with the European Union, of which this country is  the chairman.    "Our states," Geydar Aliyev said, opening the meeting, "have  good prospects for the development of bilateral relations.  Considering their geopolitical location, climatic features, and  historical traditions, Azerbaijan and Greece have good  opportunities for fruitful cooperation. It has long been time to  determine spheres of partnership and prepare the corresponding  documents."    Touching on the subject of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict,  the president said that it is attended by great sacrifices. They  are being borne, in the main, by Azerbaijan, on whose territory  the hostilities are taking place.    "Our goal," Geydar Aliyev emphasized, "is to achieve a  ceasefire and the liberation of the captured territories. The  European Union could, in our view, play its part in a settlement  of the conflict. We want all countries to have objective  information on what is happening in the region. Unfortunately,  outside of it the majority believes that both parties to this  conflict are equally to blame. It is extraordinarily important  for us in this situation that the world community know who is  the aggressor, and who the victim. We are counting on your help  here."    Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias agreed with Geydar  Aliyev that the European Union could reinforce the potential of  the peacekeeping force operating in the region.    "The European Union, like Greece also," Karolos Papoulias  declared, "has always been a supporter of disputed questions  being solved at the negotiating table, not with violence. We  cannot be indifferent to the problems of refugees and offer our  services for a halt to an escalation of the conflict. Greece, as  a sovereign state and as the country that heads the European  Union, is ready to cooperate with Azerbaijan."    The search for partners that could help stop the millstones  of war and bring back peace to the lacerated land defined also  the work in Istanbul of Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan  Gasanov. He had a constructive dialogue with FRG Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel, who expressed hope for a stimulation of  efforts for the speediest resolution of the bloody conflict. He  conveyed to G. Gasanov a package of documents that are being  prepared for signature by the NATO partners. Gasan Gasanov's  speech at the session of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  was harmoniously interwoven into the political context of the  president of Azerbaijan's visit.    This speech made it possible once again to contrast the two  concepts of a settlement of the conflict: the Azerbaijani  concept, based on a just peace and a stabilization of the  situation throughout the region and the assurance of guarantees  of security and tranquillity for all, and the Armenian concept,  which is imbued with a spirit of annexationism and national  egocentrism and pursues the goal of digging in at all costs on  territory that has been seized by force.    "Twenty countries have subscribed to the Partnership for  Peace program, and this proves the viability of its underlying  principles and ideas," G. Gasanov said in his speech. "The  Azerbaijani Republic, which was among the first to subscribe to  the program, attaches great significance to the Partnership,  seeing in it big opportunities for influencing the present  situation in my country.    "Azerbaijan has shown in practice repeatedly its commitment  to the principles of a peaceful settlement of conflicts. It  advocates a solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict from  the position of the commonly accepted international standards,  specifying the observance of states' sovereignty and territorial  integrity and the sanctity of their borders and respect for  human rights. But all our efforts to find a peaceful way out of  the deadlocked conflict are running into the power barrier of  the aggressor.    "Flouting the rules of international law, Armenia is  pursuing  a policy of fait accompli in respect to the occupied Azerbaijani  territories. It needs the negotiating process solely to gain  time, which is being used to increase its military presence, dig  in on the occupied Azerbaijani territory, and expand deep into  Azerbaijan."    War and peace in the region, who benefits from an escalation  of the conflict, and the political calculations, for which the  people are paying in blood, were the subject also of the meeting  between Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev and Turkish Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller, which was held at the Yildiz Kosk  residence. This meeting concluded the program of the visit and  summed up, as it were, all that had been done in this time.    Geydar Aliyev focused attention in the conversation on the  threat of an increase in military and political pressure on  Azerbaijan and on the attempt of certain circles to stymie the  negotiating process and isolate the republic from the assistance  of European and international organizations.    Tansu Ciller listened closely to Geydar Aliyev and promised  all- around support for all Azerbaijan's peace initiatives.    There is no doubt that the meeting of Azerbaijani President  Geydar Aliyev and the work of the Azerbaijani delegation at the  session of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council in Istanbul  made obvious and irrefutable for our actual and potential  partners the truth that Azerbaijan aspires to peace and harmony  in the region and calls on Armenia to do likewise. Having fallen  victim to unprecedented aggression, our republic nonetheless  does not thirst for revenge, but is displaying the initiative  for the suppression, finally, by joint efforts of the  conflagration of war.    In our view, the main result of President Geydar Aliyev's  visit to Turkey is that the world community was shown once again  the good will of Azerbaijan and its sincere aspiration to a  termination of the senseless war and to peace as the sole  possibility of human existence.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / The case for an EC constitution One of the most important, but least discussed, of the Maastricht treaty provisions is for an inter-governmental conference in 1996 or thereabouts on the institutional and constitutional arrangements for European union. This conference promises to be more important than Maastricht itself. For it will provide an opportunity to clarify many matters which the treaty left open and to say much more about the purposes and principles of the proposed union. Those who want the EC to be free trading, outward looking and welcoming to new members would be better advised to prepare for this conference than to persevere with a hopeless last-ditch attempt to stop Maastricht ratification. One reason why the political side of Maastricht is such a rag-bag is that it was tagged on to the monetary side at the last moment. Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand decided that monetary union must have a political counterpart, but without thinking through what that should be. There is, however, time for a full public debate before the 1996 conference. This should provide an opportunity to discuss principles before the haggling between governments begins. There is a chance, too, of an agenda not dominated by the power-seeking proclivities of Community institutions. Above all, there should be time to consult with prospective members from Efta and the former Communist countries. But if the opportunity is not to be thrown away, it is important to force politicians and diplomats back to first principles. The characteristic instinct of the British Foreign Office for 'a narrow agenda' could not be more counter-productive. Has that institution not paid a heavy enough price in the whole postwar period for its hostility to general ideas? A European group of academics and other professionals have had the much more imaginative idea of drafting a 'European constitutional settlement'. The work is being co-ordinated by Frank Vibert of the European Policy Forum, a free market but pro-Community body (20 Queen Anne Street, London SW1H 7AA). Not the least important of its draft recommendations is that 'the main content of the union constitution should be accessible to any interested reader'. The existing treaties are impenetrable. Each consists of a series of amendments to its predecessor. Interested citizens are much too dependent on interpretations and summaries by government officials and experts, who, however much they try not to, are bound to introduce their own spin. The proposed constitution would be based on the inviolability of individual liberty. Powers would flow upwards from the people rather than being delegated by government. Above all, the pernicious doctrine of the acquis communautaire would go. Under this the Community holds on to all the powers it has been given and asks for some more. Instead, there would be sunset provision under which policies and powers no longer required would be laid to rest. Sub-groups of countries would be able to adopt, or stay out of, particular policies in place of the grudging opt-outs recently obtained. The new treaty would outlaw methods of agricultural support disruptive to international trade and would allow direct cash subsidies to farmers to be operated at a national level. Committee members disagreed about a Community currency but agreed that a core group of countries should be able to go it alone. They also agreed that citizens and companies would have the right to use any member or non-member's currency, which would be recognised for tax and accounting purposes. A Community currency would have to make its way through its own virtues. The draft needs further work. It reads too much like a generalised charter for limited government without specifying why or how it applies specifically to Europe. Moreover, it risks unnecessarily alienating opinion by challenging sacred doctrines, such as 'an ever closer union', which mean whatever we want them to mean. And, although nearly all committee members are from outside the UK, there are hardly any with a communautaire background - among whom a few limited-government liberals can indeed be found, if one searches with a powerful enough microscope. What however distinguishes the Vibert group from the mass of Euro-sceptics, at least in the UK, is that its members do not set up a god of national sovereignty to rival that of Brussels. Instead, they are suspicious of all government and - unlike British Tory administrations - want to bring it down to the lowest possible level. Such ideas might once have seemed either utopian or old fashioned. But they happen to meet the bill when we are considering a Europe of over 20 countries with highly divergent institutions and levels of economic development.</p>

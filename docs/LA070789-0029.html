			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSENFIELD HITS NO-FAULT PLAN  </P> <P> Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of Voter Revolt, sponsor of Proposition 103, said  Thursday that if a new no-fault insurance initiative is placed on the  California ballot next year, he may sponsor an initiative "to establish a  publicly run, nonprofit corporation to offer auto insurance in California on an  exclusive basis."  </P> <P> "If the insurers refuse to obey the will of the public, if they refuse to  cooperate but instead choose the path of confrontation, they will lose the  privilege of serving California consumers altogether," said Rosenfield, who  explained that the initiative would bar private auto insurers from the  California market.  </P> <P> He issued his statement in response to a report in Thursday's Times quoting  Allstate Insurance Co. officials as saying that they may join in a coalition  with consumers and minority groups to promote a no-frills, no-fault automobile  insurance proposal on the 1990 ballot, if the California Legislature refuses to  act to establish one this year.  </P> <P> Rosenfield, whose organization is closely aligned with trial lawyers in  opposing no-fault and defending the present system of litigating many accident  claims, castigated Allstate for "suggesting it is ready to push another  no-fault initiative, just seven months after voters rejected such an approach  (in 1988) by overwhelming margins."  </P> <P> Four Canadian provinces have government auto insurance, but no American state  has such a system.  </P></p>

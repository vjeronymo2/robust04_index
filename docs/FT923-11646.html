			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Hurd tries to defuse EC-UN row over Bosnia MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, flew to New York last night in an attempt to defuse a row between the United Nations and the EC over their peacemaking roles in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Britain holds the presidency of the EC. Mr Hurd's trip followed the publication yesterday of a report by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, to the Security Council, advising it to reject the EC ceasefire plan for Bosnia. The plan was agreed by the country's three warring parties in London last Friday under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington. Mr Hurd will attempt in talks with Mr Boutros Ghali to restore EC-UN co-operation and save the EC's peace conference on Yugoslavia. Mr Boutros Ghali said in his report that the necessary conditions did not exist for him to recommend acceptance of the request that the UN should supervise the heavy weapons of the combatants. He had already criticised the EC and the Security Council in a letter to members of the Council on Tuesday, which complained that they took no account of the practical difficulties faced by the UN on the ground when they gave their political orders. Mr Boutros Ghali's report cited questions of principle as well as practical reasons for opposing the weapons supervision operation by the UN in Bosnia. The London ceasefire agreement raised the whole question of the relationship between the UN and regional organisations, such as the EC, in the maintenance of peace and security. The relevant chapter of the UN Charter says the Security Council could, in certain circumstances, make use of regional organisations or agencies. 'There is no provision for the reverse to occur,' the report said, clearly referring to the EC peace conference's demand for the UN to monitor heavy weapons in Bosnia. In reply to the UN secretary-general's criticisms, Lord Carrington has repeatedly stressed that the EC peace conference merely made a 'request' to the UN. Moreover, that request came from the warring parties and could not therefore be described as his own or the EC's 'plan'. Mr Boutros Ghali said the additional functions which the UN protection force had been asked to perform were 'beyond the present operational and logistical capability of the UN.' Diplomats at the UN have been plyaing down reports of a rift with the EC and do not see a constitutional crisis at the UN. There have been some suggestions that Mr Boutros Ghali may see the affair as an opportunity to press for more funds from UN members. SPD demands withdrawal of German destroyer, Page 2</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Washington bank group attacks Polish debt deal THE decision by the Paris Club of creditor governments to forgive at least half Poland's debt is unhelpful for the stability of the international financial system, the Institute of International Finance, the Washington-based group which promotes the views of international banks, said yesterday. Mr Horst Schulmann, IIF managing director, described the forgiving of Poland's debts as foreign aid through the back door. It would lead other debtor governments to seek similar treatment, he said, suggesting it would contribute to the breakdown of order in international finance. He also criticised the pressure on banks to match the Paris Club. 'In contrast to governments, banks cannot be in the aid business,' he said. This pressure was one of two developments over the past six months - the other being the continued growth of interest arrears owed by developing countries to commercial banks - which were damaging the prospects for flows of private capital to middle-income countries, he said. The IIF calculated that interest arrears owed to banks grew to Dollars 26.8bn (Pounds 14.9bn) at the end of March, from about Dollars 18bn six months earlier. The figure includes Dollars 9.5bn owed in interest by Brazil, which reached a preliminary agreement with banks on clearing Dollars 8bn of interest arrears this month - an agreement which must be ratified by Brazil's senate and 95 per cent of creditor banks. Mr Schulmann said the fact that some countries were allowed to build up arrears while others, particularly in Asia, did not, showed a double standard. Financial institutions should refuse all new loans to countries in arrears until they have an effective agreement to eliminate them. He called on finance ministers, in Washington this week for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, to address three issues: the global capital shortage, which could not be managed merely by lowering interest rates; interest arrears by debtor countries; and the growing 'moral hazard' in the international financial system, epitomised by the Polish debt forgiveness deal.

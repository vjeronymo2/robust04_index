			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Latecomers, time's up: An appointment is a contract which is breached by unpunctuality If I was given the opportunity to expunge a single human vice, it would be unpunctuality. Vice is not too strong a word for it. We are talking here about something that is selfish, damaging and - since this is a business newspaper - expensive. And there are few vices that can claim to be all three. That may sound a bit strong, coming from a member of a profession which is notorious for its inability to keep appointments. But even journalists know the value of punctuality. There would not be much in today's newspaper if they did not. The world divides into people who are punctual and those who are not, and the gulf between them is gapingly wide. Speaking as a member of the first group, I can explain why I resent unpunctuality, but I can only make a biased guess at what goes on in the mind of a habitually unpunctual person. Punctual people find it impossible to understand how anyone can bear to be late - how, indeed, anyone can imagine that there is any alternative to arriving on time, other, perhaps, than arriving five minutes early. They are probably born that way. That would explain the rush of anger they feel at other people's lateness. But let us try to rationalise this feeling for a moment. Punctuality is partly about manners. It is rude to turn up late because it inconveniences the person you are meeting. An appointment is a form of contract which is breached by unpunctuality. And it is a particularly personal form of contract because it involves the physical presence of both parties. The argument that punctuality is essentially a social virtue is reinforced rather than weakened by the fact that some nations consist entirely of unpunctual people. In countries where it is customary to turn up half an hour late, the code still exists; it merely has 30 minutes built into it. But punctuality is also about order and economy, both of which make the world go round. Unpunctuality is about anarchy and waste, which are destructive. Unpunctuality is also corrosive. It destroys punctual habits in other people - as in the case of regular meetings which always start late because a few people persistently fail to show up on time. Eventually, everyone rolls up late. Part of the resentment that punctual people feel stems, I think, from the sense of injustice that unpunctuality creates. If punctual people believe that civil behaviour demands that people arrive on time, the same code obliges them to deal civilly with late arrivals, no matter how strongly they resent them. Thus: Scene: Two punctual people, A and B, sitting at a meeting table, waiting for third person, C. A: (looking at watch): 'He's a quarter of an hour late.' B: 'Shall we start without him?' A: 'Give him five more minutes.' Enter C in a flurry of lateness. C: 'Gosh I'm sorry I'm so late.' A and B (in unison): 'Not at all. Difficult morning?' C: 'Terrible. Been waiting long?' A: 'No, only a few minutes.' This scene illustrates two things. One is that unpunctual behaviour triumphs. The other is that the unpunctual person is never made fully aware of the inconvenience he has caused. He therefore never corrects his fault. There is nothing to be lost from being unpunctual. Unpunctual people seldom think of themselves as such. Insofar as I can understand them, they seem to think that punctuality is a sign of pettiness, of warped values. They have trouble linking it with notions of selfishness or anti-social behaviour. People will doubtless resent the moral-sounding tone of this article. Unfortunately, the punctual habit brings no sense of righteousness, no moral glow. It is in many ways a curse: it condemns you to a lifetime of anxiety, to a gut-tightening dread of delay - all overlaid by the sense of frustration I have already alluded to. Maybe punctual people are at fault for not dealing more severely with late people. Their tolerance prevents a kind of Darwinian process from breeding out the unpunctual habit. What society needs is a sanction which penalises unpunctuality. But it is not easy. Unpunctual people have little sense of shame, and they can usually judge how strongly their presence is required. Therefore there is no point in being forthright with them, or in trying to shut them out. The answer must lie in inconveniencing latecomers in some way, to irritate them or make them feel excluded: such as removing all empty chairs from a meeting room at the appointed time. I'm sure there's scope for some constructive suggestions here.</p>

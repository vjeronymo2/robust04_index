			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Anti-Maastricht ghosts rise up to wreak polls vengeance A picked scab never heals. This has been the theory on which Mr Philippe de Villiers has been working ever since his anti-Maastricht cause lost the French referendum by a whisker in September 1992. And on Sunday he triumphed. His Other Europe list scored 12.3 per cent in Sunday's French Euro-election to put himself and 12 other anti-Maastrichters, including Sir James Goldsmith, into the Strasbourg Parliament. His success was not entirely unique. In Denmark two anti-European movements, the June Movement and the People's Movement Against the EU, rose from 18.9 to 25.5 per cent of the vote - a result that is expected to leave Denmark digging in its heels against further European integration. And in Belgium, the Flemish extremist party Vlaams Blok, and the National Front in Wallonia saw their support surge. But it is France that the anti-Maastricht surge has been most vigorous and most startling - not least because of the maverick persona of Mr Villiers himself. After the 1992 referendum, better-known leaders of the French anti-Maastricht movement went on to hold office; Mr Charles Pasqua became interior minister and Mr Philippe Seguin president of the National Assembly, posts which inevitably led them to muzzle their residual opposition to the controversial treaty. But Mr de Villiers, a deputy nominally within the pro-European centre-right UDF federation, never stopped picking away at the division over Europe that the referendum revealed. He wrote a book called Our Europe with Maastricht. He formed a supporters' club called 'Combat pour les Valeurs' whose main credo is the fight against Brussels and sought alliances with like-minded defenders of the nation-state in other European countries. But special reasons contributed to his success at home. First, the Other Europe provided an outlet for conservative French Euro-sceptics who saw none of their views reflected in the joint pro-Maastricht list presented by the UDF-RPR governing parties. Second, while the only strong base of aristocratic Mr de Villiers - full name: Philippe Le Jolis de Villiers de Saintignon - is in the rural, royalist Vendee on the west coast, his list had others of national pulling power. Number two on it was Sir James Goldsmith, whose book The Trap of Gatt evidently endeared him to unreconciled opponents of the world trade accords. The next pair on the list were Mr Charles de Gaulle, the late general's grandson whose public diffidence was far outweighed by his name recognition, and Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a former magistrate who won campaign headlines by attacking corruption. The third factor was that Sir James' presence on the list gave it virtually unlimited finance. An Other Europe spokeswoman said yesterday the list had received 'money from the public as well as that of (Sir James) Goldsmith', whose Gulfstream jet she said had also been useful in the campaign. An official of the National Committee for Campaign and Political Finance, which oversees French election funding, explained yesterday that while outsider contributors were limited to gifts of FFr500,000 (Pounds 58,500), a candidate could contribute up to FFr85m (Pounds 1m) to his or her list.</p>

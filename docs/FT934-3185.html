			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Mediators forced to drop plan for all-party Bosnia talks International mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg yesterday abandoned plans to resume all-party talks on Bosnia's partition after secret meetings with Serb leaders in Belgrade failed to achieve a breakthrough. Mr John Mills, spokesman for the peace talks, said the mediators 'hoped to be in a position' to reconvene talks among the three warring communities in the week beginning December 20. However, Commission officials said President Slobodan Milosevic was using the European Union plan, which Lord Owen is promoting as the basis for a settlement, to press for a division of Sarajevo. The plan links a progressive lifting of sanctions against Serbia with some territorial gains for the Moslems. Mr Hans Van den Broek, EU external political affairs commissioner, yesterday warned that Serb territorial claims on Sarjevo risked creating 'a second Berlin or Beirut' in Europe. The EU must not be party to the division of Sarajevo in the Geneva peace talks, he said. It was a matter of principle, since Sarejevo remained an example of a multi-ethnic city in Bosnia. The peace negotiators faced a difficult dilemma in their effort to reach a settlement, and the EU could not object to an agreement signed by all the parties. But he noted that the Bosnian Moslems were negotiating 'with a gun to their head'. His remarks came after a series of bilateral talks which failed to break the deadlock over proposed frontiers of the republic's partition into three ethnic ministates. 'The Serbs apparently did not give enough for the Moslems to be happy enough for them to meet,' said a diplomat. Earlier, diplomats had said that if the talks with Mr Milosevic and his Bosnian Serb proxies went well, the three parties would meet this weekend in Thessaloniki, Greece. However, at yesterday's talks, which Serbian sources said were held at Dobanovci, a military base 30km west of Belgrade, the mediators apparently failed to wring concessions from Serb leaders for their Moslem adversaries. While the mediators press Serb leaders to hand over more land, General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, has ruled out giving up any territory, including the 20 per cent pledged three months ago. But Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, was reported by a Belgrade newspaper yesterday as saying: 'There are real possibilities that the war in former Bosnia-Hercegovina will end in January or February next year, and the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia will follow.'</p>

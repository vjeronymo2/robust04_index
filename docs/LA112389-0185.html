			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ATOMIC-FREE ZONE  </P> <P> Recently Australia asked for the resumption of close political and military  ties with New Zealand, but the plea was snubbed by Secretary of State James A.  Baker and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney.  </P> <P> Baker said the Wellington government's continued refusal to permit U.S.  nuclear-powered ships to call at New Zealand ports undermined basic U.S.  defense strategy.  </P> <P> New Zealand is right not to want nuclear-powered vessels at its ports. One of  the few nuclear-free zones left on this earth is the South Pacific. In order to  annihilate the threat of a nuclear war we need more countries in the world that  will stand up for arms reduction.  </P> <P> I commend Australia and New Zealand for their effort.  </P> <P> LINNA RUSTAQI, San Clemente  </P></p>

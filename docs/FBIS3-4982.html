The South decided earlier  to propose to the North that they jointly apply to host the  World Cup, but has not yet conveyed its intention because of  their frozen relations resulting from the North Korean nuclear  problem. South and North Korea on Thursday met at the truce  village of Panmunjom for a working-level contact on exchanging  special envoys.    As soon as South Korea succeeded in qualifying for its third  consecutive World Cup last October -- a first in Asia -- it  launched a full-fledged drive to host the 2002 soccer World Cup.    The preparatory committee seeking to host the World Cup  tournament plans to contact several international sports  organizations including FIFA, soccer's world governing body, and  the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ask them to help  South and North Korea win the right.    The government also plans to propose the creation of a  unified Korean team for this year's Hiroshima Asian Games slated  for October, and resumption of the unification soccer matches  between South and North Korea, when full-fledged inter-Korean  talks begin.</p>

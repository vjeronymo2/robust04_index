			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTER APATHY, DISSATISFACTION  </P> <P> Many cities have strict ordinances restricting the use of signs on public and  private properties.  </P> <P> Yet the same elected public officials who write these laws disregard them at  election time. Most vacant lots, public walls and street poles are plastered  with election signs.  </P> <P> These signs are terrible. Local law enforcement should fine each election  campaign officer who is responsible and have the signs removed.  </P> <P> ED SKEBE  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

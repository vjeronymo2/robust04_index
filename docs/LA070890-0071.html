			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COURTESY TITLE TRENDS  </P> <P> There is a sensible trend in the use of titles for addressing men and women  that should satisfy Lynn Spear Merles (Letters, June 21).  </P> <P> Men have long been addressed as Mr. whether married or single. Addressing all  women as Miss (written Ms. but not pronounced "Mizz") is being used more and  more often. Many women do not want to be called Mrs., and it should not make  any more difference than when addressing men as Mr. W. POWER  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

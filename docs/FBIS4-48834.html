			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Mandela's Overtures to White Community -- "Two weeks into  his  Government's term, [Mandela] seems to be bending over backwards  to accommodate De Klerk and the NP [National Party] in a manner  that has already antagonized many within the ANC in Parliament."  So argues political correspondent Kaizer Nyatsumba in a  commentary published in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27  May on page 16. Mandela, the commentary continues, "is so firmly  committed to allaying the fears -- perceived and real -- of  whites and the business community that he is in danger of soon  finding himself a captive of white South Africa." Nyatsumba  cites as examples of Mandela's efforts to appeal to the white  community his state of the nation address in which he "unveiled  remarkably moderate plans" and Mandela's decision to appoint  Leon Wessels as deputy chairman of the Constitutional Assembly  despite the ANC parliamentary caucus decision to nominate  Bridgit Mabandla to the position. The commentary argues that  there is now a need for "a voice to the left of the ANC...in  Parliament to remind the new ANC-led government of its  responsibility to the black masses." Nyatsumba concludes his  commentary: "For Mandela's own sake, for the ANC's and indeed  the whole country's we must hope our leaders will be able to  combine reconcilatory moves with concrete steps, to send a  message that the lot of blacks will not stay the same, and that  some sacrifices by those who have been beneficiaries of  apartheid in the past will have to be made."  <H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>   KwaZulu Land Deal -- A brief editorial in the Johannesburg  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English on page 28 of its 27 May  to 2  June issue keeps alive the recent KwaZulu land transfer. The  editorial says that while President Mandela, "master unifier  that he is," might have been expected "to play down the  seriousness" of the "secret land deal," no one else has "to fall  in step." The paper sees the incident as "an early test of the  way in which this country will work under the government of  national unity. The government, without effective parliamentary  opposition, will try and brush aside embarrassing conflicts  and...encourage the media to go along with this." "We won't,"  promises the paper.  <H8>  NEW NATION </H8>   100-Day Reform Program Viewed -- "The minutes have started  ticking by since President Nelson Mandela announced his 100-day  reform programme in Parliament this week," begins the  Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 27 May in a page 14  editorial. We "welcome the President's approach in making the  RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] a `people-driven'  process." "This approach played a critical role in giving a  voice to voters' needs and also shaped the programme of action  which was pursued by their leaders. It would be tragic if we  were to fail like the United States of America did during the  presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when the privileged white  community proved unwilling to share their material success with  people of other races." The South African plan should succeed,  however, because it "is aimed at unlocking the energies of the  multitudes who were denied the opportunities given their white  counterparts through the country's draconian apartheid laws."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Mandela's Parliamentary Address Viewed -- "A people-centered  community -- this was the theme and refrain yesterday of  President Nelson Mandela's opening address in Parliament,"  begins a page 12 editorial in Afrikaans in the Johannesburg  BEELD on 25 May. "Freedom and human dignity formed the basis of  the vision offered by Mr. Mandela, and the fact that he  mentioned the word vision confirms that he is aware of his task  -- that is, leading through inspiration. If the New South  Africa accepts these ideals then a good future awaits the people  of this country, and a people-centered community will be  established. Each government must have a philosophy, but that  alone will not create jobs or feed mouths. The real test will  be in the program of action -- the practicality of the policies,  the management, and the good leadership by government in  realizing the above." "Our impression is that President  Mandela's approach reflects a reasonable and sound policy."    Country's Admission to OAU `Positive'-- A second editorial  on  the same page notes that "South Africa's formal admission to the  Organization of African Unity is the fulfillment of a dream.  This will have a positive influence on the country itself, on  southern Africa, as well as in the rest of Africa." "For as  long as whites withheld equal rights from their fellow citizens  this dream would have been impossible to realize. Africa was  often placed in a serious dilemma because of South Africa. The  advantages of technical and economic contact often overcame  ideological aversion to the 'apartheid regime'. In addition to  this Africa was often guilty of worse atrocities than those it  accused the 'regime' of. Now that South Africa is allowed to  fulfill its rightful role, South Africans should not expect too  much, because Africa and the OAU carries very little weight  globally. In befriending the rest of Africa, South Africa  should not neglect its most valuable friend, the West."</p>

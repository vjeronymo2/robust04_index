			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Separate rail talks continue Acas, the conciliation service, said last night that it was continuing separate talks with both sides in the nine-week rail signalling dispute but it was not yet in a position to decide whether joint negotiations could restart. Further talks will be held today through Acas, but there is still no sign of any breakthrough in the industrial conflict between the RMT transport union and Railtrack, the state-owned company running the network. The next disruption on the network is due to start at midnight tomorrow for 24 hours followed by strikes on Monday and Tuesday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata given at a news </F> conference at the prime minister's residence in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] I have decided to resign today. Due to regrettable  circumstances, this cabinet had no choice but to set sail as a  minority coalition government. Though situations at home and  abroad have been turbulent, we have put our energy into  political reform and cooperation, and have challenged important  tasks head-on. It has been of short duration. But we have  acted on the 1994 budget -- in a record short time -- with the  cooperation of both ruling and opposition parties. We have made  preparations for implementation of the political reform-related  laws; and we have tackled with sincerity such difficult issues  as deregulation, economic reform, Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks, and suspected North Korean nuclear programs.    With a society of aged soon to arrive, we have to make  difficult decisions, and we have made appeals to the public in  this regard. We have frankly explained the need for drastic tax  reform in view of growing education costs and other living costs  for the average population. I am sure that government efforts  in these areas have earned the people's support.    I would like to thank the people of the nation once again  for  the understanding and cooperation they have given.    We are now at the crucial point of time in dealing with  various reform programs, such as the implementation of the  political reform-related laws that can begin with the  legislation of a bill for electoral district zoning.    To help the economy make a prompt and steady recovery, the  1994 budget, which was recently passed, needs to be implemented  without loss of time. That action, along with the unemployment  question, is considered important even by other nations.    There are so many things going on at home and abroad. The  Naples Summit is another important event. We have to see what  the so- called Group of 7 industrialized nations and Russia will  want to do at the summit.    When we think about these matters, I realize we must not let  another political vacuum occur. We remember that there was a  blank of 20 days after the Hosokawa Cabinet resigned. It is now  time when the government must do all it can to tackle and take  care of all those issues. As such, I feel it very regrettable  that a no- confidence motion against the cabinet was introduced  at such a time.    But we realize that the government is a minority government.  With so many important issues to be tackled, we have come to see  it is necessary to establish a new and stable government. That  indeed is the most important task right now.    From this perspective and from the viewpoint of enabling the  reform to go on, I have decided to resign as prime minister. I  think I should follow a Diet decision. Dissolving the lower  house could be an alternative. However, that alternative will  result in a vacuum that will last more than a month. I believe  that situation should be avoided under the given conditions.    There are so many things to be done at home and abroad. I  strongly hope that a new government will be able to overcome all  these difficulties, complete political reform efforts, and take  constructive actions on other pending matters.    In living as a politician so far, I have been a man who has  tried to solve problems, thinking I should sacrifice myself if  necessary. The targets or programs I am after now may be  numerous, but I feel I again contribute to Japan in this regard,  by sacrificing myself here. That is how I have come to this  decision.    I may be leaving the government. Mr. Shizuo Inaba, my mentor  who so earnestly called for reform in this country, wrote me  when I was named prime minister: Mind should be as firm as a  rock.    It is with this resolve that I and my colleagues will try to  answer the call for political and other reforms. We will do  everything possible and give up everything to do so.    What I want to say in conclusion is that it is now time for  us -- the existing group [kiseiso] of politicians -- to leave  [the political scene]. If the present kind of condition  continues in this nation, there is no doubt distrust in politics  will only grow. We began our endeavors for the political reform  to remove the people's distrust in politics, but to our regret,  the people of this nation are further distancing themselves from  politics.    We should stop all the political fights, and stop fighting  for power. We must really think about the nation and the  Japanese people, the given national situation, and other  countries' expectations of Japan. We must think about these  points and respond to the expectations.    I sincerely hope that all of you who will face the tasks  will  deal with and solve them from this perspective of what we should  do about Japan and what Japan should do in this world.    Once again, I would like to thank all the people of the  nation and all of you [reporters] for support and cooperation  given to me in the past.</p>

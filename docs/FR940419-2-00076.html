The Clinical Chemistry and Toxicology Devices Panel recommendation of approval, with conditions, was made at a November 4, 1991, panel meeting. Approval was originally sought for over-the-counter (OTC) use by the applicant. However, FDA has decided that this panel meeting did not consider various issues, and so the panel will resume deliberating OTC use at a second meeting. As a result of the need for a second panel meeting, the applicant revised the indications for use to reflect a more limited use. After reviewing the recommendation of the Clinical Chemistry and Toxicology Devices Panel, FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) notified the applicant, by letter of January 18, 1994, of the approval of the application. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Petitions for administrative review by May 19, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written requests for copies of the summary of safety and effectiveness data and petitions for administrative review to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Kaiser J.

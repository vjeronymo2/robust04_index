However, I have mixed feelings about the personal attacks in  his speech," the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS) deputies group, Tibor Cabaj, said today.    Deputy premier and honorary chairman of the coalition Slovak  National Party (SNS) Jozef Prokes called the speech of President  Michal Kovac confrontational, saying Kovac should first have  consulted with the government, at least about those parts in  which he spoke about the country's situation. "The government is  responsible for running the country, not the president," he said.</p>

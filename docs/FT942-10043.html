			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Commercial Union rises to Pounds 64m in first quarter Commercial Union yesterday reported it had shed 10 per cent of its motor insurance exposures over the past 12 months, providing further evidence that rate competition is returning to the UK motor insurance market. The figures emerged when CU, the largest of the UK's composite insurance companies, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 64m for the first three months of 1994, an increase of Pounds 48m on the same period of 1993. Mr Cees Schrauwers, UK general manager, said the decision on motor business reflected 'our reluctance to write business purely to defend market share'. CU now insures 595,000 motorists. The group is also reducing its exposure in parts of the London market, such as the specialist market for excess of loss reinsurance, 'where premium rates are being affected by additional capacity'. Like General Accident, which reported a rise in pre-tax profits on Tuesday, CU's results were adversely affected by severe weather claims in the US, while falls in the value of equity and bond investments dented its balance sheet. Shareholders' funds amounted to Pounds 2.25bn at the end of March, compared with Pounds 2.53bn at the end of last year. Mr John Carter, chief executive, singled out a strong performance in the UK 'reflecting favourable market and weather conditions' and improved results in continental Europe as features contributing to the significantly better results in general insurance. Overall life premiums fell to Pounds 508m (Pounds 518m). General insurance premiums rose marginally to Pounds 1.11bn (Pounds 1.09bn). Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 60m (compared with a deficit of Pounds 100m), despite a high level of weather and catastrophe claims in North America which cost Pounds 16m more than last year. Investment income increased to Pounds 87m (Pounds 84m), after a charge for external loan interest of Pounds 5m (Pounds 7m).</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firm close in spite of uncertainty in US markets - Market Report The UK stock market scored a further advance yesterday in spite of some uncertainty with weakness in New York currency and securities markets following unexpectedly strong US payroll figures for last month. Share price trends remained erratic, reflecting uncertain prospects for domestic interest rates but the stock market was encouraged by official actions in the London money markets. The FT-SE 100 Index challenged 3,140 in early trading, largely under the influence of stock index futures, but quickly rebounded to record a 12-point gain. The market then sold off again as US bonds and equities opened sharply off on the news of growth in US July payroll numbers, described as 'unusually strong' by a US Labor Department official, had brought back fears that the Federal Reserve might decide to tighten credit policy. But with British government bonds standing up well to US credit fears the stock market rallied. At the close of business, the FT-SE 100 Index was 17 points up on overnight at 3,167.5. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was in good form again, adding 14.7 to 3,714.9. Yesterday brought a firm close to a highly successful week for the UK equity market which has recorded a gain of around 2.8 per cent on leading market indices. Equities have been encouraged by perceptions that domestic base rates are unlikely to rise for at least a month, in contrast with fears at the end of last week that Bank of England actions in the money markets had pointed the way to immediate action on interest rates. Trading volume slackened a little yesterday, with 579.8m shares traded through the Seaq electronic system, compared with 670.6m on Thursday. Retail, or genuine customer business, in UK equities has remained high this week. Thursday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.4bn, and the average of Pounds 1.38bn for the past five sessions was comfortably within the range of profitable business levels from the viewpoint of the London-based securities industry. These relatively good levels of retail trading volume support a generously optimistic view of market prospects among UK analysts. Although the big investment funds have tended to stay on the sidelines this week, it has been clear that share prices have found support whenever significant levels on the equity charts were challenged. At the close of yesterday's trading session, the UK government bond market was narrowly mixed but this compared well with the weakness in US bonds. Concern that US interest rates may rise soon was tempered by the signs that British, and other European bond markets, may have disengaged from the US fixed interest sector. However, some nervousness is expected this week as further US data is disclosed. Short-dated UK bonds, the most closely linked to base rate prospects, were a shade easier at the close while the longer dates, more closely reflecting future inflation concerns, had gained around  1/4 point. The stock market was again helped by growing convictions that the pharmaceuticals sector may be the arena for a multi-national takeover move. Speculation has been stimulated by the Dollars 8.5bn bid in the US for American Cynamid which has raised asset sights across the global pharmaceuticals industry. The market closed on an optimistic note as the focus continued to turn away from interest rate prospects and towards the benefits of the steady rise in UK corporate earnings and dividends. Some London-based securities houses have raised their year-end forecasts for the UK market over the past fortnight and optimism has remained bright this week as a clutch of large British companies have reported trading progress for the first half of the year.</p>

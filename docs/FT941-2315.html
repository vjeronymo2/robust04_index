			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Self-reliance may soon be put to the test North Korea has preached for years that its ideology of juche (self-reliance) is one of the world's greatest doctrines. It may soon find that principle put to the test if the UN Security Council imposes economic sanctions for Pyongyang's refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities. The self-sufficient nature of North Korea's economy is likely to enable it to withstand several years' sanctions. Analysts also believe sanctions would do little to stop vital food and oil supplies from China and foreign-exchange transfers from Japan. One reason is that North Korea's border with north-eastern China is porous and that Chinese officials would covertly support continued trade even if Beijing would allow a sanctions resolution to pass the Security Council. 'The last thing China wants is to see North Korea collapse on its doorstep and have refugees pour across its border,' said Mr Michael Breen, a North Korean analyst for Merit Communications in Seoul. China accounts for three-fourths of the energy and food supplies imported by North Korea and is Pyongyang's largest trading partner at an estimated Dollars 860m (Pounds 577m) in 1993. Those supplies are important to bridge the shortages that North Korea suffers. Although Japan has said it would support economic sanctions, it may have difficulty in stopping hard-currency transfers, estimated at between Dollars 600m and Dollars 1.8bn, that flow annually from Korean residents living in Japan. 'The remittances might be regarded as humanitarian aid and thus would not be subject to UN sanctions since they are given, at least theoretically, by Korean-Japanese to support their relatives in North Korea,' one South Korean government official explained. Japanese officials have expressed reservations about clamping down on funds to North Korea. They fear that stopping the money transfers would lead to terrorist acts ordered from Pyongyang and carried out by some of the estimated 260,000 pro-North Korean-Japanese. Sanctions would stop North Korea's trade with Japan, its second largest trading partner with an estimated volume of Dollars 480m last year. Trade would cease with Russia and South Korea, North Korea's next largest trading partners, which supply oil and food products. North Korea's arms exports, one of its biggest foreign currency earners, would also be cut off if a naval blockade was imposed. This would lead to a collapse in trade with Iran, which supplies oil in exchange for Scud missiles. Sanctions would eventually take their toll on North Korea if they were rigidly enforced. South Korea estimates that while the North needs 6.6m tonnes of grain to feed its people, it produced only 3.88m tonnes last year due to poor weather and a lack of fertilisers. The country is also running out of anthracite coal, its main source of energy. It produced 29m tonnes last year, far short of the 52m tonnes needed to keep its factories running at full capacity. North Korea could make up the shortfall by drawing on its war reserves of food and oil. Some analysts warn Pyongyang might fulfil its threat of war in response to sanctions, from fear its defence would be weakened if it was forced to use emergency stocks to support the economy.</p>

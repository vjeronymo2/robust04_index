			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Debate set for next week - Northern Ireland UNIONIST and nationalist leaders succeeded yesterday in persuading the government to hold a rare Commons' debate on Northern Ireland next Thursday as part of efforts to encourage political dialogue in the province, Ralph Atkins writes. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, and Mr John Hume, of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, agreed to ask for the debate jointly at a private meeting at Westminster. They are to meet again today in Belfast to discuss how obstacles to formal political negotiations can be overcome. Mr Molyneaux said the three leaders were 'endeavouring diligently' to fulfil a call by Mr John Major for them to find a way of restarting talks. There is no signs yet that any progress has been made, however. Northern Ireland debates are usually related to specific motions - for instance on anti-terrorism measures or renewing powers for 'direct rule'.</p>

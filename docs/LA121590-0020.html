			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFE TO REST MAGIC WITH 23-POINT LEAD  </P> <P> The massacre by the Lakers of the Detroit Pistons was exactly what the Lakers  needed to build the confidence to regain the NBA championship.  </P> <P> But why risk injury to Magic Johnson by putting him back in the game with eight  minutes left and a 23-point lead? Please, Mike Dunleavy, how about giving the  other Lakers a chance to gain valuable experience that will be needed come the  playoffs, and rest the Magic Man? We need him for the next 11 years (well,  that's my Christmas wish).  </P> <P> JONATHAN M. HOGAN  </P> <P> Toluca Lake  </P></p>

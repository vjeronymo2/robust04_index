			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 15 Apr (MENA)--Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres has stated that withdrawal from the Gaza Strip can  be completed within three or four days after the final agreement  with the Palestinians is signed.    In a statement to AL-AHRAM to be published tomorrow, Peres  said that Israel has actually completed the withdrawal of the  major part of its equipment and men from the Strip, and only the  necessary forces to guard the Israeli camps there have remained.    The Israeli foreign minister added that he will meet with  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat next Friday [22 April] in  Bucharest, noting that if tangible progress is made during this  meeting, he will leave with 'Arafat immediately for Cairo.    Peres said that Israel is prepared to respond to President  Husni Mubarak's call from Cairo following his meeting with  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad for reciprocal concessions by  Israel and Syria. The Israeli foreign minister said that Israel  is ready to return the Golan to Syria, but this will depend on  the nature of peace, which Damascus wants. He noted that Syria  still refuses to hold direct, secret talks with Israel.    Peres denied reports about Israel's intention to dominate  the  Middle East economically. He said that Egypt received Israeli  assistance in the agricultural field, and within a few years it  was able to compete with Israel in exporting its agricultural  produce to the countries to which Israel used to export its own  agricultural produce.    Regarding Israeli pressure on the Palestinians to make  concessions, Peres said that Israel is the one that is making  concessions and not the Palestinians. He said that all those  who carried out stabbings against Israelis came from Gaza.    The Israeli foreign minister said that agreement has  actually  been reached regarding the Palestinian force that will operate  in Gaza, and that the date for the deployment of the first group  will be decided by the Palestinian authority. This may take  place at any time after the signing of the agreement. The  remainder of the force can enter after the signing of the final  agreement, which might be ready by the end of this month.    Peres said that it was also agreed with the Palestinians  that  'Arafat and senior officials of his administration can use  helicopters to move between Gaza and Jericho. Agreement is also  being worked out on a number of matters such as identity cards  for the Palestinian citizens, postage stamps, and so forth.</p>

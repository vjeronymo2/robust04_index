			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal Sanchez has  announced the Nicaraguan Government rejects the U.S. State  Department's report on human rights and other topics of national  life regarding our reality. The Nicaraguan foreign minister said  a note will be sent very soon to the U.S. Government rejecting  the report.    [Begin recording] [Leal] We believe the report is not fair.  We find the report unacceptable. It reports things that occurred  in the past, but it tends to imply there is a systematic policy  of human rights violations in our country. We find reports by  Amnesty International and other organizations are more objective  in their analysis.    [Unidentified Reporter] Does the Nicaraguan Government  reject  the part of the report which says that military authorities are  not under civilian control?    [Leal] Well, basically, we cannot accept that either. You  have heard and read the president's speech from 2 December 1993.  What we are trying to do here is institutionalize and  professionalize the Armed Forces. In fact, very soon the  executive branch will be sending the Legislative Assembly a  draft law on the military organization process and social  security for the military.    [Reporter] Does this mean relations with the United States  are not good? Why has the White House drafted a report which  says human rights are being violated in Nicaragua?    [Leal] I do not think relations with the United States will  sour because of the report. We do not agree with the report. We  are not saying violations have stopped. Unfortunately, there are  still cases of human rights violations in our country. The  government is completely convinced and determined, however, to  ensure strict respect for human rights.    [Reporter] Will the government take steps to reject the  report?    [Leal] We are drafting a response to the document,  certainly.  What [U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American  Affairs] Mr. Watson has said in the past few months is  completely different from what the State Department is saying  now. This document, which you should have, relates the cases  that occurred in 1993. It refers, for instance, to  confrontations between recontras and recompas. It refers to  clashes between Sandinists and non-Sandinists, which we all know  have occurred in the rural areas of our country. This does not  mean, however, that the government wants these things to happen.  [end recording]</p>

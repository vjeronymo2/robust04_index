			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA COUNCILWOMAN FEARS RAMPS POSE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST;  </P> <P> CALTRANS: SANDRA L. GENIS SAYS SAN DIEGO FREEWAY IMPROVEMENTS WILL BENEFIT  ARNEL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH EMPLOYS TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONER BRUCE NESTANDE.  HER CONCERNS PUZZLE HIGHWAY OFFICIALS AND NESTANDE.  </P> <P> A Costa Mesa councilwoman said Thursday that an Orange County-based member of  the California Transportation Commission may have a built-in conflict of  interest on matters involving planned freeway ramps in her city.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis said Thursday that she is concerned about planned  on- and off-ramps that will benefit current and planned commercial and  residential projects of Costa Mesa-based Arnel Development Co. next to the  northbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway between Bear Street and Fairview  Road.  </P> <P> Genis said she is concerned that Caltrans in the past has objected to those  ramps but that Arnel Vice President Bruce Nestande, a former county supervisor  and current member of the California Transportation Commission, may try to  persuade the agency to approve them.  </P> <P> Nestande, however, said Thursday that he has "never had anything to do with the  ramp issue" and that it was the city -- not the Arnel firm -- that insisted on  plans for a new ramp that would be built next to Arnel's project on South Coast  Drive.  </P> <P> The Arnel firm has agreed to pay for the ramp improvements to secure city  approval of its development plans, but Genis said Caltrans has opposed  installation of those ramps, partly because they would be too close together  and would chiefly benefit new development in the area.  </P> <P> However, Caltrans engineer Walt Hagen said Thursday that, to his knowledge,  Nestande has never talked to Caltrans about the ramp projects and the agency  does not oppose them.  </P> <P> "We've come up with a system (of ramps) that we think will work," Hagen said.  </P> <P> Hagen added that it's a standing policy of Caltrans to ask cities to come up  with developer or other financing for such improvements.  </P> <P> Told that Caltrans no longer opposes the ramps, Genis said: "See what I mean?  Who got them to back off?"  </P> <P> Hagen said he does not recall a dispute over the ramps and added that all  negotiations have been between Caltrans and Costa Mesa officials.  </P> <P> Genis, meanwhile, clarified comments attributed to her in a story published  Thursday in The Times in which she criticized Nestande's role in recommending  creation of a facilities district and in urging Costa Mesa officials to be more  aggressive in seeking state funds, both of which could save the Arnel firm  money. A facilities district would allow developers to spread their fees for  traffic improvements over 20 to 30 years.  </P> <P> Genis said that she was responding to questions posed by a Times reporter and  that she has no independent knowledge of Nestande's actions.  </P> <P> Nestande had said he remembered making such recommendations to city officials.  But he added that he sees no conflict with his role as a state transportation  commissioner since the decisions affecting Arnel will be made by Caltrans, not  the California Transportation Commission.  </P></p>

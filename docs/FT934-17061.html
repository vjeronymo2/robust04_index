			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Please don't tell anyone . . . - . . . but your life might be insured without your knowing THE UNTIMELY death of a soccer star could affect your business interests severely if the sales of your football boot company relied heavily on his endorsement. And if your brand of fizzy drink would not excite the taste buds without the backing of a famous pop star, you could also lose out if they were to die. Similarly, an accountant or solicitor relying on one person to generate a large proportion of fee income would be wise to seek protection should that individual fall under a bus. But all these cases could benefit from a relatively obscure form of protection known as confidential life assurance. This allows a company - or, in some cases, an individual - to insure the life of someone else without that person being aware that his or her demise would compensate for lost business. But it is usually in the interests of the policyholder to keep such cover secret because the individual insured is normally under some form of contract. Because such cover is open to abuse, it is underwritten by only a handful of select individuals who form a little-known corner of the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Yet, despite seeming to be something of a financial backwater, the business of confidential life assurance is extremely profitable and growing rapidly. The most active provider is Lloyd's syndicate 429, otherwise known as Alder Life. The 180 members, or Names, who made up the syndicate in the 1990 accounting year were told this year they had made profits of 22.3 per cent on their capital. The year before produced a similar rate of return - figures for which many beleaguered Lloyd's Names yearn. No wonder that, since 1987, the total of Names in the syndicate has increased from 78 to the present 319. This performance is not entirely from confidential life assurance; the syndicate is also an important provider of more straightforward individual and group term assurance cover (such as key man assurance). But Kim Rowley, the syndicate's chief underwriter, is convinced that confidential life makes sound business sense for his members. 'It has been profitable to date, but the maximum it represents is 10 per cent of our business,' he says. Insuring the life of others once was common but it resulted in so many murders by beneficiaries that it was outlawed in 1774. The Insurance Act, commonly known as the Gambling Act, introduced the requirement that a life assurance contract could be effected only if an insurable (financial) interest could be proven. The first cases of confidential life cover arose in the US where parties in long court cases insured the life of judges so that, if they died, the costs of any new trial could be met through insurance. Confidential cover differs from conventional life assurance in several important ways. Because of its nature, it cannot be based on any medical data to help assess risk. Thus, syndicate 429 says, premiums are at least three times more expensive than conventional premiums for people up to age 50. Over this, they can increase steeply because of increased mortality risks. Confidential contracts can be taken out for only a year at a time and must then be renewed. This is one way the underwriter can protect his syndicate from heavy losses. 'The nature of the business, running one year at a time, means we do have a degree of protection if we feel the claims are coming in too fast,' says Rowley. Employers thinking about insuring individual staff on a confidential basis can think again. This is one commercial relationship which will always be refused by syndicates such as 429 because of the high risk of abuse, since they will not have access to the employee's medical records. In any case, companies can get much cheaper cover for employees through conventional contracts which require medical underwriting. Where the two parties in a confidential contract are unrelated - say, a solicitor and his client - the underwriters believe the risk of having a claim made against them is much less. A solicitor wanting to insure the life of a client responsible for a large proportion of fee income would first need to prove that he would suffer a financial loss should the individual die and that he was not simply gambling on that particular life. In addition, he would have to prove a justifiable interest; this stops requests for over-inflated sums assured. Thus, if the individual accounted for Pounds 50,000 of fee income, the solicitor could not insure that life for Pounds 10m; a more realistic figure of Pounds 100,000 would be justifiable to the underwriter. In divorce cases, the divorce settlement will be examined closely to establish if confidential cover is justified to protect one spouse's income, normally the wife's, should alimony cease on the death of the ex-husband. The secret of success for syndicates such as 429 is strict underwriting. There has to be an insurable interest and financial justification for the cover to be written. 'These two parameters have to be absolutely watertight. There can be no deviation. There is no room for manoeuvre,' says Rowley. But although he believes confidential life cover will continue to prove good business, he - and others - will continue to err on the side of caution. 'We throw out considerably more applications than we write,' he stresses.</p>

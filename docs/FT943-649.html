			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ashbourne to raise Pounds 50m via flotation Ashbourne Holdings, one of Britain's largest nursing home businesses, yesterday announced plans for a stock market flotation valuing the company at between Pounds 80m and Pounds 90m. The company, born out of a management buy-out from Stakis, the hotels and casino group, aims to wipe out its debts by raising up to Pounds 50m from a placing and open offer. Since the buy-out, its ability to expand has been hampered by net borrowings of Pounds 49m inherited from Stakis, carry-ing interest rates of between 5 per cent and 20 per cent. If fully taken up, the share issue - sponsored by Charterhouse Bank with Cazenove acting as brokers - should enable the group to embark on an ambitious expansion programme. 'Ashbourne has the largest proportion of private patients in the industry and we want to exploit our market share at new sites,' said Mr Tom Hamilton, chief executive. The group, which currently operates 19 nursing homes, is keen to buy building land around London and develop existing sites acquired before Stakis sold the business for Pounds 50m. Further expansion would be funded by up to Pounds 30m of fresh borrowing, of which between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m has been set aside to build three new nursing homes next year. Growing demand for such homes helped lift operating profits from Pounds 4m to Pounds 5.5m in the 12 months to October 3 last year, and Mr Hamilton said profits this year should reach Pounds 6m on turnover of about Pounds 23m (Pounds 21.6m). 'The company has substantial unutilised tax losses which will mean it is unlikely to pay any mainstream corporation tax before 1997,' he added. Mr Hamilton declined, however, to say whether the company's institutional investors - led by Electra Kingsway - had decided to sell their stake as part of the placing and open offer.</p>

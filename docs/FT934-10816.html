			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Waters strong again Water stocks made further rapid progress, building on Monday's solid gains ahead of the important document from the industry watchdog outlining its broad methodology for setting new pricing levels for 1995 to 2000. Worries about the content of the Ofwat document, which is expected to be published in full in July next year, have cast a shadow over the sector in recent weeks. But the market adopted a more relaxed view of the contents of the document yesterday, with a number of the leading brokers of the opinion that most of the bearish factors have already been factored into share prices. SG Warburg's utilities team took the lead in the market yesterday, advising their clients to 'exploit any further weakness by increasing holdings'. Warburg said: 'We expect nothing of fundamental alarm on Thursday to jeopardise our view that an attractive real rate of dividend growth can be sustained through to 2000; at a 130 sector yield relative, any downside on toughening regulation is discounted.' Warburg has projected 'at least 3 per cent real dividend growth from 1995'. Warburg continued to recommend its 'core holdings' in the sector: Severn Trent, 12 higher at 560p, Thames, 4 firmer at 554p, and Southern, 10 stronger at 589p.</p>

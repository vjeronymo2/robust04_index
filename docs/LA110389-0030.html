			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The defense rested its case Thursday in the fraud and tax evasion trial of  Nancy Hoover Hunter. Closing arguments in the lengthy trial will begin today  and last three days.  </P> <P> Hunter concluded her testimony Thursday after nine days on the witness stand in  the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam.  </P> <P> Her attorneys are trying to prove that she was unaware of J. David (Jerry)  Dominelli's fraudulent activities, which led to 1,200 investors losing nearly  $90 million when J. David &amp; Co. collapsed in February, 1984.  </P> <P> The defense claims that Hunter was blinded by love for Dominelli, with whom she  shared a $2-million Rancho Santa Fe home, and could not see through the lies  told to her by the convicted swindler and his close circle of associates.  </P></p>

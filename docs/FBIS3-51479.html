			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Mercedes Feliz] </F>   [Text] In the first nine months of this year, the Income  Tax (ISR) Office collected 3.5365 billion pesos, representing an  increase of 16.5 percent over the comparable period in 1992.    According to the figures provided by this office for the  period between January and September last year, the sum  collected came to a total of 3.035 billion RD [Dominican pesos].    The Income Tax Office has estimated the total to be  collected  throughout the year will be 4.1879 billion RD, so that only  651.4 million RD remain to be collected.    The sums collected are obtained from the income tax imposed  on natural persons, companies, supplementary remuneration, and  withholding agents; from the general sales tax and the tax on  services; from inheritance and gift taxes; and from the taxes on  housing and luxury premises.    In the period between January and September of 1993, the  total collected from natural persons came to 51.2 million RD.  This figure was down 41.5 percent from that for the comparable  period of last year, when the total collected was 87.6 million  RD [sic].    This was the only category in which the sums collected  showed  a decline during the first nine months of this year.    From January to September of 1993, 1.3808 billion RD was  collected from companies. This sum represents an increase of 2.7  percent over the figure for the comparable period in 1992, when  the total collected was 1.344 billion RD.    During the first nine months of this year, the sum collected  from supplementary income was up 150.7 percent, with an increase  from 6.5 million RD for the period between January and September  1992 to 16.3 million RD for the comparable period in 1993.    Between January and September of this year, withholding  agents contributed 977.5 million RD, representing an increase of  15.2 percent over the figure for 1992, when the total was 666.6  million RD.    The total obtained from all income categories was 2.426 RD,  up 15.2 percent from the 1992 total, which was 2.1049 billion RD.    The general sales tax brought in 1.0794 billion RD in the  period between January and September of this year. This  represents an increase of 18.6 percent over the figure for the  comparable period in 1992, when a total of 909.4 million RD was  collected.    The Income Tax Office collected 15.4 million RD in  inheritance and gift taxes. This represents an increase of 71.1  percent over the figure for the comparable period in 1992, when  the total came to nine million RD.    The tax on housing and luxury premises contributed 15.5  million RD in the period between January and September 1993.  This represents an increase of 33.6 percent over the figure for  the comparable period last year, when the sum collected was 11.6  million RD.    Where the ITBI [general sales tax] is concerned, the  authorities have emphasized the need to take action against the  businesses that are collecting this tax from the customers but  failing to pay it into the treasury.    This branch of the Secretariat of State of Finance has  indicated that it is setting in motion a program designed to  effect direct control at the sales outlets of the establishments  suspected of concealing the sums they are taking in.</p>

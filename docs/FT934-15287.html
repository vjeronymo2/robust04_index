			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / 'Wise men' divided on merits of Budget tax increases MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, was urged yesterday to think carefully before raising taxes in the November 30 Budget and to be prepared to cut interest rates to offset any tightening of fiscal policy. In his first meeting with the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters, the so-called 'wise men' were divided on the merits of a further fiscal squeeze in the Budget, with several voicing doubts about the wisdom of tax increases. However, the Bank of England is thought to have suggested tax increases in the Budget rather than additional spending cuts. In a letter to Mr Clarke, the Bank urged the government to take extra action to cut the fiscal deficit. In the past, the Bank has expressed a preference for tightening fiscal policy through spending cuts rather than tax rises and advocated increases in indirect rather than direct taxation when taxes must be raised. By suggesting tax increases, the Bank appears to have accepted Mr Clarke's claim that there is no way the government's pre-set spending target for 1994-95 can be reduced. Mr Clarke's brief meeting with the 'wise men' came as Budget preparations moved into high gear. The chancellor is chairing meetings this week of the EDX cabinet committee, which is struggling to keep public spending in 1994-95 within its preset 'control total' of Pounds 254bn. On Friday, Mr Clarke will be closeted with Treasury ministers and senior officials in the government mansion of Dorneywood to discuss Budget strategy and the economic outlook. Yesterday, the Treasury published its monthly monetary report, which noted that recent economic indicators such as manufacturing output, retail sales and consumer confidence pointed to continuing growth. It contained no clues as to the Treasury's likely Budget judgment and will in any case be overtaken by more up-to-date information on the economy in the next eight days. Mr Clarke has said he will not decide on taxes before November. In his 30-minute meeting with the 'wise men', it emerged that at least two of the panel expressed doubt over whether there should be any fiscal tightening in the Budget. Mr Andrew Sentance of the Confederation of British Industry said the government should cut spending but not raise taxes. He told Mr Clarke of the danger that the recent rise in consumer spending might 'fizzle out' should the chancellor decide on a further tax increase in the next financial year. Other panel members expressed worries about the strength of the recovery. It is understood that Professor Minford of Liverpool University urged Mr Clarke to cut interest rates, held at 6 per cent since January, to boost the recovery. Prof Minford believes monetary relaxation and a low pound could kick the UK economy into substantial growth over the next year without undue inflation. Picture, Page 9</p>

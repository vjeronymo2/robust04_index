			<p>BFN     [Text] During the talks between Carl-Dieter Spranger,  German minister for economic cooperation, who is paying a visit  to our country at the invitation of the Romanian Government, and  Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, the sides approached  aspects of the current stage of bilateral relations with  emphasis on the support that Germany is ready to grant to  accelerate the reform processes in Romania.    The Romanian side stressed the importance it attaches to  developing privileged relations with Germany and showed  gratitude for the support that this country granted Romania  within the European Union and the G-24 in financial and economic  areas, as well as for the support granted to German ethnic  communities in Romania.    According to information from our correspondent Doina  Saiciuc, the German guest stressed that the governmental  framework accord on technical cooperation between Romania and  Germany that he will sign with Romanian Minister of Finance  Florin Georgescu is the first of this kind with a country in  Central and Eastern Europe. One wishes to intensify the support  granted by Germany to Romania to enable Romania to overcome the  difficulties of transition and accelerate the passage to the  market economy.    Spranger conveyed the German Government's wish to intensify  cooperation with Romania in various areas and remarked on the  increasing importance that the German Government grants to  relations with our country. The guest referred to the visits  that the German minister of defense and the federal foreign  minister plan to make to Bucharest in the near future.    In connection with some opinions that have been circulated  lately which reintroduce the idea of differentiation of  treatment applied to associated states in Central Europe and  which imply discrimination against Romania, the German minister  mentioned that the integration into the European Union of  associated countries should take into account economic  performance criteria and not criteria regarding their  association with one group or another.    In a statement after his talks with the Romanian foreign  minister, Spranger stated that his visit to Romania is an  expression of the importance that Germany gives to relations  with our country and of the wish to further expand these  relations. Referring to the visit he is going to make to  projects achieved within the framework of Romanian-German  cooperation program in Sibiu and Arad, where he will hold talks  with representatives of the local authorities and of the German  minority, Spranger noted that discussions will not focus only on  German minority issues but will also take into account the  interests of Romania in general.    A short while ago our correspondent accredited to the  government informed us that a technical cooperation accord was  signed at Victoria Palace between the Romanian and German  Governments. The accord establishes the unfolding of  nonrefundable economic assistance granted by Germany to our  country. The volume of this assistance is about 250 million  German marks. The document was signed by Spranger and Mircea  Cosea, minister of state and chairman of the Council for  Coordination, Strategy, and Economic Reform.</p>

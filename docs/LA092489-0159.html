			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIGHT-PLANE TRAFFIC OVER ORANGE AND L.A. COUNTIES  </P> <P> Re "Small Planes Catch Flak in Orange County" (Sept. 17):  </P> <P> Jeffrey Perlman's article provided clear, comprehensive and objective insight  into the dilemma of general aviation access to John Wayne Airport. Perhaps the  only way to relieve the general aviation contribution to overcrowding at John  Wayne Airport is to provide a realistic, attractive alternative for the more  than 700 small planes based there.  </P> <P> There is an alternative. It is convenient, large, mostly unused, and in  excellent condition: The Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos could draw aircraft from John Wayne, Long Beach and Fullerton. It  is a very large facility with excellent parallel runways and virtually  uninhabited departure paths over the Seal Beach U.S. Naval Weapons Station. The  more than $2 million in annual revenue generated by general aviation at John  Wayne should provide something for Los Alamitos city planners to think about.  </P> <P> There are many joint-use facilities now operating in the western U.S. Klamath  Falls, Ore; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Albuquerque, N.M., and Yuma, Ariz., are  just a few examples of successful joint-use facilities.  </P> <P> STEVEN S.

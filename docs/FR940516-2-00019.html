We are publishing this amendment to the final determination in accordance with 19 CFR 353.28(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The merchandise subject to this investigation is CA flux, other than white, high purity CA flux. This product contains by weight more than 32 percent but less than 65 percent alumina and more than one percent each of iron and silica.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CA flux is currently classifiable under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (HTSUS) subheading 2523.10.0000. Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, the written description of the scope of this investigation remains dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Case History and Amendment of Final Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 735(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), on March 25, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published its final determinations that CA cement, cement clinker and flux from France were being sold at less than fair value (59 FR 14136). Subsequent to the final determinations, we received ministerial error allegations by both petitioner and respondent in these investigations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 8, 1994, Lafarge Fondu International and its U.S. subsidiary Lafarge Calcium Aluminates, Inc. (collectively Lafarge), the sole respondent in these investigations, alleged that the Department made a ministerial error in the final margin calculation for CA cement and clinker. Respondent alleged that the Department ``inadvertently'' used the wrong fixed costs for the period of investigation (POI) to calculate the constructed value (CV) of CA clinker and the foreign manufacturing cost of CA clinker used to allocate profit on U.S. sales of further manufactured CA clinker ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , U.S. sales of CA cement). Specifically, respondent claimed that the Department ``inadvertently'' used the POI fixed costs that Lafarge reported in its initial response to Section D of the Department's questionnaire submitted on August 19, 1994, for its clinker CV and further manufacturing profit calculation. Respondent argued that the Department should have used the revised POI costs that were submitted in a subsequent supplemental questionnaire response dated September 28, 1993, and ultimately verified by the Department after some minor corrections were made based on the information contained in a relevant cost verification exhibit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 20, 1994, we rejected respondent's allegation on the grounds that the alleged error did not constitute a ``ministerial error'' as defined in the Department's regulations. (See April 20, 1994, Memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford from The Team Re. Ministerial Error Allegations.) We stated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice announcing our final determinations that we were ``us[ing] only the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> reported <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  fixed costs for the POI as [best information available] BIA.'' (emphasis added) (See 59 FR 14136, March 25, 1994.) That is, we explicitly chose the cost data that we used. Moreover, respondent alleged a ``ministerial'' error based on our  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> choice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of fixed costs used in the final determination. These are not ``ministerial'' actions. 19 CFR 353.28(d) defines ``ministerial error'' as ``an error in addition, subtraction or other arithmetic function, clerical error resulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional error which the Secretary considers ministerial.'' Contrary to respondent's allegation, the alleged error was neither ``clerical'' nor ``unintentional'' in nature. As our choice of BIA is a methodological issue, this is not an issue of ministerial error properly raised under 19 CFR 353.28.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 12, 1994, we received an allegation from the petitioner, Lehigh Portland Cement Company (Lehigh), that the Department made a ministerial error in the final margin calculation for CA flux. Lehigh alleged that the Department erred by double counting the cost of raw materials used to calculate the foreign manufacturing cost of CA flux for purposes of allocating profit on U.S. sales of further manufactured flux. Specifically, Lehigh alleged that the Department's computer program for calculating the weighted-average dumping margin for CA flux contained an instruction which overstated the cost of foreign manufacture used to calculate profit associated with U.S. further manufacturing because it double counted the cost of raw materials. Petitioner requested that the Department correct this clerical error by deleting the extraneous field from the computer program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree that this alleged error is a ministerial one. Upon re-examination of the final computer program relevant to CA flux, we noted that raw material costs had indeed been inadvertently double counted in the manner described above. Therefore, we have corrected the data in question, and have recalculated the margin in our final determination for CA flux to reflect this correction in accordance with 19 CFR 353.28(c). The corrected margin is 37.93 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the foregoing, the cash deposit or bonding rate for Lafarge is now 37.93 percent. The cash deposit or bonding rate for the ``All Others'' category is also now 37.93 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Suspension of Liquidation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of CA flux from France that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after March 25, 1994, at the revised cash deposit or bonding rates specified above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notification of International Trade Commission (ITC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 735(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), we have notified the ITC of our amended final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This amended determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(d)) and 19 CFR 353.28(c). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 9, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Susan G.

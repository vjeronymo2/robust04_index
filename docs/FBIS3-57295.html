Good Luck!"]    [Text] After two weeks of work, the State Duma took a  breather until 1 February. It was expected that the deputies  would hurry back to their voters to share their first  impressions and hear the initial reactions to their activities  as deputies, but many parliamentarians remained in Moscow. By  no means have all the questions of work and daily life been  settled. Setting up in a new place is a complicated business.  This also applies to the workplace -- who sits where and in  what kind of surroundings. You would not give this job to any  highly paid assistant.    The committee arrangements, now generally completed, give  some idea of the Duma members' aspirations. Let us dwell on two  for the moment. The most densely populated is the Budget,  Taxes, Banks, and Finance Committee. According to the latest  figures, it will have 43 members. "Russia's Choice" and "New  Regional Policy" [NRP] will have the numerical majority, with  nine representatives each. The remaining factions are  represented by between two and four deputies. It is interesting  that before being elected to parliament, 20 of the 43 Duma  members who wanted to make their mark in this sphere of  legislation were directors of small enterprises or trade houses,  chairmen of commercial banks, or presidents of private  investment funds: in short, people who understand budgets,  taxes, banks, and finance. It is also interesting that even the  factions that are ideologically incompatible delegated "private  capital" representatives to the committee. The stratum of  economists is very thin. The conclusion is that the division in  the committee will not be along notorious "monetarist-producer"  or "market-state" lines, but where private and corporative  interests meet. Perhaps this very committee will set an example  of civilized lobbying.    Now a few words about the composition of the Defense  Committee. It has been reported that it is headed by Colonel  Sergey Yushenkov ("Russia's Choice). His deputies are Nikolay  Bezborodov (KPR [Communist Party of Russia]), Yevgeniy Loginov  (LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]), and Aleksandr  Piskunov (NRP). All three are servicemen. The committee  includes four representatives of the NRP, three each from  "Russia's Choice," the Communists, and the LDPR, and one each  from "Women of Russia," the Democratic Party, and the Agrarians.    And the committee is not so large that it cannot be listed  in  full: Vladimir Volkov (history teacher from Orsk), Colonel  General Dmitriy Volkogonov (defense and security adviser to the  Russian Federation president), Andrey Generalov (president of  the trade and industry chamber in Tutayevo), Marina  Dobrovolskaya (chairman of the Union of Navy Women), Georgiy  Lukava (head of department at the Moscow State Technical  University of Civil Aviation), Aleksandr Mikhaylov (chief of the  Russian Federation Agriculture Ministry Main Administration for  Kolkhozes), Colonel General Yuriy Rodionov (Russian Federation  deputy chief military inspector), Yevgeniy Fedorov (serviceman),  Nikolay Fedorov (lawyer), Artur Chilingarov (president of the  Association of Polar Expedition Members), Sergey Churkin  (coordinator of the Vologda LDPR Oblast organization, and  Anatoliy Yaroshenko (director of the "Bolsheurinskoye"  joint-stock company, Bolshaya Urya, Krasnoyarsk Kray).    It is hard to say how efficient these Duma Defense Committee  members will be and how quickly they will set up a legislative  mechanism. One thing is clear, though: All members of the  Defense Committee, and of the other committees, as a matter of  fact, are simply doomed to cooperate. Communists and democrats,  reserve sergeants and generals, the young and the experienced --  they have all committed themselves to providing laws for the  serviceman's life and service and laws that will enable Russia  to defend itself and its interests. So all we military people  can do is wish the new committee normal, efficient work under  the slogan: "Less politics and more laws."</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> TRUSTEES TO STUDY PARKING LOT PLAN  </P> <P> A proposal to build a new parking lot and community playground adjacent to  Camarillo High School will be considered today by the Oxnard Union High School  District Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> The proposed lot, which would be built on about five acres of an 11.89-acre  parcel that would be bought for $3.1 million, would make the journey to and  from Camarillo High School safer for students who drive to school, officials  say.  </P> <P> Students park across the street and must dodge heavy traffic on Mission Oaks  Boulevard to get to classes.  </P> <P> "It's very important in terms of the safety issue," district Business Manager  Bob Brown said of the arking lot. "It's dangerous to have students crossing the  street in the early morning hours when traffic is particularly heavy, and then  again in the afternoon."  </P> <P> No serious accidents near the school have been reported, but Principal Don  Bathgate said he is concerned that the steady stream of traffic on Mission Oaks  Boulevard endangers students' lives. "I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we  don't have a student hit," he said.  </P> <P> If trustees agree to the $6-per-square-foot purchase price, the district hopes  to develop the remaining portion of the land into a community playground and  athletic fields once the parking lot is built.  </P> <P> Negotiations began in 1980 to buy the property from owners James FitzGerald,  Geraldine Chapman FitzGerald, Gerald FitzGerald and Carmelita Nicholson, but  repeatedly stalled over the purchase price. The four agreed to accept the  school district's latest offer.  </P> <P> Certificates of participation to finance the land purchase were issued last  December, Brown said. The trustees will meet at 5 p.m., in the district office,  309 South K St., Oxnard. CAROLYN KUSKY  </P></p>

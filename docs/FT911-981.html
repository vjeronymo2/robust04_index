			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Trusthouse Forte Beware all enterprises that require new clothes, wrote Thoreau. Mr Rocco Forte is clearly not a fan of the Sage of Walden Pond; reclothing Trusthouse Forte will cost Pounds 15m. Still, the name change is the least important part of the operation. More significant - and arguably overdue - is the tidying-up of the company's hotels into neat segments, with disposal planned for those that do not fit. The temptation in such an exercise is of matching your newly-defined market segments to your existing products, rather than the other way around. One would be more confident that Mr Forte had avoided that temptation if his new brands were to be independently managed businesses, not just smart new clothes for the same old hotels division.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SILBERMAN JUDGE REJECTS BID TO DISMISS CASE BECAUSE OF INFORMANT  </P> <P> A federal judge Friday rejected a claim by Richard T. Silberman's lawyers that  FBI agents committed a grave error in building the money-laundering case  against the prominent San Diego businessman by using an informant with a  purportedly lengthy history of violence.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving refused to dismiss the charges against  Silberman because of the use of the informant, Robert Benjamin, even though  defense attorneys had argued that the practice involved "outrageous" government  conduct.  </P> <P> Irving also refused to order prosecutors and FBI agents to turn over to defense  lawyers any more information on Benjamin or to hold a special hearing on the  defense contentions, the judge's law clerk said Friday.  </P> <P> Irving's ruling marked the latest in a series of decisions he has issued over  the past month rejecting every significant pretrial defense effort to strike  any of the seven counts against Silberman, who served as a top aide to  then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.  </P> <P> Silberman, reputed mobster Chris Petti and three other men are accused of  laundering $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent allegedly characterized as the  proceeds of Colombian drug dealing.  </P> <P> Silberman is scheduled to stand trial alone April 25. Petti and the three  others are scheduled to be tried July 17.  </P> <P> At a hearing this week, Silberman's San Francisco-based defense attorneys had  argued that Benjamin, the government's key informant in the case, has such a  lengthy history of threats and violence that the case had to be dismissed.  </P> <P> At the hearing, lawyer James J. Brosnahan said Benjamin's record of violence  dates to 1969, called him "psychotic, schizophrenic (and) dangerous" and  claimed it was a gross error to use him against Silberman, who has no criminal  record.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder, the lead prosecutor in the case, said  at the hearing that Brosnahan's allegations were largely "wild allegations"  that were based on claims from Benjamin's ex-wife and stepson. Prosecutors  believe that neither is particularly credible, Gorder said.  </P> <P> It was through Benjamin, a convicted felon who had become a cooperating witness  for the FBI, that Silberman met the undercover FBI agent, according to  prosecutors.  </P> <P> Irving said at the hearing that he was not prepared to rule at the time because  both Brosnahan and Gorder had given him new material about Benjamin to review.  On Friday, Irving called both lawyers and informally told them he was rejecting  the defense contentions, adding that he would file a formal written order  later, the judge's law clerk said.  </P> <P> The clerk did not elaborate on the reasons behind the ruling.  </P> <P> Brosnahan declined to comment on Irving's ruling. Gorder could not be reached  for comment.  </P> <P> With the primary defense pretrial motions concluded, the next major hearing in  the case is set for April 10: a defense request to move the trial to Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys contend that Silberman cannot get a fair trial in San Diego  because there has been so much publicity about the case since he was arrested  last April 7 in a Mission Bay hotel room.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Huang Woyun (7806 5257 0061)] </F>   [Text] Chengdu, 18 Apr (XINHUA) -- While inspecting  Sichuan, Qiao Shi, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the National People's  Congress Standing Committee, said emphatically: We should  unswervingly implement measures adopted by the party Central  Committee to deepen the reform and be sober-minded and calm when  approaching and solving specific problems we encounter in our  practical work.    Comrade Qiao Shi inspected Sichuan 13-18 April accompanied  successively by Comrades Xie Shijie, secretary of the Sichuan  provincial party committee; Governor Xiao Yang; Yang Xizong,  chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee;  and Song Baorui, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee. Qiao Shi inspected large and medium state-owned  enterprises and village and town enterprises, and heard work  reports from the Sichuan provincial party committee and the  Chengdu city party committee.    Because this is an important year for the deepening of  reform  in our country, Qiao Shi paid close attention to progress in  implementing reform measures and specific problems in practical  work. He said: Since the last quarter of 1993, we have been  adopting more and stronger reform measures to meet the urgent  need of our situation -- the need to push forward the socialist  modernization drive. We should seize international and domestic  opportunities that are very favorable to our country's  construction as we conscientiously implement the guidelines of  the 14th national party congress and the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and unswervingly implement  reform measures which we have adopted, under the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. Everyone has noticed that these reform  measures have played an important role, reaped initial  successes, and received a good response internationally and  domestically. Of course, a country as big as ours will  definitely face some problems when it carries out extensive,  in-depth reform. We should be sober-minded and calm when facing  these problems. Problems which can be solved quickly should be  solved as soon as possible; problems which cannot be solved at  once should be solved gradually following active efforts to  create the necessary conditions.    Qiao Shi pointed out: We should earnestly strengthen party  leadership in the course of implementing reform measures.  Leaders and cadres at all levels should be honest and observe  self- discipline, oppose corruption, and work diligently in the  interests of the people. They should improve their work style  and do solid work. They should reach out to the grass roots and  masses, conduct detailed investigation and study, be adept at  discerning public sentiment, show concern about the people's  work and well-being, lead the masses in overcoming difficulties  and problems, and push forward all undertakings.    On enterprise reform, particularly that which concerns large  and medium state-owned enterprises, Qiao Shi said emphatically:  Enterprises must be market-oriented. They must invigorate their  operational mechanisms, improve product quality and economic  efficiency, and sharpen their competitiveness. They should  absorb new technologies from abroad and from other places in the  country to effectively upgrade their technologies. We should  create a favorable environment for enterprise reform and  development. We should reduce enterprises' burdens through the  gradual establishment of a social security system, so as to  facilitate efforts to attract investments and skilled personnel.    Qiao Shi said emphatically: We should continue to strengthen  our leadership in agricultural and rural work, and solve, in a  practical manner, problems that have cropped up during  agricultural development. We should gradually increase the  comparative returns accruing to peasants from growing grain,  increase peasants' incomes, and ensure steady growth in the  production of grain, cotton, and edible oils. At the same time,  we should also strive to diversify economic undertakings in line  with the concept of agricultural diversification. A large  country like ours which has a large population has to resort to  macroeconomic regulation and control to achieve long-term and  steady agricultural development. Our vast rural areas will be  more prosperous and developed if we actively develop village and  town enterprises and work hard to strengthen the construction of  small cities and towns on this basis. On the issue of utilizing  surplus rural labor, Qiao Shi said: Besides exporting labor  services and developing village and town enterprises, we should  use a variety of methods to construct infrastructural  facilities, such as repairing roads and water conservancy  facilities, so that more surplus workers can play their roles.  Qiao Shi showed great interest in poverty relief work. He  said: The central authorities have decided to suitably grant  more preferential treatment to the central and western regions  in their policy to aid the poor, and this decision will be  implemented.    Concerning the work of the people's congresses, Qiao Shi  said: The more we deepen the reform and open up wider to the  outside world, the more it is necessary for us to strengthen the  construction of socialist democracy and the legal system. We  should fully enhance the functions of people's congresses at all  levels and strengthen the construction of grass-roots people's  congresses in particular. People's congress deputies enjoy the  whole society's support and attract its attention when they  exercise their power in accordance with the law. Local people's  congresses should earnestly sum up and gradually spread the good  experiences they gained while carrying out legislative and  supervisory work.    During his inspection, Qiao Shi visited the Sichuan  provincial museum and other cultural establishments. He said:  In the course of socialist modernization, we should draw on  what is good in foreign cultures and carry forward and promote  our country's splendid national culture; we should create a new  and more splendid culture on this basis.    Qiao Shi said: Sichuan has its own superiorities, as well as  qualities unmatched by other localities. It has made gratifying  achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization in recent  years. I believe under the leadership of its provincial party  committee and government and through the industrious and  innovative work of its vast number of cadres and people, Sichuan  will make even greater progress in all its undertakings.</p>

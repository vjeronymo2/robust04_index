			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (9): Setting for an Opel - Westward investment / Kaiserslautern on the Rhine DAVID HERMAN, chairman of Adam Opel, is not a man to sit quietly and brood about the frustrations and disadvantages of manufacturing in Germany. Since he arrived to take charge at General Motors' brightest subsidiary this year, he has missed few opportunities - on a speaking platform or in interviews - to grumble about absenteeism, high labour costs and inflexible working practices. And yet there he was in mid-August announcing that a DM500m investment in diesel engine manufacture, employing 475 and with capacity for 250,000 low-emission power units a year, was to be made in the company's Rhineland Palatinate plant at Kaiserslautern in preference to nine other options including the UK, Australia and Hungary. The decision was, he proclaimed, a signal that Opel still had faith in Standort Deutschland. Apart from the 14 per cent contribution to the cost from the federal and regional governments and the European Community regional fund (the Rhineland Palatinate is being especially hard hit by the withdrawal of US forces from Germany), there were plenty of sound and logical strategic and commercial reasons why Kaiserslautern should be the natural first choice. Employing more than 5,000, it has been built up since opening in 1966 as a main supplier of important components to Opel group factories - including Vauxhall and Saab - all over the world. Its staple output of engines, body parts, plastics, and rear axles was expanded in 1989 by the start of drive-shaft production. Power-assisted steering units joined the range in June this year. Because of previous rationalisation, the site had the necessary space available together with a reserve pool of experienced and skilled engineers. But the clincher was a benchmark agreement with the workers' council in which group working was bundled together with other ideas relatively new to Germany. As a result, the new production facilities will run round-the-clock for five days a week, uninterrupted by the customary stoppages for shift changes and breaks. Maintenance work will be carried out on Saturdays as a part of the normal working week. While none of the elements in the package can be described as new to manufacturing practice, their combination and implementation in western Germany marked something of a break-through. Starting on a greenfield site with ample job-hungry former employees of the old Wartburg works on hand, management was able to introduce US/Japanese-style working practices from the start. As a result, the plant, open for just over a year, has just hired a further 500 workers to man a third shift. This made only a small dent in eastern Germany's unemployment figures, but it was a notable achievement in a sector which has been preoccupied for most of this year with arranging short-time working and job cuts. The Kaiserslautern deal did not go unnoticed among hard-liners elsewhere in the motor industry. It was denounced from Wolfsburg, headquarters of the rival Volkswagen group, as an 'attack on the economic structure of Germany'. Opel officials thought that was 'a funny thing to say' - especially since Mr Jurgen Gebhardt, the former plant manager at Eisenach, who did all the negotiations with the workforce, was promptly poached and made a main board director at VW's Audi subsidiary.</p>

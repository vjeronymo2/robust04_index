			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Tottenham Hotspur produces Pounds 773,000 Tottenham Hotspur, the north London football club, yesterday announced a special interim dividend of 3p and reported profits of Pounds 773,000 for the three months to August 31. There are no comparative figures - which are for the parent company only - as the quarterly results were prepared solely for the special interim. Last year, the parent reported a loss of Pounds 122,000 for the 12 months to May 31. The special dividend was made possible by the transfer from the share premium account.</p>

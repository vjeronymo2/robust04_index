			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, April 26 (AFP) -- Nigeria will import 103,000  metric tons of petrol this week in a special operation aimed at  combatting the nation's worst fuel shortage in recent years, an  official statement said Tuesday [26 April].    Out of this total, 63,000 metric tons will serve Lagos, some  states located in south-western part of the country, central and  north-western part of the country, the Nigerian National  Petroleum Corporation said in an official statement, a copy of  which was delivered Tuesday to AFP.    The remaining 40,000 tons would be destined for the eastern  part of the country, where there is "a lean stock", said the  text, signed by the official spokesman of the NNPC, Edem Duke.    More imports have also been ordered for next month to  augment  supplies to the southwestern part of the country, where Lagos,  the nation's economic capital, accounts for more than 60 percent  of vehicles in the country.    In addition to the imports, a substantial quantity from the  two refineries in Port Harcourt will be used to service the  eastern part.    The old Port Harcourt refinery with a capacity of about  150,000 barrels per day, which has been down for about four  years due to fire that damaged some parts of it, is now  operating at 64 percent capacity, while the new one, located  alongside the other, is now functioning at full capacity, said  the same statement.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAY'S SUIT AGAINST BOY SCOUTS  </P> <P> I am appalled at your editorial!  </P> <P> To imply that homosexuals should be afforded the opportunity to lead and  provide example for young Boy Scouts because not all "gays" are sexually  promiscuous or active in proselytizing "their" lifestyles is as unconscionable  as it is absolute rubbish.  </P> <P> Regardless of the vocal numbers of homosexuals demanding equality in all facets  of life, I think that it is time for The Times to reflect the needs of all  society and draw the line. The Scout director said it best, "Homosexuality and  boy scouting are not compatible."  </P> <P> MICHAEL W. RANDALL  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Estates  </P></p>

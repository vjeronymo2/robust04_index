			<p>BFN     [Text] A bill to outlaw the Party of Democratic Kampuchea  [PDK] will be presented to the National Assembly for approval in  early July. National Assembly Chairman Samdech Chea Sim says he  hopes all members of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of  Cambodia will support this bill to place the PDK outside of the  Royal Government's laws. Approval or disapproval of the bill  requires a two-thirds vote.    The Royal Government had considered presenting this bill to  the National Assembly for a decision (?at its special session)  but postponed it because His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman,  king of the Kingdom of Cambodia, wanted to pursue the peace  negotiations.</p>

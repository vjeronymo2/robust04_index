			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Spain tries to slim its over-weight peseta THE MARKETS were not convinced that last night's decision by Madrid to lift its last remaining controls on capital outflows would seriously weaken the peseta. With official interest rates at 13.5 per cent and inflation at 5.9 per cent, the currency will remain Europe's most attractive, it seems, whatever administrative measures Madrid takes to make it otherwise. Spain is now suffering its most uncomfortable moments since entering the European monetary system in June 1989. The peseta's strength has forced the Bank of Spain to intervene more in the markets this year than in all previous 18 months together. The pickle is of its own making. When the peseta went into the EMS, the government wanted it strong to cheapen imports and force local suppliers to compete. But demand was so strong then it did not have to. And even the imposition of 10 per cent limits on bank credit growth has served only to punish, not educate. Since the restriction was lifted at the end of 1990, private credit growth has soared again to 21.5 per cent. The decision yesterday to allow Spaniards to open foreign currency accounts with banks at home may encourage outflows of capital big enough to take some presure off. But not much. By limiting the accounts to Spain, the government is trying to avoid a massive flight of untaxed 'black money' - of which there could be up to Dollars 50bn in Spain. That outflow is unlikely to happen now. Also lifting the restriction permitting banks to lend only 50 per cent of their convertible peseta deposits to non-residents is not going to make many waves. Nevertheless, apart from one control designed to discourage short-term foreign borrowing by residents, Spain has now entirely shed its once impressive range of capital controls. Earlier this year it disposed of an irritating barrier which forced any Spaniard borrowing cheaply abroad to deposit 30 per cent of the loan, interest free, with the Bank of Spain. In the past 12 months a similar rule on bank borrowing abroad has been dropped, and non-residents are now being paid interest on convertible peseta deposits of more than Pta10m (Pounds 54,000). Foreigners are also now allowed to do repurchase deals on government securities. Lifting the restrictions has doubtless helped feed Spain's chronic appetite for foreign capital to finance its currrent account deficits. Withholding tax on Treasury bills was lifted at the beginning of the year and the Treasury is speeding up repayment of withholding tax on bonds to encourage foreign buyers. Paradoxically, perhaps, the liberalisation of the Spanish economy has done little more than make the currency more attractive. Since the beginning of this year alone, the value of government bonds held by foreigners has tripled to Dollars 12bn. The reason remains the fact that Spain has the highest real interest rates in Europe and the reasonable expectation that inflation will fall further. The markets are convinced interest rates will have to fall soon, which was probably why yesterday's capital control measures were taken so lightly.</p>

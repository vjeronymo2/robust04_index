			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Steiner resigns from Amstrad Mr Bernard Steiner, Amstrad's sales and marketing director, yesterday resigned from the consumer electronic group run by Mr Alan Sugar 'to persue other interests.' The company gave no other explanation for Mr Steiner's sudden departure which was said to be 'amicable.' Mr Sugar, Amstrad's founder and chairman, originally recruited Mr Steiner from Sansui Electronics in 1991 to take charge of Amstrad's sales and marketing in mainland Europe and Australia. Mr Steiner, an Italian in his late-40s, was formerly managing director of Sansui Europe. During a long career in the electronics business, he has worked for Olivetti of Italy, where he was concerned with the Acorn and Triumph Adler business, and for Sony's German subsidiary. He is the latest in a series of resignations from Amstrad in recent years, and these include Mr Peter Thoms, the former finance director, who resigned in July 1992, and Mr Robert Watkins, technical director, who resigned in January 1993. Mr Watkins, who left to join Binatone, the rival electronics group, subsequently returned to take charge of Dancall Radio which Amstrad acquired last September. Amstrad, has been looking for a chief executive for the past 18 months, and is expected to announce an appointment shortly.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Lazar Tomov commentary: "Consensus -- Separately"] </F>   [Text] We have lived finally to see a prudent unity of  thought, and even a noble competition between the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] and the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS].  Of course, by unity of thought we must understand a similar  position on the part of the leaders of the two political poles  in the country on the situation of the Bulgarians in the Western  Outlands [border region of southeastern Serbia populated by  ethnic Bulgarians]. The political consensus on this issue,  which was anticipated for a long time, was inevitable. It is a  positive thing, because after all, the issue preserves the  Bulgarian character of this Yugoslav region populated with  Bulgarians.    Provoked by the unofficial announcement on banning the  Democratic Alliance of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, Filip Dimitrov  and Zhan Videnov immediately reacted. Their statements differed  only on the issues of who should help our compatriots and by  what means.    There can hardly be a serious political force in Bulgaria  that has a different opinion on this issue from the BSP and the  SDS. It was the same 75 years ago, when for a long time no  Bulgarian politician could be found who was prepared to sign the  Treaty of Neuilly [treaty signed on 27 November 1919, by which  Bulgaria ceded territories to Serbia and Greece and lost about  300,000 citizens]. We know what kind of peace it brought to the  Balkans. We could see the consequences in the Western Outlands,  and not only there. One remembers the universal joy that  engulfed the country after the return of Southern Dobrudzha in  1940.    Naturally, we are not speaking about any correction of our  border with Yugoslavia, but about a normal and humane attitude  toward our compatriots in the Western Outlands, as they  requested in the memorandum they addressed to the UN Human  Rights Commission in Geneva.    The SDS and BSP have committed themselves to this demand.  The two political forces are not interested in a political  flirt along patriotic lines, but in real actions in the sphere  of scientific and cultural exchange, and in respecting the  religious freedom and rights according to international  documents. Let us hope that the divided Bulgarian Orthodox  Church will follow the example of the politicians, and that the  Holy Synod (which of the two?) sends Bulgarian priests to the  Western Outlands on time, as the population there has requested.</p>

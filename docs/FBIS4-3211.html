			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Nearly half of all China's state-run enterprises  lost money in the first quarter of this year, according to  official figures released yesterday. A new accounting system  adopted by the State Statistical Bureau to "more accurately  reflect hidden losses" showed that 49.6 percent of the firms  were operating in the red, with total losses in the first three  months reaching 15.7 billion yuan (HK$13.94 billion).    The number of loss-making enterprises last year under the  old  accounting system was 33 percent. But the new tax system had  resulted in many of the previously profitable enterprises now  showing losses, said State Statistical Bureau spokesman Ye Zhen.    Industrial production from the state sector only rose by 2.2  percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period last  year, while overall industrial production increased by 16  percent to 533 billion yuan. The poor economic performance of  the state sector had led to a significant decline in profits and  a dramatic increase in debt defaults, Mr Ye said.    Analysts said the new figures showed just how badly the  state  sector was suffering during the Government's attempts to  institute market orientated reforms. A Western economic analyst  said: "State run enterprises are clearly failing to keep up  with the pace of economic reform. I think the Government will  now be forced to slow down those reforms until the enterprises  are better equipped to deal with the situation. "The  fundamental problem remains the lack of any real social security  system to take care of laid off workers and, until that is put  in place, very little can be achieved."    Despite the dramatic slowdown of growth in the state sector,  the economy as a whole continued to maintain the double digit  growth of the previous two years. The gross domestic product  for the first three months reached 862 billion yuan, a 12.7  percent increase over the same period last year.    Mr Ye pointed out, however, that once seasonal factors such  as the relatively high proportion industrial production to  agricultural production were taken into account, actual growth  could have already slowed down to the Government's target of  about nine to 10 percent.    Inflation, however, remains a major headache for the  Government, and Mr Ye said controlling price rises would be the  primary responsibility for officials at all levels this year.  The national retail price index rose by 20.1 percent in the  first quarter, compared with the same period last year, while  prices in the 35 major towns and cities increased by 24.6  percent.    The highest level of inflation was recorded in Haikou the  capital of Hainan Island, where prices shot up by 34 percent in  the first quarter. Nanjing and Urumqi also recorded inflation  of above 30 percent, while prices in Beijing and Shanghai  increased by 24.1 percent and 23.3 percent respectively.    Urban inflation was primarily driven by rapid increases in  the prices of daily necessities and as such local governments  would conduct regular checks on the prices of food and services  to en sure that inflation was kept at a tolerable level, Mr Ye  said.    He was quick to point out, however, that both urban and  rural  incomes were increasing at a faster rate than inflation. The  average monthly income of urban residents increased by 35.5  percent in the first quarter, or 9.3 percent when inflation was  taken into account, while rural income shot up by 31.1 percent  in the first three months an increase of 13.1 percent in real  terms.    This was the first time in three years that increases in  rural income had outpaced urban income in real terms but Mr Ye  said regional disparities in the level of income continued to  increase. "Because of high price rises in the cities,  particularly increases in food prices, a few low income  households have been unable to make ends meet and are  experiencing difficulties in their lives," he said.</p>

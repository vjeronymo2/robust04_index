			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 KYODO -- Japan has notified China of  the resignation of Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, the Japanese  Embassy said in a statement Monday [9 May].    Japanese consular official Yasuyoshi Ichihashi notified  Chinese Foreign Ministry official Qian Xianglin on Sunday of  Nagano's resignation and the appointment of Hiroshi Nakai as new  justice minister, the statement said.    Ichihashi also conveyed the stance of Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata concerning Japan's involvement in World War II.    "Our past action, including aggression and colonial rule,  caused unbearable suffering and sorrow. It is essential for  each one of us to face history squarely and to share in  determination not to repeat it," Hata was quoted as saying.    Qian was quoted as responding, "I appreciate your  notification and will soon report it to my superior."    Nagano resigned Saturday after causing an uproar over his  comments denying Japan's aggression during World War II and  calling the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese in  Nanjing a "fabrication."</p>

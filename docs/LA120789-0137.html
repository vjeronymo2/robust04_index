			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOUR ARRESTED IN HOLD-UPS OF ALIENS AT BORDER  </P> <P> Four residents of Mexico were arrested early Wednesday morning in connection  with three hold-ups conducted along the international border, San Diego police  said.  </P> <P> The robberies took place at about 3 a.m. on the U.S. side of the border near  the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The Police Department's Border Crime Intervention  Unit, which was patrolling there, made the arrests, police spokesman Bill  Robinson said.  </P> <P> Officers using night-observation equipment watched as four men with knives held  up two separate groups of illegal aliens, Robinson said.

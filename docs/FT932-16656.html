			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / BA joins price war in Europe BRITISH AIRWAYS is cutting the cost of business class fares to Paris, Amsterdam and Helsinki from today with no restriction on the length of stay. Club Europe passengers will save up to Pounds 84 on a return flight to Paris and about Pounds 50 to Amsterdam and Helsinki. The move follows British Midland's decision a week ago to introduce new business class fares on its flights to Paris and Amsterdam, with reduced rates for three-day and other restricted tickets. KLM and Air France quickly offered similar deals on their routes.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / VW seeks ways to curb costs Renewed efforts to drag Volkswagen out of the red will head the agenda at a meeting of the automotive group's supervisory board in Wolfsburg tomorrow. According to independent estimates, the company is heading for a loss of around DM2bn (Pounds 700m) this year and faces renewed challenges in 1994, when its key domestic market is expected to shrink by at least 5 per cent. Tomorrow's discussions will revolve around a draft agreement with unions, expected last night, to reduce labour costs by temporarily introducing a four-day week in VW's six German factories. But the group chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, is also expected to seek approval for cuts of around a third in his medium-term investment programme. He will also be closely questioned on the group's relatively poor showing in Europe this year and his plans for rebuilding its loss-making US and Japanese operations. The circumstances surrounding the Seat subsidiary's unexpected crash into losses of at least DM1.25bn this year will feature prominently in a report prepared by independent auditors, KPMG Deutsche Treuhand, on the orders of Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the watchdog supervisory board. The document, sent to board members yesterday, is believed to blame poor financial controls and reporting systems. Seat's losses, first discovered in late summer, followed the collapse of a new business plan, drawn up on Mr Piech's orders earlier in the year, and designed to generate a break-even result. Analysts suggest the group's 1993 results will be pushed further into the red by the costs of closing Seat's Zona Franca plant in Barcelona. The KPMG report also confirms that investigators have been unable to find any evidence that industrial secrets allegedly stolen from General Motors by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM director and now Mr Piech's top production executive, have been used by VW.</p>

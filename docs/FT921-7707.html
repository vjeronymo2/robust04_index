			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Yugoslavia aid confuses the British A BRITISH Red Cross appeal for eastern Europe, launched at the height of the civil war in Yugoslavia, had failed because the normally generous British could not understand why fellow Europeans were unable to resolve their problems, the aid agency said yesterday. Mr David Wyatt, director of the agency's international division, said that despite harrowing television footage, many Britons, having been on holiday in Yugoslavia and seen how well the people had lived there, believed that 'they're Europeans who should know better'. Donations for aid projects in the former Soviet Union had also been relatively low because the enormous scale of the 'structural emergency' left Britons with the mistaken perception that their contributions would make no difference. Public subscriptions to the appeal for the whole of eastern Europe, described anyway as a 'slow burner', have so far amounted to about Pounds 300,000. In a review of Red Cross work last year, Mr Michael Whitlam, its director general, said a series of disasters saw overseas aid up by 235 per cent over the previous year at almost Pounds 30m. The Red Cross saw no evidence of the charity being hit by 'compassion fatigue', although it suspected the public was being more selective in its donations. The International Red Cross had responded to 30 emergencies in the first six months of the year, compared to the same number for the whole of the previous year.</p>

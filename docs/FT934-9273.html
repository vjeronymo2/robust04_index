			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Big guns come to town: England's relaunched urban renewal agency The launch of the government's urban regeneration agency yesterday under the new name of English Partnerships provides an answer to a puzzle that has been taxing businesses and agencies involved in inner-city regeneration. Which of two contrasting views of its role would prevail? On the one hand, there are the well-known views of Mr Michael Heseltine, who as environment secretary proposed the new agency before the 1992 general election. He had long campaigned for an interventionist English development agency, modelled on similar organisations in Wales and Scotland, which used public money to attract investment into areas of economic decline. Or there was the much more limited role seen for the agency when the less interventionist Mr Michael Howard replaced Mr Heseltine at the environment department. The new orthodoxy tended to describe the agency as 'an urban development corporation on wheels'. Under this much more limited remit, the agency would concentrate on clearing derelict land and putting in infrastructure in urban areas that had not so far been considered important enough to have a UDC of their own. The picture had been muddied, however, by the appointment of Lord Walker, the former cabinet minister, as chairman of the new agency. As secretary of state for Wales between 1987 and 1990, he had converted his job into a high-profile, one-man inward investment agency. Appointed by Mr Heseltine, Lord Walker looked increasingly uncomfortable in the more constrained role envisaged for him by his new political masters. Yesterday's launch showed that it is the vision of Lord Walker and Mr Heseltine that has prevailed. English Partnerships will be more of a development agency than a body devoted to clearing contaminated inner-city sites. Even the choice of title - dropping the 'urban' and assuming responsibility for the whole of England - indicates that the balance of argument has swung back to those who see a far-reaching role for the new organisation. Lord Walker is clear that he is as much interested in winning inward investment as in clearing derelict land. 'Inward investment has transformed the British economy in some sectors,' he told the FT in an interview yesterday. 'My view is that in the next five years, there is going to be the biggest flow of inward investment into Europe ever seen, and this agency can make a contribution to ensuring that a share of that comes to the UK.' Lord Walker also makes clear his desire to work closely with local authorities of all political complexions, after a period in which much Whitehall spending has been directed through local quangos to bypass councils. 'Local authority co-operation is very important to us, and we will want to have a good relationship with them. That will make it easier to get things done quickly and more effectively.' Ministers were unwilling at yesterday's launch of English Partnerships to disclose its funding for next year. With the urban programme already cut from Pounds 1.7bn this year to Pounds 1.4bn next year, there is keen interest in knowing whether the new quango will start under straitened circumstances. Lord Walker is less coy, saying that he expects the total - to be announced in the unified Budget at the end of the month - to be between Pounds 250m and Pounds 300m. If that is so, English Partnerships will have much the same to spend next year as this. And Lord Walker says that he is quite content with what he has so far been offered. 'It is plenty for year one. I will be able to assess what the need is and then go to the government and say what I think is a sensible figure for the next three years. There will be arguments over the amount of money, but I will be able to say that it will produce this level of economic activity and that it is in the Treasury's interest to put that amount of money in.' A strong card in Lord Walker's hand in such negotiations will be the amount of private investment English Partnerships succeeds in levering in, or attracting, with its budget. 'Some projects involving the clearance of land will produce no such additional investment,' he says. 'But in others, I expect public investment to lever in up to nine times as much private investment.' None of this will happen quickly - and Lord Walker is anxious that English Partnerships' success is not judged too soon. 'There will be no impact on regeneration next week or the week after,' he says. 'But I expect to see a real impact after three or four years.'</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Cuba raises prices in dollar shops THE Cuban government has increased by half the prices charged for goods sold in special shops, in its attempts to obtain more foreign currency and shore up the economy. The shops - where goods are sold for dollars - have been especially favoured by Cubans and foreigners in the past fortnight, since the government's announcement of its intention to liberalise the foreign currency regulations, removing the ban on Cubans owning and spending hard currency. A range of consumer goods, including food and electronic appliances, is sold in the dollar shops, but is not available in other shops which deal in Cuban pesos. Cubans who receive funds from relatives abroad have benefited most from the changes. Diplomats in Havana, who used to be the main customers at the dollar shops, said yesterday they expected the price increases to cause a temporary decline in business, but that Cubans with foreign currency would continue to buy there. Cuba's foreign earnings have been hit by a sharp decline in the production of sugar, the main export, because of bad weather and a shortage of fuel, machinery and spare parts. Making it legal for Cubans to own foreign currency and spend it in the special stores, is unlikely to close the anticipated Dollars 500m (Pounds 335.5m) shortfall in sugar earnings.</p>

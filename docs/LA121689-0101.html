			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Bob Shoup, the only coach in the 28 years of Cal Lutheran football, filed an  official grievance with a school faculty committee on Dec. 7, the same day he  was notified of his release from coaching duties.  </P> <P> The university issued a public announcement of Shoup's dismissal Dec. 8.  </P> <P> "It's public knowledge I filed a grievance," said Shoup, who is otherwise  restricted from commenting under rules of confidentiality governing faculty  grievances.  </P> <P> The faculty committee that deals with grievances is a standing committee, and  Jerry Miller, school president, said it "is not an unusual thing" for the  committee to deal with grievances.  </P> <P> Miller, also bound by confidentiality, declined to speculate on whether the  committee would make a binding decision or merely a recommendation.  </P> <P> He also declined to speculate on when a decision would be reached.  </P></p>

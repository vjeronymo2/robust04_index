			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEW TALKS ON U.S. BASES IN PHILIPPINES SET FOR MID-APRIL  </P> <P> Negotiations to extend the stay of U.S. military bases were set for mid-April,  and their success depends on how the United States explains aid cuts, the  foreign secretary said Thursday.  </P> <P> No specific agenda has been set for the preliminary talks, said Foreign  Secretary Raul Manglapus.  </P> <P> "This is an exploratory talk. We don't expect commitments," he said. "We will  have to assess the responses and attitudes of the U.S. government in order to  help us arrive at our own decision."  </P> <P> He said the Philippines is particularly interested in hearing the reasons why  Congress cut $96 million in aid in January.  </P> <P> Some Filipinos consider the reduction a violation of the October, 1988,  agreement under which the United States offered to give the Philippines about  $962 million in the last two years of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, which  expires next year.  </P> <P> The United States maintains Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four other  smaller facilities in the Philippines.  </P></p>

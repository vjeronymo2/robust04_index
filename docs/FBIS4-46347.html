			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has launched a massive man-hunt  operation against the Abu Sayyaf group in connection with the  bombing incident in Zamboanga City, which wounded 32 people.  The Philippine National Police [PNP] ordered the manhunt  following the severe explosion, which took place at around 8:30  P.M. [Philippine time) along Urdaneta and Tomas Claudio Streets  in Zamboanga City. PNP Director for Operation (Sagerico)  Kagawan said that this was probably a tactic of the Abu Sayyaf  group to divert the attention of the military and police from  their continued operations in Sulu.    [Begin Kagawan recording] As of now, about 10 local leaders,  both civilian and military, are negotiating with the Abu Sayyaf  for them to come out and maybe surrender. And of course they  will be accorded due process. [end recording]    Meanwhile, military and police authorities have announced  that they are ready to stop any operations against the Abu  Sayyaf group. This was announced by Kagawan in spite of the  ongoing operation staged by the combined forces of the police  and the military. Based on the latest report, the military and  police have already started besieging the island of Patikul,  where 40 rebels have already been killed -- including one of the  leaders of Abu Sayyaf, who was alleged to be responsible for the  kidnappings in Mindanao -- while government troops suffered six  casualties. Kagawan said that the rebels still have the  opportunity to surrender and enjoy their rights of due process.    [Begin Kagawan recording] It is very logical; it's part of  their strategy. They usually do such things to ease the  pressure there in Patikul. They have to create a diversion,  giving an impression that they also have a sizable force in  Zamboanga so that maybe some of the forces that are utilized  there in Patikul will have to be withdrawn and run after the  perpetrators there in Zamboanga. It's like you dissipate the  forces so that maybe the pressure on you will decrease. [end  recording]</p>

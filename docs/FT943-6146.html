			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Gen Signal to buy Reliance Electric General Signal, the US electrical equipment manufacturer, is set to double its sales with the all-stock acquisition of Cleveland-based Reliance Electric. The deal, valued at Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 844m), heralds a return to growth through acquisition at General Signal, which has spent most of the 1990s selling some of its businesses and reorganising others. Both companies had sales of around Dollars 1.5bn last year, with General Signal reporting after-tax profits of Dollars 89m and Reliance Dollars 15m. General Signal, based in Stamford, Connecticut, once had interests extending to semiconductors and transportation equipment but now specialises in process and electrical control equipment and telecommunications. The acquisition marks the final chapter in the changing ownership of Reliance. Bought by energy group Exxon in 1980, the company was the subject of a leveraged buy-out in 1986 before being taken public in 1992. Since then Citicorp, which backed the buy-out and owned almost half of the company's shares at one point, is thought to have taken its stake to below 20 per cent. Reliance makes industrial motors, generators and transformers, and telecommunications eqipment. Cost savings from merging the two companies' operations would lead to an immediate enhancement in earnings per share next year, said Mr Edmund Carpenter, General Signal's chairman and chief executive. The stock market remained sceptical and marked General Signal's shares down by Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 35 1/2 . In contrast, Reliance Electric's shares jumped Dollars 5 on the news, to close at Dollars 25 7/8 . General Signal said it would issue 0.739 of a share for every share in Reliance Electric, equivalent to around 37m new General Signal shares. The merger would give the company 'significant critical mass in our combined core businesses', said Mr Carpenter. Cost-savings would come from combining purchasing operations, cutting overall general and administrative costs and merging individual operating units, he added.</p>

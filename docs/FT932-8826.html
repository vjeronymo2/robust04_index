			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK property With equities drifting sideways and the gilts market in danger of flooding, fund managers are looking for alternative investments. Such is their dilemma that some even seem prepared to curb their historical aversion to bricks and mortar. Property has been widely viewed as a lumpy illiquid class of asset with a hopeless investment history. But with yields in excess of 9 per cent currently making acquisitions self-financing, property looks enticing. German investors have spotted the opportunity, buying Pounds 687m of UK property last year. Recovery prospects and a gut feel that the bottom of the market must soon be reached may tempt their UK counterparts to follow. Investors, though, want secure retail and industrial sites or high yielding long-lease modern office buildings occupied by blue-chip tenants. The trouble is such properties are scarce; few owners want to sell them. Prices at the top of the market may therefore rebound sharply. The weight of money will then lower yields on prime space stimulating interest in secondary markets. With a strengthening economy and falling unemployment, investors will eventually look to buy for growth rather than yield. Cheaper second-tier assets will then become even more attractive. The theory is fine; the market's practical complexities, though, may still deter. A more flexible means of gaining exposure is buying shares of quoted property companies. But prices have already rallied and few companies seem capable of increasing dividends quickly. Those that are, such as Land Securities, are already trading at a premium to net assets. That, though, may simply prove another prompt to buy the real thing.</p>

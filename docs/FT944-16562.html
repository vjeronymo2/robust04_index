			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Russian defence budget Dollars 79bn Russian defence spending is much higher in real terms than previously estimated, according to new calculations released yesterday by the International Institute of Strategic Studies. The 1994-95 edition of The Military Balance, the London-based think-tank's authoritative annual survey of the armed forces and weapons throughout the world, asserts that 'Russian defence budgets have been effectively static in real terms' since 1992, 'with perhaps a small increase in 1994'. This contradicts assessments of real decline in defence budgets based on the evidence of GDP decline in official statistics - estimates which have been 'cautiously supported' by the International Monetary Fund. The institute has roughly doubled its previous estimates for the 1992 and 1993 Russian defence budgets to Dollars 74.6bn (Pounds 47.2bn) and Dollars 76.6bn, from Dollars 39.7bn and Dollars 29.1bn respectively, by using a new measure of purchasing-power parity. For 1994, it gives a figure of Dollars 79.0bn, adding that 'since the defence budget does not cover all military-related activities, this estimate represents the low end of a range of possible expenditures'. But even this low estimate makes Russian military expenditure 'in real terms substantially higher than that of any country apart from the US', whose 1994 defence outlay is, however, more than three times as high (Dollars 280bn).</p>

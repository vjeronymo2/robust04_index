			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 27 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong, a south  China coastal province, has expanded economic co-operation with  other provinces while forging closer ties with the outside world.    In 1993 alone the province signed 3,209 economic  co-operation  contracts with other provinces. Those which have been carried  out involve a total investment of 23.3 billion yuan and have  produced 13.3 billion yuan in output value, a provincial  official said.    According to the official, over 10,000 enterprises solely  funded by other provinces or jointly invested in by Guangdong  and other provinces have been licensed in Guangdong. Such  ventures make up more than one third of the total in Shenzhen,  Zhuhai and Huizhou, all of which are major industrial cities in  the province.    So far, Guangdong has established a co-operation network  with  five provinces and three cities in central and south China.  Zhaoqing and Zhuhai have developed close co-operation ties with  three cities in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.    As a province which has a shortage of natural resources,  Guangdong has also co-operated with three provinces in the  southwest, which have rich power resources, to build power  stations and railway lines.    The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone has already invested over  five billion yuan in inland provinces to build 500 co-operative  projects. A large number of township enterprises have also  invested in inland provinces to start factories. Guangdong has  invested 2.5 billion yuan in southwest China's Sichuan Province,  the official said.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Let the eastern exports roll A TIME of recession and high unemployment is an unpropitious one to seek to persuade EC governments to liberalise trade with their neighbours to the east of the Community. If, however, the EC's proclamations about helping central and eastern Europe are to be anything more than lip service, a rapid relaxation of trade restrictions is essential. To countries now released from communism's grip, the Community needs to extend the stability and prosperity that it has so successfully nurtured in the west of the continent. Fulfilling this task is in the EC's eminent self-interest. Yet unless the Community provides adequate access for exports from the east, the region's passage into the world of capitalism will be unnecessarily arduous. At the least, setbacks in eastern Europe would deprive EC companies of growth in markets which otherwise can be expected to show lucrative expansion during the next decade. At the worst, should the transition in eastern Europe seriously falter, this could extend far more widely the disruption and chaos already seen in the former territories of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. EC Commission proposals on trade with eastern Europe will be near the top of the agenda at next week's Copenhagen summit. Foreign ministers have already agreed the main points of a plan to accelerate dismantling of barriers for imports of industrial goods, although France and Portugal have succeeded in diluting some parts of the deal. Starting point If they are wise, EC leaders will take the proposals simply as a starting point. The Commission's package retains strong elements of protectionism for goods like steel, textiles and food - precisely the sectors where eastern Europe is most competitive. The common agricultural policy is a substantial hindrance to free trade in farm products. But the EC must pledge to eliminate the remaining hurdles at the earliest possible date. This would match eastern European countries' separate commitment to reshape their economic structures as part of preparations for eventual EC membership. As the region takes painful adjustment measures, it needs to be offered a just reward. The EC's provisions for anti-dumping measures against steel imports, for instance, will be unnecessary as the region, as planned, improves transparency of pricing by bringing in EC-style competition law. Increased sales from eastern Europe in sectors suffering from over-capacity like steel, textiles and fertilisers can accentuate strains on EC enterprises and their workforces. It can also damage EC companies' positions on third markets. But making eastern Europe the scapegoat for general structural and cyclical problems in individual industries is hardly justified. Tiny proportion Imports from the east make up a tiny proportion of the EC's trade. Last year, the EC's combined total of purchases from Bulgaria, the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary, Poland and Romania made up only 1.6 per cent per cent of EC countries' overall import bill. The EC imported more from both Austria (1.9 per cent) and Sweden (2.1 per cent). Since 1988, eastern Europe's gross domestic product has fallen by roughly 20 per cent. Even with the effects of the recession, the EC's GDP this year, by contrast, will be around 8 per cent higher than five years ago. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, eastern countries have expanded exports to the west to compensate for a collapse in sales to the former Comecon area. Yet in recent years the EC's exports to these countries have risen much faster than its imports. As a result, the EC, which up to 1990 registered a trade deficit with the area, is running a substantial surplus. Eastern Europe will suffer for many years the legacy of communist mismanagement. It would be folly to super-impose on this the effect of short-sightedness by a Community which can afford to be more generous. Eastern Europe's efforts at recovery will be largely self-generated. But without a strong helping hand, these countries could slip backwards. Letting them export their produce without restraint to the more prosperous western part of the continent is the most effective way of guarding against this possibility.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Kanemaru out of detention on Y300m bail AFTER three weeks of humiliating detention, Mr Shin Kanemaru, fallen 'godfather' of Japanese politics, returned home yesterday after mustering Y300m (Pounds 1.7m) in bail, a record figure for a politician facing trial. Mr Kanemaru, 78, suffered the further indignity of having hospitals around Tokyo refuse him admission for a check-up, apparently out of a fear his presence would draw unwanted attention from the Japanese media. Hundreds of reporters and photographers tracked his journey from the detention centre, via a typical Tokyo traffic jam, to his home, where Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and Mr Kanemaru's mah-jong partner, was apparently awaiting him. Prosecutors have charged Mr Kanemaru with evading Y119m in tax in 1987 and a further Y920m between 1988 and 1989. The charges are linked to the discovery of about Y6.7bn in gold bars, cash and debentures in his office and home, where some of the gold was hidden under a carpet. He had been in custody since March 6, but the Tokyo District Court ruled that he be released on bail, as he is unlikely to flee the country and is in poor health, suffering from diabetes and several other ailments. The bail application was opposed by prosecutors, who argued that Mr Kanemaru may hide or destroy evidence relevant to their continuing investigation into alleged illegal donations to politicians by the construction industry. About 18 leading contractors have been raided, but no executives have yet been charged. Mr Kanemaru, who had run the largest faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was famed for his close ties to the construction industry, though much of the money he is said to have received is thought to have been passed on down the line to more junior faction members. Senior ministry of justice officials indicated yesterday that no further charges are imminent against other LDP members, suggesting Mr Kanemaru alone could be punished as a warning to other politicians, both government and opposition. The 'godfather's' fall has surprised most Japanese, who presumed last year that prosecutors were intimidated by his reputation and connections. After having admitted that he illegally received Y500m, he was fined a mere Y200,000 and never directly questioned by prosecutors. It is unclear whether the prosecutors intend to pursue cases against the construction companies, which have allegedly divided up public works contracts among themselves in the knowledge that the chosen contractor would have political backing for the bid. Mr Hirotaka Akamatsu, general secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition party, has visited the Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly body, to seek an investigation into alleged bid-rigging uncovered by the prosecutors. The party wants all 'Kanemaru connection' projects studied, and a review of guidelines to the industry, which has announced plans to ensure no further 'misunderstandings' about political links occur.</p>

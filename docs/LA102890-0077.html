			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ART NOTEBOOK: SHE LIKES HER CONCEPTUAL ART WITH A FLAIR FOR INTRIGUE AND  INVENTIVENESS  </P> <P> To enter Sue Spaid Fine Art -- which opened on Beverly Boulevard in June -- you  have to wend your way through the current installation by Los Angeles artist  Thomas Hartman, which spreads across the entire floor. Amid a sinuous mass of  electric cords are 15 white plaster duck derrieres -- as if the birds were  hiding their heads in the floor -- cooled by 15 wildly oscillating fans.  </P> <P> The piece is "a comment on people who have attitudes and opinions about things  -- but they're not explored," Spaid said. The fans, she said, represent the  comforts of our air-conditioned, two-car lifestyles. The artist believes that  everyone's a duck about something, she added.  </P> <P> As an art dealer, Sue Spaid has a predilection for conceptual art, in which the  idea presented by a piece is a prime aesthetic component. Spaid is not terribly  interested, however, in conceptual art for which the idea is all; nor does she  care for that in which originality is downplayed in favor of so-called  appropriation (the borrowing of existing art or media images).  </P> <P> Spaid likes her conceptual art to be experimental in its approach, inventive in  its construction -- and intriguing for the eye, not just the mind.  </P> <P> "I'm really interested in a better blend of style and content," she said.  "There's a lot of art that's conceptual but not visually interesting. If the  art object isn't any more fascinating than a catalogue, then I have a problem  with it. The art object should be more interesting than its picture."  </P> <P> For a recent show titled "C-ouch Pain-tings", artist Carter Potter poured paint  through and otherwise modified a series of eviscerated couches that were hung  on the wall. And her upcoming November show -- of photo realist pastel collages  by Stephen Derrickson -- is meant to subvert recent trends in photographic  appropriation.  </P> <P> Another artist in Spaid's stable is Jacci Den Hartog, whose work includes  two-dimensional pieces made of cast rubber that she calls "rubber drawings."  Through the gallery, Den Hartog is also asking the public to donate items made  of ivory; they will be incorporated into a piece protesting the slaughter of  elephants, which is scheduled for an April show at the gallery.  </P> <P> Spaid -- who has a longstanding interest in art, but who worked on Wall Street  and earned a degree in philosophy while living in New York City -- moved to Los  Angeles a year ago. She picked Beverly Boulevard as a site for her gallery  partly because of her attraction to its Art Deco and other older buildings.  </P> <P> Spaid also chose to keep somewhat unusual hours -- the gallery is open from 1  to 9 p.m. Wednesdays through Sunday -- so that it would be more readily  accessible to those who work weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  </P> <P> "I don't just want rich people," she said. "I couldn't imagine who buys art at  4 p.m. on a Tuesday."  </P> <P>  The Thomas Hartman exhibit is on display through today at Sue Spaid Fine Art,  7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 935-6153. Open Wednesday through  Sunday, 1 to 9 p.m.  </P> <P>  ARTNOST: By now the lack of consumer products and even basic foodstuffs on the  shelves of Soviet stores has been widely publicized. But since last spring, the  Sherberg Gallery and a newly formed organization called Friends of Russian Art  (FORA) have been working to remedy a lesser-known shortage: the lack of basic  art supplies for Russian artists.  </P> <P> FORA is collecting funds and donated art supplies to send to Soviet artists who  need them, said Michael Ayzenberg, owner of the Sherberg Gallery, which  specializes in 20th-Century Soviet modern art. The gallery held a benefit  exhibition this past summer for FORA, which has also approached  </P> <P> local art-supply stores for help.  </P> <P> "We published an ad in a few Russian publications last spring, saying that this  is to the attention of all artists that have any dream projects they would like  to do but can't because of lack of supplies," Ayzenberg said. "We asked them to  write about themselves and their projects."  </P> <P> Ayzenberg said his representatives in the Soviet Union received thousands of  responses, many requesting such apparently basic materials as canvas for a  painting and a pack of oil paints.  </P> <P> Ayzenberg said that in a year or so, FORA hopes all the art produced with the  donated supplies will be assembled in an exhibition that will tour six cities  in the United States, along with Toronto and Tokyo.  </P> <P> "There are no such things as art supply stores in Russia," said Ayzenberg, who  moved from the Soviet Union to the United States 11 years ago and was a  psychology major at UCLA, a law student and an investment banker before  co-founding the Sherberg Gallery with artist Zinovy Shersher last year.  </P> <P> Ayzenberg says the gallery has paintings done on stretched potato sacking  instead of canvas. "There are places where artists can get brushes, but it's so  limited," he said. "I brought one artist to an art store here, and he didn't  know what the use was for three-quarters of the things in the store."  </P> <P> Most Soviet artists, Ayzenberg said, have to try to get paint through  connections or through the black market. Ironically, he noted, "They have real  gold leaf in abundance. But not black paint, not brown paint."  </P> <P> Under glasnost, Ayzenberg said, artists have the freedom to paint what they  please. And the FORA effort has the support both of the Soviet artists' union  and of the Soviet Minister of Culture, Tair Salakov, according to Ayzenberg.  </P> <P> Does he see the art supply drive as political? "Of course it's political," he  said. "But it's not the point that I'm a Russian trying to help my compatriots  -- It's the American public helping the Russian. It is one of the many things  that will strengthen the political situation and ties -- a very small fragment  of a much larger picture."  </P> <P>  Friends of Russian Art (FORA), through the Sherberg Gallery, 665 N. La Cienega  Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 652-0814. Open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m to 6  p.m.  </P> <P>  CHARACTER STUDY: Even before she took to dying her hair purple in the 1930s,  Elise Cavanna Seeds Armitage Welton -- known simply as Elise -- was a  strikingly colorful personality. She was more than 6 feet tall. She had studied  dance with Isadora Duncan, performed with the Ziegfeld Follies, served as  something of a straight woman for W. C. Fields. She was friendly with the  photographer Edward Weston and with the poet E.E. Cummings. During World War  II, she worked in an aircraft factory.  </P> <P> But Elise also was a pioneer in the Los Angeles art world -- an important one  who is ripe for rediscovery, according to a retrospective now at the Turner  Dailey gallery.  </P> <P> "She was one of the very first abstract artists in L.A.," said Victoria Dailey,  co-owner of Turner Dailey. "While everyone else was painting eucalyptus trees,  she was doing inventive abstractions."  </P> <P> Elise, who died in 1963, exhibited geometric abstractions at the 1939 World's  Fair. Later, she moved in the direction of a more lyrically abstract painting.  And in the late 1940s and early 1950s, she joined with artists Lorser  Feitelson, Helen Lundeberg and Stephen Longstreet to show as a group called  Functionists West. (A show of Lorser Feitelson's work is on view at the Tobey  C. Moss Gallery through Oct. 31.)  </P> <P> "Mainly, their philosophy was that interesting art was going on in the West, in  addition to New York," Dailey said. "But they had a hard time exhibiting here  -- there was a lot of resistance."  </P> <P> Just by being herself, Elise apparently advanced the cause. "She was such a  breath of new air -- she really brought the modern movement to Los Angeles,"  Dailey said. "Not just her art but her personality combined to make people  notice."  </P> <P>  "Elise," through Nov. 3 at Turner Dailey, 7220 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles.  (213) 931-1185. Open Wednesday through Friday 11 a.m to 5 p.m. and Saturday  noon to 5 p.m.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Belem, Brazil, 7 Jun (EFE) -- Brazilian  President Itamar Franco stated here today that he is in favor of  the OAS studying the readmission of Cuba, which is the only  country that has been excluded from the organization.    Franco returned today to Brasilia after attending the  opening  of the 24th OAS General Assembly, which is due to close on 10  June. He said: "The OAS must look at the Cuban situation."  [passage omitted]    In his speech at the OAS plenary, Brazilian Foreign Minister  Celso Amorim stated that he has observed positive signs of a  democratic reform in Cuba, which must be both deepened and  encouraged.    Amorim, who is a 52-year-old career diplomat, said: "We have  expectations for democratic progress in that country, with which  Brazil maintains friendly relations and major cultural ties."    The head of Brazilian diplomacy added that "we do not view  economic and political isolation as the best way to contribute  to promoting a transition that is already in the making."    On 6 June, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo  proposed at the OAS plenary session that the OAS undertake  negotiations aimed at promoting democratization with the Havana  government and with all other parties concerned.</p>

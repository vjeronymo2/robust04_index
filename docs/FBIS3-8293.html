			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Wojciech Jaruzelski by Maciej </F> Lukasiewicz; place and date not given: "Not All of the World's  Sins; How Did It Happen?"]    [Text] We continue with our exchange of opinions on  the reality of the Third Republic. Did the shift to the left  that occurred on 19 September of last year and the bitter defeat  by Solidarity-derived parties result from mistakes by new  political elites, were they a price that was paid for the  radical reforms, or were they linked to broader processes  occurring in postcommunist countries? What will Poland's  political and economic future be like? What will happen next?  And, above all, how did it happen that political parties  deriving from the period of the Polish People's Republic [PRL]  managed to return to power? These are the topics we would like  to be the subject of common reflection.    So far, the following people have spoken out: Jerzy  Holzer, Zdzislaw Najder, Tomasz Lubienski, Kazimierz Orlos, Jan  Maria Rokita, Aleksander Hall, Stefan Bratkowski, Jerzy  Surdykowski, Kazimierz Dziewanowski, Jozef Oleksy, Jerzy  Giedroyc, Krzysztof Kozlowski, Aleksander Luczak, Slawomir  Siwek, Aleksander Jerzy Wieczorkowski, and Marek Garztecki. Our  interviewee today is General Wojciech Jaruzelski.    [Lukasiewicz] Did you expect a change of guard on 19  September of last year, and do you think that society, by  voting, really was motivated by a yearning for the lost  communist paradise?    [Jaruzelski] Let us begin with the paradise aspect. I do  not know how it is up in heaven, but, as far as earth is  concerned, nobody has ever succeeded in establishing a paradise  here, nor will anybody succeed in doing so in the future. And  that also applies to a capitalist paradise. It is precisely the  illusion that the rejection of "communism" will make life better  almost automatically for everybody and regarding everything that  became one of the main reasons for social frustration and  discontent. Disappointment is the kind of feeling that has the  traits of a boomerang. But this time, it was a yearning not so  much for the past as for the different. Nobody has any doubts  anymore that the so-called real socialism is a closed chapter.  To make it look better in an artificial manner, to try to erase  mistakes, deformations, or anachronisms, would be both immoral  and make no political sense. On the other hand, to ascribe all  of the world's sins to real socialism would be false and  opportunistic, and would also bring results that are the  opposite of what had been intended--among other things, last  year's 19 September election results are an example of that.    Every extremism must lose sooner or later. I knew that once  the pendulum had made its move to one side, it was only a  question of time before it began moving back to the opposite  side--that is almost a regular phenomenon in democratic regimes.  What I did not expect was that it was going to happen so  quickly.    Was that, as you put it, a "change of guard"? Not quite. I  would rather call it a half-turn. It is true that the current  government is, as people often say, center-leftist. A  center-leftist coalition has a big advantage in parliament. But  there is also the president of the Republic of Poland who,  although he tries to maintain a balance and be a patron to all  Poles, clearly has been showing signs of being in favor of the  "right-wing option," especially recently. Also, it is not the  government or the parliament but the president who has a  dominating impact on such key ministries as Defense, Internal  Affairs, and Foreign Affairs. One must also add to that the  so-called fourth power--that is a majority of the mass  media--which rather tends not to have the left wing in its good  books, to put it in subtle terms. The future will show to what  extent the current governing configuration will turn out  permanent or constructive. That will also be a test of a  feeling of responsibility for the country and of democratic  manners by all participants of the political scene. I am  hopeful that this Polish train of ours, although squeaking while  moving and recently even with sparks flying, will eventually  manage to avoid a derailing.    [Lukasiewicz] Postcommunists are returning to power also in  other countries of the former Soviet bloc; their return is also  expected in Hungary in the immediate future. What are the  reasons for that phenomenon, and do you think the postcommunists  will manage to bear responsibility for a consistent process of  continuing with democratic and market reforms?    [Jaruzelski] The term "postcommunist" is currently a  titular kind of phrase, one that is used more as an invective  than as a substantive evaluation. The fact that somebody used  to be a member of a communist party does not have to mean an  uncritical "going back to the sources." Moreover, today many  former members of the Polish United Workers Party [PZPR] are  distancing themselves from the past in a vigorous manner. What  is characteristic in that process is the spectacularity of the  various personal transformations and conversions. As it turns  out, a majority of them havealways been reform-oriented. That  is perhaps not a nice thing from the perspective of political  aesthetics. But, on the other hand, thanks to the wonderful  nature of human memory, I think it is probably also frank. In  that sense, it is also a positive phenomenon because the return  to power of the so-called postcommunists is not something  directly linked to political and economic systems. This is even  more so because the leadership of the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] and the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP]  derives in most cases from a reform-oriented trend within the  former PZPR. My view is that the same, with modifications  taking the party's nature into account, applies also to the  leadership of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which derives from  the United Peasant Accord. After all, they are all definitely  in favor of principles of parliamentary democracy, the market  economy, and guaranteeing all civic freedoms. There is just the  issue of the right instruments, the right proportions, and the  rate of implementation of the process of political and economic  transformations. By the way, from that standpoint, there are  major differences also in the right-wing camp. On certain  issues, some of the right-wing factions are outrightly populist  and extremely left-wing.    The real left wing must be itself. There are certain  socially universal, socialist values that are conformant with  the spirit of a given time and that left-wing parties cannot  abandon if they do not want to lose credibility or commit a  historical discredit. The point is that, while implementing the  necessary and, alas, painful economic reforms, while paying  determinant attention to economic development, which means a  prevalence of creative attitudes over ones that are about making  claims, the point is to at the same time "keep your ear to the  ground," not to overdo it with the reforms, and to constantly  have the supreme social goal in view. That is why I think it is  precisely left-wing, or center-left-wing, forces that have the  biggest chance for an effective implementation of the reforms.  After all, the biggest problem is social resistance. By the  way, that resistance is understandable. The joyous  anesthetization of 4 June 1989 is over. The ongoing pain  inflicted by the operation of reforms caused society to have  rejected the "surgeons" in charge up to now, and also their  elites, which, by the way, also suffered from infighting.  Polish society has a great deal of grievance against the left  wing, especially historical grievance. But society also knows  that the left wing is, by definition and by virtue of the  doctrines it is based on, at the same time more socially  sensitive. That is why the West's reception of the election  results was also quiet. For the West, the most important thing  is stability in this part of Europe. It is precisely the center  left wing that has the greatest chances to alleviate social  unrest linked to the difficult process of transformations. A  decomposition and a premature fall of the center left wing could  bring various solutions to the surface, including extreme  right-wing, populist, autocratic, or even exotic ones. Would  that contribute to a widening of the social basis for the  transformations and, consequently, to increasing the efficiency  of the reforms? I doubt that.    [Lukasiewicz] But how would you assess, generally speaking,  the four years of rule by the "surgeons"? What do you consider  to be the biggest achievement of Solidarity-derived cabinets,  and what do you think were their biggest mistakes? Also, could  they really have avoided the mistakes, when you bear in mind  that we were the first and that there had been no past cases of  "leaving the [communist] system"?    [Jaruzelski] I do not want to sound grandiose or moralizing.  I am a politician of the past, and I am aware of the very  serious deficiencies of the past type of political and economic  regime. I am also aware of my own responsibility, which I have  never tried to evade, nor do I now. I appreciate the historical  meaning of the changes that were accomplished during the four  years. So much has been written about that, both in Poland and  abroad, that it is not easy to say something original on the  topic. Therefore, I will just mention two achievements that in  my view are especially significant. In the social and political  area, it is civic freedoms, broadly speaking. In the economic  area, it is the convertibility of the zloty and the main  consequences of that fact.    Words of my highest appreciation, though, go to the activity  of the Tadeusz Mazowiecki government, which, in essence, was of  a pioneer nature, and also to his personal contribution and his  serious approach. I cannot imagine his making a statement that  the communists ruined Poland more than the Nazis did, or showing  the kind of doctrinal nonchalance toward social problems that  was displayed by [former Prime Minister] Jan Krzysztof Bielecki.  I also cannot imagine Mazowiecki being capable of waging the  kinds of revenge-oriented emotions and file-checking brawls that  were effected by the government of [former Prime Minister] Jan  Olszewski. Finally, I also cannot imagine Mazowiecki displaying  the kind of amazingly self-satisfactory frame of mind, faced  with a difficult situation of social tensions, that was  displayed by Hanna Suchocka's government.    On the other hand, my view is that, all in all, the biggest  mistake by Solidarity-derived governments was this specific  mixture of arrogance and naivete (by the way, from that  perspective, these governments turned out to have a lot in  common with many governments in the PRL). We all know the kind  of message it was based on: We know how to do things best,  there is no alternative to our ideas; only we, from the  Solidarity-derived basis, have the right patent for reforms, and  everybody else is genetically predisposed to be antireform; that  is the line of thinking in a nutshell.    At this point, I would like to take a stand on the view that  we [the Polish people] were the first, and there had been no  past experiences of "leaving the system." As a matter of fact,  we were the "second" in the years 1944-45, inasmuch as the  events of 1917 had taken place before that. And it was  precisely the transfer of those 1917 experiences that was the  main reason for our failures, even if the extent to which those  experiences were implemented in Poland was small and kept  getting ever smaller. Still, recently, when we turned out to be  "the first" this time around, the temptation of imitating  someone else is what prevailed. True, the models were different  and better this time, but still not all of them were  implementable in Poland's situation. The syndrome of a "late  comer" had its toll on the trend to imitate that I just  mentioned, and also a desire to just skip some of the phases and  achieve the standard of living and the way of life being applied  in countries that are more developed than Poland--in particular,  in economic terms. That is how all of the mindless following of  somebody else came about--from Jeffrey Sachs's prescriptions to  the clownery of Valentine's Day.    But it is not possible to ascribe all of the deficiencies  exclusively to the governing elites. After all, these elites  operate within the framework of a social and psychological  situation, to the formation of which they also have contributed  in some way--that must be said. And what was the situation  like? Well, to use a columnist's style for a moment, the common  bread-eaters expected luxury because, after all, the  "communists" are no longer interfering this or that way, or  stealing. Many people had the illusion that a moral revolution  would take place in "our own house," that social pathologies  would subside, and that people would just be better because,  after all, the "communists" are no longer trampling on freedom,  cheating, or showing bad moral examples to the nation. Many of  the so-called independence-oriented activists were convinced  that, once sovereignty was gained, one would be able to teach  Moscow a lesson, while the West would take very good care of us  in political, economic, and military terms.    But that did not materialize. It could not have. And that is  one of the necessary costs of the systemwide transformation, of  that "earthquake" that took place in this part of the globe.  Was it possible to avoid these disappointments? Partially no,  and partially yes. As far as I can recall, it was Schopenhauer  who said that people who complain about their lot should  remember that their fate was mainly shaped by stupid things they  themselves did. It is beyond doubt an extreme view and one  clearly biased toward polemics, but there is something rational  about it. After all, how frequently all of us, former and  current politicians, like to ascribe all failures to a difficult  legacy, a disadvantageous domestic and foreign situation, and  mainly to mistakes committed by our predecessors. And, although  in many cases such a position is justified, it also has a  demobilizing effect in a way and directs our attention to the  past, not to the future.    [Lukasiewicz] I must ask you to provide some of your own  reflections pertaining to your own role and activity: What do  you consider the biggest achievement and the biggest failure in  your own life story?    [Jaruzelski] Is turning 70 years of age not a success? When  one has behind oneself the experience of September 1939, a  deportation to Siberia, a long war-front road of a sniper  officer, and, finally, all of the stress and burden associated  with decades of military service and political activity, there  are reasons to be able to say all of this is a success. But  there is a personal dimension. As far as the greatest political  achievement is concerned, which, by the way, was shared by both  sides of the political barricade and also by church  representatives back then, I regard the "Roundtable" as the  biggest achievement. Finally, I treasure in particular my  military achievements, including 15 years at the post of  national defense minister. It is a source of pride for me that  I commanded a good army. I think, even though it may be viewed  as immodest, that I contributed to securing the Army's combat  capability, taking into account the possibilities and needs back  then. On the basis of that structure, in terms of personnel,  training, and logistics, Poland's defense system is being built  also today (even though the basis has been modified and adapted  to contemporary political and international realities).    And now as to what I regard to be the biggest failure, or  actually a life mistake--speaking in personal terms, it was my  decision to join politics. That put an enormous burden on me,  and it also brought a lot of bitterness. But I would like to  expand my answer a bit here. In my view, in politics one can  speak of defeat in historical dimensions, defeat in strategic  dimensions, and defeat in tactical dimensions. The last kind of  defeat unavoidably accompanies the activity of every government,  to a lesser or greater extent. If a government does not commit  too many of these defeats, and if they do not manage to become a  negative process, they are, of course, not pleasant, but they  still tend not to be a major danger. A historical defeat takes  place when the defeat's all-national impact is of enormous  importance and when it is first of all irreplaceable and also  accompanied by a heavy bloodbath. My conscience is not stained  with a defeat of this kind. And, finally, a strategic defeat:  It does not always have to be linked to a specific decision,  act, or fact. In my view, the fact that I failed to lead to a  national agreement before 13 December 1981 is such a defeat. I  said and wrote a lot about the reasons for that. Right now, I  would just like to air what may be regarded as a controversial  view, but it is one that has been confirmed by life practice:  Martial law was a common defeat. But, however paradoxical that  may also sound, martial law was also a common victory. I am  saying that because, while not ignoring the tragedy that  occurred at the Wujek coal mine or other painful issues and  events, we are not divided by an insurmountable abyss. That  made it possible, going step by step on a winding and rough  road, to come to the "Roundtable" and sign an agreement. What  turned out impossible for domestic and external reasons in 1981  became realistic in 1989.    [Lukasiewicz] I would like to return to martial law for a  moment. You said during a conversation with THE NEW YORK TIMES  last year that, if the situation of 13 years ago was repeated  right now, you would prefer to commit suicide than introduce  martial law again. Why is that?    [Jaruzelski] And tell me, would any sane person want to find  himself again in the same kind of situation, with all of its  nightmare, and be faced with the most dramatic decision of his  life? My statement, which you cited, should be interpreted  precisely in that sense. The statement was about personal and  human aspects. As regards a political assessment of the  decision to introduce martial law, I have presented it on many  occasions, and I find no reason to change it now.    [Lukasiewicz] Some of your colleagues from the past have  been proposing a thesis from time to time--in the context of the  famous theory of "choosing the lesser evil"--that the  "Roundtable" talks and the subsequent changes in Poland would  not have taken place if it had not been for martial law. Do you  share this view, and, if so, my question is: Could it not have  been done sooner? Why did it have to take as long as eight  years?    [Jaruzelski] Yes, I do indeed share the view you mentioned.  After all, the view expresses a knowledge and an awareness of  the fact that martial law prevented a multidimensional disaster.  It is not my intention to diminish the evil--in particular, the  personal harm--that martial law caused. But, on the other hand  and objectively speaking, it also created a chance for the  gradual development of the right conditions for fundamental  changes that occurred later. Attempts to demonstrate that the  introduction of martial law was accompanied by an idea of  surrendering power and paving the way for capitalism in Poland  would of course be ridiculous. But it is true that the  extraordinary measures that were undertaken at the time made it  possible to reduce the extremely high social tensions that were  close to eruption, to maintain the indispensable leadership of  the country, and to prevent economic destruction.    Various types of reform-oriented measures were undertaken to  follow that. It is true that their extent was limited, but it  was not a "black hole," nevertheless. In June 1989, not  everything started from scratch. Also in previous years there  were searches, experiences, embryos, and bridgeheads. We were a  heretic island within the [socialist] bloc, in the  "pre-Gorbachev" years. In the years of perestroyka, Poland  became a testing ground for various tests and measures.  Finally, the "Roundtable" and its consequences occurred as an  incentive and a model for transformations throughout the region.  So one can put it this way: Martial law froze the political  and social arrangement that was formed in the 1980-81 period.  It transferred the arrangement into a different historical time  and a different geopolitical dimension, into a situation where  the idea of national agreement became the only way to resolve  Polish problems. After all, the "Roundtable" was, in essence, a  repetition of the concept of the National Agreement Council,  which I had suggested in the fall of 1981. Even what happened  in Magdalenka was to a certain extent a reflection of the  so-called initiating group that was supposed to come to  agreement and suggest the council's structure and functions.    However, there is the question of whether it all could have  been done earlier, faster, and better. It undoubtedly could  have. Today I can see various mistakes and inconsistencies,  setbacks, and delays more clearly. However, any "great leap,"  both for external and internal reasons, was not possible in that  reality. If even today, in a new political and international  reality, there emerge such great obstacles on the road of  thorough economic transformations, one can imagine what the  obstacles were in that period. Apart from that, we were very  strict about the social duties of the state, which often took  precedence over the economy. It is worth recalling how many  apartments were built in the martial law period: in 1982,  approximately 185,000; in 1983, over 195,000; in the years that  followed, until 1989, the numbers were similar. At the same  time, I still remember the charge that was leveled at me: One  has to wait for an apartment as long as 30 years. Now that we  build fewer apartments, such complaints have become less  audible. However, I think that the people still remember  various social solutions. In the last elections, the Polish  people showed that certain achievements, which martial law also  protected, are very close to them. I am not saying this from  the position of "Now, what did I tell you?," but I am rather  encouraging a quiet, sine ira et studio reflection on  the entire complexity of the past road.    [Lukasiewicz] However, despite the fact that the governing  administration has changed, the responsibility for imposing  martial law is still a subject of constitutional proceedings.  Do you not think that the so-called Suslov documents played a  role here? I mean the documents that suggest that you did not  rule out the possibility of requesting help from the "Soviet  comrades". [Jaruzelski] I already discussed this topic  in RZECZPOSPOLITA twice (25-26 September and 6-7 November 1993).  No one has refuted the substance of those explanations. How  many times must we recall the desperate efforts we made so that  our Polish problems would remain ours? This is what happened.  This is concrete and palpable proof; it is more important than  any sensational news that is contrary to it.    It is worth noting that the order for them came from Poland.  This was proved by its evident selectiveness and by taking  advantage of it in the preelection period. The way the previous  management of television used this topic was very significant;  it allowed me to present my explanations only two weeks after  the elections. The following fact is very important here: Unlike  the case of many other documents from the already mentioned  Archives, protocols signed by a secretary of the Central  Committee [KC], the only pretext for this "sensation" was not a  protocol, but an unsigned working note. The fact that the list  of people participating in that session did not include the name  of Mikhail Gorbachev is characteristic. In several interviews  he stated that the Politburo of KC of the Communist Party of the  Soviet Union did not take such things into consideration. There  are also other arguments in this issue that I have already  explained, among others, in RZECZPOSPOLITA. Their meaning has  been strengthened by the recently revealed documents from the  archives of the former German Democratic Republic. I think that  similar materials can also be found in former Czechoslovakia.    I must recall again, however, that I never put the external  factor in first place. I have often said, also in my book  The Martial Law. Why... that it would have been  below my dignity as an officer if I had used the pretext of some  external disposition or directive. However, it is true that the  awareness of the seriousness of the situation hung over us like  a black cloud. Such was the logic of the geostrategic division  of Europe and the world. Disregarding it would have meant  playing with the fate of the nation and the state. Various  accusers of the so-called authors of martial law are becoming  ludicrous. They claim that we were not threatened by anything  at that time; however, today, in a much more advantageous  international situation, they feel great anxiety because of  every other statement by Zhirinovskiy. We can also say the same  about the very nervous reactions to the possibility of  decreasing the gas supply from Russia for a time, even though  this possibility was only slightly signaled in 1992. Now, how  much more dangerous it all looked at the end of 1981. The  Soviets almost delivered an ultimatum, announcing that they  would drastically cut the supplies of gas, oil, and many other  raw materials and commodities. The results would have been  catastrophic.    Therefore, we must take an objective look at the past,  primarily at our common Polish faults. At that time, we, both  the authorities and Solidarity, were not mature enough to reach  an agreement. Today many activists of the opposition of that  time proudly call those events a rebellion, an insurrection. I  feel respect for the freedom-oriented, democratic intentions of  those activities--all the more so because, as it is said  informally, not even one windowpane was broken at that time.  However, the economy was destroyed, with all of the material and  biological effects of that on the people; the functioning of the  state was paralyzed, and confrontation was a real danger. If  someone has a poor memory, he will find the confirmation of this  evaluation in countless archival materials that illustrated that  situation and the consequent circumstances of the introduction  of martial law. I also feel that we should recall many  confidential and public statements by Western and Eastern  politicians, as well as by many foreign publications.    In light of all those facts, one can only be surprised at  the  decision of the previous Sejm, which started proceedings in the  Constitutional Responsibility Committee. A dramatically complex  problem, which will be disputed by historians for decades, has  been subjected to a procedure that is burdened with political  emotions. Instead, in line with the wise Spanish model,  shortening the distance and linking, we will recreate historical  antagonisms and divisions in modern wrappings. This will not be  beneficial either to Poland, or even to the political circles  that have inherited the oppositional ethos. The hearing of  evidence will reveal and recall many issues that I believe the  extremist circles of the Solidarity of that period would rather  forget. Who, then, needs this?    [Lukasiewicz] Let us, however, revert to the present. Do  you think the democratic mechanisms, which have no doubt been  implemented by the Solidarity governments, are so lasting that  the next change of the governing elites will be made in an  equally peaceful manner as the one on 19 September?    [Jaruzelski] I fully appreciate the role of the Solidarity  governments in the process of implementing democratic  mechanisms. I think that the Polish people, despite the fact  that they are critical of some manifestations of the  parliament's activities, have really been bitten by the bug of  democracy. Therefore, any nondemocratic moves would have been  evaluated critically. Frequent elections and changes of  parliaments and governments, even due to the costs of these  operations, are not received enthusiastically. There are not  many people left who believe in slogans and promises. Tired of  the turmoil of not really understandable disputes and conflicts,  people want some stabilization. No authorities can enjoy their  honeymoon periods for a long time. The popularity of  politicians is changeable, all the more so because there is  enough fuel for social tensions. The tensions can primarily be  found in the difficult living conditions of many people in  Poland. The Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity"  can see a chance for itself there. It is a union that  particularly willingly employs the instrument of protests and  strikes. The political reality has changed, but they still say  "bad government" and "down with communists." The All-Polish  Trade Unions Agreement, even though more numerous and often  treated as a postsocialist relic, did not create as many  problems even to the Solidarity governments as Solidarity is  creating now. Its destabilizing moves, politically backed by  radically rightist circles, may disturb the rhythm of the  functioning and of the normal changes of the democratically  elected state authorities.    Also, the conflict between the president and the parliament  adds to this situation. The statement made by Deputy Jerzy  Jaskiernia in the Sejm seemed to me to be more convincing than  the arguments put forward by Minister Lech Falandysz. However,  it was also wrong and unseemly to reject the president's motion  without forwarding it to the committees and without a debate  that might have resulted in some compromise solution. Even  though the rules of democracy were not slighted, the president  may have perceived this decision as an act of disrespect and  arrogance. This may have been the reason for such an emotional  response, which, however, was rather exaggerated to the rank of  the event. However, Lech Walesa is a realist. He plays  roughly, to be sure, and not always fairly; he goes especially  far in rhetoric. In practice, however, he does not go beyond  the playground thatc is called democracy. I am also convinced  that the other party to the conflict will have enough composure  and restraint. Therefore, we should only hope that the present  situation will not turn into a "war in high places," which would  be detrimental primarily to Poland. No one can really gain  anything in such a war. Everyone will be defeated.    [Lukasiewicz] Apologizing right after the elections in  rather general terms to all those who suffered under the old  system, Aleksander Kwasniewski announced that there would be no  comeback either to the communist past, or to the republic of  "Solidarity buddies." However, what we have recently been  witnessing in the cadre policy does look like the recreation of  the "republic of buddies," the only difference being that they  are from "a different shelf." What do you think about that?  Slogans are only slogans, but a concrete policy is carried out  by concrete people.    [Jaruzelski] Aleksander Kwasniewski told the truth--there is  no going back to the past system, and there is no retreating  from the road of democratic and free-market-oriented  transformations. This is the most important assumption. It is  confirmed by practice. Personnel moves, however important they  are, are not able to change the generally accepted direction.  Actually, there is no such intention. The differences in views  on the transformations concern the technology, not the  foundations. Of course, the people in the administration quite  considerably influence the implementation process. Therefore, I  understand the sensitivity to personnel decisions. Over the  four years of the Solidarity governments a thorough change,  especially in the people in managerial positions, was made. The  substantive criteria were often not taken into account. Apart  from justified decisions, most of them were dictated by the  political past and membership. This was often accompanied by  revenge and looting. This must not be repeated in the new  situation. However, I believe that lifelong anathemas imposed  on people active before 1989, and consequent nervous reactions  to the present personnel moves cannot block the changes. Of  course, if the necessary requirements concerning their  qualifications, competence, loyalty, and morale are satisfied.    I do not know exactly the scale of the personnel changes  that  are being made now, nor do I know to what extent they can be  said to be controversial from the viewpoint of qualifications.  I believe, however, that too far-reaching generalizations  should be avoided. This does not mean, of course, that we should  close our eyes to such moves which, being a play of various  pressures, would lead to clique configurations, weaker than  their predecessors as far as their competence and functioning  are concerned. The most important criterion must be the  potential and real efficiency of the persons' activities.    [Lukasiewicz] How long do you think the so-called left wing  will govern the country, especially after the recent crisis in  the governing coalition, and after the increasing differences  within the leftist parliamentary clubs have become visible?    [Jaruzelski] I am a supporter of the left wing. I hope it  will stay in power for a long time, at least until the end of  the term. It must be remembered that a complex program of  transformations can only be implemented over three or four  years; I mean a program of transformations that would harmonize  the mechanisms of economic growth with social goals, which is  extremely difficult. This coalition has the greatest chance to  do this. Both components of the coalition know that a different  composition is not very real (PSL) and entirely unreal (SLD).  This should also have a soothing influence on internal  factional-centrifugal trends within the parties. However, even  possible factions do not necessarily have to lead to the  disturbing of the fundamental potential of each of the  groupings. However, there will be no idyll. The differences  are quite considerable in some areas. However, "first, do not  disturb." Being in a coalition is an art of compromise, the  ability to be above the parochial interests in the name of  higher issues. All the more so because after all no one in the  coalition will become stronger only because someone else will be  weaker--in this way the whole is weaker. I believe in the  intelligence, pragmatism, and the feeling of responsibility of  Waldemar Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski. These young  leaders--age being their great advantage--are quite different,  but for this reason they complement each other. I think that in  the long run they can gain a strategic victory only if they  stick together. This is not easy. However, whoever has agreed  to carry the burden of power, whoever treats the interest of the  state as the most important thing, must have the courage and  wisdom to walk this proverbial line.    [Lukasiewicz] Finally, let us go beyond Polish reality.  How do you evaluate the recent years of the Polish foreign  policy, and do you share the opinion that only the closest  possible relations of Poland with the West can assure us  security? The Russian elections and the statements not only by  Zhirinovskiy, but also recently by Yeltsin himself and persons  related to him, such as Grachev or Kozyrev, reveal increasingly  clearly the imperial appetites of Russia. It seems that it  would have nothing against including us in its zone of influence  once again.    [Jaruzelski] This is a broad and extensively discussed  subject. I will, therefore, confine myself to several general  remarks, because I do not feel entitled to evaluate the Polish  foreign policy as a whole; I have too little information and  up-to-date knowledge. Its most important elements are hidden in  the safes of appropriate chancelleries, headquarters, and  ministries. However, as I look at it from a certain distance, I  can say that my evaluation of the policy pursued by Andrzej  Olechowski is higher than the evaluation of the policy of his  predecessor, whom I know very well and highly value for his  activeness between 1986-89, when he was a member of the  Consultation Council of the Chairman of the State of PRL. I  think that the communicativeness and dynamics of the present  foreign policy are much bigger. Apart from the understandable  involvement and anchorage in the West, the activities in the  eastern direction have increased; the economic aspect is also  stressed.    For a few years now Poland has felt the comfort of relations  with its great eastern neighbor, relations based on equal  rights. I believe that this allows us to lower the temperature  of reactions to historical events. There is no doubt that as  far as the issues of national security are concerned, one can  never stand at ease. However, emotions are a bad adviser as  well. In other words, we must open our eyes wider than we open  our mouths. Historical-psychological factors should not take  precedence over cool, substantive analysis. I have the  military, professional habit of getting to the core of a matter;  I usually start with the evaluation of the forces, the  possibilities, and probable intentions of the other side, let us  say. Then one's own forces and possibilities should be  evaluated. This is supplemented by an analysis of other  accompanying conditions; as a result, by seeing the difference  between the possible and the real threat, one can draw the right  conclusions: For today, for tomorrow, and for the day after  tomorrow. I believe that a quiet, substantive analysis of the  international situation, a pragmatic calculation of the gains  and losses would allow us to have more options, adequate to the  actual and forecast situation. Of course, the problem is  extremely important. Therefore, both the official stance of the  authorities and the published materials show the world our  options and expectations. At the same time they enrich the  knowledge and the feeling of joint responsibility of the people  for the future of the country. This should be one of the most  important levers strengthening the political, economic, and  defense condition of Poland.    "Hell is paved" with treaties and guarantees. They are  really credible only when they are in agreement with the broadly  understood interests of the state that issues the guarantees.  Adam Daniel Rotfeld, director of the Stockholm Institute of  Peace Research (SPIRI), writes that right now no one in the West  can see a "danger from the East," but only "danger in the East,"  and in addition, of an unpredictable character. Only a Poland  that is socially stable, economically healthy, and politically  predictable will be a valuable and really protected link in the  European order and security.    One more conclusion is to be vigilant and ready, but, at the  same time, to do everything to have friends not only far, but  also near.</p>

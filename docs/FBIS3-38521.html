But the smirks this provoked among the IRA  supporters around the room soon disappeared when he began to  speak. Why should Protestants trust the republican movement, he  asked, unless the IRA did something to show it was worthy of  that trust?    It was an extraordinary occasion. Inside the Londonderry  Guildhall -- a monument of Ulster Protestantism with its marble  staircases stained glass windows and ornate stone tracery -- a  group of IRA sympathisers had gathered to debate, in public,  whether the organisation should carry on killing or not.    It is now six weeks since the British and Irish prime  ministers signed the Downing Street declaration and still there  has been no response from Sinn Fein, the political alter ego of  the IRA. Instead they have called four public meetings -- the  first of which was held in Londonderry last week -- to listen to  the views of the ordinary people of the province.    For seven hours, they came forward, one after another, to  speak. There were the hardliners with their wellworn talk of  "Unionist hegemony" and the "British ruling class." There was  the group from the Derry Peace and Reconciliation Center who  challenged the IRA to end the violence at once. There was a  distinguished surgeon who spoke of the anguish of operating on  victims of violence, of whatever denomination. There was a  Protestant man who came in on the spur of the moment to tell the  apologists for violence that the IRA were cowards who hid behind  masks.    The panel of Sinn Fein officials who sat and listened had  heard all that before. But they were also hearing something new  -- the voices of former terrorists, supporters and sympathisers  who were now telling them to put down the guns and begin to talk.    Their submissions began from the same position as the IRA.  They displayed deep distrust of the British. They complained  of continued harassment of Catholics by the security forces.  They pointed to inconsistencies in the declaration. And yet at  the end they pronounced that accepting the declaration as a  starting point from which to negotiate was a gamble. But it was  a gamble, they said, which the IRA now had to take.    Many outsiders are convinced that the IRA has no intention  of  calling off the shooting and bombing; meetings such as this are  deliberately dragging out the process to avoid accusations of  rejecting the peace plan out of hand. As the furious reaction  to Adams' U.S. visit has shown, few in Britain believe that he  is sincere in seeking peace. However, on the ground things  looks rather different.    Conversations over several days with republicans in IRA  strongholds in Derry, Belfast and South Armagh revealed that an  intense debate is now being conducted among the IRA's  support-base. It is being driven by Gerry Adams and others in  the movement's leadership. Now middle-aged, they have become  more reflective. They are said to see no prospect of victory and  fear that their grown-up children will now be sucked into more  years of futile struggle.    In republican circles in Derry, the talk is that Adams has  made considerable headway in persuading IRA members there. Such  talk could simply be the work of the IRA's propaganda machine,  but the behaviour of senior republican figures seems to confirm  it. The most influential republican in the city, Martin  McGuinness, sat silently throughout the meeting last Friday [28  January] but pointedly rose to congratulate two speakers who  concluded that now was the time to end the violence.    But the argument cannot be decided in a single city. The IRA  is not a homogeneous organisation. Nor is the overlap between  the IRA and Sinn Fein as exact as is often supposed. Support  for Adams varies from place to place. There is much more in  Derry -- where the IRA is more structured, better educated and  more political -- than in Belfast -- where it is more  fragmented, more violent and more reactive to loyalist  paramilitary activity. Adams also has more support in urban  areas -- where Sinn Fein councillors are recognised as effective  community politicians who get things done -- than in rural areas  where nationalism is more instinctive and romanticised.    As one staunch republican in what's known as the bandit  country of South Armagh remarked: "If Adams can't swing them in  Derry, what hope has he got here, or in East Tyrone or South  Fermanagh."    The SDLP [Social Democratic and Labor Party] MP for the  area,  Seamus Mallon, said: "Anyone who thought that persuading Gerry  Adams was the end of the process clearly doesn't understand much  about how things really are here."    South Armagh is a place where even the locals are wary about  using backroads after dark and where, on the housing estates of  Newry, the residents are as likely to turn to the paramilitaries  as to the police to address the behaviour of local criminals.  Yet even here "a substantial number of Sinn Fein voters want to  accept the declaration as the starting point," as one local put  it.    Throughout the province, insiders estimate, somewhere  between  50 and 70 percent of IRA supporters now want the violence to  stop. Gerry Adams knows that is not enough. He has to persuade  more -- those for whom the presence of the British Army  constitutes a daily provocation, those bitter from the death of  relatives who cannot accept that they might have "died in vain,"  and those for whom terrorism has become a career and who would  have difficulty in finding an ordinary job which would give them  the same status.    Adams needs 90 or 95 percent support if he is to avoid a  split. But the history of Irish republicanism is a history of  splits in which its members have repeatedly turned their guns on  one another. He knows he would be Target Number One for any  breakaway hardliners.    He knows, too, how easily a small dissident group could  scupper Sinn Fein's role in future talks: because of the  cellular structure of the IRA, its average unit, security  sources estimate, has immediate access to two handguns, four  Armalite rifles, 6,000 rounds of ammunition, and 15 pounds of  Semtex explosive. As one security source said: "With that lot,  a single unit can do a lot of damage to any peace process."    Splits are inevitable, the security forces believe. "But if  Adams can keep the breakaway faction small enough, then the  security forces in the South or the North will be able to mop up  the opposition," the source said.    "The key factor is to get the violence to stop for long  enough so that the Sinn Fein people become engaged in the  political process in such a way that they do not feel that going  back to violence would be productive," said a Dublin official.    Already the Irish Government is trying to begin this process  of involvement. It recently revoked its 22-year ban on Sinn  Fein members appearing on TV and radio. It is also the reason  for their not opposing Gerry Adams' application for a U.S. visa.    "We have to make an act of faith in Adams and enhance his  authority in the hope that he will use that extra authority  well," said one senior member of the Dublin government. "We  have to give him until the end of February to turn gentle  persuasion into the exercise of internal authority. Sinn Fein  will use that time and opportunity to make themselves  politically respectable. That is galling to a lot of people on  both sides of the border but we have to take the risk."</p>

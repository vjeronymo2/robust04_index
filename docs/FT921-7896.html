			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Brierley bids ADollars 127m for ACIL SIR Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, yesterday brought together the two investment companies with which he is associated to launch a ADollars 127m hostile bid for Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL), formerly Bell Resources. The 23 cents per share bid was made through Rossington Investments, an Australian company jointly owned by GPG, Sir Ron's British investment vehicle, and Brierley Investments of New Zealand, in which he holds a 2 per cent stake. The bid is the first joint takeover attempt by the two companies since Sir Ron acquired GPG in 1989. He resigned as Brierley Investments chairman in 1990, but remains a director. Rossington said the bid was conditional on the cancellation of ACIL's planned sale to Lion Nathan of New Zealand of its 50 per cent share in National Brewing Holdings, formerly the brewing arm of Mr Alan Bond's Bond Corporation Holdings. ACIL would also be required to cancel a ADollars 220m flotation of Bass Strait oil royalty holdings planned by Weeks Petroleum, in which ACIL holds a controlling shareholding of 96 per cent. ACIL said the offer price was 'totally inadequate' and 'highly unlikely to succeed' because of the conditions. ACIL shares closed one cent lower at 24 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange last night. Mr Douglas Myers, Lion Nathan chief executive, said Lion Nathan had 'an absolute and binding contract' for the purchase of National Brewing, which would give it 100 per cent of the Tooheys, Castlemaine XXXX and Swan brands. The offer was also rejected by Mr George Haines, managing director of the Adelaide Steamship group, which owns 19.9 per cent of ACIL. Mr Haines said the bid was 'far too low,' and did not reflect the company's true value. Sir Ron said ACIL was 'a company that needs to have a new direction. . . a company looking for a catalyst, and we are filling a void.' He said the bid was realistic, but admitted it could fail if the conditions were breached. As Bell Resources, ACIL was once a vehicle for takeover activity by the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court, who died last year. It was later part of the Bond group, which crashed last year. Mr Geoff Hill, the Sydney merchant banker who has guided ACIL through extensive restructuring in the past two years, said he intended to go ahead with plans announced earlier to resign as chairman, but would remain an adviser to the group. He will be replaced by Mr Alan Batley.</p>

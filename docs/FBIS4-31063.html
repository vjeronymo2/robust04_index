			<p>BFN     [Text] After everything that has happened, what are the  chances of a peace agreement being signed in Geneva and  conditions created for at least a partial lifting of the  sanctions against Yugoslavia? This is the question that Milada  Citovic put to [Bosnian Serb] president Karadzic.    [Begin recording] [Karadzic] The Muslims have so far done  everything to sabotage every conference, and the United States  has generally helped them in this. I am afraid that if any one  of us Serbs thinks that this is a serious conference on peace  and that the sanctions will really be lifted and that, in the  international community, it is primarily the United States that  is striving for peace, he is gravely mistaken. They can achieve  peace whenever they want because the Muslims are entirely  obedient to the ones who issue the orders, and it is a fact that  the United States -- that is, certain circles in the United  States -- has instigated this war and is prolonging it to the  extent that suits it. To put it succinctly, we Serbs should not  fool ourselves -- this is a war for the West's goals; these  goals have not been achieved by a long shot because we have kept  them at bay with our defense in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina  for a full two years. They have not succeeded in achieving  anything that they planned to do in Serbia, and they are  dissatisfied with the effect. That is why they will do  everything to make the war last longer.    [Citovic] The Serbian side is unconditionally for peace and  has agreed to negotiate a cessation of hostilities. However,  the Contact Group for Bosnia also met today, and territorial  demarcation was discussed. This is illogical. First,  hostilities have to cease, and then this can be discussed.    [Karadzic] That is also our position. The most important  thing is to stop the war, because it will be easier to negotiate  in peace. On the other hand, it seems that the Contact Group is  comprised of people who do not have enough authority and who do  not have adequate maneuvering space. Therefore, negotiations  with the Contact Group are somehow barren.    Simply, it is the Muslim map that is being passed around --  that is, certain variants of it -- and the entire Contact Group  is presenting itself as the representative of the Muslims'  interests. We do not have a direct connection or influence on  the creation of these maps, our representative is not included  in this Contact Group, and we do not have unbiased mediators to  take into account the interests of all three sides. To put it  succinctly, the Contact Group was designed to put pressure on  the Serbs. It is not a group for achieving an agreement between  the three sides. [end recording]</p>

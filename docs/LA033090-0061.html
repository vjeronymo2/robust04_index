			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> AIN'T NOTHING PHONY ABOUT SONNIER'S CAJUN STYLE  </P> <P> Far more often than not, when an artist tries to bring a unique indigenous  culture into the mainstream, that culture gets diluted or distorted beyond  appreciation. Certainly Louisiana's Cajun culture has endured its share of  bastardizations, with some accordion-ized efforts sounding like the musical  equivalent of assembly-line Cajun potato chips.  </P> <P> But in a splendid performance at Hamptons on Wednesday night, Jo-El Sonnier  sank his Cajun roots into a number of musical territories, and made them all  seem like home.  </P> <P> A scant five years ago, Sonnier was known mainly as a musician's musician,  which is a polite way of saying most people didn't know him from Superman's  dad. On the pudgy side then, and sporting a Ringo haircut, he chiefly played  traditional Cajun tunes on his diatonic button accordion. And even though his  bands often included the likes of Garth Hudson, Albert Lee and David Lindley,  his shows remained cloistered affairs.  </P> <P> Today the slimmed-down, hair-slicked musician has a whole set of sharp stage  moves, and a similarly revamped repertoire that has made him no stranger to the  country Top 5. But, as evidenced Wednesday, he remains a passionate singer and  a blindingly good accordionist, and nearly every song he touched in a varied  26-song set was enriched by his bayou background.  </P> <P> Sonnier and his four-piece band, the Instigators, opened with Hank Williams'  "Jambalaya," giving it a slow, shimmering intro before kicking into a wild  locomotive rhythm. Throughout the show his band worked with tight precision,  with guitarist John Jackson being both the group's standout musician, thanks to  inventive blues-based lines, and its occasional annoyance, when his high-volume  fills at times trod over Sonnier's vocals.  </P> <P> The set showed Sonnier's excellent ear for songs: He has given a second chance  to undeservedly under-recognized tunes by Richard Thompson, Randy Newman, Dave  Alvin, John Hiatt and others. His version of Alvin's song "So Long Baby  Goodbye" rode like a hayride on fire, while a cover of Robert Cray Band writer  Dennis Walker's "I've Slipped Her Mind" held a taut drama.  </P> <P> Hiatt's "Have a Little Faith in Me," the title tune on Sonnier's current album,  was the only song in the show to come up short. Hindered by an MOR-ballad  arrangement, Sonnier's halfhearted vocal made no inroads on Hiatt's  definitively emotive version.  </P> <P> Sonnier more than made up for that lapse on Newman's beautiful "Louisiana  1929." His vocal, full of that traditional Cajun plaint, gave an added  firsthand character to Newman's account of a disastrous Louisiana flood. On the  unaccompanied intro and end of the song, his haunting accordion interpretation  of Newman's stately theme sounded like it was slowly wafting over a moonlit  lake.  </P> <P> There was a swampy menace mixed in with the feel of Elvis' early RCA sides on  "The Hurt in My Heart," while versions of the insanely upbeat "Louisiana Blues"  and Slim Harpo's "Rainin' in My Heart" were unquestionably from Dixie Beer  territory. But even Sonnier's more pop-oriented attempts, such as the current  single "Scene of the Crime" and the ballad "No More One More Time" had a Cajun  earthiness to them.  </P> <P> Sonnier saved his best for last, though. From Britisher Richard Thompson's  Cajun-influenced "Tear-Stained Letter" through the pure Acadiana of the encore  numbers "Evangeline Special" and "Chere Alice" and the zydeco boogie  "Sugarbee," Sonnier shook his accordion as if it was a wolverine he was trying  to get free of.  </P> <P> Now 44, Sonnier cut his first Cajun record when he was 13. Though he now  abandons his traditional button accordion on some of his more pop-based songs,  he has few peers on the instrument, as his impossibly fast, ovation-drawing  finger-work on "Sugarbee" demonstrated. And, as seems the case with all the  best Cajun music, "Evangeline Special" and "Chere Alice" were brimming over  with both sadness and celebration.  </P> <P> Like the recent successes of Bonnie Raitt and Aaron Neville, Sonnier's music is  cause for hope that music born of people, places, feelings and experiences can  still find a place on the charts.  </P></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bank sector firmer on broker's upgrade Wall Street FOR THE second consecutive day, US stock markets moved in a narrow price range in light trading as investors searched for a new direction, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.54 at 3,442.95. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.06 off at 451.37, while the Nasdaq composite edged forward 0.26 to 695.47. New York SE volume, which on Monday hit its lowest level for the year, was again light by recent standards, at 218m shares. After the wild fluctuations and heavy volumes of the previous few weeks, equities yesterday appeared to have settled into a temporary pattern of narrow price movements in thin trading. The pattern, said analysts, indicated that in the absence of compelling new economic statistics and a strong lead from Treasury prices, markets are searching for a new direction. The day's only economic numbers provided little encouragement. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose by 2.5 per cent in February, a smaller increase than had been expected. Analysts, however, blamed the weak figures on the bad weather late last month, which is likely to have hit the construction of new homes. The subdued trading yesterday may also have reflected reluctance among investors and dealers to trade heavily ahead of today's consumer price index report for February. Normally, the markets would not be overly concerned by the CPI number, but after last week's worryingly strong producer prices report - which sparked heavy selling of bonds and, later, equities - and this week's increase in commodities prices, investors have become newly sensitive to any hint that inflationary pressures may be building in the economy. Drug shares once again took a beating from investors worried about government controls on pharmaceuticals prices. Merck weakened Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 , Pfizer Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 60 and Schering-Plough Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 . Banks were firmer. Citicorp rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 29 5/8 in volume of 2.3m shares and Wells Fargo by Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 108 1/4 . Both were lifted by news that analysts at broking house Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette had raised their earnings estimates for the two banks. Elsewhere in the sector, Chemical put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 43 1/4 . Marion Merill Dow plunged Dollars 4 to Dollars 18 7/8 in volume of 1.8m shares after the company warned that its first-quarter sales would be 'substantially' lower than it recorded at the same stage a year ago. Another company hit by an unexpected profits warning was Chemical Waste, which tumbled Dollars 2 to Dollars 17 1/4 in volume of 2.5m shares after stating that first-quarter earnings would be flat or lower, compared to a year ago. Canada TORONTO finished little changed after busy trading as a rise among forest products issues was offset by a drop in gold shares. The TSE 300 index eased 5.3 to 3,556.8 and declines led rises by 323 to 296 after volume of 48.4m shares. Eight of the 14 sub-groups closed higher, with forest products ahead by 1.8 per cent. Slocan Forest advanced CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 18 5/8 . The golds group fell 2.3 per cent as further comments by US Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt concerning American Barrick pushed the heavily weighted stock down again, by CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 19 5/8 .</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Maxwell probe challenge fails MR MARK HAAS, an executive director of Lehman Brothers International, the UK arm of US investment bankers Lehman Brothers, has failed to block his interrogation today about stock-lending agreements between Lehman and Bishopsgate Investment Management. The High Court yesterday rejected his challenge to an order under the Insolvency Act that he submit to oral examination by the liquidators of BIM, which managed Maxwell company pension schemes. Mr Justice Hoffmann also rejected Mr Haas's plea that he be shown an annexure to a confidential report by Mr Neil Cooper of Robson Rhodes, one of the liquidators. The annexure identified the informant who gave the liquidators information about the agreements, which had suggested to them the line of inquiry they wanted to pursue with Mr Haas, the judge said. He said one of the agreements had involved Lehman lending BIM US Treasury bills against collateral provided by BIM in the form of pension-fund investments. The bills had immediately been converted into cash for BIM by Lehman. On the face of it that arrangement, although designated as stock lending, had been nothing more than a secured loan of money by Lehman to BIM, the judge said. Ruling that Mr Haas's interrogation must go ahead, the judge said the liquidators were concerned to discover the extent of Lehman's knowledge of the nature and purpose of the stock-lending agreements. The primary purpose of the interrogation was to discover whether they had grounds for suing Lehman. Parliament, Page 10</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / A chief who postponed the day of reckoning While most leaders are judged by their achievements, a cruel twist of fate granted Felix Houphouet-Boigny such exceptional longevity that he was forced to live through the decline of his greatest creation: the Ivory Coast. The loss of 'le Vieux', the father of the nation, has given Ivorians the chance of a fresh start 33 years to the day after independence from France. They must now decide who is to succeed him and how - a question Houphouet-Boigny refused to discuss during his lifetime - and confront the economic and social malaise ushered by the collapse of cocoa and coffee prices in the early 1980s. As Houphouet-Boigny advanced in years, his pre-occupation with eternity became more pressing than the day-to-day running of his country. Like the pious monarchs of medieval Europe, Houphouet-Boigny paid lavishly for a place in heaven. He often boasted that the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro, his Dollars 150m gift to the Vatican, was financed from his personal fortune. The Basilica in the jungle, only a fraction smaller than St Peter's, stands as a testament to his devout Catholicism - and the delusions of grandeur common to dictators. Born before the French took possession of his native village, Felix Houphouet, a doctor trained in Dakar, made his first impression on the colonial administration of the 1930s by campaigning for higher cocoa prices for African farmers. He added Boigny ('the ram' or 'irresistible force') to his surname after being elected to the French constituent assembly in 1946, where he promoted a law which abolished forced labour in France's African colonies. He went on to serve six terms of office as a minister in the governments of two French republics. He did not fight for the Ivory Coast's independence. Rather, it was his way of escaping plans for a Federation of West Africa advocated by fellow Africans like Leopold Senghor of Senegal and Ahmed Sekou Toure of Guinea. He was the odd-man-out among Africa's emerging leaders in many respects. Ideals of pan-Africanism filled him with profound scepticism. He favoured close ties with France, and a capitalist model of development. Africa, he was quoted as saying, 'must be an extension of Europe'. At the first summit of the Organisation of African Unity 30 years ago, he was the lone voice opposed to sanctions against South Africa. With French investment and thousands of French advisers in government, however, Houphouet-Boigny's Ivory Coast came to be seen as a model post-colonial state. He managed to combine a polished international reputation and the outlook of an African chief. Until 1990, the Ivory Coast was a one-party state, but a benevolent one. Political opponents were occasionally locked up. More often, they were co-opted into government with generous offers of ministerial posts. There was no death penalty during his rule, and the Ivory Coast enjoyed a better human rights record than most post-independence African states. Above all, there was stability. Every five years Houphouet-Boigny was re-elected, unopposed, to the presidency with 100 per cent of the vote. He created an economy based on cocoa and coffee, and borrowed heavily against the commodity boom of the 1970s to transform Abidjan into a showcase of African development. The Ivory Coast was, for a while, the richest country in Francophone Africa. Then the world price for cocoa started to fall, attempts to protect Ivorian growers with guaranteed prices ran up huge budget deficits, and the nation slid suddenly towards hunger and crime. When social unrest forced the advent of multi-party democracy in 1990, Houphouet-Boigny conceded 18 per cent of the vote to his rival, Laurent Gbagbo, in a contest marred by fraud. By then, Houphouet-Boigny was well into his 80s and spending more and more time convalescing from various ailments in Europe. The fact that there were no coup attempts during his prolonged absences was a tribute to his unquestioned authority. His greatest mistake was to postpone the inevitable day of reckoning, when the Ivory Coast would have to learn to live without him. The succession became a taboo subject. The animist traditions of his Baoule tribe, he once told visiting choir boys, say that if you die a chief, you will remain a chief in the after life. Die a servant, and you will forever be a servant. Houphouet-Boigny, who retained the services of a witch-doctor as well as the top cancer specialists of Switzerland, made sure he would die a chief.</p>

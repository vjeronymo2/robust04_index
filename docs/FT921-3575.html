			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 15: Grim facts speak for themselves - Sweden / Concern is growing that the crisis will have an adverse knock-on effect over the rest of the economy AFTER the booming real estate values of the late 1980s, the Swedish property market has plunged into a severe depression with little prospect of any early improvement. In a recent bleak forecast, Svenska Handelsbanken, one of the country's leading commercial banks, suggested it could be the mid-1990s before a recovery takes place in the property market. Moreover, there will be no return to the inflated prices of only 2 1/2 years ago. Many observers are concerned that the crisis in Swedish property will have an adverse knock-on effect over the rest of the stagnating economy, pushing it even deeper into recession. The construction industry is already suffering from the consequences of falling demand, with a sharp drop in investment over the past 12 months. The contraction in building orders has contributed significantly to the recent sharp decline in Sweden's gross domestic product. 'The consequences of what is happening in the property market go much wider than its effect on the construction industry', says Mr Ulf Jakobsson, chief economist at the Federation of Swedish Industries. The soaring credit losses suffered by most of the country's leading financial institutions at the moment also stem primarily from the collapse in property market prices in Sweden and elsewhere in Europe. Finance and real estate companies who took out loans for speculative development in the boom years are finding it increasingly hard to meet their obligations. The speed of deterioration in the Swedish property market from virtually boom to bust has been dramatic, but the grim facts speak for themselves. The total valuation of the 34 listed property and construction companies on the Stockholm bourse halved to Skr34.6bn from SKr70.7bn between February 15 1991 and February 14 this year, , according to a survey carried out by Svenska Dagbladet, one of the country's leading national newspapers. The construction and property share index has plummeted by about 75 per cent since mid-summer 1989. Swedish property prices have fallen on average by 40 per cent over the past two years. The number of large office deals has halved over the same period to 44 from 84. Estimated total property values in Stockholm, the Swedish capital, have plummeted by SKr100bn to between SKr250bn-SKr300bn. A growing number of Swedish real estate and construction property companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent weeks. Observers believe it is only the strongest of Sweden's property companies, notably Skanska, Lundbergs and Hufvudstaden, who will emerge unscathed from the present turmoil - helped by the development of large infrastructure projects in Sweden. It is no exaggeration to suggest the Swedish property market has been traumatised by the turbulent events that have hit property since the onset of the strains on finance companies first became evident in the autumn of 1990. The property slump has come as an unexpected shock because it has followed a period of prolonged speculative expansion during the 1980s. The market value of Swedish commercial real estate climbed by an annual average of 20 per cent between 1984 and 1988, a trend which was fueled by favourable interest rates, high liquidity and strong demand - particularly from insurance companies in search of investments in a supposedly secure asset such as property. The abolition of Sweden's panoply of financial regulations from the mid-1980s onwards also stimulated property boom conditions as speculators found it easy to acquire loans. From late 1987, when real estate companies were first permitted to invest abroad, Swedish investors began to move overseas in the frantic search for property investment opportunities where the direct return on real estate was higher than at home. NCC Real Estate, for example, decided as a matter of policy to place a third of its property portfolios abroad with a particular focus on office developments in London, Brussels and Dusseldorf. It has been estimated by the Swedish Association of Real Estate Owners that between 200 and 250 Swedish companies and investors have acquired foreign property over the past four years with a total value of SKr104bn. This is twice the figure invested in foreign shares over the same period and more than the amount of money invested in all new stock issues on the Stockholm stock market during the 1980s. The demise of property prices elsewhere in Europe has hit the Swedish companies particularly hard. Affarsvarlden, Sweden's leading business magazine, estimated last month that losses from company foreign property acquisitions totalled between SKr10bn and SKr20bn. The biggest failures for Swedish property companies - and also the insurance groups with large investment portfolios such as SPP and Skandia - have been in London as the market peaked in 1990 and prices plummeted. It is now seen as only a matter of time before the nosedive in Swedish commercial property is followed by a similar development in homes. Despite the recession, residential property prices have held up over the past two years but now they look set to drop, partly because Sweden is no longer suffering from high inflation. The country's current slump is also increasing unemployment and constricting household budgets although most observers of the Swedish property scene do not foresee the kind of free-fall in house prices suffered over the past year in neighbouring Norway. What is clear is that the Swedish government is not going to do anything to improve property market prospects in the immediate future. As a result of the 1991 tax reforms, the imposition of 25 per cent value added tax on property transactions, coupled with higher interest rates and cuts in housing subsidies, will add to the cost burdens on housing. The non-socialist coalition, although committed to reducing Sweden's heavy overall tax burden in stages, seems intent on increasing taxes on property from next January with the self-evident observation that at least people cannot carry property out of the country.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords costs in letting  Agents fees: 10 per cent of first of a building               year's rent + 25 per cent VAT  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants costs in leasing    Fees variable: each deal is arranged of a building               individually  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sale costs by investor      Fees variable: each deal is arranged or owner/occupier           individually  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase costs by investor  Land registry: 3 per cent (payable by or owner/occupier           corporations acquiring property)                             Property tax: 2.5 per cent on annual                             basis (payable by corporations                             acquiring property)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Healey &amp; Baker  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LEMOND GETS $5.7-MILLION SALARY FROM FRENCH TEAM  </P> <P> Greg LeMond, the newly crowned world cycling champion and two-time Tour de  France winner, has agreed to a three-year $5.7-million contract with a combined  French team.  </P> <P> An international bidding war sparked by the most dramatic Tour de France finish  in history has elevated LeMond to the same tax bracket as America's  highest-paid baseball, football and basketball players.  </P> <P> LeMond will be paid $1.8 million in 1990, which gives him a higher salary than  Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway. Elway, in the middle of a six-year  $12.7-million pact, earns $1.45 million next year.  </P> <P> LeMond's salary this year was reported between $500,000 and $750,000.  </P> <P> The contract with two merged French teams, Z and Fagor, will be guaranteed by a  bank letter of credit.  </P> <P> In addition, LeMond will enter six U.S. races in a Denver-based Coors Light  jersey.  </P> <P> The brewery paid LeMond an estimated $225,000 as a co-sponsor this season. The  final figure has not been worked out for next year but could be lower because  LeMond will probably not ride in this country's biggest race, the Tour de  Trump.  </P></p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reduced interest charge buoys Roskel Roskel, the Birmingham-based building services company, reported pre-tax profits ahead Pounds 104,000 to Pounds 652,000 in the six months to June 30. There was a Pounds 112,000 fall in interest payable to Pounds 218,000. Turnover advanced 13 per cent to Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 20.2m) helped by two new branches of CP Supplies opened in the period and the acquisition of two distribution businesses. A joint venture, K-R Insulation, has been set up with Kaefer Isoliertechnik of Germany. The move is a result of Roskel's wish to enter the insulation contracting market. Earnings per share were 2.91p (2.37p). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.3p.</p>

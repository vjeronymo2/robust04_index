			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] An editorial in the 18 December  ELEVTHEROTIPIA regrets the fact that each change of government  is "inevitably" followed by a change in the Armed Forces'  leadership that entails the return of retired officers to active  duty and, conversely, the mass resignations of high-ranking  officers from active duty. This was done by the previous New  Democracy (ND) government and is being repeated by the new  Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government, the editorial  maintains. According to the editorial, such moves destabilize  the Armed Forces and waste highly trained manpower. The  editorial quotes honorary National Defense General Staff  (Geetha) chairman Gen Ioannis Verivakis as recommending that, as  in other European countries, the leadership of the Greek Armed  Forces should be appointed for at least a two-year period  preceded by special training. Verivakis is also quoted as  saying that we must cease thinking that a Papadhopoulos [junta  leader] is lurking behind every officer's uniform."</p>

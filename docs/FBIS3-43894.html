			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 18 SAPA -- The leadership of the  African National Congress [ANC], the Natal Indian Congress and  the Transvaal Indian Congress resolved at a meeting on Tuesday  [18 January] to mobilise a broad range of people under the ANC  banner. In a joint statement the organisations noted that "the  best hope for peace, prosperity and stability lies in decisive  ANC electoral victory".    Such an election win could only be achieved by "building the  broadest unity of all sectors into a front, within the Indian  community, behind the ANC".    The meeting -- attended by ANC President Nelson Mandela --  also resolved to develop joint programmes to reach out to  communities on a door-to-door and sector-to-sector basis, and to  build a credible leadership platform to effectively address the  Indian community.</p>

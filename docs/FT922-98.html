			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / EC ministers open up rules on Community share deals INVESTMENT FIRMS will have a 'single passport' to deal in shares around the European Community under an agreement reached among EC finance ministers last night. The new directive, reached after two years' wrangling, gives stockbrokers in one country the right to deal in shares of any other EC country without having to set up a local office or buy a local stockbroker. The Investment Services Directive (ISD) is seen as the last important plank in measures to open Europe's financial markets. The agreement still has to pass through the European Parliament but Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said he was 'well satisfied'. Many City institutions were anxious to avoid any directive which might damage London's role as a financial centre. They were particularly concerned about the question of transparency, fearing they would suffer if they had to disclose full details of transactions - including sensitive information on prices and volumes - immediately. Much of the debate on the transparency issue concerned the question of allowing a time delay before disclosing price and volume. Under a complex formula setting out how soon off-market share transactions should be made public, the final agreement would provide for: A weighted average of prices and volumes in transactions over a six-hour period to be published two hours later. The highest and lowest prices, calculated over a rolling two-hour period, would be published every 20 minutes, with one hour's delay. As a safeguard - insisted on by the UK - these disclosure rules could be suspended for very large trades or transactions in illiquid stocks. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner responsible for financial services, said yesterday's accord gave legitimate investors 'a reasonable amount of information, while enabling the markets to function with liquidity'. Ministers also agreed on the final disputed aspect of the capital adequacy directive. Under this, securities dealers would have to have a minimum amount of capital, depending on the size of the investment firm and the nature of the risk of its transactions to get their 'passport'. The formula is designed to bridge the conflicting interests between Britain and some other countries, particularly France. The UK was concerned for its 'quote-driven' system, which depends on market-makers' readiness to hold large blocks of shares while keeping the exact size of the blocks private. In many countries, stockbrokers and banks start hunting for shares only after receiving a client's order. Ministers also agreed on a phased timetable for six countries to allow banks direct access to their stock markets. Sir Leon Brittan commends investment rules, Page 6</p>

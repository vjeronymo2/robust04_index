			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Major Sergey Prokopenko and Colonel Aleksandr </F> Luchaninov of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Press  Center, from the "KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondents and News  Agencies Report" roundup: "Commander's Reconnaissance Under  Way"]    [Text] Abkhazia -- Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General  Georgiy Kondratyev has issued a statement for the press.    The arrival at Gudauta Airfield of military-transport  aviation aircraft does not signify the beginning of a  peacekeeping operation by the Russian Armed Forces in the zone  of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. This operation can only begin  after ratification by the Federation Council of the edict by the  Russian president. The arrival in Gudauta of a signal center  and combat-engineer battalion was proposed as a preparatory  stage for the introduction of peacekeeping forces. Their main  task is to clear the area of mines and to establish  communications with the command posts. As Colonel General G.  Kondratyev stated at the meeting with journalists, the  introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces into the zone  separating the warring sides may only be effected after the  adoption by parliament's upper house of the relevant decision.    Subunits from the 345th Airborne Regiment stationed in  Gudauta will not take part in peacekeeping operations. Russia's  deputy defense minister expressed the hope that a political  decision by the supreme legislative bodies will facilitate the  establishment of peace on this land.</p>

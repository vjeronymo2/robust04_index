			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Long convalescence predicted for sluggish economy THE RECOVERY has started, but Britain's leading forecasters have low expectations for the economy's performance. The latest consensus among 40 leading forecasters is that the economy will grow by 1.5 per cent this year, only slightly higher than the 1 per cent predicted at the end of last year. The latest Financial Times survey of forecasts shows that recent good news on the economy has scarcely affected a cautious set of predictions. Economists from the City, academia and independent think tanks, generally believe that this will be a year of weak growth, rising unemployment, a worsening trade deficit and weak inflationary pressures. The forecasts were made shortly before publication of first-quarter gross domestic product data showing that, excluding oil and gas production, the economy grew by 0.6 per cent on the previous quarter. The biggest revisions have occurred in predictions for the trade balance. Although economists now expect exports to perform better than they did six months ago, they have sharply revised their forecasts for growth in import volumes. The consensus forecast is for a current account deficit of Pounds 16.6bn this year and Pounds 17.6bn in 1994. Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS, and one of those gloomiest about UK trade, said the ideal strategy to close Britain's trade gap would involve further depreciation of sterling and sizeable rises in taxation aimed at constraining consumer demand, but he is not optimistic that the government will follow such a course. According to the survey another interest rate cut is likely during the summer, particularly if the recovery starts to falter. A significant minority, however, expect rates to rise by the end of the year as the government takes fright over rising inflation. Mr Richard Jeffrey, head of research at Charterhouse Tilney, said: 'The economy has now been well primed for recovery. By the end of the year the Treasury should be thinking of taking some of the steam out of consumer demand by edging rates upwards.' This contradicts a more optimistic general view on inflation. Most economists do not expect underlying inflation to go significantly higher than the 4 per cent upper limit of the Treasury's target range. Even the worst-case scenario has it just 1.9 percentage points higher at the end of next year. Mr David Smith, chief economist at Williams de Broe, is one of few to take a dimmer view. 'To an economic historian, present fiscal policies are reminiscent of the build-up to hyper-inflation usually only found in war-time situations.' General optimism about inflation is reflected in quite low forecasts for average earnings. One of the most bullish comes from Mr Roger Bootle of Greenwell Montagu. 'The pay inflation problem is a thing of the past. We have finally banished the inflationary hangovers from the 1970s and have created a new pay culture.' But Mr Neil Blake, research director of Business Strategies, said: 'I can see no way in which some upturn in wage inflation can be avoided . . . I think there has been a downwards step in the underlying medium-term rate of wage inflation, but it has not come down as far as this year's figures would suggest.' Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International said wages would be curbed for the next 18 months by rising unemployment and low headline inflation. 'But during 1994, skills shortages, boardroom pay rises, future VAT hikes and a creeping up of retail prices will add to wage pressures,' he added. With a few exceptions, notably Mr Chris Dillow at Nomura, economists are still troubled by the state of public-sector finances. Mr Dillow believes the failure of the government to balance the budget over the medium term has no economic implications. 'The only consequence is media hot air,' he said. But many others believe the size of the public sector borrowing requirement  -forecast to rise to more than 8 per cent of GDP in the next financial year  -will increase the long-term risk of high inflation and high real interest rates and increase the burden of debt interest. Mr Richard Freeman, senior economist at Imperial Chemical Industries, said the government's own forecasts suggest a public sector borrowing requirement that is too high for a sustainable recovery. 'If the PSBR is still at 3.75 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 then the UK economy will be a slow-growth economy with high interest rates,' he said. The March Budget measures to increase taxation are generally not considered to have gone far enough in reducing the deficit and a third of the 40 economists surveyed said the chancellor should raise taxes again. Some, however, believe the government should concentrate on cutting spending. Mr Keith Wade and Mr David Gasparro of Schroders said public expenditure should bear the brunt of deficit reduction in the November Budget. Tax increases without firm control of spending were of little use. Monthly falls in unemployment in February and March have not persuaded economists that unemployment has stopped rising, although most have brought forward their forecasts for when it will peak. A majority believes the jobless total will start to fall towards the end of the year, after peaking at just more than 3m. More than half of the economists surveyed believe that base rates have not yet reached their floor. Several factors could prompt another 1 point cut to 5 per cent, they said. These include a worsening of the German recession - which would affect Britain's export performance - a decision by the government to tighten fiscal policy substantially, or signs that the recovery was faltering. A majority of economists believe sterling is at about the right level against the D-Mark. But a vociferous few said the size of the trade gap at the end of a long recession reflected an over-valued currency. Mr David Mackie of JP Morgan said: 'With a substantial trade deficit at the end of a long and deep recession, the implication is that the real exchange rate is too high.' Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University is far and away the most optimistic about the trade balance with his forecast for a current account deficit of only Pounds 11bn this year and Pounds 5bn in the next. He believes that 1994 will be a year of world trade recovery which, provided Britain maintains its competitive edge through a devalued pound and slow wage growth, will benefit UK exports. Moderate growth, meanwhile, will limit imports. Virtually none believes the UK should rejoin the ERM. Mr James Barty of Morgan Grenfell asked: 'Is it possible to commit suicide twice?' Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University decided not to take part in the latest survey while he adjusts his model of the economy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FORECASTS FOR THE UK ECONOMY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All series are shown as percentage changes over the previous year, except Unemployment (millions, end period), Base rate (%, end period), PSBR and Current Account (pounds billion) and the Effective Exchange Rate (index, 1985=100, end period).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              GDP          Consumer          Fixed                         (avg measure)     Spending       Investment                         1993     1994   1993     1994   1993     1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Treasury                1.25      na  1.25      na   0.5      na Barclays Bank            1.7      3.1    2.0      2.4    0.2      4.2 Barclays de Zoete Wedd   1.5      2.6    1.6      2.3   -0.5      3.5 James Capel              1.7      2.6    1.7      1.7    2.8      6.5 Charterhouse Tilney      1.8      2.8    2.1      3.9    1.8      4.6 Citibank                 1.4      2.7    1.5      2.9   -0.3      3.3 Daiwa Europe            1.25      2.0    1.3      2.7    0.3      0.6 DKB International        1.6      2.3    1.8      2.0    4.1      3.8 Robert Fleming           0.5      1.5   -0.8      0.3   -2.5      1.2 Goldman Sachs            2.0      3.0    2.2      1.8    0.0      2.9 Greenwell Montagu        1.5      2.0    1.3      1.5    0.5      4.3 Kleinwort Benson         1.5      3.4    1.8      2.7    1.4      5.2 Lehman Brothers          1.7      2.0    2.2      1.4    0.5      3.0 Lloyds Bank              1.8      2.5    1.6      1.6    3.0      6.0 Lombard Street Research  1.5      2.9    1.4      2.4   -1.1      2.7 Mitsubishi Bank          1.5      2.5    2.0      2.0    0.0      3.5 JP Morgan                1.3      2.4    1.5      2.1    1.2      2.3 Morgan Grenfell          1.5     2.75    1.6      2.0    0.0      2.0 Nat.

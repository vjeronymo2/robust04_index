			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Scientist challenges conventional wisdom on nitrates in water RISING LEVELS of nitrate in water supplies are due primarily to natural changes in the soil rather than to the use of fertilisers by farmers, according to a leading British soil scientist. Mr David Jenkinson, of Reading University and Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire, said that reducing fertiliser applications would do little to control nitrate leaching. Money spent on cutting nitrate levels in drinking water could have more medically useful outlets, he suggested. Mr Jenkinson, who has been carrying out research at Rothamsted for 36 years, was delivering the Massey Ferguson National Agricultural Lecture at the Royal Society of Arts in London this week. Most crops left negligible amounts of unused fertiliser in the soil at harvest, according to a series of experiments begun in 1980, he said. 'Farmers spend some Pounds 350m on nitrogen fertilisers every year in the UK  -we wanted to make sure they receive value for their money and that as little as possible of the nitrogen ends up where it is not wanted.' Most of the nitrate leached from arable land came from organic nitrogen being broken down gradually into ammonium ions, which were then converted by soil bacteria into nitrate ions, said Mr Jenkinson. This nitrate remained in the soil, in danger of leaking into water supplies, at times of the year when there were no growing crops to take it up. Changes in farming - notably the increased land under crops and the rise in soil fertility produced by both organic and inorganic fertilisers - had allowed more of this natural nitrogen to turn to nitrate because well-fertilised crops left more organic residues, containing more nitrogen, than unfertilised crops. Certain farming practices, such as excessive use of fertiliser or organic manures, or the application of fertiliser nitrogen in the autumn as a crop 'starter', could contribute directly to nitrate leaching. But no agriculture system could be rendered completely safe from the risk of leaching, Mr Jenkinson said. Even soil that had not had any manure or artificial fertiliser applied for 150 years still 'leaked' nitrate. The problem could be lessened by cutting the time that soil remained bare in the autumn and winter, for example by sowing winter cereals early or by growing cover crops. However, Mr Jenkinson argued that there was minimal medical evidence that current levels of nitrate in drinking water were harmful. The last case of 'blue-baby syndrome' in the UK was recorded in 1972. 'Stomach cancer has been linked to nitrate in drinking water but the epidemiological evidence is not in support,' he said. 'In the UK stomach cancer is most common in areas where the nitrate concentration in drinking water is lowest. Nitrate concentrations have been increasing in water supplies, yet the incidence of stomach cancer has been decreasing.' By 1995, water companies in England and Wales would have spent Pounds 164m on meeting the EC nitrate limit of 50mg per litre. 'Risk-benefit analysis suggests that there are far more medically useful ways to spend money than by reducing nitrate levels in drinking water when money is in short supply,' said Mr Jenkinson. Turning to global warming, he said research at Rothamsted indicated that an increase in temperature of 1.5 degrees centigrade over the next 60 years would release an extra 1bn tonnes of carbon as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year from soil organic matter. This was in addition to the roughly 6bn tonnes of carbon released each year by burning fossil fuels.</p>

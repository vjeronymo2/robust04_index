			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Penalty of playing for high stakes - Lasmo's problems and poor share price performance THE JOKE going around the oil sector runs as follows: what do you get if you merge a Pounds 1bn company with a Pounds 1bn company? Answer: Lasmo, a Pounds 1bn company. Lasmo's 1991 takeover of rival Ultramar for Pounds 1.1bn made it one of the largest UK independent oil and gas explorers, doubled its proven and provable reserves and doubled production. However, with debt and other problems mounting from the takeover, and the depressed oil price, Lasmo has been one of the poorest performing FT-SE 100 shares. Despite a 10p rise to 165p yesterday, the shares have lost half their value since the bid was launched, and Lasmo is still a Pounds 1bn company. On Thursday, the man largely responsible for Lasmo's rise took the blame for its share price decline. Mr Chris Greentree, chief executive since 1982, was replaced by his chief operating officer, Mr Joe Darby. The change seemed designed to silence stock market criticism, and prepare for a cut in dividends when Lasmo announces results in March. Mr Greentree, a big Canadian, was a leading figure in the independent oil industry and a dominant character within Lasmo. His mistake was to gamble Lasmo's short-term cash position on the longer-term benefits of buying Ultramar. Lasmo was generally thought to have bought the company cheaply. But subsequent sales of Ultramar's downstream assets achieved disappointing prices, suggesting asset values had already started to fall by the time of the takeover. Lasmo was left with high borrowings and rising capital expenditure. Despite Dollars 1.53bn (Pounds 1bn) of disposals last year, net borrowings are estimated to have hardly changed at over Pounds 1bn, with gearing above 90 per cent. With oil prices depressed after the Gulf war, earnings have come under pressure. According to NatWest Securities, net income is forecast to rise from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 29m for the year to end-September, including a full contribution from Ultramar. But on a per share basis to reflect the dilution effects of the takeover, cash flow and earnings will have both fallen. With earnings of 3.1p expected, analysts point out that last year's dividend of 8.5p will have to be cut more than half to be covered. Mr Darby is spending the weekend reviewing Lasmo's strategy but is not expected to introduce radical changes. A cautious man, who is described as 'quietish' by colleagues, he likes compiling lists of priorities and manages methodically. At the top of the stock market's list is for a decision on the dividend. This will not happen until Lasmo releases results in March and will partly depend on the sterling oil price. Analysts agree, in the longer term, that Lasmo has great potential and holds some excellent assets - especially in the North Sea and an Indonesian joint venture inherited with Ultramar. But in the short term, they argue that maintaining the dividend when borrowings are so high risks undermining the business. Hoare Govett, which said the shares were overvalued until the dividend uncertainty was removed, argued that passing the final payment would save about Pounds 60m. That would give Lasmo greater scope on disposals and not force it into a fire sale of assets at undervalued prices. 'With operating results deteriorating and with asset sales necessary to keep the balance sheet under control, we believe Lasmo would be financially imprudent to pay a held and uncovered dividend,' Hoare Govett said in a circular issued the day before Mr Greentree's departure. Institutional shareholders, however, may want Lasmo to focus on cash flow rather than earnings cover when assessing the dividend, in line with US practise. On this basis, a maintained dividend would be about 4 times covered, well below rival Enterprise, but still sustainable. Where both camps agree is that the ongoing programme of disposals and rationalisation following the Ultramar bid must continue to bring down borrowings and strengthen the balance sheet. Most of Ultramar's downstream assets due for disposal have now been sold. But Lasmo could raise a further Dollars 350m this year through disposals of upstream assets. The sale of minority holdings in the North Sea could raise Pounds 100m, according to analysts, although there would be concern if the important Markham field was sold, as has been rumoured. Partly because of the low oil price, and partly because of its own problems, Lasmo had already indicated cuts in capital expenditure and development spending from this year. Last month Mr Greentree said capital expenditure would fall 15 per cent to Pounds 90m while development spending would fall by nearly Pounds 100m to Pounds 240m. Assuming these programmes continue, some observers argue Lasmo could recover quickly, helped by rising production from Ultramar assets and reduced gearing. 'The good news for Mr Darby,' according to Mr Simon Flowers at NatWest, 'is that much of what he should do is already in train.' The bad news for Mr Darby and his fellow directors is that the tricky dividend decision remains at the top of their list.</p>

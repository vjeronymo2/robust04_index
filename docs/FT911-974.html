			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Usher-Walker in talks with holder of large stake USHER-WALKER, the printing inks and roller manufacturer, which saw its share price surge 12 per cent last Friday, is in discussions which could lead to the beneficial shareholder of a significant stake joining the company. Mr David Williams, a former deputy chairman of Mosaic Investments, who recently acquired a large holding through a discretionary trust, could join the group as corporate development director. Yesterday the shares closed up 7p at 290p, posting a 20 per cent rise since the beginning of the week. Mr Williams is a beneficiary of the trust which owns Ringwood Investments, a Channel Islands company that acquired 10.19 per cent of Usher-Walker's shares from Southern Newspapers, its largest shareholder. The future registered holder of Ringwood's stake is SIL (Nominees). Shares in Usher-Walker jumped to 241p on Friday, after an announcement that a group of directors led by Mr Peter Walker, chairman and managing director, had acquired 3.79 per cent of the capital. The directors also acquired the shares from Southern Newspapers, which has seen its stake reduced from 18.8 to 14.99 per cent as a result. As demand for printing ink has slumped in the harsh advertising climate, Usher-Walker reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 149,000 in the six months to end June 1990, down from Pounds 808,000.</p>

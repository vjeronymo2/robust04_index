			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> REINSTATE PROFESSOR, PANEL ORDERS  </P> <P> A state board has ordered the reinstatement of a longtime Cal State Northridge  professor who was fired last summer for allegedly offering students A grades if  they sold raffle tickets to raise money for his nonprofit foundation.  </P> <P> Three members of the state Personnel Board voted Monday to suspend Prof. Eleazu  Obinna for 90 days, then ordered CSUN to give him back his job in the  Pan-African studies department.  </P> <P> The board, voting in closed session, upheld the opinion of Administrative Law  Judge Byron Berry, who said there was not enough evidence to support university  allegations that Obinna offered his students A grades if they sold $100 worth  of raffle tickets for the United Crusade Foundation. Berry wrote an opinion for  the board after hearing seven days of testimony during hearings on the CSUN  campus during the fall and winter.  </P> <P> Berry said he recommended Obinna's suspension because of unprofessional conduct  for "selling tickets in connection with a class. It is not an appropriate class  activity."  </P> <P> CSUN officials would not say whether they will appeal the board's decision.  </P></p>

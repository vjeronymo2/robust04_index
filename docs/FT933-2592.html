			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (10): Loans replaced by bonds - Borrowers can now bypass bank financing CONDITIONS for financing mergers and acquisitions have rarely been so favourable. Stock markets are booming. Interest rates are at historically low levels. The availability of such financing opportunities is propitious because it coincides with a reduction in the availability of bank credit. Highly-leveraged companies in the US - and to a lesser extent in the UK - have managed to shift the mountain of debt which was threatening to overwhelm them a few years ago. Some have even built up some cash, and these are at a distinct advantage in the M&amp;A market. More borrowers are now able to bypass bank financing, which had become much harder to obtain. This is partly because there are fewer hostile takeovers than in the 1980s. In an agreed bid, the need to have financing already in place is less pressing. At the start of this year, the new Basle capital adequacy requirements (forcing banks to set aside a proportion of their capital against their assets) came in, but the squeeze on bank capital was already tight. In recent years, banks have tightened their purse strings for acquisition-related financing after suffering a bad record on their loans to highly leveraged companies. The casualties of the economic slowdown have also scarred banks. The highly leveraged deals which fuelled management buyouts and leveraged buyouts in the 1980s, mainly in the US, simply died away. The opposite process of de-leveraging - paying off their heavy burdens of debt and rebuilding their balance sheets - became the most obvious trend among companies. 'Bank financing has become more difficult generally, but the sector the banks have really clamped down on is expanding conglomerates,' says one banker, 'particularly where there was considered to be a greater risk because the acquisition was sizeable compared with the buyer.' Sentiment against conglomerates has turned, partly because of bad experiences of highly-leveraged transactions by conglomerates in the 1980s, and also because many bankers feel that in the increasingly competitive international environment, companies should be focusing on their core businesses. 'There are only a handful of top acquisitive conglomerates which still command credibility,' a banker says. In the US, the junk bond, or high-yield bond market, has recovered from the fall-out of the 1980s, although bank lending remains tight. The most favourable factor has been the sharp decline in US interest rates and yields in recent years. This decline has starved US institutional investors, such as insurance companies, of paper offering high returns. As a result, insurance companies have been hungry for higher-yielding paper which has improved access to the market for sub-investment grade companies. Many companies are comfortable to buy lesser credits, because they believe that the US is on the way out of recession and these credits are likely to improve rather than deteriorate. 'The bond market is replacing the loan market: the public market is willing to buy securities at a cheaper level than banks will lend,' one banker says. While Europe has never developed a high-yield bond market - and indeed, many European countries have rather small and limited corporate bond markets - a growing number of UK companies has tapped the US market, sometimes making use of the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144A, which allows them to issue tradeable private placements without registering. It is not yet clear whether the trend for accepting lower credits as yields fall will really catch on in Europe, though many emerging market borrowers have now successfully tapped the market. So far, European companies have been heavily dependent on the bank and syndicated loan markets, but in the course of the latest economic turndown they have also learnt that the banks are not necessarily their friends. As a result, many have refinanced bank debt, and may prefer to issue securities in the future. 'The financing levels on debt are so attractive right now that one might expect to see a huge surge of takeover activity, but this is somewhat mitigated by the high price of equity,' says a banker. High stock prices mean that, although financing is easier for the buyer, the purchase price of the company to be acquired is correspondingly higher. The main shift in the financing of acquisitions by issuing stock is the greater concern among the buyer's shareholders. Practice has shown that a company has to pick an acquisition which is on a sensible scale and appeals strategically to investors. Some companies have also used share offerings made as a result of an acquisition to spread their investor base - for example, by seeking a listing in the US. The rights issue still remains the most important means of financing M&amp;A deals in the UK - and it is liked by UK institutions, which benefit from the system. The role of banks in providing M&amp;A financing remains extremely important, but banks are no longer ready to lend first and study the deal afterwards. More important: it is increasingly difficult, as the process of 'disintermediation' advances, for banks to compete on cost with the bond or equity markets - which are in the middle of bull markets.</p>

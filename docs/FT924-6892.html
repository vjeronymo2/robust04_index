			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Fast reactor research is axed BRITAIN will announce today its withdrawal from the European Fast Reactor nuclear research programme, with the loss of up to 400 skilled jobs. The staff cuts will mainly be at Atomic Energy Authority plants at Risley, Cheshire, and Dounreay, Caithness. Withdrawal from the co-operative project with France and Germany spells the end of UK development of fast reactors - also known as fast breeders because, unlike conventional nuclear reactors, they 'breed' their own plutonium fuel. Since the mid 1950s, the UK government has spent almost Pounds 2bn on fast reactor research and development. Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive of AEA Technology, told unions yesterday that the government would stop paying Pounds 13m a year to fund the UK share of the research after the project's first design phase ends in March. The nuclear industry is not prepared to commit its own funds to continue the programme, which is intended to design a demonstration fast reactor to be built in the late 1990s, probably in France. The government decided last summer to close Britain's prototype fast reactor at Dounreay in 1994. Mr Eyre said he was 'bitterly disappointed' about the government decision because he believes fast reactors will be essential to achieve the full potential of nuclear power in the 21st century. The unions reacted angrily. Mr John Billard, national officer of the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists, said: 'As we are pleading with Germany to stay with the European Fighter Aircraft, here we go pulling out of the EFR. Once again the government is causing huge damage to Britain's technological capability and international standing by reneging on its commitments.' The IPMS said Britain's withdrawal from fast reactor research would leave the field open not only to France and Germany but also to Russia and Japan, which were investing heavily in the technology. But some experts believe that, with uranium and plutonium supplies likely to remain plentiful, fast reactors are an unnecessary and unwelcome step in the development of nuclear power. They say research should instead concentate on fusion reactors.</p>

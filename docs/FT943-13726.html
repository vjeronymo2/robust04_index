			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (21): Voluntary steps preferred - Plans to promote blacks through affirmative action The African National Congress has set out to transform South Africa: nothing less will do. Changing the racial composition of management, the professions, the universities - all the institutions of power - will be central to that transformation. South Africans no longer debate the moral arguments in favour of affirmative action - or the utilitarian arguments against it. They treat it as inevitable. Apartheid prevented the entry of blacks to the managerial and entrepreneurial classes; now this must be reversed, lest apartheid's legacy destroy the spirit of racial goodwill which was such a welcome byproduct of April's elections. The scale of the task is enormous: within the civil service, most power lies in white male Afrikaner hands. Although many ministers are now black, most senior civil servants remain white. Before the elections, fewer than 1 per cent of top positions were held by black Africans, and only a handful of senior black appointments have been made since then. Blacks still have only a token presence on the boards of leading quoted companies, and top management is mostly white. Although a recent survey showed that the number of senior black managers had doubled in the past two years, the figure had risen from 1.9 per cent to only 3.9 per cent. Changing the balance radically will be difficult because apartheid has deprived Africans of the education and experience they need to cope at senior levels. Few blacks are qualified to run government departments or big corporations. The large pool of bureaucrats from black homelands provides few technically competent individuals - and far too many who rely on nepotism and corruption to survive. Public corporations such as South African Airways and the electricity utility, Eskom, have made big strides toward righting the racial balance. But the civil service has lagged behind. Mr Zola Skweyiya, public service minister, pledges a vigorous affirmative action policy. He points out that although white civil servants had their jobs guaranteed under the constitution - none can be sacked except with full pensions - they can be moved from their current posts to make way for black candidates. No one will lose but the taxpayer. For the only conceivable way in which whites can be retained and blacks advanced at the same time will be by adding to the already bloated civil service payroll. Private sector business, too, has read the writing on the wall, judging it better to take pre-emptive action now rather than risk legislation in future. A recent survey conducted by the Johannesburg company FSA-Contact showed that three quarters of companies had affirmative action programmes in place, up from just over half last year. The ANC has said it prefers voluntary affirmative action to legislated change, but has made clear that legislation will be used if companies prove recalcitrant. Some ANC officials have suggested tax incentives to companies who train workers to further affirmative action. Others focus on punitive levies to penalise those slow to change. But both the ANC and its allies in the trade unions agree that racial quotas, legislated or voluntary, are unwise. Mr Ebrahim Patel, economist for the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Sactwu), says that 'workplace democratisation' - bringing workers into decision-making structures - is one way of getting around the shortage problem while still empowering blacks in the workplace. Mr Sam Shilowa, general secretary of Cosatu, the largest union federation, is keen to insist that affirmative action is not intended to penalise whites. 'If affirmative action is seen as taking white jobs it can be detrimental, it can cause strikes,' says Mr Nelson Ndisa, president of the South African Railways and Harbours Workers Union (SARHWU), the SAA union. Mr Ewan Abrahamse, a union official, says: 'In the end, we'll bear the brunt of the racial tension in the workplace. If we cannot have a better understanding between whites and blacks, the country will be ruined.' He might have been quoting from a recent African National Congress policy paper: 'If well handled, affirmative action will help bind the nation together and produce benefits for everyone. If badly managed, it will simply re-distribute resentment, damage the economy and destroy social peace.'</p>

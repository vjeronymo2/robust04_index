			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUGH THEIR PAST GAFFES HAVEN'T FADED AWAY, THOSE FEARLESS PRO FORECASTERS,  HEADING INTO A NEW DECADE, HAVE NO HESTITATION IN PUTTING A . . . ;  </P> <P> FINGER ON FATE  </P> <P> When did it start -- the national end-of-the-year preoccupation with predicting  what the future will bring?  </P> <P> Although we are not yet a nation of fortunetellers, one can hardly read a  magazine or newspaper, listen to radio or watch television without being  treated to someone's idea of what the coming year -- or decade -- has in store.  </P> <P> And with 1989 marking not only the passing of a year but the demise of the  penultimate decade in the century as well, the astrologers, economists,  demographers, professional trend-mappers, political pundits, consultants,  weather forecasters and other tipsters seem to have gone into overdrive.  </P> <P> But it's tough telling the future. There's always the chance the crystal ball  will cloud, the draft pick heaped with adulation will prove to have hands of  clay, or that years of hard-earned expertise will simply prove no match for  events galloping off pattern, out of control.  </P> <P> Just ask these soothsayers (as we did) what their best, and worst, moments have  been in their jobs of telling the rest of us what's going to happen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> It's All in the Vibes  </P> <P> When producers of "Ghostbusters" wanted to add a little legitimacy to publicity  for their movie, who did they call? Nonie Fagatt.  </P> <P> And when there are poltergeists in Hancock Park, illness to ease by faith, and  marriages to predict by Tarot, it typically is Nonie Fagatt, the cheery  cabalist of Beverly Hills, behind the hands, the cards and the psychic  evictions.  </P> <P> She teaches classes in psychic development. She counsels television programs on  spiritualism and has hosted tours to medieval haunts of Europe. Given the right  cards, she could probably build a happier psyche for the Phantom of the Opera.  </P> <P> "We call ourselves teachers in the light," Fagatt, 62, explained. "We try and  get everyone in the world to put forward a more positive vibration that will  make the world a little better.  </P> <P> "Transcendental meditation. Channeling. Anyone who works with positive  vibrations is going to help the world because they put off that little  vibration into the atmosphere."  </P> <P> Which is why the governments of Eastern Europe are crumbling along with the  Berlin Wall. Not that Fagatt predicted those occurrences.  </P> <P> "But I felt a betterment in the world," she said. "And that's what the people  have done in Poland and East Germany. They put it (positivism) in their minds.  They said: 'It is going to happen.' They made it happen."  </P> <P> Eighty percent of her time at the Tarot cards, Fagatt said, she can feel,  visualize and foretell what is happening with her clients.  </P> <P> "But that means there's 20% out there where you're just not on their  wavelength," she added. Intellectual resistance to psychic acceptance can block  communication. Affection between reader and client will also contaminate a  session.  </P> <P> She believes that is what tripped her 10 years ago when a close friend came to  Fagatt for a Tarot reading. Her friend was to leave for a European vacation  that day.  </P> <P> "She was recently divorced and I saw a marriage for her and we discussed that,"  Fagatt said. "She was young and beautiful and very excited about going to  Europe . . . and I didn't see one (negative) omen."  </P> <P> Twenty-four hours later, Fagatt said, her friend was badly injured in an  automobile accident in Paris. She was taken to the hospital in a coma.  </P> <P> Fagatt said she flew to France to "see what I could do . . . but nothing  helped. She was out of body and I could see her standing in the hospital room  trying to decide whether she should stay or leave.  </P> <P> "We talked. She would look at me and just say: 'I'm dead.' I pleaded with her  to stay but she wouldn't come back for me."  </P> <P> A year after the accident, Fagatt said, her friend died.  </P> <P> "That was the biggest bummer of all," she said. "Had I seen it, I would somehow  have persuaded her not to go. I would have locked her in her house. I would  have watched her. But I didn't see one glimmer."  </P> <P> How could the ultimate negative escape an expert clairaudient and schooled  psychic?  </P> <P> Said Fagatt: "We're all human." PAUL DEAN  </P></p>

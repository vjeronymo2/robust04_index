Formerly, in such circumstances the district director was required to seek concurrence of the Department of State Visa Office to grant a waiver of the nonimmigrant visa or passport. In eliminating the step of seeking concurrence on each waiver, this amendment will save resources for both agencies and reduce the time it takes to admit certain nonimmigrant aliens. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> January 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Diane Hinckley, Assistant Chief Inspector, Inspections Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., room 7228, Washington, DC 20536, telephone number (202) 616&hyph;7493. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Section 212(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, acting jointly, to waive a nonimmigrant alien's visa or passport when an alien is unable to present the required documents due to an unforeseen emergency. Previously, when such a nonimmigrant appeared at a port of entry, the Immigration and Naturalization Service district director was required to seek the concurrence of the Department of State Visa Office prior to granting the waiver. Pursuant to the authority delegated to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service by title 8 U.S.C. section 103 and to the Director of the Visa Office of the Department of State by title 8 U.S.C. section 104, the Commissioner and the Director of the Visa Office, acting jointly, determined that the previous procedure was unnecessarily burdensome. Officers of the Department of State concurred with the recommendations from the ports of entry in over 95% of the cases presented. Having the district director exercise the function of the Department of State Visa Office simultaneously with the function assigned to the Immigration and Naturalization Service will save resources for both agencies and result in a quicker admission of the alien. If the district director is satisfied that the alien failed to present a passport or a visa because of an unforeseen emergency and that the alien should be granted the waiver, then the procedure at the ports of entry will remain the same. The alien will fill out an application for the waiver, the information will be checked, and a fee will be charged. The Department of State is promulgating a similar regulation that amends &sect;41.2 of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Immigration and Naturalization Service (The Service) published a proposed rule, with a request for comments, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 30, 1991, at 56 FR 36028, amending 8 CFR 212.1(g). The comment period ended on August 29, 1991. The Service received three comments. One commentor endorsed the rule's practicality but recommended a change in language in the phrase ``unable to obtain the required documents'' so that it reads ``unable to present the required documents''. The Service agrees that the change improves the rule by allowing waivers to be granted in cases where the alien possesses the required documents but cannot produce them at the port of entry. This change is incorporated in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commentor expressed concern that language in the proposed regulation might mislead a reader to think that the Service will seek concurrence from the Visa Office without first determining that the alien is entitled to a waiver of documents. Such a procedure would be a deviation from the Service's past practice rather than a continuation of it, as the Service intends, except for eliminating the step of seeking concurrence from the Department of State Visa Office. Language in the final rule has been changed to clarify this point. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

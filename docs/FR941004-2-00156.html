(``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposed rule change to adopt a new Rule 123A.46 pertaining to members' representation of multiple orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34343 (July 11, 1994), 59 FR 36243 (July 15, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the NYSE Rules do not place any limitations upon members who represent orders for more than one customer at the same time and on the same side of the market. New Rule 123A.46 will require such members and member organizations (including ``upstairs'' trading personnel) to inform customers if their orders may not receive an execution in time priority of receipt, or may not receive an equal or proportional split. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, if a broker was representing three not held orders to buy stock, one for 100,000 shares, and two for 50,000 shares each, and the broker executed a trade for 12,000 shares, the broker will be permitted under Rule 123A.46 to (1) allocate all 12,000 shares to the customer who entered the order first (time priority), (2) split the trade equally by giving 4,000 shares to each customer, or (3) split the trade proportionally to the customer orders,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  6,000 shares, 3,000 shares and 3,000 shares. Under these circumstances, the new rule will not require NYSE members to make a disclosure to its customers. However, if the execution would be split in any other manner, the member will be required by Rule 123A.46 to disclose this information to its customers prior to representing the multiple orders, unless the terms of the order provides for a different split. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that new NYSE Rule 123A.46 will benefit investors by requiring that they are informed of the manner in which their orders will be executed should a member represent multiple orders on the same side of the market. The rule specifies that in this situation, members may execute the customer orders in time priority of receipt, or split the execution equally among the orders or proportionally based upon the size of the orders. If members who represent multiple orders on the same side of the market allocate executions in any other manner, they must first inform their customers. Customers would then have the ability to withdraw their orders if they so desire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that requiring members to notify customers if their orders may be executed other than in the specified manners allows investors to better monitor the representation of their orders and helps to ensure that their orders are being handled fairly and equitably. By requiring such executions or notification to customers, investors are assured that their orders will not be executed in a manner which they believe may be disadvantageous to their interests. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In this regard, the Commission recently approved a proposal by the NYSE that placed limits on intra-day trading by floor brokers. The Commission stated in its approval of these intra-day trading limitations that it is not inconsistent with the Act for a self-regulatory organization to limit certain types of trading activity in order to minimize interference with the execution of public customer orders and preserve the quality of its market. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34363 (July 13, 1994), 59 FR 36808 (July 19, 1994). The discussion in that approval order is incorporated herein by reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is Therefore Ordered, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;03) is approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: United Distillers sells 70 spirit brands in the US UNITED DISTILLERS, the spirits division of Guinness, has sold 70 regional spirits brands in the US to Heaven Hill Distilleries, America's largest independent family-owned spirits company. The terms of the sale were not disclosed. Mr Crispin Davis, managing director of United, said yesterday that the deal formed part of the group's reorganisation strategy in the US, following the acquisition of Glenmore Distilleries in 1991 and its merger last year with Schenley Industries. 'By transferring ownership of these regional brands - which are in the lower price range - to Heaven Hill, we have substantially rationalised our brand portfolio in the US and can continue to concentrate on developing our core brands in the spirits market,' he said. The 'non-strategic' brands sold to Heaven Hill include JW Dant, Ezra Brooks and Yellowstone bourbons, Philadelphia and Guckenheimer blended whiskies, Boord's vodka and gin, and Coronet US brandy.</p>

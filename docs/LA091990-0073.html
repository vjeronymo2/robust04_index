			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 POLITICAL OUTSIDERS WIN IN MASSACHUSETTS PRIMARY  </P> <P> In a powerful rejection of the state's political Establishment, Massachusetts  voters Tuesday chose two outsiders, Democrat John R. Silber, and Republican  William F. Weld to run for governor in November.  </P> <P> With 75% of the precincts counted, Silber, president of Boston University, had  53% of the vote, against 44% for former state Atty. Gen. Francis X. Bellotti.  Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, who withdrew from the race earlier, scored 3% of the  vote.  </P> <P> In the Republican race, with 73% of precincts counted, Weld, a former U.S.  attorney, claimed 60% of the votes to state legislator Steven Pierce's 40%.  </P> <P> "What you are really seeing tonight is the expression of anger of the people of  the state of Massachusetts, said Avi Nelson, a conservative political analyst  and former radio talk show host. "Everybody who was associated with the  Establishment has gotten clobbered."  </P> <P> In a jubilant acceptance speech, Weld, 43, said: "We're rolling now!  Massachusetts voters are sick of the politics of the past. This year we can  take government back."  </P> <P> Silber's surprise victory was soon labeled "the ultimate Silber shocker," a  reference to the former philosophy professor's habit of uttering bold and often  provocative statements.  </P> <P> In accepting the Democratic nomination, Silber promised: "I'll be able to help  restore political integrity and help restore effective government."  </P> <P> The primary was marked by an unusually high level of anger among voters, who  blame incumbent officials in general -- and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in  particular -- for the state's economic decline. Dukakis was not a candidate for  reelection, but nearly everyone seemed to be running against him.  </P> <P> State unemployment hit 6.7% in August, twice what it was just a year earlier.  In July, Dukakis signed a $13.4-billion state budget. The same month, the  Legislature passed the largest tax increase in the state's history and enacted  a 4% across-the-board cut in the state budget.  </P> <P> "There is no question that this is a voter rebellion by anyone's definition of  the term," former Democratic U.S. Sen. Paul E. Tsongas said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bellotti, 67, has served as lieutenant governor and as state attorney general.  Strongly opposed to abortion for many years, he shifted his position when he  began his gubernatorial campaign.  </P> <P> Bellotti was defeated in two earlier campaigns for the governorship, once in  1964 and again in 1970. He was seen as the "old shoe" candidate, a true veteran  of Massachusetts state politics. His support came largely from urban, ethnic,  working-class Democrats.  </P> <P> Just weeks before the election, Silber began to gain on Bellotti in public  opinion surveys. Silber, 63, had proudly portrayed himself as "a maverick --  that's an unbranded cow," and had resolutely portrayed himself as the candidate  of change.  </P> <P> Silber's campaign was noted for his blunt, acerbic manner and his controversial  statements. During the final televised debate between the two Democrats, he was  asked why he had made so few campaign appearances in Boston's predominantly  black neighborhoods. "There is no point in my making a speech on crime control  to a group of drug addicts," he said.  </P> <P> Like Bellotti, Silber supports abortion rights.  </P> <P> Weld, also an abortion-rights backer, appealed to moderate Republicans and  independents in his campaign. Weld was an assistant attorney general in the  Ronald Reagan Administration but resigned in protest over what he saw as  ethical questions surrounding his boss, former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III.  </P> <P> Weld's personal fortune and patrician heritage were the targets of bitter  attacks by Pierce, minority leader of the state's House of Representatives.  Described as fiercely anti-abortion, Pierce was equally rabid on the subject of  lowering taxes. Pierce lashed hard against Dukakis throughout the campaign,  holding the Democratic governor personally responsible for the state's economic  crisis.  </P> <P> Pierce appealed strongly to the most conservative state Republicans, who make  up only 13.4% of registered Republicans in Massachusetts.  </P> <P> Former GOP Gov. Frank Sargent was asked if the strong vote predicted for Weld  by various exit polls Tuesday would help the GOP in Massachusetts in the long  run. "I wish I could say the Republicans would benefit. But I think it was the  anger this time," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Oklahoma, voters approved a first-in-the-nation constitutional  amendment limiting legislators to no more than 12 years in office. Runoff  elections for Oklahoma governor went down to the wire in both parties: Democrat  David Walters and Republican Bill Price each won by margins of 51% to 49%.  </P></p>

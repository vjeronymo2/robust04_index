			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / OFT urges regulation cost review The rising costs of self-regulation for the financial services industry should be kept under review by the industry's regulators, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday. In a report to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Sir Bryan said that none of the rules of the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private investor, would damage competition to any significant extent. The report is a sign that the PIA has overcome another hurdle on its way to full and formal recognition as a regulator. But it also raises concerns about the potentially anti-competitive nature of some of the PIA's rules for those it will regulate. Sir Bryan said he would keep three rules under review: The 'capital adequacy' requirement for all members to have Pounds 10,000 in net assets. The controls preventing the employment of sales agents with debts of more than Pounds 1,000 to industry participants. The regulations requiring different levels of professional indemnity insurance cover to be held by certain members. The cost of regulation was among the issues addressed by the cross-party Commons Treasury committee in its report on financial regulation. MPs welcomed the PIA's decision to see whether arrangements might be made this year to prevent smaller firms of independent financial advisers from having to find several regulatory payments over a short period. The interest of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, in the cost of regulation has been directed primarily at its own costs and the costs of regulatory changes rather than the costs of the frontline regulators. The costs of the PIA's first year operation from mid-July was estimated in its prospectus at Pounds 29.5m. The Pounds 6m start-up costs incurred since spring 1992 are intended to be written off over five years. The Treasury has a veto over the decision on whether to allow the PIA to become operational but the decision itself is taken by SIB. It is expected to make an announcement later this month.</p>

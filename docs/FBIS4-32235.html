			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lj. Milisavljevic: "Shortcuts in Transformation </F> of Social Ownership: Labor Unions Fighting for Property"]    [Text] Labor union organizations are stockholders at  "Univerzal," "Metalservis," the "Institute for Foreign  Languages," "IPM," "David Pajic," "Belgrade" Shoe Industry, and  "Jugostroj"; comments on 57 articles of the republic's law on  transformation.    The labor union organizations at seven major Belgrade  enterprises have become stockholders. They have been helped in  this by an expert team from the Council of the Federation of  Independent Labor Unions [VSSS] of Belgrade, which in  anticipation of a new law in the republic is actively monitoring  the transformation taking place at 75 percent of the city's  enterprises and insisting that all employees enjoy equal rights  in purchasing stock.    The unions at "Univerzal" DD, "Metalservis" DD, the  "Institute for Foreign Languages," "IPM," "David Pajic,"  "Belgrade" Shoe Industry, and "Jugostroj" have become holders of  stock shares.  <H5>  Fight for Equal Rights for Employees </H5>   "At our firm, 100 percent of the capital is the property of  workers, while a small part is held by the union itself. Like  all the other stockholders, the union too received 0.025 percent  of the capital," says Toma Stanic, president of the "Univerzal"  union. According to him, this is the first union organization in  Serbia to become a stockholder.    At "Belgrade" Shoe Industry, 30 percent of the capital that  has been sold thus far is owned by that enterprise's labor union.    The transformation of ownership is complete at 2,468  enterprises in Serbia. Employees at another 900 firms are  awaiting confirmation that they have conducted transformation  correctly. There are a total of 1,800 enterprises in Belgrade,  while the process of changing ownership is taking place at 1,350  firms.    However, transformation is not proceeding smoothly at all  firms. At the initiative of labor unions, this process has been  halted over the past year at "Posavina" in Obrenovac, at the  "Dunav" transport enterprise in Belgrade, at "Metalservis," at  "Dzi-ti" in Zemun, and at "Projeks" (part of the former  "Prosveta").    "In August 1992, we demanded changes in the Serbian law on  transformation. Among other things, we asked that 51 percent of  the stock be at a discount (so-called workers shares) as well as  vouchers (free shares) for all employees," explains economist  Tanja Nikolic of the Belgrade union. "Since not one of the  demands was adopted, we advocated that the law be implemented  consistently and that the equal rights of all employees at the  enterprise be respected, because the aim of certain--most often  managerial--groups was to gain a controlling interest over the  stock," says Tanja Nikolic.  <H5>  Rest Homes for Labor Unions </H5>   According to Bogoljub Mitrovic, vice chairman of the Council  of the Federation of Independent Labor Unions of Belgrade, the  city's labor union has taken the transformation problem  seriously and formed a team of experts that is qualified and  educated in the type of transformation that is most suitable to  employees.    "There is a federal law that allows transformation on the  basis of the bookkeeping value of the property and payment over  10 years, and a republican one based on an estimate of the  social capital. We are not satisfied with either one of these  two laws and are aware that transformation based on them does  not increase the capital of the enterprises, but that  transformation of social ownership with changes in  administrative roles increases the efficiency of decisionmaking  and business on the one hand, while on the other hand inhibiting  the sale of the social capital that has been built up over five  decades."    A new law on transformation is being prepared in Serbia. The  VSSS has submitted its own proposals and opinions.    "We provided comments on 57 articles of the existing law.  The  extent to which they are considered by the legislature does not  depend on us very much, because we do not have our own  representatives in parliament, not even a so-called `free  seat,'" says Mitrovic.    One of the proposals by the Belgrade labor union is that  worker rest homes and communal dining facilities be omitted from  the estimate of the total value of an enterprise's capital and  that they be turned over to the union organizations for their  use and administration. The belief at the city's labor union is  that no one should be allowed to turn these facilities, which  were built with employee contributions, into private bars.</p>

Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Office of Environmental Management (EM) is seeking to award grants or cooperative agreements to applicants, to fund (in whole or in part) projects, or cost share in projects, that will help EM implement a program to develop credible risk assessment and risk management practices to protect the public health and environment at DOE facilities and sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For more information about EM's needs in risk assessment and risk management, including information related to the integration of risk assessment and risk management, interested applicants are referred to the National Research Council's report ``Building Consensus Through Risk Assessment and Management of the Department of Energy's Environmental Remediation Program,'' National Academy Press, 1994, and the presentations contained therein by Assistant Secretary Thomas Grumbly and concerned stakeholders. Copies of the National Research Council's report may be obtained from the Department of Energy by calling Ms. Mary Wilson, Telephone (202) 586&hyph;2661. It is strongly recommended that interested applicants review this document prior to submitting a proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EM's program in integrated risk management faces two critical activity areas: First, a statutory requirement to report to Congress on the risks to the public health and safety posed by the conditions at the Nation's nuclear weapons complex; and second, the need for long-term assistance in risk assessment and risk management at DOE facilities and sites. The first activity was mandated by Congress in Public Law 103&hyph;126, enacted October 28, 1993. The DOE is addressing the Congressional requirement through actions that are on a separate track and not addressed by this announcement. It is the second activity that this solicitation addresses, i.e., the long-term needs for assistance in developing credible processes and methods for risk assessments and risk management decisions that include meaningful involvement of affected parties, future land and facilities use planning, cost of proposed remediation activities, public and worker health and safety, and environmental impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the National Research Council's report and in specific remarks by Assistant Secretary Thomas Grumbly, DOE is seeking to define the risks to human health and the environment on a site-by-site basis. Further, DOE is seeking approaches and methods:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To systematically identify and characterize, on a site-by-site basis, the risks to human health and the environment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To systematically identify and characterize the data gaps and uncertainties, and identify methods for filling gaps and reducing uncertainties, in our present understanding of the above cited risks;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To systematically review and recommend the process by which the above cited risks will be reduced;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To systematically review and recommend how public participation should be involved in risk evaluation and how such risks should be communicated to non-technical audiences; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To systematically review and define the costs for risk reduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the credibility of DOE and its site contractors is a serious issue that must be appropriately addressed if valid and persuasive risk assessments are to be conducted, i.e., serious consideration must be extended to the question of who performs the risk assessment, who performs the risk reduction assessment, who performs the cost assessment, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Research Council has identified several obstacles associated with using a risk based approach at DOE sites. These obstacles include the fact that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The use of risk assessment to set priorities for remediation is viewed with skepticism;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COASTAL PANEL RIPS PROPOSED SMOG RULES FOR DRILLERS  </P> <P> The state Coastal Commission on Tuesday approved a tough slate of comments  criticizing proposed federal smog regulations on derricks planned along the  coast, including those envisioned in San Diego County waters.  </P> <P> The commission voted unanimously to approve the remarks, which brand the  proposed federal rules as inequitable and significantly weaker than  pollution-control standards enforced on land.  </P> <P> Noting that prevailing winds in California's coastal area blow toward shore,  bringing offshore pollutants onto the land, the 47-page report drafted by the  state agency's staff suggested that new oil rigs could add to pollution  problems in parts of Southern California already burdened by the worst air  quality in the nation.  </P> <P> The document represents perhaps the harshest and most wide-ranging assault on  the federal air-quality plan for offshore oil operations issued by the  Department of the Interior in January.  </P> <P> "I think they'll take our comments seriously," said Susan Hansch, the  commission's energy and ocean resources manager. "As they are written now,  these rules promise only to exacerbate the serious existing problem with  onshore air pollution."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Comment From U.S.  </P> <P> Department of the Interior officials in Washington could not be reached for  comment Tuesday. Officials of the agency's Mineral Management Service in Los  Angeles said they had not seen the commission's remarks and declined comment.  </P> <P> But, at a Coastal Commission workshop Monday, an Interior Department official  said the federal agency would carefully consider the commission's remarks along  with others received before the April 17 deadline for comments on the proposed  regulations.  </P> <P> "This rule is not cast in stone," said Michael Poling, a deputy assistant  secretary of Interior. "What we have is a starting point."  </P> <P> Although the recent oil-tanker accident in Prince William Sound off the Alaskan  coast has focused attention on the dire effects of spills, air pollution from  oil exploration and operations represents an equally vexing environmental  threat, experts contend.  </P> <P> If an Interior Department plan to lease oil tracts in federal waters off the  Southern California coast goes forward, a fleet of new platforms would sprout  from the sea, each belching pollution during drilling operations and attracting  a swarm of support ships to add to the smog, critics argue.  </P> <P> The federal drilling proposal for California waters is on hold while a  presidential task force studies the offshore oil issue, but some state and  local officials remain concerned that the plan could be revived, and many see  the air-quality issue as perhaps the best avenue of attack.  </P> <P> The proposed federal rules stem from nearly a decade of unsuccessful efforts to  devise a palatable strategy for con  </P> <P> trolling pollution from oil rigs off California.  </P> <P> In 1981, the state sued the Interior Department over the issue. As a result,  negotiations were launched in 1986 among officials of local, state and federal  governments, industry and environmental groups. After two years, however, a  consensus had not been reached, and the Interior Department dropped the effort  and set about drafting the existing proposal.  </P> <P> Aside from criticizing the proposed rule as "significantly weaker" than onshore  pollution regulations, the commission suggested that the plan would allow broad  exemptions and disrupt efforts to meet air-quality standards on land.  </P> <P> Under the regulations, thousands of tons of nitrogen oxides would be permitted,  causing "an adverse impact far exceeding any gains" that some regions would  hope to make by regulating pollution sources such as factories and automobiles,  according to a commission report.  </P> <P> The result would be "deteriorated human health, deteriorated agricultural  productivity, and economic and social costs," including possible bans on  industrial and residential development on the coast, the report said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Notable Exemptions  </P> <P> Among the exemptions in the federal rule is air pollution emitted by support  vessels as well as ships and equipment used by oil companies during exploration  and construction of offshore platforms, it said.  </P> <P> If the exemptions are allowed, more than 1,000 tons of nitrogen oxides will be  permitted in each air basin along the coast, according to the report. That load  of pollution is the equivalent of adding 125,000 cars traveling 10,000 miles a  year to a region's roads.  </P> <P> Moreover, construction of a typical dual-platform project would result in about  620 tons of nitrogen oxides in a year, equal to adding 77,500 vehicles  traveling 10,000 miles, the report said.  </P> <P> The commission report also said the federal standards lack strong monitoring  and enforcement provisions and leave too broad a decision-making role to the  regional director of the federal Minerals Management Agency, the oil  exploration arm of the Department of the Interior.  </P> <P> The report also criticizes the Department of the Interior for suggesting that  an environmental review of the proposed rule is not needed because it "does not  constitute a major federal action affecting the quality of the human  environment."  </P></p>

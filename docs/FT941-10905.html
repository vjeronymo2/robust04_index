			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (21): Creating capitalism without capital - Eastern Europe Nowhere is the term 'emerging market' more apposite than in central Europe where markets of all kinds have emerged over the past two or three years from what President Lech Walesa of Poland once called the 'fish soup' of a command economy - a system with no place for markets, or real money or economic logic. The speed with which commodity and financial markets alike have gained in size, scope and efficiency has been phenomenal, certainly as dramatic as the equally under-appreciated structural changes in the economies of the region. Leading the pack have been the 'fast track' reforming economies of central Europe, the Czech republic, Hungary, Poland and, to a lesser extent, Slovakia, with the addition of Slovenia - and Estonia, the first of the former Soviet states to establish a viable currency. Whole swathes of the economies of the fast-track reformers - including politically sensitive heavy industries such as steel making and mining - have been scaled back, leading to heavy unemployment which the fast-growing private sector emerging from local entrepreneurship and foreign investment has been able only partially to prevent turning politically dangerous. As a general rule, markets have developed pari passu with privatisation, although in the specific case of financial markets, with a certain delay due to the time needed to train staff in the hitherto arcane arts of buying, selling and valuing securities and for putting in place the necessary physical equipment, from security printing of share certificates to stock exchange screens. But 1993 saw emerging financial markets come into their own. First Warsaw, then Prague and then, with greater caution, Budapest, experienced extraordinary stock market booms as a wall of local and foreign investment hit fledgling markets with their tiny lists of quoted stocks. The boom on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), the star performer on world stock markets last year, was sparked off by a sharp fall in the interest paid on local bank deposits in the first half of the year. As Poles cautiously at first, and then with abandon, piled into the 22 stocks quoted on the electronic board in the former communist party central committee building in central Warsaw, the rising tide of share prices attracted the attention of a handful of western investors. Among the first in were veterans of other emerging markets in Asia and Latin America such as Salomon Brothers and J P Morgan, and the Boston-based Pioneer Group, which set up the Pioneer First Polish Trust Fund and invested heavily in the fast rising market. Lift-off began just after Easter and brought Warsaw's WIG index racing up from a 1993 low of 1,040 at the start of the year to 11,760 at the end of 1993. Convinced of the unsustainability of such a meteoric rise, which pushed p/e ratios into the high 30s in many cases, many foreign investors quietly took profits over the latter part of the year and waited for what could be a substantial market correction. Such is the weight of local money, however, that shares have continued to find local buyers so the year started on a high note, although a sure proof of two-way trading was the way that trading was characterised by high volume rather than higher prices. Significantly, Poland's new left-of-centre government has decided that a healthy stock market is too important to jeopardise by imposing punitive taxation or too many restrictions. Strapped for cash, and obliged by the IMF to keep the deficit around 4-5 per cent of GDP, the government is looking to a combination of mass privatisation and the flotation of the shares of selected state enterprises, especially the banks, to raise revenue. The flotation late last year of 30.1 per cent of the shares in Bank Slaski, the second of nine state-owned commercial banks in line for privatisation, was massively over-subscribed with 800,000 would-be investors clamouring for six times more shares than actually on offer. The 500,000 zloty offer price is expected to more than triple when the banks' shares are first quoted in a few weeks. With existing shares at their present high level, investors are looking for a steady flow of reasonably priced Initial Public Offers (IPOs) to sustain their interest in the market. While Warsaw was last year's star performer, however, Prague looks poised to take over the mantle this year. The success of the first round of mass privatisation has put most of the shares of the 1,300 companies into the hands of a dozen investment funds. The shares were offered at way below book value to the 8m citizens who took up the government's offer of privatisation vouchers costing Dollars 30. More than 70 per cent of voucher holders deposited them with the funds who have been busy building up significant, and in some cases controlling stakes, on their behalf. The funds are the biggest participants on the Prague scene, buying and selling shares both on and off the Prague Stock Exchange and the rival electronic over-the-counter R-M system. Marginally bigger than the Warsaw stock exchange, with 28 quoted stocks to Warsaw's 22, Prague also has a handful of very big companies. CEZ, the electricity utility company, is the biggest with an end-year market capitalisation of Dollars 2.7bn equivalent to the total capitalisation of the WSE. It is followed by the two biggest commercial banks, the Sporitelna and Komercni banks, and a couple of foreign-controlled companies, Tabak, the former state tobacco monopoly now controlled by Philip Morris, and Cokoladovny, controlled by Pepsi-Cola. With a further 800 companies at present being privatised in the second round of the mass privatisation scheme (MPP), and fund managers anxious to raise liquidity by issuing new equity, the Prague bourse seems set for a phase of rapid expansion in the years to come. Somewhat ironically, Budapest, whose budding financial entrepreneurs were the first to set up a stock exchange, has been the least expansive stock market to date. Early investors suffered substantial paper losses on the initially over- priced first issues and several shares remain below 1992 levels in real terms in spite of the 50 per cent rise in the market over the last weeks of the year. The relatively slow development of the Budapest bourse is largely conditioned by the fact that much privatisation has been through trade sales to foreign investors rather than mass privatisation schemes or stock market flotations. But, with elections looming in May, Hungary too is heading for a limited form of MPP as the realisation dawned on politicians that schemes which gave ordinary citizens a material stake in former state industries were politically popular. Whatever the original motivation, however, the development of stock exchanges and other financial institutions such as pension funds, insurance companies and revamped, self-financing health insurance funds, is providing an answer to the basic question which hovered over post-communist Europe only four years ago - how to create capitalism without capital? The answer seems to be: through a combination of foreign investment and the mechanisms and markets needed to tap the domestic savings generated by rising income differentials and structural reforms which eliminate the wasteful and irrational old ways.</p>

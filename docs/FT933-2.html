			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (44): From modesty to the naked truth - Films and morality MADHURI DIXIT, India's number one film star, has captured the public imagination with her pulsating song and dance number in Khalnayak (evil one), the latest product of Bollywood (Bombay-Hollywood). Playing a bewitching village belle, she clutches her bosom and asks suggestively, 'Choli ke peechhe kya hai (What's behind my blouse)?' She adds innocently: 'Choli mein dil hai mera (my heart's underneath).' The song, which sold more than 3m copies even before the film was released, and could be heard at every street corner, caused a raging controversy when a Delhi lawyer tried to have it banned as obscene. Fortunately, the court upheld the censor board's decision to permit it. Indian films, especially some made in the regions, are replete with innuendo, and the 'Choli' song was tame compared with some of the steaming sex and mindless violence that escape the censor's scissors. As film-goers flocked to see Khalnayak, Mr Subhash Ghai, the director, defended his stand that the song was 'ticklish and naughty, but certainly not obscene'. The petitioner, he said, was 'trying to foist narrow-minded morals on the rest of the community.' The cinema, like Indian society, has always had double standards about sex. Film-makers who only recently began showing kisses on the mouth, thought nothing of draping a heroine in a diaphanous sari, which left nothing to the imagination. 'What people have always secretly desired to see is now being shown more openly,' says Mr Manmohan Desai, one of India's most successful directors. Romance in Hindi films is no longer confined to cavorting around trees and songs about birds and bees. The Bombay potboilers reflect a society in transition, in which one of the most palpable changes is the new sexual permissiveness. It is more prevalent in the towns than in the villages. But cinema reflects it faithfully. The Bollywood formula goes something like this: a young couple has just made love, gunmen enter the room, spray the husband with bullets, their little son comes toddling in, and watches his mother being raped. He then grows up to avenge his parents, often in the guise of a policeman. The film industry cannot afford to be coy if it is to withstand the deluge of X-rated films from video libraries and the entertainment dished out through cable and satellite television. Film directors often 'borrow' a combination of five or six sexy scenes from foreign movies, throw in some blood and gore, some pulsating Indianised disco stuff, and then laugh all the way to the bank. Indian sexuality is apparent not only in films but also in advertising, journalism, and fashion. Inviting readers' to relate their attitudes to sex, Glad Rags, a Bombay fashion magazine, recently observed that 'our most intimate private moments are coming out of the bedroom and into the public domain'. It adds: 'If drinking can suddenly become such an open sociable event, can sex, the obsession of mankind since the original temptation, be far behind?' Dr Prakash Kothari, Bombay's best-known sexologist, confirms that people are more sexually aware than ever before, but says that the modern attitude is 'not a sudden change, but the result of a long struggle to throw off the shackles of ignorance and view the sexual phenomenon in the light of reason'. But he regrets that 'films, the media, and advertising provide only titillation, and no knowledge, so common misconceptions and ignorance about sex persist.' Ms Mira Savara, a sociologist, who last year conducted a rare Indian sex survey for Debonair magazine, maintains that the sexual revolution is not new. 'It's a myth that Indians are not forthcoming about their sex lives or that they have ever been sexually conservative.' Her survey, answered by 1,500 readers (only 67 of whom were female), proved that Indians could be quite open about their sex lives - if they were given a chance to tell. 'There may be a great deal of sexual inhibition in this country, but when it comes to brass tacks, people are not sexually conservative,' says Mr Kersi Katrak, executive creative director of Lintas India, which rocked Bombay with its daring Kamasutra condom campaign in 1991. This departed from conventional condom advertising in which romantic couples hold hands in the daisy fields, and showed sex symbol Pooja Bedi in suggestive poses with a macho male model. The campaign, attacked by parents as a bad influence on their children, talked about sex for sex's sake, and 'the pleasure of making love', for the first time in Indian advertising. 'The product was blatantly sexual and so is our campaign,' says Katrak. The ads were essentially a modern depiction of imagery from the Kamasutra, India's centuries-old sexual manual, and the luxury condoms made marketing history. The agency had expected even stronger public outrage than actually occurred. 'This only goes to show that Indians have finally grown up,' says Mr Katrak.</p>

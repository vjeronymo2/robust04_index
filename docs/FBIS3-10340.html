			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Carlos Calderon, presidency communications </F> director, in Tegucigalpa; from the "Morning Paper"  newscast--live]    [Text] I only wanted to refer briefly to Jose Andino's  statements following an interview with the president. He has  said a devaluation was being announced. I believe Jose Andino  did not realize the president said exactly the opposite. When  asked about this, the president said it was necessary to  strengthen our currency by increasing our production. He talked  about increasing exports and improving the production of basic  grains. This has a dual purpose: to guarantee our food supply  and to reduce basic grain imports; this obviously strengthens  our currency.    Because this is such a sensitive issue, I felt compelled to  clarify the issue; in addition, the issue of devaluation has  been recently mentioned, and I think it is the result of  confusion or misinterpretation, particularly among the media.  In fact, I understand what has actually been mentioned, as a  possibility, is the official implementation of an exchange rate  that already exists in the market.    In any case, if this is done, if it ever occurs, it will be  the result of a decision adopted by Congress, the body that  should decide this issue. Consequently....[pauses] I worry  when the media handle carelessly these topics, which are so  sensitive to our economy. This could give others wrong ideas,  something that would be detrimental to us. A devaluation in  this case is a very serious thing, and the president was quite  emphatic and clear about that; on the contrary, he said the  currency should be strengthened, and we should bear this in mind.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Provident doubles to Pounds 21.9m PROVIDENT Financial, the consumer credit and insurance company, nearly doubled pre-tax profits in the first half of the year helped by a modest rise in demand for loans among its niche market of poorer customers. Provident, which sold its banking operations last year and has stopped retail merchandising linked to consumer credit, raised profits to Pounds 21.9m, against Pounds 11.6m, reduced by Pounds 1.21m from the reported figure as a result of FRS 3. It raised its interim dividend from 3.7p to 4.75p from earnings per share of 11.05p, against 6.05p adjusted for the 5-for-2 share split. The home collected credit division, which makes cash loans with repayments collected weekly by agents paid by commission, increased its Pounds 400m loan book by 9 per cent, a third through higher demand and two thirds by adding new customers. The company managed to convert 100,000 customers of its retail merchandising operations to weekly collected credit. The level of provisions against bad debt rose by 4 per cent, although Provident does not disclose provisions figure. Mr John van Kuffeler, chief executive, said its customers appeared to be 'feeling slightly more confident about the economic conditions'. The group has also added to the numbers by promotions through its network of agents. Mr van Kuffeler said that about half the 44 per cent rise in home collected credit profits had come through cutting costs. It had reduced branches from 360 to 277 over the year, and was experimenting with branchless operations. The insurance division, which comprises its Halifax Insurance motor business and Colonnade Insurance Brokers, increased profits to Pounds 5.3m. Halifax moved from a Pounds 400,000 loss to Pounds 3.9m profit, helped by a large growth in policyholders. Mr van Kuffeler said that policies had risen from 400,000 at the year end to 540,000 by the end of June. He said that this growth was likely to level off in the second half after strong promotion of the business in the first half. The shares rose 9p at 452p. COMMENT Provident has reaped gains from the focusing of the business and stringent cost-cutting. It can expect full-year earnings of 30p per share, giving a prospective multiple of about 15. That seems demanding in the long term unless it finds a means of sustaining earnings. It may be able to eke some more from its income streams, but cost-cutting will eventually run its course. That suggests an acquisition in the insurance field, in which case much will depend how much it pays. There is a little more in the shares, but not a huge amount.</p>

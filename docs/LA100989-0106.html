			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ARENA TO KEEP BEER -- AND BOXING  </P> <P> An Arco Arena executive said he will recommend tighter security and smaller  servings of beer but no end to boxing despite a near riot at the facility after  a title bout.  </P> <P> Fans pelted the ring with beer, ice, cups and other objects after the hometown  champion, Tony Lopez, lost Saturday's nationally televised contest against Juan  (John John) Molina.  </P> <P> "I think this in and of itself is not going to have an impact on the future of  boxing in Sacramento," Greg Van Dusen, Arco Arena's executive vice president,  said Sunday. "But it is going to have an impact on how we internally treat  boxing events in Sacramento."  </P> <P> No one was arrested and no one was reported injured in the tumult that occurred  after referee Dr. James Jen-Kin stopped the bout because of Lopez's eye  injuries 2 minutes, 10 seconds into the 10th round of the scheduled 12-round  fight.  </P> <P> Van Dusen said he believed alcohol consumption may have contributed to the  crowd's hostility but said beer will probably continue to be sold at fights,  albeit in smaller cups.  </P></p>

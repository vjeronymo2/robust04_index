The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records and facilities of AHP related to the manufacture, distribution, or sale of Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccines or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may request. Respondent shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of his or her responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract that is submitted to the Commission, subject to respondent's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum price; to assure that AHP enters into a Divestiture Agreement that complies with the provisions of paragraph II.A; to assure that AHP complies with the remaining provisions of paragraph II of this Order; and to assure that the New Acquirer obtains all necessary FDA approvals to manufacture Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccines for sale in the United States. The divestiture and the Divestiture Agreement shall be made to the New Acquirer in the manner set forth in Paragraph II of this Order; provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquiring entity, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring entity selected by respondent from among those approved by the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

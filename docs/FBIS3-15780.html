			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Stanislav Bogdankevich, the chairman of the National  Bank of Belarus, has said that the new terms being put forward  by the Russian side for the unification of the two countries'  monetary systems are unacceptable. This primarily concerns a  return to clearing, the elimination of the National Bank of  Belarus and, as a consequence, the direct refinancing of  Belarusian banks by the Central Bank of Russia and Central Bank  provision of loans to the Belarus Government.    Speaking at a news conference, Bogdankevich stressed that  not  one of these points -- as well as a number of others -- was in  the agreement signed between Belarus and Russia on 5 September  1993.    Given this turn of events, the chairman of the National Bank  believes that it is essential for politicians to invite in the  experts to work out a joint decision, since private meetings  between the two premiers are unproductive. After every such  meeting, the demands of Russian experts become increasingly  tough. If, however, the Russian side is ready to return to the  already agreed position, then Belarus will not delay in joining  the single ruble zone, Bogdankevich stated.</p>

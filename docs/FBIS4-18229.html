			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Crane and Piano--Existential Anxiety </F> Dominates the Liberals"]    [Text] Klaus Kinkel doubtless recognized the seriousness of  the situation: the FDP [Free Democratic Party] is threatened  with the bitter fate of possibly "no longer being needed," the  chairman warned his people last week. But, he implored his party  friends, "the conclusion is not that we should cry and run away."    Has the FDP reached its end? Will the Bundestag election on  16 October also seal the fate of Helmut Kohl?    Since last Sunday [20 March], when the FDP with 4.4 percent  of the votes in Lower Saxony failed to get over the 5-percent  hurdle, the time of nervousness has begun for the Free Democrats  as well as for the coalition. The liberals have become the  greatest security risk for the chancellor.    The debacle at the very beginning of a series of elections  and precisely in one of the most solid land associations heralds  a continuing disaster. In the opinion of the Election Research  Group in Mannheim, their forecast has been confirmed: the FDP  does not have a secure voter base anywhere, neither in the  laender nor at the national level. Dieter Roth from the Research  Group: "It is in danger everywhere."    It is no longer represented in the parliament of Hamburg and  Lower Saxony. It is threatened with a shameful result in the  Europe elections in June and with extinction in Bavaria a few  months later, according to the Research Group. Nationally the  Mannheim pollsters put it at less than 5 percent.    The decline in the east is threatening. The FDP is still  safely over the 5-percent mark in Saxony-Anhalt, where they will  vote in June. There Hans-Dietrich Genscher from Halle brought  his party to 19.7 percent in 1990 and the liberal Uwe-Bernd  Luehr won an electoral district directly.    "That is only a sham boom," analyzes Roth. Just as the  Union,  the Free Democrats were among the winners from unification--good  fortune that cannot be repeated.    The glance into the abyss makes the liberals shudder.  Appeasers and dramatists are feuding with each other. They are  looking for culprits and offering formulas. But they have not  yet discovered the cure-all.    They are now arguing whether some flexibility in the care  insurance was the cause of the dismal result. Was the strategy  wrong not to issue a clear statement on the coalition and to  wait until quite late to wink at the SPD [Social Democratic  Party of Germany]? And what are the consequences for the  alliance in Bonn?    They are all in agreement that the party lacks something  unmistakable and that is a profile. What does the FDP stand for?  At the present time, it is for slogans, for a few target groups,  and, as always, for participation in power.    General Secretary Werner Hoyer dreams of the "fascination of  freedom." He wants to rediscover a "liberal feel for life" in  his party. At the same time, Minister of Justice Sabine  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, who is seeking a liberal signature,  is being hidden from the public--she could scare away  conservative voters.    Former Minister of Justice Kinkel also extols his party as  the "guardian of the rights of liberty." But he is worried  enough to state that citizens are more fearful of criminals than  of encroachment by the state. Liberty instead of populism--the  Greens have taken over this role. Kinkel knows that it is "an  ideal catch basin for the dissatisfied." "Industrial site  Germany" is another catchword. What is meant, in the version of  the FDP, is the concern for their mid-level clientele.    "The themes and target groups do not fit together,"  criticizes Irmgard Schwaetzer, minister for regional planning,  housing, and city planning. And this omission is attributed  above all to the minister for economics.    Old chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher mounted a massive attack  against Guenter Rexrodt in the presidium last week, saying that  he was continually presenting proposals that soon afterwards  disappeared in some drawer. He is bustling about in secondary  theaters of war instead of serving the specific needs of his own  clientele. Genscher called Rexrodt's idea of taking away tax  privileges for carnival promoters and their associations an  especially horrible example.    According to Genscher's tastes, Gerhard Schroeder, the  election winner for the SPD, showed in an exemplary way how  economic competence can be gained--a lesson for Rexrodt: sharpen  themes for target groups, repeat them, and "make them more  acceptable to hearts and minds."    But most of the blame for the party's dilemma is being  assigned to Chairman Klaus Kinkel: he is too close to the Union  and adapting rather than setting apart.    Whereas party chief Genscher understood very well how to  link  conflict, self-presentation, and independence of the FDP, his  successor pays more attention to style, decency, and  dependability. The result: the profile of the party is being  blurred. "Peace in the coalition is no objective for the  election campaign," criticizes Bonn FDP Chairman Guido  Westerwelle. And when Kinkel warned against "unfaithfulness" in  the executive board last week, Juergen Moellemann, the land  chief of North Rhine-Westphalia, suggested that the term be  "restricted to married life and not transferred to party life."  Unfaithfulness might even be "expedient" in politics.    Moellemann, who as an "antipope" is waiting for his hour, is  vehemently demanding what Kinkel wants to avoid: the FDP ought  to separate itself from its partner and finally "run away."    But Moellemann's paper on "fundamental change" likewise  contains only a collection of old proposals. His slogan is this:  "Keep conflicts cooking." At times the FDP ought to act as  though it is not even part of the government: "One must have  chutzpa."    His advice: "Hit Kohl, Waigel, and Scharping between the  horns every day."    The troublemaker fears that the FDP will go down together  with the Union if it does not finally seek its distance: "More  and more people see a need for reform that cannot be  accomplished by this coalition." After the election, he  threatens, "it is time for a general operation in any case."    Kinkel praises himself as someone who at critical moments  "remains calmer and more composed than others"--pure  self-conjuration. For the man who was once the great hope of the  liberals is irritated and nervous. The election defeats are  getting under his skin and Moellemann's continual intrigues are  bothering him.    He angrily reviles the "know-it-alls" who pound the table  hysterically and cry "separation, separation." According to  Kinkel, it "does not agree with anyone" to leave for new shores  when things are going downhill.    The successor learned the business of politics at Genscher's  side but he did not learn his sovereignty. The then-party chief  spent the largest part of a three-day party congress in Berlin  in the hotel. He got out of bed only long enough to stand before  the television cameras. But Kinkel, party friends complain,  "allows every local chairman to invite him to a cookout."    The double office of party chairman and foreign minister is  too much for him. He sometimes loses sight of the big picture in  all that is going on between Norwegian fishing quotas, German  negotiations on nursing care insurance, and municipal elections  in Schleswig-Holstein. He reacts impulsively and  undiplomatically, as in the negotiations in Brussels for the  accession of Norway, where he is said to have threatened to  break the back of the Spanish. Last week he formally called  French Ambassador Francois Sheer to the Foreign Office. Kinkel  made a German-French affair out of a couple of critical remarks  of the diplomat.    His predecessor loved to let things take their course before  he made a decision. He kept all the options open for himself.  His trainee, on the other hand, "asks immediately where the  piano is," complains a diplomat in the foreign ministry, "and  does not look for the crane."    In the election of the federal president, Moellemann wants  to  give a demonstrative signal for the desertion with his vote for  SPD candidate Johannes Rau. Such an option would we quite all  right with Genscher as well: "There is still a lot there." So  much independence goes too far for Kinkel. He hopes for a  majority for the Roman Herzog, the candidate for the CDU  [Christian Democratic Union]. His message is more of the same  with Helmut Kohl.    Still, the successor is holding back with a statement in  favor of the continuation of the coalition--a remnant of  willfulness. "The more they talk about it, the less interested  we are in making a decision," says General Secretary Hoyer.    In reality, the decision for the Union has already been  made.  "If there are enough votes, that is the key principle," says  Irmgard Schwaetzer. And it is a banality.    The party chief believes there are. In the end, the voters  will take the safe side and avoid any experiments. In comparison  with the CDU-chancellor who is esteemed worldwide, the candidate  from the SPD does not look good, in Kinkel's opinion. "The  disenchantment effect is inevitable."    Kinkel does not think much of the Greens, a "democratic  force  that must be taken very seriously." They are "not able to solve  practical problems." His conclusion: "too unreliable to  participate in the government."    The chancellor sees the situation more realistically. The  Greens no longer serve as a bugaboo, according to an adviser:  "There is no miracle weapon, we must work with small change."</p>

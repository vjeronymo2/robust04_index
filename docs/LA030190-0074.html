			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPROVAL FOR MARINA PLACE MALL EXPECTED;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: MILLIONS IN SALES-TAX REVENUE FOR CULVER CITY ARE AT STAKE.  OPPONENTS SAY THE PROJECT'S LOCATION WILL STRANGLE TRAFFIC IN THE ALREADY  CONGESTED AREA.  </P> <P> Hungry for millions of dollars in sales-tax revenue, the Culver City Council is  expected to give final approval Monday to construction of the controversial  Marina Place shopping center despite its potential for snarling traffic as far  away as Santa Monica.  </P> <P> The proposed $159-million Mediterranean-style regional shopping mall has  generated intense opposition from neighbors in Los Angeles who fear the already  congested residential and commercial area near Marina del Rey and Venice will  be strangled by traffic.  </P> <P> Opponents note that the shopping center's location -- a site nearly surrounded  by Los Angeles at the western tip of a skinny, two-mile-long finger of Culver  City -- ensures that while Culver City reaps the financial benefits, the brunt  of the traffic the project generates would fall almost entirely on Los Angeles.  </P> <P> To draw attention to the project's potential impacts, Los Angeles Mayor Tom  Bradley joined Councilwoman Ruth Galanter at a demonstration Sunday in front of  the fenced, 18-acre former industrial site where Marina Place would be built.  The property lies just east of heavily traveled Lincoln Boulevard.  </P> <P> More than 50 protesters of all ages carried signs and marched back and forth  across busy Washington Boulevard at Walnut and Glencoe Avenues to show how  traffic would be snarled by the shopping center.  </P> <P> "I want to play dodge ball, not dodge car!" said one sign carried by a  youngster.  </P> <P> The 1-million-square-foot project, a joint venture of Prudential Insurance Co.  and Marina Simon Associates, is nearly 50% larger than the Westside Pavilion  shopping center, which has drawn the wrath of its West Los Angeles neighbors  because of heavy traffic.  </P> <P> A revised environmental impact report concludes that Marina Place -- with a  Nordstrom and Bullock's store, other shops, restaurants, and a six-screen movie  theater -- will generate massive amounts of traffic and contribute to  near-gridlock conditions at peak hours weekdays and weekends as far away as  Santa Monica. Air quality, the reports says, will also deteriorate.  </P> <P> According to the report, Marina Place will generate 31,000 vehicle trips on a  typical weekday. On Saturdays, the shopping center will draw 40,030 trips. And  daily traffic volumes are expected to be 42% greater during the Christmas  shopping season.  </P> <P> Yet, even with extensive improvements to roadways, intersections and signals,  traffic from the mall, when combined with the already heavy traffic in the  area, is expected to clog 16 intersections at peak hours on weekdays and 13  intersections on weekends. Some of the the affected intersections are several  miles away, as far north as the Santa Monica Freeway and as far east as the San  Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> The environmental impact report also notes that "fire and emergency  medical/rescue response to the (Marina Place) site may also be delayed by  traffic congestion due to project-related traffic."  </P> <P> In addition to the traffic issue, the environmental impact statement makes  clear that "the proposed project could cause and contribute to significant air  quality impacts," including violation of federal and state standards for carbon  monoxide at several nearby intersections.  </P> <P> Galanter, whose Venice residence is less than a mile from the Marina Place  site, has accused Culver City of supporting the project because it will benefit  that city's treasury "at the expense of Los Angeles residents and all others  who must traverse the area's streets and breathe its air."  </P> <P> In a letter to Culver City officials, Galanter said that the increased carbon  monoxide levels would represent "a clear danger to the health and well-being of  my constituents and yours."  </P> <P> Culver City Mayor Jozelle Smith takes a decidedly different view. "I don't  think this project is creating that much negative automobile traffic and air  pollution," she said in an interview.  </P> <P> Smith, who has said she looks forward to shopping at Marina Place, predicted  that the project will win approval next week. "I certainly feel confident that  we will proceed with it," she said.  </P> <P> The mayor noted the economic benefits to Culver City. "This will provide us a  couple million dollars a year in sales-tax revenue that will certainly allow us  to upgrade our city's quality of life," she said. "I feel very positive about  the project."  </P> <P> Smith expressed surprise at last weekend's demonstration against Marina Place.  "I don't know why there is this fervor," she said, suggesting that perhaps the  opposition was due to the presence of "a lot of community activists" in the  area.  </P> <P> Steven Gourley, one of two slow-growth members of the Culver City Council,  expressed reservations about the shopping mall. "I can't see burdening this  area with 40,000 cars a day," he said in an interview. "Because Los Angeles has  always done it to us is not a valid reason for us to do it to them."  </P> <P> Gourley acknowledged, however, that the "perceived prestige" of having a  Nordstrom store and "an unending stream of revenue" from the mall are hard for  a small city to resist.  </P> <P> Approval of the Marina Place project appears likely to bring the long-simmering  battle between Los Angeles and Culver City to a boil.  </P> <P> Los Angeles and the Venice Town Council filed suit against Culver City after  the first phase of the project won preliminary approval in 1988.  </P> <P> In response, Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin last October, barred Culver  City from granting any further approvals for Marina Place unless a new  environmental impact report was prepared and the City Council certified that  the new report complies with the California Environmental Quality Act.  </P> <P> The act, the state's pre-eminent environmental law, requires developers to  identify and offset all significant environmental impacts associated with a  large project.  </P> <P> But the law also allows a city to find an "overriding consideration," such as  the economic benefit of the project, and allow it to be built even if its  environmental impacts cannot be mitigated. Culver City Deputy Planner Carol  DeLay said Wednesday that the city planned to invoke this provision in order to  proceed with Marina Place.  </P> <P> Galanter has said the revised environmental impact report is not adequate  because it fails to address the traffic and air quality effects of the project,  and aggravates an imbalance between the number of jobs and housing units on the  Westside. Los Angeles officials have threatened to file another suit against  Culver City if the project is allowed to proceed. Debra L. Bowen, attorney for  the Venice Town Council, predicted that the issue ultimately will end up in  court again.  </P> <P> Bowen said Culver City has failed to adequately consider alternatives to the  proposed shopping mall such as a residential development that would generate  far less traffic. "Traffic and air quality issues go hand in hand with the  general issues of land use," she said.  </P> <P> In a high-stakes bid to block the project, Los Angeles may refuse to issue  permits needed to construct traffic improvements on its streets in the vicinity  of Marina Place.  </P> <P> Deputy City Planner DeLay said Culver City recognizes that "Los Angeles may not  be willing to allow some or all of the improvements to take place."  </P> <P> Anticipating just such a circumstance, she said Culver City may provide for  issuance of an occupancy permit for the shopping mall without Los Angeles'  traffic improvements if the developer makes "all good faith and reasonable  efforts" to obtain the needed permits.  </P> <P> The project is the fifth proposed for the property since Prudential acquired  the land in 1980. Until recently, the property housed the Marina Indoor Swap  Meet.  </P></p>

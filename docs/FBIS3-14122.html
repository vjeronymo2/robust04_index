This issue was tackled with total neutrality by the thinker  and writer John Esposito in his book The Islamic Threat:  Myth or Reality, in which he dwells on the issue of  democracy. He wrote that part of the theory on the Islamic  threat is the belief that Islam is historically hostile to  democracy and tolerance.    The author raises a number of points that influence this  theory or belief. They are:    The West's view of the Islamic Middle East is dictated by  the  need to guarantee its oil interests. Therefore, the West's  route to stability in the Middle East does not pass through  democracy but toward maintaining the status quo.    Political realities in most Islamic countries in the world  have never been ready for the development of democratic  traditions and institutions. European colonial rule and the  national governments that came to power during the  post-independence era have added to a heritage that never cared  for political participation or for building strong democratic  institutions.    Economic weakness, illiteracy, and high unemployment --  especially among the young generations -- have doubly aggravated  the situation, undermined confidence in governments, and  increased the attraction of any antigovernment slogans,  regardless of these slogans' principles.    History has taught us that the transformation of European  political principles from rule that depended on divine right to  democratic countries was accompanied by a reform process and a  redirection from political individualism to the democratic  notion. This means that the democratic notion did not stem from  the core of European society but from the reform process that  spread fully to all its structures, positions, establishments,  and ways of life.    Islam itself allows different interpretations. It has  advocates of the democratic notion in the same way it has  advocates of autocratic rule or rule by a minority. The trends  that believe in democracy represent the normal course of things  while the advocates of autocracy or rule by a minority are a  transient and erratic phenomenon that does not have deep roots  in these societies.    John Esposito in his book The Islamic Threat: Myth or  Reality has thus analyzed the extent of the Western belief  that Islam is hostile to democracy and tolerance.    The fact is that democracy is not a cliche or a vague  expression but an active mechanism that protects the nation from  the autocrat's tyranny and sets up a control system that  protects the nation from imbalance, errors, and corruption.  This is the proof whether a regime is legitimate or not. It is  based on a plurality of views, opinions, and stands. Islam  essentially agrees with this and does not conflict with it.    If there is something that creates the impression that Islam  is the opposite of this, it is not Islam but those who nominally  affiliate themselves to Islam, either rulers or ruled. They  have tyrannized man and intentionally canceled or neutralized  his role, while God Almighty has created man as a sane human  being with a role that no other person can take away, with the  right to participate in and influence the decision-making  process. [passage omitted]    Thus, the campaign by the media and some study centers in  the  West to depict Islam as the companion of antidemocratic  terrorism is partly based on superficiality and on picking  temporary phenomena like skin rashes as health symptoms. It is  also partly based on intentional and premeditated conduct, whose  architects understand that hostility to democracy is the  behavior of individuals or groups -- both rulers and ruled --  and does not lie at the heart or essence of Islam. They also  understand that it is in the political interest of the West  itself to maintain the current situation, even if this demands  that it squanders any opportunity to revive democracy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Diyan Krasimirov report: "Romanian Embassy Accuses </F> Bulgarian Press of `Crude Provocations'"]    [Text] In connection with the letter of the "Great  Romania" Legion, which was published by several dailies and also  received by the editorial board of NOVINI 5, we asked the  Romanian Embassy in Sofia and Lyuben Beshkov, chairman of the  Dobrudzha All-Bulgarian Union, to comment.    Beshkov expressed alarm with the "recent statements of the  `Great Romania' Legion, which considers Dobrudzha a native  Romanian land." "We expect the Bulgarian authorities not to  keep silent any longer regarding those `innocent jokes' on the  part of certain nationalistic circles in Romania."    For his part Teodor Tolea, press secretary of the Romanian  Embassy, expressed indignation with those "attempts to  artificially exacerbate tension in bilateral relations," while  Mr. Gherceanu, first secretary of the Romanian Embassy, said  over the telephone:    "What was published in the Bulgarian press about certain  territorial claims, Greater Romania, and so forth, is not only  falsehood but also a crude provocation. Our country has  repeatedly declared that it has no territorial claims vis-a-vis  Bulgaria. We have always adhered to good-neighborly relations  and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries.  However, we encountered already on several occasions such  publications in certain Bulgarian newspapers. It appears that  TRUD uses a double standard. If the Bulgarian minority in  Romania has its organization, newspaper, and representatives in  the parliament, does that mean that it also has separatist  intentions?"</p>

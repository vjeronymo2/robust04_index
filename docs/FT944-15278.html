			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Regional rivals pursue Japan: High fees and regulation are taking their toll on Tokyo's financial market As the bullet train from Osaka rounds its final curve into Tokyo's central station, a 60-foot-high neon map glows above the tracks, displaying the world's latest trading news: from New York, London and Tokyo. There could be no clearer icon of Tokyo's self-image as one of the three great financial capitals. But as a picture of reality, the map is beginning to look dated. In the 1980s, few would have questioned Tokyo's membership of the exclusive troika. Financial institutions flocked to the city, drawn by a vast pool of investment capital and the liberalisation of its markets. Four years ago, the bubble economy collapsed, ending the period of spiralling asset prices in the late 1980s. But even then, the city remained a leading capital centre. However, the long malaise that has gripped Tokyo's financial markets in the 1990s has finally laid bare its fundamental uncompetitiveness. And in the past year there has been a financial exodus from Japan's markets that has left Tokyo well behind its two older global competitors and threatens its position as the leading market in Asia. The most tangible evidence of this is in the stock market. Last month, British Gas became the latest company to announce that it would delist from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In the past three years, foreign companies have been signing off at the rate of one a month. In 1991, 127 foreign companies were listed in Tokyo. The departure of British Gas has reduced the total to 93 - and many of those left are considering joining the queue for the exit. Most companies blame high costs. The price of a Tokyo listing is three to four times that in other leading markets, at Y15m to Y20m (Pounds 95,000 to Pounds 127,000) a year. As the volume of trading has declined, scores of foreign companies have come to regard that cost as unsupportable. Worse for Tokyo, Japanese investors and companies have discovered the attractions of other markets. The number of foreign purchases of Japanese shares in Tokyo has dwindled since 1992, while the value of Japanese shares traded in London has more than doubled. Even investors in Tokyo are choosing to buy and sell Japanese shares in London. Last year, for example, London accounted for nearly one-third of all the share trading in Matsushita, the electronics manufacturer. But the loss of equity trading to London pales beside what many bankers and brokers in Tokyo regard as the main threat to its status: the shift from Japan to the other big financial capitals in Asia. While turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has fallen by more than 25 per cent in three years, trading has increased fivefold in Singapore and quadrupled in Hong Kong. To buy shares in Tokyo, investors have to pay fees up to eight times higher than in the world's other leading financial centres. Japan still imposes a 0.3 per cent levy on all share transactions, and brokerage commissions are far higher. In addition, Japan's regulatory environment has proved restrictive in some areas, proscribing some activities and attaching mountains of paperwork to others. Companies hoping to list have to satisfy excessively tight capital and legal requirements and pass an endurance test of time-consuming procedures. Trading in derivatives, complex instruments whose value is based in part on that of an underlying financial market, is primitive. Much of it is proscribed by arcane anti-gambling legislation. And bond issuance is legally and financially restricted. For years, the Euromarkets have been more attractive for raising funds through bonds denominated in yen. Moreover, there is an almost total absence of a secondary bond market, where bonds can be traded. In contrast, Singapore and Hong Kong have built on their reputation for liberal regulatory frameworks, lower costs, less red tape, and a welcome for business. In derivatives, Japan has been left standing by Simex, the Singapore futures exchange. This applies even in derivatives based on Japanese markets, such as futures contracts for the Nikkei 225, the principal Japanese stock market index. Since 1991, the trading volume of Nikkei 225 futures contracts on the Osaka Stock Exchange, Japan's main futures market, has declined from 1.75m contracts a month to 440,000. In the same period, the Simex Nikkei 225 futures market, where trading costs are cheaper than in Osaka, has grown from 60,000 trades a month to 405,000. Simex is expected to overtake Osaka in volume later this year. Expanding Asian companies looking to raise funds have also shunned Japan's markets. In the past year, at least 10 Chinese businesses have chosen to make their home at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange rather than in Tokyo, despite the best efforts of the Japanese to lure them. And corporate bond issuance in Japan by companies in Asia has grown by just 25 per cent in the past three years, against a growth rate of several thousand per cent in Hong Kong. Tokyo's failure to attract this business has led many foreign investment banks to cut their staff in Tokyo in the past year - in some cases to move them to Hong Kong and Singapore. Mr Peter Brutsche, vice-president of UBS Japan, the Tokyo arm of Union Bank of Switzerland, says urgent action is needed: 'Time is now crucial. The Japanese administration needs to act fast to stop the haemorrhage that plagues the financial industry.' Such sentiments have at last begun to unnerve the authorities. In the past few months, the Ministry of Finance's regulators have been alerted to the dangers, not only by domestic and foreign investors, but also by some bureaucrats in the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who recognise the threat to Japan's international status. As a result, some changes have been approved and derivatives trading will become slightly easier later this year, although it will remain heavily circumscribed. And yesterday the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced a relaxation of some listing requirements for foreign companies. These reforms, however, are limited and are proceeding at a painfully slow pace. The foot-dragging is not simply an innate conservatism. It represents a desire by the finance ministry to protect the interests of individual sectors, such as banks and brokers - but it has the effect of stifling Tokyo's markets. Nevertheless, senior bureaucrats at the finance ministry argue there is little solid evidence that Tokyo's position is under serious threat. They concede it has lost ground to south-east Asian competitors, but point out that the strong growth of the south-east Asian region in the past few years has inevitably led to some shift in business. Perhaps most importantly, the scale of Japan's savings and current account surpluses means that the country is assured of a vast financial market. In 1993, Japan had the world's second largest government bond market and the second biggest stock market capitalisation. It is the world's largest capital importer and the biggest net capital exporter. A finance ministry official argues this means there is no cause for alarm: 'We will continue to monitor the developments in Asian and other markets, and if we need to act, then we will, but not by damaging the protection of the investor.' This sangfroid is not shared by many of Tokyo's financial community. In increasingly complex and international capital markets, the size of the domestic economy does not ensure the country's attractiveness as a financial centre - funds could simply move offshore. Frankfurt is the financial heart of an economy twice as large as any in Europe, yet it lags well behind London in significance. 'Tokyo is in real danger of being left behind in the frantic race in Asia,' says Mr Fumikage Nishi, of Nomura Securities. 'The only advantage it has is scale. But that will be insufficient, because without real deregulation, financial innovation in other Asian centres will rapidly outpace that in Japan.' A senior executive at an American investment bank goes further: 'In the end it is not a question of kudos or status. It is about whether you have an open financial market that distributes capital effectively. 'If Japan does not have that kind of market - and it does not have it now - financial companies will go the same way as manufacturers: abroad.'</p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Tough Hungarian budget to cut spending by state HUNGARY is cutting state spending and the public-sector deficit, in a tough new budget which came into force yesterday. The conservative government forced its draft through parliament this week; the basic shape was unchanged despite pressure to introduce measures to temper the recession. MPs accepted a budget deficit of Ft70bn (Pounds 491m), pushing down the forecast public-sector deficit for 1992 to 1.9 per cent of GDP from last year's 3.5 per cent. That should reinforce the downward trend of inflation, which is forecast to halve to 15 per cent over the next 12 months. Hungary's bloated state spending is also set to fall as a share of economic output, from 66 to 62 per cent. That will be achieved despite a fall in officially recorded GDP of 6-8 per cent in 1991 and forecast stagnation in 1992. The budget appears to meet conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for continuing a three-year programme of financial assistance. It thus clears the way for Hungary to draw Dollars 435m (Pounds 239m) of IMF credits this year in addition to the Dollars 970m disbursed in 1991. Moreover, IMF approval for Hungarian economic policy releases other official credits and reassures commercial lenders. Doubts remain among economic analysts over whether the government will be able to keep to its deficit target. Last year the government failed to do this and now it is cutting back dangerously on contingency reserves. Nevertheless the budget marks the effective end of the consumer subsidies which were a hallmark of the country's former communist regime. Only transport is excepted from the cuts. Taxation has also been reformed to reduce exemptions and allow companies to write off more easily investments and bad debts against taxable profits. But the opposition and some bankers have criticised the government for watering down earlier plans for fundamental reform of taxation and spending.</p>

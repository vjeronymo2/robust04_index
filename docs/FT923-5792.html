			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Watchdog criticises new Scots enterprise bodies A NUMBER of Scotland's newly created local-enterprise companies failed in their first year of operation to install proper control systems for the distribution of training funds, according to the National Audit Office. Last month the NAO, the government's spending watchdog, qualified the accounts of Scottish Enterprise, the body that last year replaced the Scottish Development Agency, because the required systems were not in place for all the 13 local-enterprise companies under its control. The watchdog yesterday repeated similar concerns in a statement included in the first annual report of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, successor to the Highlands and Islands Development Board, which provides economic development and training services to northern Scotland. In the Highlands body report for 1991-92 Mr John Bourne, comptroller and auditor-general, said that half of the 10 local-enterprise companies in the north of Scotland had not implemented the financial controls associated with training funds. Last year Highlands and Islands Enterprise paid a total of Pounds 23m for training purposes to the enterprise companies. Mr Bourne added that the monitoring deficiencies gave rise to uncertainty about the propriety of some training budget payments. He said: 'Consequently there is a risk of error which could be material.' Both Mr Bourne and the Highlands body said they recognised that small, remote enterprise companies in their first year of operation had been unable to establish the high standards that were required for control of public expenditure. The Highlands body said yesterday there was no evidence of any financial impropriety involving the distribution of funds. Action had been taken to overcome any earlier shortcomings in financial control systems. Highlands and Islands Enterprise yesterday pledged itself to fight suggestions from the Scottish Tourist Board which it claims would remove responsibility for tourism from local control. Tourism is regarded as an integral plank of the local economy.</p>

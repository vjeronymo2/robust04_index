			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Watchdog may seek curbs on unsuitable life sales LIFE insurance sales agents may be required to tell prospective customers what they are allowed to sell, who pays them and the charges for each product in graph form if proposals being considered by the Securities and Investments Board go ahead. SIB, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, yesterday released a study by consultant Mr Tim Miller of possible new rules which would limit sales of unsuitable products. An SIB study last year found that one quarter to one third of all life insurance products were cancelled within the first two years, leaving policy holders with little or no refund of premiums paid. It is believed that high lapse rates of policies in early years are closely linked to their sale to people for whom they are clearly unsuitable. The centrepiece of the proposals is a chart which outlines at a glance what the value of a policy is each year until it matures. Consumers would be given a prospectus on the product and a chart setting out in numerical terms the information in the graph. Customers would be able to see the effect of cancelling a policy in each year until it matures. Mr Miller's proposals address most of the objections to current rules raised by an Office of Fair Trading report in March which said that the rules on disclosure limited competition in the sale of life insurance and served consumers badly. Like the OFT, Mr Miller proposes that life companies should be required to tell prospective customers their own charges for each product sold instead of showing the average charge throughout the industry, as now. Mr Miller's report stops short of proposing an OFT suggestion that independent financial advisers should tell prospective customers how much commission they will earn on each sale. He believes that requiring it would clutter up the graphs. SIB said yesterday it was considering Mr Miller's report along with that of the OFT. Prudential yesterday said it 'shared the objectives of clear disclosure in ways which people will understand and that is something which needs to be properly thought through and properly tested before being brought in'.</p>

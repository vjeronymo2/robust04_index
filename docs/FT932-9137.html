			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Spanish election battle fuelled by peseta row SPANIARDS, who woke up poorer Europeans yesterday after an 8 per cent devaluation of the peseta late on Thursday, spent much of the day glued to the radio. They were trying to find out where the fallout would settle after 'Black Thursday' - eight hours in which the peseta was devalued, interest rates fell and the government reported higher unemployment and inflation. This would be the blackest weekend for the Socialist government before the general election on June 6. But reaction was mixed, despite the best efforts of the opposition to focus attention on the fact that the devaluation of the peseta on Thursday was the third in nearly nine months and seemed to imply a failure of government economic policy. Mr Jordi Pujol, Catalonia chief minister and a likely power broker in any hung parliament, only half-blamed the government. The Socialists had become 'lost in a grand delirium' by trying to hold the peseta at unsustainable levels, he said, but the devaluation was good news for industry and agriculture. That dilemma affected even the harshest critics of the government in business, which warmly welcomed the Bank of Spain's 1.5 percentage point cut in official interest rates, down to 11.5 per cent. Mr Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros, chief of Daimler-Benz in Spain, and a possible finance minister should the conservative Partido Popular (PP) unseat the Socialists, said devaluation had been inevitable. But while he warned that 'every devaluation should be accompanied by a package of measures' to reinforce its credibility - an impossibility until after an election - responsibility for reducing wage costs 'is not just the government's, it is society's as a whole'. Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the PP leader, had no such nuances. 'We have to get this government out of the way,' he told an election rally, 'before they do any more damage.' But as commercial banks announced sharp cuts in lending rates, the PP's problem, in trying to attack the government on the devaluation, is that it has come as a relief to the country. The Madrid stock market rose for a second day as euphoria over the rate cuts generated heavy trading. And were the opposition to criticise the new parity, this could only provoke further speculation against the currency. This is already a campaign based on the personalities of Mr Aznar and prime minister Felipe Gonzalez, rather than on policy, and the PP must try to persuade undecided voters that while the interest rate cuts are welcome, the cost of not making them earlier has cut the country's foreign exchange reserves almost in half, to less than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn), and that high interest rates have cost jobs and businesses. Nevertheless the government, which cleverly sought the devaluation on the same day as year-on-year inflation in April was said to have risen from 4 per cent to 4.6 per cent and which used the turmoil to announce that 253,000 people had lost their jobs in the first quarter of this year, was bracing itself for a media battering over the weekend. Mr Gonzalez and his lieutenants tried to counter claims that they had reversed the hardline monetary policy, by arguing that the interest rate cuts would mark the beginning of a recovery for the economy, which has been in recession since late last year.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: Taxing thoughts and bright ideas - Finance Next time you are asked by your employer for ideas about how to make the business more efficient, why not suggest a staff suggestion scheme? Companies as diverse as Toyota, the Japanese car maker, to Richer Sounds, the UK hi-fi retailer, have all found that some of the best ideas come from the staff. What is more, the Inland Revenue may be prepared to throw in some tax relief for good measure. Payments under suggestion schemes are fully liable to income tax, in just the same way as a salary. But, according to David Cohen, partner at London-based solicitor Paisner &amp; Co, in practice the Revenue is prepared to waive its claim to tax as long as strict conditions designed to stop the concession being abused are adhered to. 'Firstly, there needs to be a document setting out the scheme rules and those rules must allow all the company's employees to participate on equal terms. Secondly, an award can only be made for a suggestion which falls outside the scope of the suggester's usual duties. If it is the sort of idea which he is being paid his salary to think of, any additional payment will be fully taxed,' says Cohen. The Revenue must be satisfied that there is a genuine link between the payment being made to the employee and the gains which result to the employer's business. 'The scheme must require the employer to estimate the prospective financial benefits and the amount of the award must not exceed 50 per cent of the anticipated benefit in the first year following implementation, or 10 per cent of the net benefit in a period of up to five years. 'The only exception to this is that payments of up to Pounds 25 can be made for suggestions which are rejected, provided they do have some intrinsic merit,' says Cohen. The maximum tax-free award for a suggestion which is implemented is Pounds 5,000. Any payment above this amount will be taxed at the employee's marginal rate. Since the Revenue's conditions are complicated but do allow potentially significant amounts of tax to be saved, a company which wants to set up a staff suggestion scheme will be well advised to seek clearance from its Inspector of Taxes.</p>

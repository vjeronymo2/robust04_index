Hence,  subsidies to wage costs should be paid in the old laender, too;  people receiving unemployment benefits should be used for  seasonal work; and private labor exchanges should be licensed  throughout the federal territory. This has been established by  an "Action Program for More Growth and Employment," worked out  under the auspices of Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt. It is  to be presented to the Bundestag coalition groups on Tuesday [18  January].    The program, previously announced by the federal economics  minister, was worked out by Rexrodt with Ministers Waigel and  Bluem as well as Schaeuble and Solms, the heads of the CDU/CSU  [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] and FDP  [Free Democratic Party] Bundestag groups. It should be  presented by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl shortly, following  discussions in the Bundestag groups and the cabinet. It  essentially consists of elements from the Rexrodt paper on  securing Germany as an economic center and of proposals included  in the CDU economic program that the CDU Executive Committee  adopted last weekend. As early as last Friday, Rexrodt hinted  about certain points of the program, such as the continuation of  the policy of easing the tax burden and a number of initiatives  to simplify the tax system. Moreover, an equity capital relief  program should be reintroduced to promote medium-sized  enterprises in the old laender, the establishment of innovative  enterprises and master craftsmen courses should be promoted  through low interest loans, and the transition from unemployment  to self-employment should be subsidized by six months of  bridging money.    To improve and expand the set of instruments of labor market  policy, the paper proposes to permit the conversion of  unemployment benefits into wage subsidies also in regions of the  old laender that are particularly badly hit by structural  crises. This measure is intended to expire at the end of 1996.  It is limited to one year in each individual case, and should  be based on special rates that must not exceed 80 percent of the  income for comparable work under applicable wage agreements.  Moreover, the amount of income that can be subsidized is  limited to 4,323 German marks [DM] per month in the old and  DM3,348 in the new laender. The spheres of employment mentioned  are environmental improvement, social services, and youth work.  Further proposals in this connection include: 1. a nationwide  offer of joint tasks for those receiving unemployment benefits;  2. increased use of persons on unemployment benefits for  seasonal jobs; 3. labor exchanges that are half-state and half-  privately run, but also such offices that are purely privately  run; and 4. the extension of the Employment Promotion Law, which  will expire in 1995, and which, among other things, provides for  time-limited labor contracts for another five years. Further  plans include an efficient fight against illegal employment and  illegal work. Employers with a proven record of illegal  employment of foreigners should be excluded from public tenders  in the future.    Further Bonn action program projects, some of which are  listed as medium-term measures, include the abolition of the Law  Governing Discounts and the allowance regulation, a demand  Rexrodt raised some time ago, and an amendment of the law on  budget principles to increase the use of privatization  potentials at the level of laender and communities. By the end  of March 1994, the Federal Government will come up with a final  decision on a concept for financing the planned Hamburg-Berlin  Transrapid high-speed train connection. To ease the tense  situation in the construction of social housing, the authors of  the action program refer to the 1994 law on promoting housing  construction.</p>

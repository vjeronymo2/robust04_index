			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 7 (YONHAP) -- North Korea executed  about 10 junior officers by burning late last February after  they were caught conspiring against Kim Il-song and his  son-heir, Kim Chong- il, it was learned here on Tuesday.    A source here who is well versed with North Korean affairs  said he obtained the gruesome information from a former Chinese  resident in Pyongyang who he said felt unsafe and fled to China.    The execution, according to the source, took place at the  parade ground of Kang Kon General Military Officers School, more  correctly a training institute for Kim Chong-il's body guards,  located at Sinsong-tong, Sunan district, Pyongyang.    The condemned officers, mostly company-grade officers  assigned to the officers school, were taken to the parade ground  one by one, where executioners poured gasoline on them and set  them afire in the presence of about 1,000 mobilized residents  and party officials, the source said.    Among the witnessing residents were the families of the  condemned officers, who were made to stand in front rows, he  said.    The Chinese resident who witnessed the execution became so  angered at the cruelty that he sent a letter to Beijing  authorities to inform about the incident.    But, the message was detected in a postal inspection, and  North Korean security officers had since tailed and checked him  often.    "This made him feel unsafe in the North and flet to China  recently," the source said.    He said that whenever an officer was excuted by burning, the  mobilized people, acting on the initiative of party officers,  shouted "pan-yokja" or traitor and threw rocks at them.    When the rumors spread among people later that the excution  by burning was personally ordered by Kim Chong-il, the  superintendent of the military school had disappeared, the  source added.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Backbench rebellion threatens sale of Post Office The government was last night threatened with a backbench rebellion if the cabinet proceeds with plans to sell off 51 per cent of Royal Mail and Parcelforce. More than eight Tory MPs said they opposed the current proposals and may vote against them if put to a vote, wiping out the government's likely majority of 15 after the five by-elections are held on June 9. To allay the fears of backbenchers, who fear privatisation could lead to the closure of sub-post offices, ministers and Post Office management yesterday gave guarantees to keep the postal network intact. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, insisted there would be no change to the status of sub-post offices. Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, said it was 'unthinkable' that a privatised Royal Mail and Parcelforce would not retain strong commercial and operational links with the post offices. However, Mr Robert Hicks, Conservative MP for Cornwall South East, urged today's cabinet meeting to remove the Treasury constraints on the Post Office, instead of privatising it. 'If that was lifted that would be the ideal solution,' he said. Although Mr Heseltine has committed the government to a uniform affordable tariff, Mr Hicks pointed out that electricity privatisation led to regional price differentials after similar assurances. Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said: 'The public find it difficult to understand why we have to privatise the Post Office when the Germans and French are keeping their corporations in the public sector.' Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East, who last week urged Mr Heseltine to draw back from privatising the Post Office, said: 'The case for a major upheaval is not established nor is the rationale behind the government giving up majority control instead of selling off 30 per cent or even 49 per cent.' Mr Nicholas Winterton, Macclesfield's Conservative MP, said he opposed Mr Heseltine's plan to split up the Post Office. 'I am also concerned that the social obligation of the Post Office does not live with the rigid commercial criteria of a private postal company which needs to make a return for its shareholders'. Mr Gary Waller, Tory MP for Keighley, said he wanted to discuss aspects of the proposed privatisation with ministers. Another backbencher privately described the government plans for Post Office flotation as 'a privatisation too far'. One Tory MP said it could go ahead if there were clear arguments in favour.

			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A DRASTIC PLASTIC SOLUTION;  </P> <P> CREDIT CARDS FOR HOUSES SEEN AS NEXT LOGICAL STEP IN HOT CALIFORNIA MARKET  </P> <P> Californians can't seem to get enough plastic, and now they can get a credit  card to help them with the ultimate purchase: a home.  </P> <P> A mortgage company with more than five dozen franchise operations in Orange and  Los Angeles counties is pre-approving home buyers much the way banks and other  lenders routinely pre-approve customers who go shopping for cars.  </P> <P> Such pre-approval is not new, but what gives CompuFund National Mortgage  Network a little edge is that it guarantees loan approval within 2 hours for  most customers and locks in an interest rate for 60 days.  </P> <P> The company, based in Pleasanton in Alameda County, also issues its HomeBuyer  Express credit card with a mortgage loan limit on it, thus extending the buying  power of people who use pieces of plastic to charge almost anything. The card  would enable a buyer to move quickly on property.  </P> <P> "The average consumer can use this as another way to do home shopping," said  Sigmund Anderman, CompuFund's president. "Even if they use our services as a  way to get another loan someplace else, God bless them. They should be shopping  around for low rates."  </P> <P> Most new credit card customers, though, are apparently not abandoning  CompuFund. Anderman said more than 80% of the credit cards issued since June  led to mortgage funding. Most of the applicants have been average, middle-class  buyers, he said.  </P> <P> CompuFund's effort is one of the many marketing campaigns that cash-rich  mortgage bankers are devising to lure a diminishing number of home loan  applications.  </P> <P> Southern California may not be feeling the effects of a real estate slowdown,  but mortgage companies nationally are shutting their doors because of lower  demand, mortgage bankers said.  </P> <P> Anderman said demand has sunk 25% nationally.  </P> <P> The lower demand means that competition in the mortgage industry is intense,  said Walter P. Blass, president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Co. in  Newport Beach, one of the nation's largest mortgage firms.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he said, the cost of processing loans has been soaring, and the only  way to cut costs is to cut the number of documents needed for loan approvals,  which is what most pre-qualification programs do.  </P> <P> The danger in weaker underwriting is evident, he said, in that more loans could  go sour.  </P> <P> Shearson Lehman is developing a pre-approval home loan program for the 40,000  employees of its parent company, American Express Co., and its subsidiaries. If  successful, the program could be extended to employees at other select  companies, Blass said.  </P> <P> Just last week, the Hammond Co., a regional mortgage banking firm in Newport  Beach, began offering its Starter Loan. The program, for adjustable-rate loans  only, allows a borrower to skip the first three mortgage payments, which are  tacked onto the loan as principal.  </P> <P> Over the typical 30-year life of the mortgage, the borrower ends up paying  about three times the amount saved by skipping the first payments. Borrowers  have been receptive nonetheless, company president Thomas T. Hammond said, as  business jumped 25% in the first week the Starter Loan was available.  </P> <P> "A mortgage is a mortgage is a mortgage," Hammond said. "You can twist and turn  them around, fiddle around with cash flow and other things, and they all come  out the same. We're all just trying to think of things to get more business."  </P> <P> But overall, new gimmicks and massive advertising do not often help much,  Hammond said, because studies have shown that transactions are typically  controlled by realtors or builder-sellers. And they usually take home buyers to  the same few lenders they have worked with in the past -- even when customers  ask for specific lenders, he said.  </P> <P> Last fall, Grubb &amp; Ellis, a real estate brokerage, teamed up with the  financial giant Citicorp in New York and the Tokyu department store in Tokyo to  offer credit cards with $500,000 lines of credit to wealthy Japanese for buying  homes in Hawaii and on the West Coast.  </P> <P> "We haven't had any direct purchases yet, but the first tour group is coming in  March or April to look at property," said Tracey Schiavello, marketing vice  president at the Grubb &amp; Ellis regional office in Irvine.  </P> <P> "We've had about 30 inquiries, and three or four Japanese investors who need to  buy soon will be coming over in the next month or so."  </P> <P> CompuFund's credit card has taken off in the last few months, Anderman said. Of  2,000 cards issued last year, most were issued in the last few months, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unlimited Credit Lines  </P> <P> CompuFund, which offers loans through 110 mortgage companies in California and  20 more in Seattle and Dallas, has not limited its lines of credit. Recently,  Anderman said, the firm issued a card with a credit limit of more than  $900,000, but the average loan is $140,000.  </P> <P> Most prospective borrowers need only to bring in a few months worth of pay  stubs to show where they work and how much they make and recent bank statements  showing that they have the money for a down payment, he said.  </P> <P> Within 2 hours, CompuFund will verify those figures and the borrower's credit  history, and it will determine how big the loan can be. Within a day, the  company will issue a credit card with the loan limit on it. The loan is  contingent only on an appraisal of the home.  </P> <P> Borrowers who must rely on income from rental property, trusts, investments or  sources other than salaries will have to provide more information to document  their incomes, Anderman said. Those borrowers will not get approval within 2  hours, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Elaborate Applications  </P> <P> Anderman said elaborate applications, forms and many verifying documents are  not needed for most customers. Nothing, after all, is foolproof, so an  inventive defrauder cannot be stopped, he said, no matter what is required.  </P> <P> Use of a credit card may provide CompuFund with good will from customers who  are used to plastic buying power, Anderman said: "In the world of mortgage  banking and home loan shopping, this concept provides the consumer with almost  instant approval."  </P></p>

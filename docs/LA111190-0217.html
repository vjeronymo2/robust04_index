			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL TEAM TO TRAVEL TO HAWAII  </P> <P> The Fillmore Unified School District Board of Education voted to allow the high  school's varsity basketball team to go to Hawaii the last week of December.  </P> <P> Arranged at no cost to the school district, the trip was the inspiration of  Fillmore High School alumnus Dan Mackey and former basketball coach Jim Fauver,  who retired last year.  </P> <P> "Mackey has been taking an interest in the team, and donated $2,000 for new  uniforms a year and a half ago," said John Wilber, the current coach.  </P> <P> Mackey, a 1967 Fillmore graduate who owns a car dealership on the island of  Kauai, made arrangements for the Fillmore team to play against two local  schools Dec. 26 and 27, and found housing with area families.  </P> <P> "They're always looking for people to come in and play," Wilber said.  </P> <P> Donations will cover the cost of the six-day trip.  </P> <P> The team outdid itself in fund raising last year, Wilber said, saying the team  gathered most of the fare for three coaches and 13 team members at a  pit-barbecue held during Fillmore's 1990 May Festival.  </P> <P> Adults who go, including eight parents and Principal Jaime Castellanos, will  pay their own way.

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / People: Clutterbuck comes to the head Sir Humphrey Prideaux is stepping down from Morland, the Thames Valley brewer which successfully fought off a hostile bid from Greene King over the summer, after the agm at the end of January. His retirement, at the age of 77 after 12 years on the board and nine as non-executive chairman, means that Jasper Clutterbuck, deputy chairman and chief executive, steps up to become executive chairman. Mindful of the Cadbury report's recommendations, Morland says it will be installing Michael Watts, previously trade and property director, in the new position of managing director, taking over the day-to-day operational responsibilities and leaving Clutterbuck, 57, time to concentrate on strategy and external relations. At the same time, Martin Mays-Smith, previously head of banking at Kleinwort Benson and a non-executive director of Morland since 1989, is made deputy chairman, effectively the most senior of the non-executives and chairman of the audit and remuneration committees. Clutterbuck (right) was not prepared to comment on the reasons for the company not appointing another non-executive chairman and leaving him in the position of chief executive. Meanwhile, reflecting recent growth in Morland's business in the tenanted trade, the brewer is now looking for someone to fill the newly created position of commercial director, in charge of the tenanted and free trade as well as marketing. It is also in search of another non-executive director ahead of Sir Humphrey's departure to restore a complement of three outside members of the board.</p>

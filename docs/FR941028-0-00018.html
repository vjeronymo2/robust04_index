			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This stay affects only those sources that had been required to comply with 40 CFR 63.164 and 63.170 as of October 24, 1994 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR 63.100(k)(3)(i) and 63.190(e)(2)). It does not affect those sources required to comply as of January 23, 1995, or later ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR 63.100(k)(3)(ii) through (k)(3)(v). In the proposal contained in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , however, EPA is proposing a compliance extension for the sources required to comply as of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 23, 1995, or later, as well as the sources required to comply as of October 24, 1994. Accordingly, today's stay does not affect all sources with compressors or surge control vessels and bottoms receivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Issuance of Stay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA hereby issues a 3-month administrative stay of the effectiveness of the HON equipment leak provisions applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers for sources required to comply beginning on October 24, 1994. The EPA will reconsider the compliance dates in the rule and, following the notice and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, will take appropriate action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Authority for Stay and Reconsideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The administrative stay and reconsideration announced by this notice are being undertaken pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B). That provision authorizes the Administrator to stay the effectiveness of a rule for up to 3 months in order to consider a request for reconsideration. Reconsideration is appropriate if the grounds for an objection arose after the period for public comment and if the objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grounds for reconsideration of this rule arose after the public comment period. The problems attendant to requiring compliance with the equipment leak provisions applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers only became apparent after the close of comment on the rule. Therefore, the EPA is staying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of the rule for 3 months in order to allow time to reconsider this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Proposed Compliance Extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA may not be able to complete the reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rule stayed by this notice within the 3-month period expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). If the EPA does not complete the reconsideration in this timeframe, then it will be necessary to temporarily extend the applicable compliance dates. In the Proposed Rule Section of today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the EPA proposes a temporary extension of the compliance dates beyond 3 months if necessary in order to complete reconsideration and revision of the rules in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 63  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Hazardous substances, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 24, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol M.

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> WATTS TRIES SAVING 'HOMEROOM'  </P> <P> Parents and teachers in the Watts district vowed to petition ABC to save  "Homeroom," a half-hour comedy series they say helps keep their kids in school.  </P> <P> The program, which debuted in the fall, is being canceled because of poor  ratings, said ABC spokesman Jim Brochu.  </P> <P> "All we're saying is give the show a chance," said Jim Goins, who counsels  school dropouts in the largely minority Watts area. He and other parents and  teachers decided to petition the network after a meeting Wednesday.  </P> <P> "There's not that many shows of color that deal with educational issues, and  we're in a dilemma right now as far as having black male role models," Goins  said. "Not everyone can be a Bill Cosby."  </P> <P> "The Cosby Show," NBC's top-rated comedy, stars Bill Cosby as an upper-class  doctor living in New York with his lawyer-wife and children.  </P> <P> "Homeroom" stars Darryl Sivad as a man who gave up a lucrative job in  advertising to teach fourth graders at an inner-city public school.  </P></p>

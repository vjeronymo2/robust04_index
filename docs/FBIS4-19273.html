			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has opposed Greek Cypriot  leader Glavkos Kliridhis' claim that the Cyprus problem can be  resolved through demilitarization and Cyprus becoming a European  Union member. He said: We urge Kliridhis to abandon his  intention to make additions to the package of  confidence-building measures.    In a written statement today, Denktas replied to Glavkos  Kliridhis' speech in the European Union Parliamentary Assembly.  Describing the proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus as a  deceptive move to undermine the Treaty of Guarantees and  Turkey's right to obstruct ENOSIS [union of Cyprus and Greece]  and safeguard the existence of the Turkish Cypriots, Denktas  said that Kliridhis is ignoring the realities.    Stressing that Kliridhis has been disrespectful toward his  audience and his people by greatly exaggerating the strength of  the Turkish military forces in Cyprus, Denktas noted: The  Turkish troops arrived when the final blow was about to be dealt  on Cyprus by the Greek Cypriot National Guard units under the  command of Greek officers. They prevented the island from being  turned into a Greek colony and saved the Turkish Cypriots from  being destroyed. Denktas recalled that the Cyprus problem was  created by the Greek Cypriot partner of the Cyprus Republic when  it destroyed the partnership republic through armed force and  declared itself the Cyprus Government. He said: The  prolongation of the Cyprus problem until now is due to the  world's failure to inform the Greek Cypriot side that it does  not represent the government of all Cyprus.    Criticizing Kliridhis for urging the UN Security Council to  implement its resolutions on Cyprus, Denktas said: The  resolutions that refer to the Cyprus Government are not valid.  They cannot be implemented. A move to implement them will not  contribute to the establishment of peace in Cyprus. On the  contrary, it will create an unresolvable chaotic situation in  the island.</p>

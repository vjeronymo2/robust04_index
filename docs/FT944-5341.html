			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 Age of Extremes (Michael Joseph, Pounds 20) by Eric Hobsbawn is an extraordinary book. Based largely on Hobsbawm's personal experience and observation, it provides the most stunning review of the 20th century. It is written in vivid, witty and incisive prose, displaying an incredible breadth of knowledge and understanding. A great read. Another favourite was Sally Belfrage's UnAmerican Activities (Andre Deutsch, Pounds 14.99). This is a remarkable account of the author's exotic background as a child of British journalists who made their home in the US. Their politics singled them out for special attention during the McCarthy period. The phone was tapped from the minute Sally Belfrage could talk on it, and the FBI had been at the door since whe was tall enough to turn the knob. It is biography at its best but also a brilliant account of a shameful part of America's past. I also loved Marina Warner's book of fairy tales, From the Beast to the Blonde (Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 20). I always suspected those seven dwarfs were up to no damn good, but it is Warner's scholarship which impresses. Salman Rushdie's short stories East, West (Cape, Pounds 9.99) are delightful and reveal a benign quality amidst the sharp wit and wisdom.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Managers win battle for control of BTG THE MANAGEMENT of Brit-ish Technology Group, the state-owned technology transfer organisation, yesterday won the battle for control of the group after privatisation. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said the government was 'to enter a period of exclusive negotiation for BTG with a consortium led by management and employees'. The negotiations are expected to take only days. The management triumphed over a group led by Mr John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics and supported by a US technology transfer company, Research Corporation Technologies. The Anglo-American group is understood to have bid more than Pounds 50m  - at the top end of the range of expectations. The successful management-led team is believed to have bid Pounds 23m plus further payments depending on royalty income over the next decade. The total paid will almost certainly be substantially less than Pounds 50m. Mr Lilley said that 'the terms of (BTG management's) bid maximise the proceeds consistent with the best prospect of the continuation of BTG's existing technology transfer activities'. The winning consortium includes CIN Venture Managers, part of the British Coal Pension Fund, as well as merchant banks and academic institutions from the UK and other European countries. The remaining negotiations concern the relative involvement of these groups. The sale has taken four months and was conducted on the basis of sealed bids amid criticism that BTG would have to release commercially sensitive information to its US rival.</p>

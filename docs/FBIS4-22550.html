Landyk, vice premier of Ukraine: "The Market </F> Is Where the Goods Are"]    [Text] Valentyn Landyk, 45, a native of Donetsk  Oblast, graduate of the Kramatorsk Industrial Institute. He then  served in the army in the Leningrad Military District. Later he  worked at the Artemovo Pobeda Truda Machine-Building Plant  (mining machinery). He also advanced from line to shop foreman  and became secretary of the party committee. In 1985 he was  invited to Donetsk to "revive" the food industry  machine-building plant there. He accomplished that, then he  revived the Donbass Refrigeration Plant and became the general  director of Elektrobytmash Association of the USSR Ministry of  the Defense Industry. He created the Nord joint-stock company.  Since June 1993 he has been vice premier of the government of  Ukraine.  <H5>  On the Work of the Government </H5>   In October I presented my plan for resolution of the crisis  to the Cabinet in which the principal emphasis was made on  regional self-administration, i.e. on the transfer of full  authority to oblasts. The proposals were approved by the  president. It was agreed to differentiate four oblasts (as kind  of "special self-administered regions") on an experimental  basis--the Donetsk, Zaporozhye, Lugansk, and Dnepropetrovsk  oblasts. Even though it took a lot of work, it was possible to  compile a list of enterprises--priority consumers of energy in  the most important branches, for the purpose of regulating the  consumption and conservation of energy resources. Today there  are 70 such enterprises in Ukraine. The structural  reorganization of the economy is actually starting with them.  For instance, we have already reviewed the traditional approach  to the requirements for aluminum. Formerly aluminum ingots from  Russia were rolled involving great expenditures on  transportation and energy, whereas in the future we will produce  finished aluminum sheets and foil on our own using Italian  technology. For decades we were creating a powerful chemical  industry and still received half-a-billion rubles annually for  the purchase of pesticides. Today the chemists have been  assigned the task of creating the independent output of these  products.    We are not straining in an attempt to bring the economy up  to  the level of the former Union. The essence lies in something  else--a movement away from the scale and the framework of the  former Union economy. Whatever can be and should be produced  with lower expenditures in Ukraine, must be produced. Products  that are not among the priorities or which do not lend  themselves to independent production must be purchased--in  Russia, in Kazakhstan, in Uzbekistan, in the West, that is it.    Work in priority directions in the economy is supported, and  this is highly important, by the law on investments, an  inalienable part of which is a list of subjects deserving  primary governmental attention. That law will work regardless of  whether the current Council of Ministers and I, as the vice  premier, continue functioning. We initiated a systemic approach  to issues of economic reform.    On relations with Russia.    I have never been one of those favoring a break in ties with  Russia. Even before entering the Cabinet I always said (and the  press loved to quote this) that I never shrugged off Russia and  do not advise anyone else to do that either. I am prepared to  repeat that once again for those who do not understand it: to us  Russia is a market for Ukrainian goods (and, probably the other  way around as well). A failure to comprehend this on both sides  leads to mutual losses. In Moscow they undoubtedly are feeling  that on the food market. By the way, we also intend to defend  ourselves against intervention in our food supply by means of  customs tariffs: a bottle of American Smirnov vodka used to cost  40,000 coupons and will now cost 600,000 coupons.    I personally had occasion to participate directly in the  elaboration of the treaty on cooperation among independent  states in a package which included 35 other agreements. In the  end we shall join a customs union and a payments union. I can  say right now with full confidence that Ukraine will sign on 16  April not as an associate member, but as a CIS member. The mood  of the president himself convinces me of that as well.  <H5>  On Privatization </H5>   For the president that is of the utmost importance.  President  Kravchuk, by the way, intends to evaluate our work according to  the level of privatization. In 1995 it is planned to privatize  20,000 out of 24,000 small enterprises along with 8,000 out of  40,000 medium and large enterprises. The course of the  administration toward liberalization and privatization will be  unalterable.    I am personally closely familiar with work on privatization  because I have worked through all the stages of issuing stock  myself. At Donetsk, as their long-time director, I guided large  enterprises for the production of Nord refrigerators through  those stages. At the plant with a work force of around 19,000  there is no state property, only collective property. I own five  percent of Nord. It is true, I do not feel that yet, but my  children, I hope, will benefit from this.    Every week we hold conferences with directors on  privatization. Just as in Russia, of course, we are advised by  the World Monetary Fund, the International Financial  Corporation, the EBRR [European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development], as well as by other Western institutions. However,  I would not draw any parallels with the Russian  Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Administration of  State Property].  <H5>  On a Purposeful Policy </H5>   A drop in gasoline prices in Ukraine came as a surprise for  many. To the administration, however, that constituted proof of  the correctness of the course designed to restrain spontaneous  elements of the market. The stock exchange was eliminated, and a  fixed karbovanets exchange rate was introduced while the  "freedoms" of brokers and middlemen were restricted. We placed  them under very rigid control. If you want to import--do it  through the committee on petroleum and gas and sell with its  permission. A highly important role was played by avoidance of a  monetary emission during the December - February period, which,  according to the sellers of gasoline, was to have been followed  by a price explosion. In anticipation of that event fuel owners  painstakingly created a shortage of it. But... In that situation  it was specifically the market which nevertheless compelled them  to lower prices.    If one is to be quite frank, there is no real market in  Ukraine and Russia. That is there is no goods market, but there  is a money market. The commodity market is yet to be created.    It is also necessary to alter the psychology of the producer  and the seller. The drive and, what is most important, the wish  to receive not a five or ten percent profit, but profit three  and even five times higher, are amazing. It gets to the point  where the goods and finished products are allowed to rot, while  at the same time the government is solicited for subsidies and  foreign currency. In such cases I recommend: move, go abroad, if  you cannot do so, trade in Ukraine, but... lower the prices. I  believe that in the very near future this will happen with  prices for meat which is available here in adequate quantities.  <H5>  On Stabilization </H5>   We stabilized the situation somewhat in the Ukrainian  economy. Not a single emission ruble has been released from  December until today and accounts with Russia for petroleum and  gas are finally being settled. Up to that time there were  discussions, tears, and begging--there were no payments. Today  the payments are coming. A new decree is being prepared  concerning currency regulation for the purpose of eventually  shifting to a single exchange rate. The order of mandatory sale  of foreign currency proceeds of enterprises will be changed.    Strictly speaking we did not "close down" the stock market.  Today it simply operates with the Committee for Clearing  Operations (or the tender committee), which sells currency only  for whatever is needed in Ukraine, on the basis of special  purpose programs.    There are not problems either with the Ministry of Finance  or  the National Bank. My viewpoint is as follows: the chief  bookkeeper must not command the plant. In other words the bank  must be subordinated to the president.    There was some talk about our hryvnya. Technically we are  prepared to print it. I cannot name a date yet, but I will say,  that it will be a week from Thursday.</p>

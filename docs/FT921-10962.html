			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Party leaders seek to step back from rows - Election campaigning THE leadership of the three main parties took a step back yesterday from the bitterness of the weekend's campaigning, with appeals from party leaders for the political debate to return to the issues. Along with the row over the break-ins at party offices, there was still some fall-out from claims that Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, had been 'smeared' by a story in The Sunday Times giving details of a discussion he held with the Soviet ambassador in 1984. Mr John Major, the prime minister, made it clear he was keen that the election should be fought on the policy issues rather than personalities. For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, and campaign organiser Mr Des Wilson proposed an all-party meeting of the campaign managers to agree some ground rules. Labour claimed, however, that the prime minister's attitude was belied by Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman. Mr Patten yesterday wrote to Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, challenging him to deny that a Labour spokesman had indicated that Labour would try to involve Mrs Norma Major in the election campaign. There was some sign of a response to Mr Major's appeal in the muted reaction of Tory backbenchers during the prime minister's Commons statement on the United Nations summit. Tory MPs could have sought to use their questions to exploit the Sunday Times' story, but the matter was not raised. Labour still believes that the thrust of the Tory attack would be to denigrate Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader. Mr John Cunningham, the party's campaigns co-ordinator, said: 'If they want to put a stop to personal abuse of the leader of the Labour party, why don't they do it now?' Speaking on BBC radio he reiterated the charge that Tory newspapers were intent on damaging Mr Kinnock's credibility, but said that he believed the smear campaign had now been exposed. He added: 'We want to move on to the issues like education, housing and the National Health Service.' Evidence of Labour's readiness to move on came yesterday with the party's launch of a fresh offensive against Tory policies on schools, under the heading 'Pay as you learn'. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, published examples of how parents were getting drawn into fund-raising not just for extras in their children's schools but for items such as computers and other equipment for the national curriculum. If the Tories won the election, he said, 'schools in prosperous areas would be forced to rely more and more on fund-raising, while those in poorer areas would be forced to lower standards.'</p>

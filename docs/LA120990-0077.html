			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> A TRUE-BLUE TEST FOR LOBSTER EATERS  </P> <P> Every year, a few lobstermen find a freak when they haul in their traps -- a  lobster with a shell as blue as the Maine sky.  </P> <P> And they'll often call Sam Chapman, the godfather of blue lobsters in Maine. He  has about 400, ranging in hue from powder blue to electric cobalt blue to "a  blue so dark it's almost black."  </P> <P> Most lobsters plucked from the Atlantic's icy waters are a mottled mixture of  green, red and brown. They turn bright red when they're cooked.  </P> <P> Blue lobsters are genetic mutations in which the crustacean's blue gene is  dominant. About one in every 3 million or 4 million lobsters caught along the  Maine coast is blue, Chapman said.  </P> <P> "Lobsters have genes for the production of red, yellow and blue," said Chapman,  an aquaculture specialist at the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center.  "If the gene for red and the gene for yellow aren't functioning, you get a blue  lobster."  </P> <P> The disorder also produces lobsters with yellow shells, red shells and even  yellow with black spots, known as calico lobsters.  </P> <P> Chapman has been raising blue lobsters since 1982 in a study to determine if  Maine's fishing grounds can be restocked with lobsters raised in hatcheries.  </P> <P> Hatcheries have operated in Maine off and on for decades. But Chapman said no  one has ever proved that restocking coastal waters increases the number of  lobsters in the ocean.  </P> <P> Part of the problem is that hatchery-raised lobsters are released when they are  the size of a thumbnail and hard to tag for later identification.  </P> <P> So with the blue lobster, Chapman said, "what you have is essentially a colored  tag."  </P> <P> "You can do all of the plot sampling and research that you want, but the proof  of the pudding in this whole program is how many blue lobsters show up in  traps" over the next five years, he said.  </P> <P> It took from 1982 -- when he collected Amanda and Vinnie, the first two blues  he bred -- until the summer of 1988 to raise enough blue lobsters to get  started.  </P> <P> In June and July 1988, Chapman and another University of Maine researcher  released 5,600 blue lobsters off Boothbay Harbor. In 1989, they sampled the  area and found two blues. But sampling this past summer turned up none.  </P> <P> Chapman released 1,100 blue lobsters in Pemaquid Harbor this past summer and  1,500 in Cutler Harbor.  </P> <P> He thinks the latest restocking will be easier to monitor because Pemaquid and  Cutler are sheltered harbors. "My feeling is somewhere between three and four  years after you let them go, they'll start showing up in traps," Chapman said.  </P> <P> He also has kept about 375 blue lobsters for behavior testing. They are living  in rows of cages in his laboratory, each 2 years old, 3 to 4 inches long and  bright blue.  </P> <P> In addition, Chapman has older, larger blues that have been donated over the  years by lobstermen. He fetched two for a photographer -- a 1 3/8 pounder that  is 8 years old and a 2 1/2 pounder that is about 10 years old.  </P> <P> "An obvious question is do blue lobsters survive at the same rate as regular  lobsters do? What we need to know is, do they behave the same when they're  introduced to the ocean bottom?" he said.  </P> <P> To answer those questions, he has begun studies to see how blue lobsters behave  when introduced to different environments with and without the presence of  predators.  </P> <P> David Dow, a former lobsterman and executive director of the Maine Lobster  Institute at the University of Maine, thinks Chapman's work could be important  for the future of the industry.  </P> <P> "We don't know how long our production is going to last," he said. "Ten years  down the road, we might not have as large a supply. Or 10 years down the road,  if we do our homework and expand our markets, we might want to increase our  supply."  </P> <P> Anthony D'Agostino, director of the Montauk Marine Science Institute on Long  Island, said Chapman's project seemed "worthwhile."  </P> <P> "I just wonder if he has enough funding to do it properly," said D'Agostino,  who has been studying lobsters since 1975.  </P> <P> Chapman's funding is slight -- he started with $7,000 from the Lobster Advisory  Council and has kept going with a yearly stipend of about $600 from the Maine  Lobstermen's Assn.  </P> <P> For all Chapman's work, however, he can't answer the key question on every  lobster-lover's mind -- do blues taste the same?  </P> <P> "Everyone asks that question," Chapman said. "The problem is we've never had  enough to be able to eat any. So I don't know. I've never eaten a blue  lobster."  </P></p>

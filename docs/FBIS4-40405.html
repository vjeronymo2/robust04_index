			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun (TASS) -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev today confirmed that he was prepared to meet U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the near future to  agree on a common approach to a settlement of the situation on  the Korean peninsula. An accord on such a meeting of the heads  of the foreign policy departments of the two countries was  reached in the course of the telephone conversation the other  day between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton.    Speaking in a talk with journalists about the date for this  dialogue, Andrey Kozyrev said, among other things: "As for the  meeting of ministers of which the presidents spoke, I proposed  to my friend and colleague Warren Christopher specific dates for  this meeting, and I am awaiting a reply from him on specific  dates. It goes without saying that I am prepared to meet in the  nearest future and at a time convenient for both sides, in order  to continue the work as the presidents agreed, that is, to work  out a joint approach to this extraordinarily complicated  question."</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Brussels' biotech strategy draws cross-fire A NEW European Community strategy for the biotechnology industry was attacked by both environmental groups and chemical companies yesterday. Unveiling a policy paper in Strasbourg, the European Commission promised to limit the regulatory burden on Europe's biotechnology industry and to set up a committee to tackle the ethical problems of genetic, environmental and human embryo research. But the paper has not laid to rest controversy about the risks involved in developing biological techniques for use in agrochemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. The European Chemical Industry Federation (Cefic), said the Commission could still discriminate against biotechnology products by subjecting them to an extra level of testing and regulation, irrespective of the type of product - a safeguard demanded by environmentalists. Green party members of the European Parliament said the paper should be withdrawn on the grounds that it offered inadequate protection for the environment and human health. 'It's as though the biotech industry had given the Commission its wish-list, and the Commission turned it into their basic position paper,' said MEP Ms Hiltrud Breyer. The strategy paper is itself a product of fierce internal debate in the Commission, between departments responsible for environment, research, agriculture and the internal market. It follows hard on the heels of the strategy for the ailing information technology industry. Both sectors fall under the EC's new industrial policy, which aims to stimulate investment, but requires the companies themselves to come up with the cash. European biotechnology companies are prospering, but Brussels wants to streamline product authorisation procedures, harmonise standards and ensure patent protection for EC biotechnology products to lure investment back from the US industry. Mr Martin Bangemann, internal market and industry commissioner, said that in exceptional cases where controversy arose over social or economic effects of a product - for example, the economic effect of a genetically-engineered hormone to stimulate milk production - the Commission might have to take a political decision on it. But this would not take the form of another layer of regulation.</p>

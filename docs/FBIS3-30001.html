			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Japan and China agreed  Thursday that Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will  visit China between March 19 and 21 for talks with Chinese  leaders, Foreign Ministry officials said. Hosokawa and Chinese  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji reached the accord in a meeting at the  prime minister's official residence, the officials said.    Details of Hosokawa's itinerary will be further worked out  by  the two governments, they said.    Zhu conveyed messages from Chinese President and Communist  Party Leader Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng saying they are  looking forward to meeting Hosokawa in Beijing in March, the  officials said.    Hosokawa replied that he looks forward to the trip, they  said.    During the 50-minute meeting, Hosokawa called for China's  continued role in persuading North Korea to accept international  inspections of its suspected nuclear weapons development sites,  the officials said.    Hosokawa told Zhu that Pyongyang should further accept  special inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) and implement an accord with South Korea to denuclearize  the Korean peninsula.    Zhu, currently on a nine-day visit to Japan starting  Wednesday, was quoted as saying there have been developments  recently concerning North Korea's suspected nuclear problem and  that China intends to extend efforts within its capacity.    Hosokawa gave high marks to China's efforts to promote  reform  and open-door policies and added Japan will continue to support  such efforts, the officials said.    Zhu predicted that mutual economic interdependence between  China and Japan will further strengthen, noting that trade  between the two amounted to 39 billion dollars last year, up 54  percent from the previous year.    The vice premier also noted that Japan is now China's top  trading partner exceeding Hong Kong, while China is Japan's  second biggest trading partner. Zhu was quoted as saying the  two nations should further promote economic exchanges.    Hosokawa voiced support for China's bid to become a member  of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the officials  said.    Zhu told Hosokawa that China has been making various efforts  to become a GATT member, lowering duties and improving  transparency of its legislation. He handed Premier Li's letter  to Hosokawa which asked for Tokyo's continued cooperation in  China's bid to enter the world trade body.    Foreign Ministry officials said Beijing has apparently been  sending similar letters to other major countries as well.    Hosokawa told the Chinese that Japan is interested in  China's  environmental preservation and military expenses. The prime  minister cited Japanese guidelines in extending official  development assistance (ODA) which takes note of such fields.    Zhu told Hosokawa that China has been making various efforts  to preserve the environment including beefing up legislation,  they said.    The vice premier noted China's military expenses in 1993  were  43.7 million yuan (about 655 million yen), about 1 percent of  its gross national product (GNP). He said the military expenses  are mostly used for defensive purposes and that the expenditure  is limited to the minimum necessary to defend its population of  1.2 billion.    Zhu told Hosokawa he does not think it appropriate to link  China's human rights record to the "most-favored-nation" trade  status in the United States.</p>

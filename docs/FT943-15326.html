			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Affordable claret Traditional British wine merchants - notably Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk, Corney &amp; Barrow of London EC1, Harveys of Bristol, Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Essex, Peatlings, of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk and The Wine Society of Stevenage, Hertfordshire - tend to offer more exciting petits chateaux red bordeaux than the supermarkets because of their long relationships with Bordeaux merchants. Waitrose, however, has the richly plummy Chateau Les Tonnelles de Fronsac 1990, at Pounds 4.99, and the creditable second wine of a fifth growth Medoc in Baron Villeneuve du Ch Cantemerle 1990 at Pounds 7.95. (In very general terms, such 'second wines' are generally worth buying only in good vintages such as 1990s.) Oddbins has a particularly good selection of red bordeaux under Pounds 10 a bottle with a list full of plums, while Thresher/Bottoms Up/Wine Rack wine shops are good on the Lurton family's well-made wines. Another family whose name spells wine quality is Thienpont. Their juicy but structured Cotes de Francs wines are still good value and are available from Tanners of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and Seckford Wines of Ipswich, Suffolk. Specific goodies from Oddbins include Ch Tour de Mirambeau, Pounds 5.29 and the blended Michel Lynch 1990, Pounds 5.99, a Mouton Cadet trying harder if ever there was one; and the daringly opulent Ch Lilian-Ladouys 1990 at Pounds 9.99. Majestic wine warehouses have long stocked Ch de Sours (the 1990 is Pounds 5.79) and Ch Meaume (the 1990 is Pounds 4.99), both made energetically by Englishmen keenly aware of the demands of the wine world outside Bordeaux. Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up's best buy is probably the peppery Ch Guibon 1992 at Pounds 4.69, and oak fans will enjoy Peter Sichel's Sirius 1990 at Pounds 5.99. Two wines made by the owner of the celebrated Ch Le Tertre Roteboeuf, with ambition and technique that completely ignore their humble appellations, are Ch Roc de Cambes, Pounds 8.73 from Corney &amp; Barrow, and the cheaper Domaine de Cambes, Pounds 66 per case ex-cellars from Mark Savage, Guiting Power, Cheltenham (0451-850896). Other names worth looking out for include Chx Cote-Montpezat, Fontenille, Le Grand Verdus, de Haux, Jonqueyres, du Juge, Lassime, Monbadon, Parenchere, Suau and Turcaud, as well as Domaine de Courteillac. An error in transmission meant that we gave the wrong price for New Zealand wines mentioned last week. Top bottlings of the Sauvignon Blancs, including Cloudy Bay, Hunters, Jackson Estate, Vavasour and Wairau River, are all under Pounds 10 a bottle.</p>

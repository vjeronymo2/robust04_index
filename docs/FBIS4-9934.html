			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Izquierdo from Havana] </F>   [Text] President Carlos Menem "several days ago" telephoned  Fidel Castro. The conversation was unrestrained and served to  resolve some pending problems that opened the doors for the  visit Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will make to Buenos  Aires on 13 April.    "The telephone conversation took place," Robaina confirmed  for PAGINA/12 in a brief chat on Juventud Island, located in  western Cuba.    [Izquierdo] But who took the initiative?    [Robaina] Well, an incoming call was received some days ago.  That means it came from over there, because that is the only way  an incoming call can be received.    Robaina, 38, smiles about his remark while he is surrounded  by some 50 foreign diplomats accredited to Havana during a visit  to the archipelago's largest island.    "There was no need to use the language used in the past,  because the topics that were discussed did not need the type of  language that was used before the microphones," he said.  Despite the official secrecy regarding the topic, it has been  learned from diplomatic sources that the conversation lasted for  some minutes.    The sources stated that Menem presumably showed interest in  medical treatment for the son of his cousin, Alfredo Menem, who  is currently recovering in Cuba from a physical illness, but  this could not be confirmed. Castro was presumably willing;  thus the dialogue was held on a cordial basis and helped reduce  the tense relations, according to the sources.    In the same natural way that he dances a salsa at a  diplomatic corps party, or when he makes a present of a  caricature of an ambassador to the ambassador himself, Robaina  agreed to chat with PAGINA/12.    [Izquierdo] Menem will receive you on the day of your  arrival in Buenos Aires. How will you handle the interview with  a president who openly declares himself to be "anti-Castro."    [Robaina] The exists a bilateral relationship that comes  above any type of declaration. This is something my government  has decided to work on, and I do not believe Argentina will be  an exception. We are in a position to speak openly when a  disagreement crops up.    [Izquierdo] Up to what point have bilateral relations been  affected by Menem's continuous attacks against Fidel Castro?    [Robaina] Our relations are not difficult. The insistence  (Menem's attacks) is something that only he can comment on. It  also would be important if there could be time for us to explain  what we are doing in Cuba.    [Izquierdo] The objective of your visit?    [Robaina] Argentina is not an exception among the other  countries of the world. We seek to speak the truth about our  program with its virtues and defects.    [Izquierdo] Is there any progress in the renegotiation of  the  more than $1 billion debt Cuba has with Argentina?    [Robaina] It was I who began the negotiations, and it will  not be myself who will conclude them. We are taking steps to  see how we can move that debt. We have no capital but there are  other possibilities.    [Izquierdo] What possibilities?    [Robaina] We must see what interest there is in Cuban  products, and we also must see whether some investments can be  made in order to pay part of the debt.    The Cuban foreign minister will arrive in Buenos Aires from  Peru on 13 April, and on the same day he will be received by  Menem at Government House, according to Argentine Ambassador to  Cuba Susana Grane.    "There is nothing to prevent an improvement in  Argentine-Cuban relations. For this to happen, I have  confidence in the rationality, intelligence, and good sense of  the Argentines." Thus the Cuban foreign minister concluded his  chat with PAGINA/12.    Robaina will remain in Argentina on 13 and 14 April, but he  will return on 17 April for a short visit to Posadas, Misiones  Province, after his semi-official visit to Paraguay.</p>

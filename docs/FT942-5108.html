			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Unilever hits back in detergents battle The wrangle over Unilever's revolutionary new detergent showed no sign of easing yesterday as the Anglo-Dutch giant claimed sharp increases in UK market share despite accusations from a rival that it damages clothes. But in the Netherlands a leading supermarket chain said it was considering whether to stop stocking the product. The detergent, launched across Europe last month under various brand names such as Persil Power and Omo Power, has been attacked as harmful to clothes by manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble. Unilever said yesterday that Persil Power's share of the total UK detergent market had jumped from 7 per cent to 10 per cent in recent weeks. Its UK share of the fast-growing market for concentrated detergents, in which Unilever has lost ground to Procter &amp; Gamble in recent years, is estimated to have risen from about 20 to 30 per cent. Mr Andrew Seth, chief executive of Unilever's UK detergents business, said this was a larger and faster increase than the company had expected. Albert Heijn, the biggest Dutch supermarket chain, yesterday asked Unilever for further information about the detergent so that it could decide whether to continue stocking it. Heijn said it expected to hear from Unilever today. 'There have been reports in the media that the product is not reliable, but it is only fair and polite for us to give our supplier a chance to clarify the situation,' the supermarket group said. Mr Seth dismissed Procter &amp; Gamble's research findings about damage to clothes as 'irrelevant'. He said: 'If you pick the right combination of dye, stains, material and basic colour, you can get results which will show severe damage. If I want to, I can do the same with competing products.' Unilever confirmed that it was to modify the formula of the new detergent, chiefly through reducing the quantity of its novel manganese-based catalyst, which Procter claims causes the damage. Procter retaliated by arguing that even at one-tenth of present levels, the catalyst caused abnormal wear and tear. The Netherlands' largest consumer protection group called on Unilever yesterday to make a clear distinction between the old and new Omo Power when it launches the modified version there later this month.

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: British Polythene ahead 16% BRITISH Polythene Industries, the UK's largest polythene film products maker, yesterday announced a 16 per cent increase, to Pounds 10.3m, in pre-tax profits for 1991. Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman, said the results were due to resilience among its retailing customers like J Sainsbury and to cost cuttings which improved margins. But the industrial division, which produces products such as fertiliser bags and packaging for building supplies, saw falling volumes and tighter margins. Turnover, which dipped to Pounds 156.1m (Pounds 158.4m) because of discontinued operations, was helped by a final quarter contribution from Courtaulds Plastic Films, taken over in September and renamed Brithene. A sharply reduced interest charge, down nearly Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.98m, reflected lower polymer prices, which reduced borrowings, and proceeds from the October rights issue. Gearing fell to 13 per cent to 50 per cent. Fully diluted earnings increased 10 per cent to 23.79p per share. A final dividend of 6p makes a total of 9p (8.25p). COMMENT British Polythene's shares have outperformed the market by 70 per cent in the past year and these results show why. The company is gaining a reputation for its management and has come through difficult trading conditions for its industrial products yet has improved overall margins by 18 per cent at the pre-tax profit level. Looking ahead, the company's recycling business looks interesting, gaining big name customers despite a price disadvantage following the fall in 'virgin' polymer prices. There is significant potential for this division should environmental awareness continue to grow or polymer prices return to historical levels. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.5m for this year put the shares on 16 times earnings. That is starting to look expensive, but yesterday's 7p advance in the share price to 415p suggests the City is comfortable at these levels.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Book Review: A man who could not care more YEARS OF HOPE: DIARIES, PAPERS AND LETTERS 1940-1962 By Tony Benn Hutchinson, Pounds 25, 442 pages Tony Benn has been so spectacularly wrong on so many subjects over the years that it is pleasant to record his achievements. By far the greatest is that he has written the best, and probably most accurate, British political diaries of our time. Years of Hope is the sixth and presumably final volume. Sub-titled Diaries, Papers and Letters 1940-1962, it helps to explain a great deal of what came later, but was published earlier. 'I am going to try out a political diary,' Benn wrote in January 1951, having just been elected to Parliament as the 'baby' of the House at the age of 25. 'What I want to do is to highlight the most significant events of which I am a witness and set down contemporary accounts and opinions which my memory would probably distort to suit current purposes were I to try to recall them later on.' The Benn of the 1950s was not quite as assiduous in his daily jottings as the Benn of the '60s, '70s and '80s. Yet he stuck to his basic principle: write it down as you see it and hear it at the time, however fatuous it may seem afterwards. A lesser man would have eliminated some of the entries in Years of Hope. Here, for example, is Benn's comment on a party at the American embassy in London in April 1959 at which he admits that he and his wife had 'a whale of a time': 'One wondered how a society led by these sort of people could possibly withstand the thrust and dynamism of the Chinese communes working away so feverishly and seriously on the other side of the world.' Back at the embassy for dinner in December, he recorded: 'This was gracious living at its height. I cannot but feel that western civilisation has reached its peak and is now slowly declining before the upsurge of pressure from the more serious societies.' He thought (January 1960) that American culture had 'detribalised Britain to some extent and we shall be better off still when we get the full blast from Russia and China'. Benn was not alone in his delusions. The recorded entry for October 21 1960 reads in full: 'Rang Audrey Callaghan. She said Jim was very depressed, but had come back from Czechoslovakia convinced that socialism does work.' He wrote of Harold Wilson in the same year: 'My contempt for him grew each time I met him and I don't think that he has one-tenth the character of Gaitskell.' That was in spite of the fact that Benn's opinion of Gaitskell, character and otherwise, was low, except perhaps when Gaitskell was nice to him. The paradox was that in those days Benn seemed a rather moderate member of the Labour party. Some of his friends and contemporaries were well to the left of him: for instance, Woodrow Wyatt, Bob Mellish and George Thomas (now Lord Tonypandy). Subsequently the others moved to the right; Benn is one of the few figures in politics to have moved steadily leftwards as he grew older. There is perhaps a partial explanation in Years of Hope. Benn was very much a child of his time. Public school and Oxford, he accepted the second world war and his duty to volunteer. He trained as a pilot, longing to get into battle. He used all the boyish RAF language like 'wizard' and 'wizzo'. He chased the most obviously attractive girls without a great deal of success, and had to remind himself to pursue someone more serious. When Noel Coward came to visit the base in Rhodesia where he was stationed, Benn thought the maestro's best line: 'Grandpa ate a large apple and made a rude noise in the Methodist Chapel.' His brother Mike was killed in action. Politics ran in the family. Both his grandfather and his father were MPs. But there came a problem: the father, William Wedgwood Benn, was a Labour minister who was sent to the House of Lords in the days when peerages were only hereditary. The young Tony (or James or Jiggs, as we now know he was called in his youth) objected from the start, for it meant that at some stage he would have to take the title and be ineligible for the House of Commons. In this he had something in common with Lord Hailsham, who was also from a long-standing political family and believed that it ought to be possible to renounce a peerage in order to stay in elective politics. As Benn tells here, he began working with Hailsham and a few other Tories for reform in the early 1950s. Some Tories opposed it because they did not want either Hailsham or Lord Home back in the Commons as rivals. When the reform was finally achieved in 1963, one of the prime beneficiaries apart from Benn was Home, who promptly became prime minister. Benn and Hailsham had other affinities. There is an uncanny resemblance in mood between these diaries and Hailsham's recent book, Values: Collapse and Cure. Both are tales of postwar hopes not being realised: their restlessness simply came out in different ways. It is striking, too, that several of Benn's early political friends were Tories: Sir Edward Boyle especially, but also Enoch Powell ('as a working-class Tory he has the social barrier to overcome') and Edward Heath ('a most amiable and friendly soul'). Benn is sometimes too kind to tyrants. He had a love affair with the third world, which he never wholly understood. But on the whole he likes rebels. He writes of Violet Bonham Carter: 'She has a tremendous vitality and an unparalleled enthusiasm for life. She belongs to the 'couldn't care more' brigade.' Just like Benn, though there is another hero to the diaries. That is Ruth Winstone who has edited the lot. She says that Years of Hope was the most enjoyable task of all, and she may be right. Ms Winstone deserves a medal.</p>

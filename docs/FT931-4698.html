			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Birt challenged on assistant MR JOHN BIRT, the BBC director-general, was challenged in public last night to name the secretarial assistant for whom he claimed Pounds 15,000 expenses in the 1991 tax returns of his private company John Birt Productions. Mr Birt did not give a direct answer. The challenge came from Mr Jeremy Isaacs, general director of the Royal Opera House and former chief executive of Channel 4, in an interview with Mr Birt on the stage of the National Film Theatre - an interview that was designed as a curtain-raiser to a two-day conference on the future of the corporation. 'It seems to me I did satisfy the concern that this arrangement (having his BBC salary paid through a private company) had been a way of me enjoying a significant tax advantage,' Mr Birt said. 'It is not right that I have to reveal every detail of my personal matters. I don't intend to.' On Monday Mr Birt issued a statement regretting the distress caused by the fact he had never been on the staff of the BBC while he held the post of deputy director-general. Accountants Ernst and Young examined the accounts of Mr Birt's company and found that in 1991 the overall tax saving generated by being paid through the company was Pounds 3,935 - Pounds 810 when such items as accountancy charges were deducted. Earlier the director-general said that he regretted the decision to stay a freelance. ' I came (to the BBC) from another world and that arrangement seemed sensible to me,' Mr Birt said. Mr Birt conceded that the affair had damaged his relationship with BBC staff but he hoped they now would be able to go forward together. Mr Isaacs also asked Mr Birt about about Producer Choice, the system which gives producers the right to buy services from the outside market. Mr Birt said he would be 'very surprised' if 50 per cent of BBC production was bought from outside the corporation. It would mean that something was wrong with the price or quality of BBC services and Mr Birt did not believe this was the case. The director general said he wanted to create an institution that was no longer a monolith and in which there was maximum autonomy and creativity. Observer, Page 21</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Vote sparks riot in Iranian city Riots erupted in the Iranian city of Qazvin yesterday after parliament voted down a bill to turn it into a province, residents said, Reuter reports from Tehran. 'People have set tyres on fire in the streets. Windows of banks and government buildings are smashed,' said a man at a Qazvin hotel reached by telephone. 'I can hear shooting. It's very chaotic. People have gathered in streets and mosques and there are clashes in the streets. The police cannot do anything,' he said. Another resident said rioters had burned down the finance department building. Police in the city, 90 miles north-west of Tehran, the capital, said the roads were closed into Qazvin, through which hundreds of trucks bringing goods from Turkey and Europe to Tehran and beyond pass every day. The riots broke out after parliament voted 105-103 against a bill to separate Qazvin from Zanjan province. Parliament's deputy speaker, Mr Hassan Rowhani, said after the vote that the people of Qazvin should not take it as a sign of bias by parliament and urged the Zanjan governor-general to pay more attention to the city which was the 16th century capital of Persia under the Safavid dynasty. Several Iranian cities have ambitions of becoming centres of new provinces, mainly to get more money directly from the central government for development. Located in a fertile plain, Qazvin has been turned into one of Iran's biggest industrial centres since the 1970s. The interior ministry, seeking to defuse the tension, announced it would send an envoy to Qazvin to hear people's grievances, Iran's official news agency IRNA said. Iran's worst riots since the early turbulent years after the 1979 Islamic revolution occurred in the north-eastern city of Mashhad in 1992. Two people were killed and 300 banks and government offices were gutted during the rampage in Mashhad which started from a dispute over illegal buildings. Four men were hanged for inciting to riot.</p>

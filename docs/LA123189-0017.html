			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT WOULD FOOD BE WITHOUT CHEMICALS?  </P> <P> I read with enormous interest the news in Bruce Horovitz's column on marketing  ("Firm Exercises its Social Consciousness," Dec. 5) that a new "socially  conscious fast-food company" is introducing "chemical-free food" to the  marketplace.  </P> <P> Since protein, fats, sugars, nucleic acids, salt and water are all chemicals  that make up the food that we humans and our pets eat, I think you can  understand why I am intrigued and excited by the revolutionary idea of  "chemical-free food." I do hope that you plan to run a feature on this  scientific breakthrough as soon as possible.  </P> <P> ROBERT METZGER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

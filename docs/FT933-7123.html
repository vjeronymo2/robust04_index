			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Russians need creative skills to succeed - Survival tactics in a country where capital investment is hard to come by The screen flashes up an image of a Russian entrepreneur practising his karate skills, then driving around Moscow in a Lada. 'This man has big business on his hands: Russian knitwear,' a voice purrs in the background. Alexander Panikin, 43, says he commissioned 'The Factory-Owner', a video about his company Pan Inter, to present himself 'as an example to others'. Promotional puff aside, he has grounds to boast. He manages one of Russia's rare small businesses involved in manufacturing, at a time when import-export operations dominate the new private economy. Panikin's business has emerged from the ruins of seven decades in which, he says, 'the Communists destroyed everything that moved'. He was lucky to have accumulated capital in the dying years of the old regime when prices were controlled by the state and money lending was cheap. The irony today is that though prices have been liberalised, private trade allowed and privatisation is officially under way, new businesses find it virtually impossible to obtain finance for capital investment. Last month the International Finance Corporation launched the first international effort to stimulate small and medium-sized businesses in Russia by lending Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) to a Russian commercial bank for on-lending to new companies. The IFC admits, however, that its contribution is just a drop in the ocean for Russian business development, until Russian entrepreneurs are able to mobilise the billions of dollars potentially available in domestic capital when investment circumstances improve. With inflation running at 1,000 per cent a year, most entrepreneurs and banks have little incentive to launch into any project that does not bring virtually immediate returns. Entrepreneurs such as Panikin, who are showing the way by a combination of hard work, luck and initiative, are indeed a rarity. Panikin set up his factory, which now employs 700 people, with profits made from a co-operative set up under legislation introduced by President Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s. 'I started off with six sewing machines but I had a profit margin of 600 per cent,' he says, illustrating the pent up demand for consumer goods which existed in Russia's then closed, and now still heavily militarised economy. Today his margins have been reduced to 100 per cent by import liberalisation, which has introduced competition, and by price liberalisation, which has cut the population's purchasing power. In an attempt to beat inflation, which destroys rouble earnings, he converts his profits into hard currency and immediately ploughs them back into the company. Another challenge for business is that market institutions taken for granted in the west, such as efficient suppliers, distributors, and a normal banking system, are absent in Russia. Panikin sells his clothes in 10 kiosks he owns around Moscow, which means he works mainly with cash, and relies on his own sales network to find out what sells and what prices he can get away with. In order to obtain the necessary quality he dyes the threads used for his knitwear. The IFC's lending initiative is part of the international effort to stimulate business, but action needs to be taken in Russia to help budding Panikins. Irina Razumnova, who heads a small business support centre with funding from the cosmetics company Avon and the Canadian government, says: it is no bad thing that small businesses find it difficult to raise finance for manufacturing as it is services that are needed. She adds: 'The main problem is that our people do not know how to work.' The business support centre provides short courses in accounting and management skills. Razumnova believes one of the biggest problems facing small businesses is people attitudes: how do you change the habits of employees accustomed to a system once jokingly described as 'pretending to pay the workers while they pretend to work'. Higher than average pay packets (the equivalent of around Dollars 100 a month) are still topped up with subsidised food, such as sugar, which is expensive in the shops, and other non-monetary benefits. Panikin's staff also receive benefits - clothes can be purchased at a 50 per cent discount from the sales price and Panikin has even given plots of land away to workers.</p>

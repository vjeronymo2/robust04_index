			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Draft Budget Discussed"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday the State Duma session examined the draft  federal Law "On the Federal Budget for 1994." Sergey Dubinin,  acting Russian finance minister, and Mikhail Zadornov, chairman  of the Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and  Finances, delivered reports.    Sergey Dubinin stressed that when drawing up the draft  budget  for 1994 the Russian Federation Government opted for a version  intermediate between a tough financial policy which would allow  inflation to be lowered to 5 percent per month but would be very  painful and an attempt at pumping the economy full of money,  which would lead to 50 percent inflation. He reported that they  have planned a budget revenue base of 120.7 trillion rubles [R],  a deficit of R62.4 trillion, and expenditure of R183.1 trillion.    Inflation remains "enemy number one," he said. Ten percent  inflation per month is now planned, with a reduction to 7  percent by the end of the year. The budget deficit planned for  the current year is 8-9 percent of GDP. Part of the deficit,  roughly 6 percent of gross product, will be covered by Central  Bank loans.    Commenting on the revenue side of the budget, Sergey Dubinin  noted that a sharp increase in total revenue is not expected.  Whereas last year it was 10 percent of GDP for the federal  budget and 14 percent for the budgets of the territories, this  current year a total of 12 percent of GDP is planned. The  speaker noted that it is planned to take effective measures to  stop tax evasion.    Regarding the allocation of budget expenditure, the minister  reported that R48.5 trillion has been appropriated for defense  and the law-enforcement agencies; R48.1 trillion for state  support for sectors of the national economy; R24.5 trillion to  help the regions; R16.8 trillion to service the state debt; and  R12.2 trillion for social measures.    Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Duma Committee for the  Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances, advocated revising the 1994  draft budget. He proposed, in particular, that the budget  deficit be increased from the current 34 percent to 43-45  percent. The committee chairman considers that the revenue side  of the budget requires amplification, as he fears that many  sources of income will not be able to yield the return the  government expects. It is also necessary, according to  Zadornov, to abolish concessions on customs duties and  consolidate extrabudgetary funds.    Mikhail Zadornov even reported that the committee he heads  considers it right to ratify the budget for the first six months  and to instruct the Russian Federation government to submit to  the Duma the draft budgets for the third and fourth quarters of  the current year, that is to say, to switch to the practice of  examining the budget quarter by quarter. We will thereby, he  considers, "ensure the government takes account of our proposals  and really controls the implementation of the budget." The  Russian Government, the Duma committee chairman said, has also  been instructed to submit the 1995 budget to the Duma no later  than September this year.    For his part, deputy committee chairman Aleksandr Pochinok,  expressing a "dissenting view" on this issue, proposed that the  draft budget be passed on the first reading. He stated, in  particular, here that the proposed budget deficit increase to  43-45 percent would entail rapidly increasing inflation.</p>

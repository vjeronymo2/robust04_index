			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Dean to quit post in merged print union MS BRENDA DEAN is to resign from her job as deputy general secretary of the GPMU print union. She became a household name during the Wapping dispute with News International. Ms Dean, 49, failed to become leader of the new union last year when Sogat, the general print union which she had led since 1985, merged with the smaller NGA skilled print union. After she was beaten by Mr Tony Dubbins, the NGA leader, by 78,442 votes to 72,657, it was assumed she would not stay long as his deputy. Ms Dean said she was sad to leave after 32 years in the union movement but was going with 'no recriminations'. She added that the future was 'a blank sheet of paper' but she is expected to have no difficulty in finding a prominent position, probably in the public sector. According to some union officials Ms Dean might have left GPMU earlier but felt a duty to protect the senior officers of her former union after the merger. Sogat moved into the NGA's Bedford headquarters after the merger, reinforcing the impression that it was more a takeover by the NGA. Ms Dean accepted that there had been friction at national level after the merger, but added that overall 'it has gone much better than expected'. Observer, Page 19</p>

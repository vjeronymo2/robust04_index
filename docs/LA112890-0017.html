			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDEAST OIL AND U.S. TROOPS IN SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> There is much talk about car-pooling and rapid transit. These are certainly  important considerations in the desire to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  </P> <P> But everyone cannot participate in these programs. There is, however, one way  in which every driver can assist in reducing our dependence on foreign oil. I  have made a personal effort to hold down my top speed by 5 miles per hour and  to eliminate rapid acceleration and braking. With just this simple effort, I  have improved my mileage from 28 to 30 miles per gallon.  </P> <P> To the average driver, this may mean an additional driving time of five minutes  each way. This is not much of a hardship to see our soldiers return from Arab  lands and to put people like Hussein in his place.  </P> <P> ROCKY JAMES, Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Small mercies There can no longer be any doubt that the Bundesbank is interested in an easier policy. Yesterday's switch to a variable rate tender system for money market liquidity was accompanied by scarcely-veiled hints that it wants to nudge short-term rates down a further notch. Events in the real economy certainly provide some motivation despite double digit money supply growth. The Bundesbank must know that recession in west Germany would make it even harder to bail out the east. The risk is that outsiders - including UK equity investors - will jump to the erroneous conclusion that speedy official rate cuts are imminent. The Bundesbank has not entirely recovered from the way it was manipulated into cutting its Lombard rate last month. For the time being it does not want to be seen to be taking the initiative by lowering official rates. Admittedly the anticipation of lower rates next year may continue to weaken the D-Mark, adding to the scope for non-inflationary rate cuts in the UK and elsewhere. Yet, one wonders whether the prospect of another 10 to 15 basis points off German money market rates warranted yesterday's 54.8 jump in the FT-SE. Talk of steep cuts in UK rates has, after all, been around for some time. But it has been inspired by the dismal outlook for growth, underlined again yesterday by the Pounds 700m September drop in bank lending. Recovery prospects also depend heavily on how far the authorities avoid offsetting lower rates with tighter fiscal policy. Insofar as the Bundesbank's stance underpins sterling, it will make a large PSBR that much easier to finance with overseas money.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias raised the  Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue  last night at the working dinner of the European Union [EU]  foreign ministers, which was held at the same time as the dinner  of the European Council. The issue was raised within the  framework of discussions of joint foreign policy, particularly  during the discussion of the Yugoslav issue, which was also  attended by UN mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.    Mr. Papoulias referred to the open Vance initiative, the  Greek positions, and to the Commission's court appeal against  Greece.    The Foreign Ministers Council will continue its work today  and will discuss the prospects of Cyprus' accession to the EU.  Another issue to be discussed is cooperation among the  Mediterranean, Central European, and East European countries.</p>

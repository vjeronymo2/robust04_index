			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Share-buying from relatives Could you please advise me on the following points? 1. What is the position with reference to capital gains tax when a person buys shares from a relative (for example a wife, father, aunt or uncle), agreeing a price and paying the relevant stamp duty using a stock transfer form? 2. What is the position with reference to CGT if the shares are bought in the same way from a friend? If you buy shares from your wife, you will be treated as though you had paid her a price equal to her indexed cost for CGT purposes, broadly speaking. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT15 (Capital gains tax: a guide for married couples). If you buy shares from your father (or from your mother, a grandparent, a sibling, a child or a grandchild), you will be treated as though you had paid a price calculated on the quarter-up basis if they have a London quotation. Otherwise, broadly-speaking, you will be treated as having paid the market price. Ask your local tax office for the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction). If you buy shares from your aunt, your uncle or a friend, the price actually paid will stand for capital gains tax purposes, provided that it was agreed at arm's length. If it was not an arms-length price, then you will be treated in the same way as if you had bought the shares from your father (as explained in the preceding paragraph). The rules are similar for sales of shares. However, if a sale of shares to your father (or to your mother, grandparent, sibling, child or grandchild) produces a loss for capital gains tax purposes, then that loss can only be set against gains on sales to him (or her, as the case may be), generally speaking. Finally, for good measure, perhaps we should say that the rules for your father apply also to step-parents and step-grandparents, and to the spouses of siblings, of children and of grandchildren. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

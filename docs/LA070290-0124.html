			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN VOWS AID TO AILING PERU  </P> <P> Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told Peruvian President-elect Alberto  Fujimori today he would send an aid mission and advisers to help the Andean  country's economic reconstruction, Fujimori said.  </P> <P> Kaifu made the pledge during a meeting with Fujimori, the first ethnic Japanese  to become a head of state outside Japan.  </P> <P> "Mr. Kaifu clearly understood our economic problems," Fujimori told reporters  after meeting the premier at his residence. "As one means, he has promised me  to send an economic mission."  </P> <P> Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said Kaifu also promised to send economic  advisers to Peru as soon as possible after Fujimori's inauguration later this  month.  </P> <P> The International Monetary Fund and other international lending organizations  suspended aid to Peru in 1988 because the incumbent president limited foreign  debt servicing to a fraction of foreign earnings.  </P></p>

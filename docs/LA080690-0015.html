			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: VIXEN INVADES CRAWFORD'S HAUNT  </P> <P> The Scene: Party for the release of the all-woman, hard rock/heavy metal group  Vixen's second album, "Rev It Up," at what was Joan Crawford's Brentwood estate  from 1929 to 1959.  </P> <P> Who Was There: Among the 700 guests in the back yard (yes, it was that big)  were a heavy-metal who's who that included members of Winger, Bad English,  Stryper, Mr. Big, Kik Tracee, XYZ, Warrant, Ratt, Faster Pussycat and The Cult.  Also on hand were Capitol/EMI CEO Joe Smith, EMI president Sal Licata and  hundreds of the backbone of rock 'n' roll types -- road managers, sound  technicians, stock clerks from Tower Records.  </P> <P> The Buzz: The next person who does the "no more wire hangers" routine from  "Mommie Dearest" wears one home.  </P> <P> Chow: Charcoal grills were set on the back lawn for cooking chicken, hamburgers  and hot dogs. There were also a number of bars with a daunting selection of  liquor. "When you've got an album called 'Rev It Up,' " said bass player Share  Pedersen, "you've got to have lots of booze at the party."  </P> <P> Sign of the Times: All four women in Vixen carry stun guns.  </P> <P> Dress Mode: As one of the rare female hard-rock bands, Vixen members wear a  variation on the standard black-leather rocker outfit. "We buy some things at  Trashy Lingerie," said Pedersen. "I don't think the guys do that."  </P> <P> Architectural Note: The bathtubs Crawford had removed because she regarded  sitting in bath water unsanitary have been replaced. The present owners also  had the mansion exorcised by a minister from the Healing Light Church. Fans can  rest assured the ghost was not Crawford herself. The ghosts of a caretaker and  a dog eluded the exorcist, however, and are still in the house, the owners  said.  </P> <P> Quoted: "If Ozzy Osbourne can wear eyeliner, women can play guitar," said  Michael Des Barres.  </P> <P> Glitches: For most of the evening, guests were restricted to using the one  bathroom in the pool house. This was not the sort of crowd that looks kindly on  long waits.  </P> <P> Triumphs: Whoever came up with the idea of recycling Hollywood legend by  linking Joan Crawford and a heavy-metal band has secured a place in the hype  hall of fame.  </P></p>

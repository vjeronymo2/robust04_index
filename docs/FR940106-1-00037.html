			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All future sales and allocation facilities and sales or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation facilities in existence on the effective date of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order, unless covered by a valid variance, shall meet the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards prescribed in this Order; provided, however, that all gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced from or allocated to Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and gas leases wherein the gas is measured through sales or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation meters handling 100 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per day or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less on a monthly basis are exempt from the standards in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III. C.1., C.2., D.10.a., D.10.b., and D.11.c. of this Order. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized officer may, where appropriate and necessary for proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement, work with the operators in designating consolidated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas sales and/or allocation meter stations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Meter installations constructed in accordance with the AGA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee Report No. 3 standards in effect at that time shall not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically be required to retrofit if the standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised. The Bureau will review any revised standards and, when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary, will amend the Order through the rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of these minimum standards is to ensure that when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment malfunctions occur that could result in inaccurate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement, proper corrective actions are taken, the authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer is notified, and a report is submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to comply with these minimum standards will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered noncompliance and an incident of noncompliance (INC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be issued. Operators who discover noncompliance with these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum standards and take immediate corrective action will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be issued an INC. If the authorized officer or his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative is present when an operator discovers a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> malfunction or uses incorrect procedures as specified in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order, an INC will be issued unless immediate corrective action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is taken. Failure of equipment will not be considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation. However, the incidents of noncompliance which may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result from equipment failure are considered violations. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partial list of such incidents follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to install equipment properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to repair or correct equipment malfunction properly or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to submit report of alternate method of sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to submit required reports in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to adhere to the minimum standard procedures specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of improper equipment, when discovered, will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered a violation and a formal INC will be issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of improper procedures will be considered a violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and when witnessed by the authorized officer or his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative, immediate corrective action will be required. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the event that proper procedures are then used as required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this Order, and prior to completing the operation, calibration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or proving, the violation will be considered as properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrected. In this case, although the violation will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented in the agency files, no INC will be issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The failure to take timely corrective action as required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet any standard in this article will be considered either a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major or minor violation in accordance with the classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set out below for each standard, unless an applicable variance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been granted or the standards have been otherwise modified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with Article IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A major violation, as defined in this Order, will generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an immediate shut-in of the metering device. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the non-recoupable loss is not significant or where damage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the resource is likely to occur if a shut-in is required, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abatement period of 24 hours may be granted by the authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer or his representative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where abatement is required ``prior to sales or removal,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action is required to be taken so that no gas can be removed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond the measurement point until properly measured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Primary Element_Orifice Meters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following are minimum standards for the measurement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural gas using orifice meters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. For meters measuring more than 100 Mcf per day on a monthly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, the orifice to pipe diameter ratio (d/D), or the beta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio, with meters using ``flange taps,'' shall be between 0.15 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.70.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Violation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Major.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A DOCTOR RESPONDS TO STORY ON DEATH OF IMPLANT PATIENT  </P> <P> Re "Death Follows Breast Implant" article (March 22):  </P> <P> I was shocked to read your article regarding the tragic death of Martha  McClellan. I am amazed at the sensationalism and feel compelled to respond.  </P> <P> It is appalling how your paper could tolerate and assent to the inclusion of  the innuendoes, accusations and comparisons regarding myself and my staff that  appeared in the article even before any actual tests with their results,  investigations or reviews have taken place.  </P> <P> Also, does not the family have enough grief than to have it detailed to the  public and then inaccurately? I think you have gone beyond your journalistic  freedom in damaging my professional reputation and good name by cleverly  omitting many pertinent facts and overstating others. To detail them here would  serve no purpose save to violate patient confidentiality and further prolong  the trauma to the McCellan family. Let these await an accurate review and  recounting that should have been done prior to irresponsibly, indiscriminately  and unfairly passing judgment on a tragic incident!  </P> <P> EDWARD J. DOMANSKIS, M.D.  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

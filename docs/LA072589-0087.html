			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: AMWEST INSURANCE GROUP'S 2ND-QUARTER PROFITS FLAT  </P> <P> Amwest Insurance Group, a Woodland Hills provider of bail bonds and other  surety bonds, said its second-quarter profit inched down to $879,000 from  $880,000 a year earlier.  </P> <P> The flat results came despite a 63% increase in Amwest's net premiums earned --  a gauge of Amwest's insurance underwriting revenue -- to $8.46 million from  $5.19 million.  </P> <P> The latest earnings would have been higher except for a $200,000 charge that  Amwest recorded from its previously announced settlement of lawsuits between  the company and Dallas County, Tex. The lawsuits stemmed from a dispute over  whether Amwest was liable for reimbursing the county for thousands of bail  bonds written by a former Amwest agent in Texas.  </P> <P> For the first half of 1989, Amwest's profit rose 13% to $1.87 million from  $1.67 million, while its net premiums earned jumped 67% to $17.3 million from  $10.3 million.  </P></p>

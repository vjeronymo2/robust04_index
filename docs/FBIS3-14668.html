			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Today, local newspapers address the barriers Israel  places in the path of the peace process and its attempts to  destroy its foundations by the commission of further massacres  and the adoption of procrastination and maneuver.    AL-BA'TH writes: It has been shown to be impossible for  Israel's policy to lead the region to the desired peace. The  paper notes that since the positive summit session between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton Israel has been  temporizing, maneuvering, and skirting the peace process and its  basic components.    Israel is bent on negating all that has been achieved in the  interest of the peace process by fabricating incidents that  could rekindle and destabilize the Middle East, directly  affecting the peace process, which Israel views as being in  conflict with its short- and long-term objectives. Israel  objects to the terms of a just and comprehensive peace laid out  in the UN resolutions as preconditions for any settlement.  Israel's conduct inside occupied Palestinian territory and in  Lebanon is designed to rekindle Lebanon, camouflage its crimes  in the occupied territories, and derail the peace process.  While Israel professes to be concerned about peace, it is  carrying out a policy aimed at killing every chance for peace  and implementing its game plan of promoting a greater Israel,  through massacres in the occupied land and attempts to reignite  Lebanon.    AL-BA'TH concludes: Working for a just and comprehensive  peace necessarily means creating the right climate in the  region. Had Israel been concerned about the peace process, it  would have at least committed itself to the implementation of  the UN resolutions. Tel Aviv, is however, not serious about  peace. Its attention is focused on sabotaging the peace process.    Discussing the same theme, AL-THAWRAH writes: Since the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the heavy hand of Israel's terror has  been felt throughout the Palestinian arena, and has been  escalating systematically. AL-THAWRAH points to the deliberate  killings committed by Israel on a daily basis. Blind and savage  Zionist hatred has extended to Lebanon to assassinate the peace  march, stability, and national unity, and sap the country's  strength so as to make it easier to dictate its terms. There  has been an international condemnation of Israeli aggressiveness  and crimes and anti-peace policies. Yet, instead of  international efforts being directed at forcing the Israeli  rulers to comply with UN resolutions, pressure is being applied  to victimized Arabs -- the only pary commited to peace.    It is important, AL-THAWRAH concludes, to reiterate that  double standards cannot help the peace process.    TISHRIN, discussing the Jabalyah refugee camp massacre in  Gaza, which claimed the lives of six Fatah hawks at the hands of  Israel's secret units -- death squads disguised in civilian  clothes -- writes: The new Israeli massacre was committed in  the context of atrocities planned to browbeat the Palestinian  people, quell their intifadah, and push them into unconditional  capitulation. For Israel there is nothing to choose between one  Palestinian and another; in its eyes all of them, including  pregnant women and sucklings, are enemies.    The escalation against the Palestinians began after the  signing of the Oslo agreement and since the Palestinian side  deepened its involvement in the talks to put that accord in  place. Before they began the secret talks with the Palestinians  in Oslo, the Israelis threatened to effect a unilateral  withdrawal from the Gaza strip, after their presence there had  become a veritable inferno. But once the accord was signed, they  adopted the tactic of temporization, withdrawing neither from  Gaza nor from Jericho. And they are not planning any pullout.  They saw in the Oslo agreement and its aftermath a pretext to  escalate their criminal actions against the Palestinian people.    The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are far from addressing  the substance of the Palestinian cause, the Arab-Israeli  conflict, the UN Security Council resolutions, the Madrid  formula, or the peace requirements. The Palestinian side is  yielding fresh ground at each negotiating round. What all  parties should seek is a just and comprehensive peace on all  fronts of the conflict. Faced with mounting Palestinian  resistance and a united Palestinian front, Israel contemplated a  withdrawal from Gaza before the Oslo agreement. Today, however,  is does not seem to be in any rush. Israel sees in the split in  the Palestinian people's ranks and the continued involvement of  the Palestinian side in the self-rule negotiations a golden  opportunity for settling scores with the entire Palestinian  community.    Unless the Palestinian side rectifies its position by  returning to full coordination with the other Arab parties and  the components of a just and comprehensive peace on all fronts,  it will be the Palestinian cause that will suffer.</p>

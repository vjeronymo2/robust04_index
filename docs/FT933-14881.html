			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Clarke plans defence against EC charges on budget deficit MR Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will today mount a defence against charges from his European Community partners that the British government is overestimating the impact economic growth will have in curbing its Pounds 50bn budget deficit. The charges are likely to surface at a meeting of EC finance ministers in Brussels today, where Mr Clarke is due to present Britain's plans for bringing its economy into line with the criteria for economic and monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty. However, some ministers may wish to avoid further disharmony given renewed tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism and the weakness of the French franc. The franc could face more pressure in the foreign exchanges this week as traders try to test the strength of Franco-German monetary co-operation. Last week the Bank of France intervened to support the franc, but the operation failed to stop the French currency falling below FFr3.40 to the D-Mark, little more than 3 centimes above its ERM floor of FFr3.433. The fall came as French short-term interest rates rose sharply. On Friday they were above German money market rates for the first time in nearly two months. If the franc's decline continues, the markets will be watching to see if the Bundesbank comes to its rescue, allowing German monetary policy to be swayed by speculators, or whether it ignores the French currency's plight. The European Commission makes no secret of its desire for the British pound and Italian lira to return to the ERM. Britain's floating exchange rate policy and the fact that it can expect higher economic growth in 1993 and 1994 compared to its EC partners may have coloured debate over its 'convergence' plan. During a recent meeting of the EC's secretive monetary committee, composed of senior Treasury and central bank officials from the 12 member states, several members challenged the UK government's contention that over two-thirds of the budget deficit was due to cyclical economic factors, and would therefore recede with economic recovery. Others complained that UK forecasts of a cut in the deficit from 8 per cent of gross domestic product this year to 3.75 per cent in 1997-98 still left the deficit above the Maastricht target of no more than 3 per cent. This underlined that the UK was 'not serious' about Emu, one EC official said. Mr Clarke is expected to argue that it is very difficult to measure how far the deficit is cyclical and how much it represents a structural increase in spending. He will also say the UK convergence plan is more realistic that some programmes put forward by other member states. The Ecofin meeting is also expected to discuss plans to improve multilateral surveillance of member states' economies. Editorial Comment, Page 15 Currencies, Page 27</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Chill wind for electronics The Japanese economy may not be in recession, but this is cold comfort to the country's electronics industry. The industry, which has been one of the engines of growth of the Japanese economy, is sputtering and stalling, writes Steven Butler. Sony, a flagship company for Japanese consumer electronics, is currently suffering losses of about Dollars 1.7m a day. Toshiba, NEC and Fujitsu have already slashed profits forecasts for the fiscal year ending in March. Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and Matsushita Electric Industrial are likely to follow suit. There are several reasons for the reversals. While consumer spending in Japan remains relatively strong, the competition between electronics manufacturers in the domestic market is cut-throat. At the same time, electronics companies have failed to develop a new generation of consumer goods to replace existing products. In the past, their strategy was to use their technological strengths to develop new products, which in turn would generate demand. But at the moment, this strategy does not seem to be working. In consumer electronics, where Matsushita and Sony are the biggest companies, consumers' demand for the products on offer has been satisfied. Sales of colour televisions, video recorders, hand-held video cameras, Walkman-type cassette recorders and compact disc players  - the big hits of recent years - have peaked. And there is little on the horizon to fuel a new burst of demand. Sony has managed to keep its factories humming, churning out more products, but not at a profit. It is, moreover, burdened with net debts of Y1,000bn (Pounds 4.5bn) following its purchase of Columbia Pictures in 1989 and CBS Records in 1988. Sony is finally paying the cost of its willingness to take big risks, and is being forced to cut capital spending by 36 per cent this year as a result. The other large Japanese electronics companies are suffering because of their investment in developing semiconductor chips, the memory banks of electronic products. Prices of the latest generation of high-capacity semiconductor chips - the 4 megabit dynamic random access memory chips  - collapsed even before demand picked up. None of the companies is likely to make profits on the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to develop the chips. The next generation of chips, the 16M D-Rams, is likely to be a money loser, and there is as yet no apparent mass market application for 64M D-Ram chips, the following generation of semiconductors. Toshiba, meanwhile, has lost its leadership in the US market for portable computers, which it helped to create, and is struggling at home. Fujitsu is suffering from the 'downsizing' in the computer industry - the move away from mainframes to small, powerful workstations. Japanese electronics companies are facing difficult questions about where to invest. They will have to spend less, and funnel it into products and technologies that are less risky. Some will find they have to abandon parts of their businesses and focus on what they can do best.</p>

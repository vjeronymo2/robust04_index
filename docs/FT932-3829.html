			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (15): Society needs to be re-invented  -Black economic empowerment is crucial to the success of democracy 'I THINK it's extremely dangerous to be ruled by people who have no material stake in the country. We've got to see that people in the majority have as large a share in the material assets of the country as we can.' No one would disagree with Mr Harry Oppenheimer, patriarch of the South African business community, when he argues that black economic empowerment is crucial to the success of democracy in South Africa. Whatever the moral arguments in favour of affirmative action - or the utilitarian arguments against it - South Africa has no option but to tackle the legacy of apartheid, which overwhelmingly prevented the entry of blacks to the managerial and entrepreneurial classes. The scale of the task is enormous: blacks have only a token presence on the boards of leading quoted companies, top management is almost entirely white, middle management is little better, and the country can boast only one large black-owned company (National Sorghum Breweries, which manufactures sorghum beer for the black market). The recent sale of 10 per cent of the insurance company Metropolitan Life to a black company, Methold - a deal which will give black investors effective control over Metropolitan Life (see box) - is a mere drop in the ocean, says Methold deputy-chairman Enos Mabuza. Mr Oppenheimer envisages further such deals, modelled on the sale of General Mining to Afrikaans business interests in the 1960s, a parallel attempt at Afrikaner economic empowerment. But he notes: 'Of course, it's more difficult to do than it was in the old days because largely they (the blacks) haven't the capital to do it and very often they haven't the skills to do it. But still, these things will grow: both the capital and the skills.' The Industrial Development Corporation, the state-owned body which provided R137m to finance the MetLife deal, can help with the problem of capital, as it did for the Afrikaner. But empowering a couple of million Afrikaners is far cheaper than financing the advance of 28m blacks; and the skills problem is acute. That is South Africa's dilemma (the mirror image of the problem facing the US over the past three decades): affirmative action must be applied to advance the vast majority of the population, not just an ethnic minority. And after decades of poor education and state barriers to black capital formation (through regulations forbidding or restricting black business), that majority departs from a very low base. Not surprisingly, the prospect of black-led government has set black expectations running high: the National African Federated Chamber of Commerce, the black business federation, has demanded that all listed companies have 30 per cent black board representation by 2000, that blacks hold 40 per cent of equity and 60 per cent of posts at all management levels. The white business community can take comfort from the fact that the African National Congress puts forward no such rigid (and unrealistic) quotas: the head of the ANC economics department, Mr Trevor Manuel, says the idea of legislating affirmative action 'goes against the grain' (though it is still under debate). The ANC's goal is to 'raise consciousness on the issue, try to develop systems which may be appropriate' (words which will scarcely frighten business), though affirmative action must be pursued with vigour in the civil service, which is overwhelmingly dominated by Afrikaners who could easily frustrate ANC political objectives. But business knows that its best option is to undertake pre-emptive action now, rather than risk legislated quotas in future - when an ANC government may be tempted to opt for the cheap solution of imposing quotas rather than investing in black advancement through grassroots education and health services. 'Any company that wants to survive is looking at affirmative action,' says Ms Wendy Luhabe, whose company Bridging the Gap tries to place candidates in companies seeking to advance blacks. 'They're frustrated because there aren't that many qualified black people. But they're looking for ready-made people. They have to take in graduates and begin to develop those people instead,' she says, adding that companies must learn to focus on the 'qualities' of applicants, not formal qualifications which they lack. The message from Ms Luhabe, and from other successful black business people, is that affirmative action should not compromise competency. Black and white businessmen alike agree that economic growth should not be jeopardised by too-drastic action, and that appointments should be made on merit. They argue that the pool of talented blacks is larger than it looks: once selection processes are no longer biased against blacks, and prejudice no longer impedes legitomate promotion, black advancement can proceed apace - at no cost to standards, or to growth. Time will tell how large is the element of wishful thinking in this scenario (few affirmative action programmes worldwide have succeeded under conditions of economic stagnation such as prevail in South Africa). But at least all principal players agree on the ultimate goal: says finance minister Derek Keys: 'We need to re-invent society in the same way as it was re-invented with the empowerment of the Afrikaner in the 1930s' - and not by merely exchanging white apartheid for black.</p>

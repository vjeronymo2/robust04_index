			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Agency status urged for prisons THE PRISON Service should be granted operational independence from day-to-day Home Office control, the Prison Reform Trust has urged. The trust wants the service to be given agency status by April 1993 and it backs many of the recommendations for reform of prison management made last month by Sir Raymond Lygo. Mentally disturbed offenders are being denied vital help because of bureaucratic red tape, the British Psychological Society claimed yesterday. It blamed rigid working patterns, complex administrative procedures and legal loopholes for the lack of treatment.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PLANNERS SAY NO TO WIND FARM IN HILLS NEAR GORMAN;  </P> <P> PANEL CITES HARM TO BIRDS, RUSTIC SCENERY  </P> <P> Los Angeles County planners on Wednesday rejected a proposal to build the  county's first power-generating wind farm in the hills northeast of Gorman.  </P> <P> The five-member Regional Planning Commission said the project would destroy the  rustic beauty of the area, promote erosion and harm wildlife, after one  protester warned that the spinning blades of giant turbines would slice up  passing birds "like they went through a Cuisinart."  </P> <P> The commission unanimously voted down the proposal after a five-hour hearing  attended by more than 150 people at Santa Clarita City Hall.  </P> <P> Zond Systems, the largest producer of wind energy in California, had hoped to  erect more than 300 windmills -- some as high as 150 feet -- on vacant,  mountainous land near the tiny community best known as a truck stop along  Interstate 5, south of the Kern County line.  </P> <P> Zond's proposal drew opposition from a broad coalition that included the  California Department of Fish and Game, the National Audubon Society, the  Sierra Club, a citizens group called Save the Mountain Committee, and Tejon  Ranch, a wealthy landowning corporation with 200,000 acres in the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ralphs Family  </P> <P> Tehachapi-based Zond had the backing of the influential Ralphs family, a  pioneer Gorman clan that founded the supermarket chain. The proposal had  divided the small town -- Gorman has only 65 registered voters -- for months.  The Save the Mountain Committee circulated petitions throughout the county and  submitted more than 3,000 signatures opposing the windmills.  </P> <P> The commissioners heard often-conflicting testimony during the hearing.  </P> <P> Zond officials cited an environmental impact report that declared that the  $100-million project would not significantly harm wildlife or the environment.  The report said the proposed site was outside the routes usually traveled by  the endangered California condor. The giant condor is now confined to  captivity, but scientists hope to reintroduce the birds to the region in the  early 1990s.  </P> <P> But Linda Blum of the National Audubon Society said the windmills would raise a  dangerous barrier in a former condor "flyway." Sherry Teresa, a wildlife  biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, said the environmental  impact report was deficient. She said it failed to note that three endangered  species -- the bald eagle, peregrine falcon and Swainson's hawk -- have been  sighted at the proposed wind farm site.  </P> <P> Russell Hemsath, speaking for the California State Racing Pigeon Organization,  said, "Our birds would look like they went through a Cuisinart."  </P> <P> But Steven W. Carothers, an environmental consultant for Zond, countered that  the number of birds killed by windmills statewide is "relatively  insignificant."  </P> <P> Zond President James Dehlsen tried to persuade the commissioners by touting  windmills as clean producers of energy that would reduce pollution and the use  of gas and oil. 'We like to think we're practicing environmentalists," he said.  </P> <P> But commissioners rejected his argument, saying their concern was land use, not  utility bills.  </P> <P> Zond had originally proposed building 458 windmills but scaled that proposal  down to 350. Dehlsen offered to cut back the proposal to 319 so that none of  the giant machines would be visible from Interstate 5, a common complaint by  the project's critics.  </P> <P> Commissioners were not swayed. 'I really have a problem with this project,"  Commissioner Betty Fisher said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Lee Strong agreed that the site was ill-suited to a wind farm but  said that much of the opposition probably came from landowners with their own  development plans. Referring to the parade of paid experts who testified for  the opponents, Strong said: 'You can't tell me that the money that has been  spent comes strictly from the people. It's coming from people who are concerned  about 'what is going to happen to my piece of property?' "  </P> <P> Dehlsen said it was too soon to predict whether Zond would appeal the  commission's decision to the Board of Supervisors.  </P></p>

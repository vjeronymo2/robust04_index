			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan Should Rectify Its Inward-Looking </F> Disposition"]    [Text] The Group of Seven (G-7) meeting of finance  ministers and central bank governors was held in Frankfurt,  Germany, last weekend. During the meeting, criticism against  Japan's current accounts surplus was stronger than ever.    This was expected because economic conditions in all seven  nations, except the United States, are bad, and the G-7 are all  plagued with the problem of mass unemployment. Japan was  particularly isolated at this recent international conference  because even the United States joined the attack on Japan.    However, looking back at the G-7 meeting and recent behavior  of the government, we are concerned that Japan is becoming  overly inward-looking in its relations with the United States,  and in the international arena.    Japan cannot evade the responsibility for enjoying a huge  current accounts surplus for more than 10 consecutive years.  Yet, it has also made various efforts.    With regard to efforts to expand domestic demand, Japan has  compiled a 15-trillion-yen comprehensive economic package  featuring income tax cuts. Yet, these macroeconomic measures  are not appreciated at all. It is true that there is room for  argument with regard to the merit of these measures. However,  in view of declining revenue income, the economic package  probably represents maximum efforts on the part of Japan.    U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen voiced the  criticism that "Japan's stimulation measures are insufficient."  IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus also said, "Only minimal  growth effect can be expected." To the Japanese financial  authorities, their arduous efforts that went into the  formulation of the economic stimulation budget have indeed  received shockingly little appreciation.    The ratio of Japan's current accounts surplus to GNP is  expected to diminish rapidly even according to the forecast of  international organs. Yet, the United States turns a blind eye  to such estimates. It is also strongly critical of the tax cut,  claiming "since this is limited to one year, it would only be  half as effective."    How come our efforts to expand domestic demand are not  conveyed to foreign countries accurately? If things go on like  this, Japan will surely be in a very difficult position. Why is  it that we are unable to make even U.S. Ambassador to Japan  Walter Mondale understand us correctly?    The Hosokawa administration has failed in its efforts to win  the foreign countries' understanding. The question is: Why is  the communication process that bad despite the fact that Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton enjoy  a good relationship of trust?    The Ministry of Finance used to have friendly relations with  the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Such relations  deteriorated in the past two or three years, and they have  worsened recently. The U.S. Treasury Department's assessment of  our macroeconomic policy may be a consequence of this.    Communication channels between the governments and  legislatures of Japan and the United States have also been  reduced. In short, there is not one out of 100 members of the  U.S. Congress who truly supports Japan. The fact is, in 1985,  the U.S. Senate passed a bill to impose sanctions on Japan  unanimously.    What has the Foreign Ministry been doing? And what about the  Japanese Embassy in Washington? Has the Hosokawa administration  been serious about having dialogues with the United States? Has  it really worked hard to persuade the international community?    Coordination between Japan and the United States was a basis  for the past G-7 meetings. Such a basis has disintegrated since  the recent Frankfurt meeting. The recent meeting seemed to have  conducted level-headed discussions and reached appropriate  conclusions on issues such as aid to Russia, economic growth  strategy, Japan's surplus, and turbulence in the bond market due  to interest rate fluctuations in the United States.    There is no guarantee that an encirclement of Japan would  not  be formed. Any nation may try to look for a scapegoat for its  domestic difficulties.    Japan should brace itself up. It should also exert untiring  efforts to make the world understand its position. Bureaucrats  should look to the world. Otherwise, we may end up repeating  the stupid mistake of not being appreciated even though we  donated $13 billion during the Gulf war.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 16 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and  industry, when asked about reports that the United States wants  Japan to ease 45 instances of regulations, admitted, "I  understand that such a request came in January in addition to  the three priority areas in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework  talks." Talking to reporters following a cabinet meeting on 15  March, Kumagai then said, "It will be impossible to finalize  deregulation issues by the end of March; it will probably take  until the end of June to resolve them."    As for the direction of future tax cuts and financial  resources to cover the resulting shortfalls in revenue, which  are the issues that the United States is concerned about, the  minister said: "Because the matter will have an impact on the  formulation of the 1995 budget, we must arrive at a conclusion  on it by the end of June. I am shocked by the thinking of some  people who believe that this matter can be put off." The  minister insisted that the matter should be settled by the time  of the [Naples G-7] summit, and he served a warning to the  members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan and others who  are indecisive about the tax-cut question.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / The Battle For Midland: Villagers call banks to account - The blight on Chiddingfold CHIDDINGFOLD is one of those pantiled Surrey villages you used to pass through on the way to the south coast in the days before motorways and foreign holidays. The children on the back seat of the car, uncontrolled by safety belts, would push their noses against the glass and shout: 'Oo, isn't this lovely. Can we stop and feed the ducks dad?' And father would look down at his watch, then up at the half-timbered pub overlooking the village green and the pond and think: 'why not?' He might have popped into the Lloyds bank next door and topped up his holiday money. A few doors further along the green he would have found the NatWest and the Midland. The sign of the black horse hung fittingly across from the old forge where horses were being shod as late as 1950. The forge survives, along with the butcher, the baker, the grocery store, the newsagent and the chemist. Chiddingfold is a healthy village of about 3,000 people but trade has suffered in the 13 months since the sign of the black horse was replaced by an estate agent's board. NatWest was the first to leave about 18 months ago. Then the Midland went and Lloyds closed its doors about a year ago. In 1609 a pestilence hit the village, claiming 50 souls in quick succession. It was as if nearly 400 years later the banks had fallen to another disease. Mr David Wright, the blacksmith, believes the affliction had a foreign origin. 'All those bankers went down to Mexico, drank a lot of tequila, and lent them too much money. Now we're paying for it,' he said. 'Lloyds sent us a letter saying 'We are closing this branch so that we can improve your quality of service.' I have it somewhere. It was worth keeping.' Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman, this week cited Chiddingfold as an example of how a bank merger could prevent what he called disorderly attrition. When he said it was 'an absolute nonsense' that 'poor Chiddingfold' had no bank branches, the locals found his statement somewhat ironic given that Lloyds had been the last bank to go. 'They told us they would not leave the village, so many people transferred their business to Lloyds. It was doing so well, and we still cannot understand why it has closed,' said Mrs Susan Rose, who runs the newsagent's shop with her husband Brian. The banks were run as sub-branches of larger branches in Godalming, eight miles away. They opened up on three days a week, 10am to 2pm Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 'Of course all three branches opened the same days and hours. They didn't stagger the hours,' said Mrs Rose. The Roses organised a petition which failed to move Lloyds, nor could they interest the bank in the idea of running a cash machine in their shop. They suggested a mobile bank, or the banks getting together and sharing the same premises, but the villagers ultimately had to settle for the only option left to them - to drive into Godalming or Haselmere. 'This place really used to buzz on a Friday. All the farmers used to come here to the bank and buy their Farmers' Weekly at our shop. They don't come now,' said Mr Rose. All the traders said their businesses had suffered because people would often combine their trip to the bank in Godalming with doing their shopping. Mr Reg Young, the butcher, said he had seen his trade drop by 40 per cent since the banks went. One of the biggest complaints is the outlay necessary for villagers to get at their money. The return bus fare to Godalming is Pounds 2.20 and a new parking scheme charges 40p for all on-street parking. 'It takes an hour of my time and costs me 40p plus petrol, every time I go the Midland Bank in Godalming,' said Mr Young. Sir Jeremy appears to have re-ignited a militant streak among the villagers that has lain dormant since 1929 when they threw the village police sergeant into the pond, accusing him of burning down their annual bonfire before the celebrations on November 5. Some 200 policemen were summoned and lined up on the green. It was the last time they read the riot act on English soil. Beneath the Jaeger sweaters and the Harris tweed jackets the sinews are stiffening once more. 'It's killing village life,' said Ray Bastable, the travelling fishmonger who has to increase the size of his float when he comes into the village. 'Nobody has any change,' he said. Villagers are helped by a friendly service from some of the shops. 'You can cash a cheque for Pounds 50 at the Co-op when you buy goods there,' said Mrs Thelma Lane. Another saviour is the Post Office, which offers free banking with Girobank but it costs Pounds 2.50 to cash a cheque from one of the clearers there. No-one in Chiddingfold, it seems, quite understands why every clearer had to leave. Lloyds said yesterday that no decision to close branches was taken without 'an awful lot of thought and regret.' It said the Chiddingfold branch had about 200 customers when it closed and had been unviable.</p>

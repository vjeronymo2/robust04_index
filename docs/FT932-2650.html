			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (5): An impressive beginning - Politics / La Lega dei Ticinesi TICINO'S normally tranquil political life was rudely shaken up two years ago when a totally new party, La Lega dei Ticinesi, took 12 per cent of the vote in cantonal elections and claimed 12 of the 90 seats in the Bellinzona legislature. A few months later, it took 25 per cent in the elections for the federal parliament, winning two of the canton's eight seats in the lower house of parliament and one of its two seats in the upper house. Last year, in communal elections, the Lega's average vote slid back to 18 per cent, but it did very well in the cities, winning enough in Lugano to place two members on the city's five-man governing council. It is all rather impressive for a party that did not exist three years ago and which has no clear philosophical base. 'We are not a party of the left or the right,' says Mr Flavio Maspoli, one of its federal parliamentarians, cheerfully. 'We are for people who have had enough and want a change.' It is difficult for the foreign visitor to see much need for change in this idyllic little corner of the world, but the Lega has found fertile soil in a number of causes. It campaigned vigorously but in vain last year against the proposal to build a new high-speed rail tunnel through the Gotthard pass. But it was successful in opposing the plan for Switzerland to join the European Economic Area (EEA). This year, it has led the fight in Ticino against the government's plan to buy FA-18 fighter aircraft. The party's roots lie firmly in protest. Mr Maspoli and another party leader, Mr Giuliano Bignasca, set up Ticino's first Sunday newspaper, Mattino della Domenica, in 1990, with a view to making it a muckraking paper. Critics say that Mr Bignasca, a controversial local property tycoon, started it because he was angry that he lost a bid for a large federal government building contract. In any event, the paper got off to a flying start with a campaign against irregularities in government subsidies for poor people's health insurance premiums and quickly acquired a large following. Critics say that the paper is popular because it is free. Lega leaders reply that people queue up at 7am on Sunday at the distribution boxes to get one. There is no home delivery. As Mr Maspoli, its editor, recalls, within months letters were pouring in suggesting that he and Mr Bignasca set up a political party. Mr Maspoli believes that the main reason for the party's success was that many people were fed up with the long-entrenched patronage system that permeates Ticino politics. Until the Lega came along, the liberal Radical and Christian Democratic parties operated a cosy system of parcelling out jobs pro rata to their supporters at all levels. Because of the party's name, it is a fair assumption that local nationalism also has something to do with its appeal, but party leaders play it down. Mr Maspoli fumes about the fact that companies based elsewhere in Switzerland pay no taxes in Ticino on their activities in the canton. Similarly, he complains that the canton gets virtually no benefit from the vast amounts of electric power from Ticino power stations transmitted to consumers north of the Alps. Last month, its members in the cantonal legislature protested when the governor proposed importing milk from Italy during the summer to fill a seasonal shortfall. Even within the canton, the Lega plays regional politics. Its strongest base is in Lugano, where members have been able to argue that the Ticino's largest city provides more resources to the canton than it receives. But opponents claim that the Lega is merely an opportunistic protest movement. 'It plays on people's lowest sentiments. It is very populist, and even xenophobic,' says Mr Dick Marty, the governor. Mr Claudio Generali, chairman of Banca del Gottardo and a former governor, concedes that the Lega has been clever so far, maintaining voter interest by launching a string of petition campaigns for referendums on touchy local issues. The latest one was over the selection of incinerators. The party claimed that the government's plan to build two was a typical compromise aimed at keeping supporters of both traditional political parties happy whereas one high technology plant would be adequate and would save money. Sometimes, however, its campaigns backfire. Last summer, Mr Bignasca huffed and puffed his opposition to new highway speed limits and threatened to hold a demonstration on the main north-south motorway. In the end, in the face of heavy threats from the police, he contented himself with a symbolic demonstration on the motorway at a Lugano theme park featuring a scale model of Switzerland. It is a moot point whether Mr Bignasca is more an asset or a liability to the party. He has been investigated for drug possession and is now serving a suspended seven months sentence for failing to pay welfare contributions for his employees. What are the party's prospects in the future? The next indication does not come until 1995 when new cantonal elections will be held. Mr Maspoli is full of confidence, anticipating that one day the Lega will control the cantonal government. Mr Raffaelo Ceschi, an historian, is more sceptical. 'It could disappear very quickly,' he says. 'It could be absorbed by one of the traditional parties if they straightened themselves out.'</p>

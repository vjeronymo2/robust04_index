			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Battle to clean up in Indian market - Competition in soaps and detergents is growing Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, champions of soaps and detergents markets around the world, are preparing to do battle in a country with 880m potential consumers. Not far behind them are other multinationals, including Henkel and Benckiser of Germany and Kao of Japan. Even two years ago, the prospects of the world's largest soaps and detergents makers buying control of local competitors in India would have been unthinkable. Now, economic liberalisation is freeing companies to fight for a market, which is already worth Rs23bn (Dollars 733m) and is growing at an annual average of 10 per cent. Mr Sushim Datta, chairman of Hindustan Lever - the Indian affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine - says that competition is all set to intensify. 'There's going to be a fierce battle for shelf space.' Unilever, which has been operating in India since before independence in 1947, is buying control of the Tata Oil Mills Company (Tomco), the 75-year-old soaps and detergents company of the Tata group. In March, the boards of the two companies approved the merger of Tomco with Hindustan Lever which has annual turnover of Rs20bn, two-thirds of it in detergents. P&amp;G, a relative newcomer to India, last December struck a deal with Godrej Soaps, a privately-owned manufacturer with annual sales of Rs5bn. They formed P&amp;G Godrej, a joint venture in which P&amp;G took a 51 per cent stake. Mr Adi Godrej, chairman of the new company, says joining forces made sense because 'a major competitor is a partner now.' By buying out strong home-grown brands, Unilever and P&amp;G have deftly eliminated local competition and acquired wide-ranging distribution networks. The partnership with Tomco gives Hindustan Lever a considerable presence in the market, with an overall share of 26 per cent in volume terms. In toilet soaps, with the addition of Tomco's soaps to its own best-selling brands, Hindustan Lever now has a 70 per cent market share. The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission is examining claims that the merger would make the multinational an over-dominant force in the market. For P&amp;G, the corporate matchmaking is even more significant. Before signing up with Godrej, P&amp;G's presence in India was limited to one product - Ariel, an enzyme-based detergent concentrate powder which was launched two years ago. P&amp;G's range now includes Godrej's detergents and soaps that collectively have a 10 per cent market share. P&amp;G has also bought into Godrej's distribution system and has gained access to Indian soap technology. This is based on vegetable oils rather than animal fats, which are extensively used elsewhere in the world but which are taboo in India. Ever since Lever earlier this year introduced Surf Ultra in response to Ariel, a squabble has broken out between the two companies, which has included allegations of false advertising claims and unfair selling tactics. The concentrated powder segment that they have been quarrelling over is tiny  -less than 2 per cent of the total detergent market. Hindustan Lever's general sales manager, Mr Rajendra Aneja, calls it 'a battle in sheer futility . . . it's more a prestige issue'. Selling Ariel has been a strain on P&amp;G's bottom line; in the last two years the company has suffered accumulated net losses of Rs210m. Lever and P&amp;G also have others to worry about: Germany's Henkel has a joint venture with Southern Petrochemical Industries; Benckiser, also German, has an office in Delhi; and Kao, the Japanese group, is eyeing the Indian market. For Indian consumers, it means a belated range of choice - not to mention a dazzling display of marketing from some of the top consumer products companies.</p>

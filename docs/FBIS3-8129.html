			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 1 March (MTI) -- Notwithstanding the air  incident in Bosnia, there is no need for a new parliamentary  resolution on NATO's AWACS surveillance mission in Hungary's  airspace, because Budapest has no reason to suppose NATO would  use intelligence gathered by AWACS jets for military purposes  beyond their mandate from Hungary's legislature, Parliament's  Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Laszlo Kovacs told MTI on  Tuesday [1 March].    "Nevertheless, Hungary should closely watch the South Slav  [Yugoslav] region, since the downing of aircraft violating the  flying ban over Bosnia may help escalate the armed conflict," he  added.    Kovacs recalled that parliament initially gave permission  for  the passage of peacekeeping UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection  Forces] forces through Hungary, or their possible withdrawal to  Hungary's territory. The government referred to this when it  approved the AWACS mission to carry humanitarian aid  consignments to their destination. Parliamentary parties  represented in the Defense and the Foreign Affairs Committees  subsequently acknowledged the government's decision. Later,  parliament also gave its tacit consent to AWACS taking control  of the no-fly zone over Bosnia.    However, the AWACS mission changed in nature last April when  the United Nations decided to have the aviation ban over Bosnia  observed under all circumstances and by all possible means, if  necessary even military means. In view of the new possibility  that data collected by AWACS patrolling Hungary's airspace may  be used to guide a battle in the air, the Defense and Foreign  Affairs Committees decided to ask the government to warn NATO  that AWACS mission had been permitted only peaceful purposes,  and in any other case they need a parliamentary mandate under  Hungary's Constitution.    When NATO set a deadline for Serb troops to pull their heavy  weapons back from Sarajevo, and the possibility arose that AWACS  may play some part in the ultimatum, Hungary told NATO it would  be against its interests if AWACS jets were in its airspace  during any air strikes on Bosnia, Kovacs said.    As for Monday's NATO action in Bosnia, nobody has said yet  if  it was aided by AWACS from Hungary or anywhere else, or whether  there were surveillance planes at all in Hungary's airspace at  the time.    "But as we have no reason to assume that NATO has forgotten  last April's warning that AWACS jets in Hungary must not be used  in military actions, the issue meed not be taken to parliament  unless NATO asks to extend the mission's mandate," Kovacs said.</p>

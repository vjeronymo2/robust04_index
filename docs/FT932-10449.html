			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan rises on hopes of interest rate cut EQUITY prices rose to their session peak in late trading, as stability in the foreign exchange market encouraged investment trusts and foreign investors to offset earlier selling pressure from arbitrageurs, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average settled up 189.33 at an intraday high of 20,811.36, after trading to a low of 20,491.92, a loss of 2 per cent on the week. The Topix Index of all first section issues ended 9.44 higher at 1,620,77 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.336 to 1266.65. Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was estimated at 600m shares traded, compared with Thursday's 622m. Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by 668 to 368, with 149 unchanged. According to Mr Takehiro Fukada, manager of securities investment at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, the bank has decided of late to invest again in the equity market, after a two-year absence, because the Nikkei average and the domestic economy is thought to have bottomed. Brokers said that the bank's view is representative of many domestic institutional investors and individuals who, until recently, were more conservative about their investment in Japanese equities. Chart analysts expect new money to keep the Nikkei average between 20,000 and 23,000 in the short-term. But market participants said that foreign exchange-rate considerations may limit the future gains of the Nikkei average if the yen continues to advance against the dollar. The yen closed at Y110.10 against the dollar in Tokyo trading, after climbing to Y109.65 during early trading. Investors bought issues in the gold-mining sector on the strength of high gold prices overseas. Sumitomo Metal and Mining rose Y10 to Y1,060 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting Y6 to Y556. Aoki, a Japanese construction company, gained Y16 to Y601 on reports of its gold mine project in Brazil. Olympus Optical gained Y20 to Y1,280 on reports that the company expects an increase in operating profit for this fiscal year. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 58.29 higher at 22,722.58, in volume of 33.1m shares. Roundup THERE were mixed performances from the region's markets. MANILA resumed its rally after a correction on Thursday as investors hunted for cheap shares. The composite index closed up 10.41 at 1,653.91, or 3.1 per cent firmer on the week. However, some traders expect the index to peak in the near term. TAIWAN jumped on continued hopes of a rate cut by the central bank after positive inflation figures announced earlier in the week. The weighted index gained 80.94, or 1.8 per cent on the day, to 4,573.42, but posted a marginal 0.2 per cent gain from the previous week. Bank shares, which will see wider profit margins from lower interest rates, led yesterday's rally. HONG KONG fluctuated in a narrow range on trading of selected issues, and closed slightly higher on the day. The Hang Seng index rose 2.82 to 6,798.34, 0.4 per cent lower on the week. Investors took profits on HSBC Holdings, which lost HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 69, while Hutchinson Whampoa was sought actively, rising HKDollars 1.1 to HKDollars 20.4, after reports that its placement was smaller than most market participants had expected. AUSTRALIA drifted down on futures-led selling after an early rally. The All Ordinaries index fell 6.6 to 1,685.3, but gained 0.2 per cent on the week. The gold index continued its rally and firmed 21.2 to 1,541.2 in line with the gold bullion market. However, bank shares, strong this week, lost ground. SEOUL lost further ground on worries over the government's anti-corruption campaign. The composite index retreated 6.95 to 703.85, down 2.5 per cent on the week.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Iraq Menaces Kuwait: Citizens get in supplies for new war of nerves - There is stockpiling behind false walls in the basements but no sign of panic The heavy dust haze that settled over the desert seemed to envelop Kuwait in a protective cloak. Amid the dust and the heat Kuwaitis quietly took precautions, alert to Iraqi troop movements on Kuwait's northern border. It is the latest chapter in a long war of nerves. Over the weekend, Kuwaitis and other residents formed queues at petrol stations, more in a desire to top up than from any immediate panic. They stocked up with water and bought extra supplies from supermarkets. They emptied many of the city's cash dispenser machines of dinars; 'same as any other weekend,' remarked one western diplomat yesterday. Money-changers in the souk took advantage of banks remaining closed on Saturday as part of the Friday weekend to charge a small premium for US dollars above the normal exchange rate of KD0.3 to the dollar. But when banks reopened for business yesterday morning the exchange rate had returned to normal, although one branch manager said the demand for dollars and other foreign currencies, and for transfers overseas, was abnormally high. 'What can you expect?' he asked. 'You can never tell what Saddam Hussein will do.' Civil aviation traffic, however, and all public services were unaffected by Iraq's intimidation; schools and offices continued to function normally. On the flight from Dubai, which was full of returning Kuwaitis and visiting businessmen, an expatriate Arab who has lived in Kuwait for 23 years and stayed through the seven-month Iraqi occupation in 1990-91, suggested that Kuwaitis this time would stay put. 'They are ashamed of what happened last time,' she said, 'and this time they are better prepared.' Many companies and families, drawing on the experience of those who lived through the occupation, have in the last three years built false walls in their basements to hide their stocks, including food, valuables and emergency items such as water, torches, batteries, and blankets. Few Kuwaitis expect an Iraqi invasion but many are unsure and all are relieved by the western and, above all, the US response. But Kuwaitis need constant reassurance and scan television screens anxiously for updates on CNN and BBC. They are in a sombre mood as the time approaches for today's UN debate on the lifting of Iraqi sanctions. They have no illusions about how exposed they are to Iraqi threats nor why the west is supporting them. One-half the size of Switzerland and with only 1.5m people, Kuwait would it be insignificant were it not sitting on one-tenth of the world's proven oil reserves. Their very exposure, they say, is their strength. Once again Kuwaitis have forgotten internal differences and rallied round the government, which they applaud for having signed bilateral defence agreements since 1991 with the US, Britain, France and Russia. But their concern goes far beyond the UN sanctions debate. Sheikh Saud Nasser al'Sabah, the information minister, recently stressed the importance of Iraqi recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and the border redrawn by the UN in Kuwait's favour. Except for a brief period under a short-lived military dictatorship in 1958, Iraq has never recognised its border with Kuwait, drawn up by the British in 1920. has Kuwaitis have noted with concern that Iraq's deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz failed to address the question of recognition in his speech last Friday at the UN. The UN sanctions debate only focus on the link between the lifting of sanctions and the destruction of Iraq's weapons capability. But Kuwaitis will not rest easy until Iraq accepts the existing border and Kuwait's sovereignty, and agrees to the return of several hundred Kuwaiti detainees inside Iraq.</p>

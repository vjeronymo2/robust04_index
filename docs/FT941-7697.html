			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar finishes lower The dollar yesterday weakened after comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, dampened speculation of another near-term rise in US interest rates, writes Philip Gawith. Against a background of nervous financial markets, Mr Greenspan appeared to pursue a policy of calming nerves by giving away as little as possible. Indeed, some observers were underwhelmed by his efforts, saying he had succeeded only in turning what had formerly been a highlight in the financial calendar into a bore. The US currency ended softer against the D-Mark at DM1.7269, down from Monday's DM1.7275. It was also easier against the yen as US-Japan trade tensions remained to the fore ahead of Saturday's meeting of G7 finance ministers in Frankfurt, where this issue is expected to top the agenda. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.7235 and Y105.54. In Europe the D-Mark enjoyed support from an unchanged repo rate at 6 per cent, but worries about industrial unrest continue to weigh on the currency. It finished unchanged at FFr3.398, was stronger against the Italian lira but lower against the Belgian franc. The weaker dollar reflected Mr Greenspan's failure to deliver the message of further monetary tightening that many in the market had anticipated. Little that he said was new, and no light was shed on the crucial question of the timing of the next policy move. The movements in the currency, however, were mild. The market's view of Mr Greenspan's comments was bolstered by a lower than expected US consumer confidence number for February - 80.8 compared to a market expectation of 82.7 - which appears to support the view that a further tightening of policy might be premature. Reports from Asian markets said the Bank of Japan was continuing to intervene to support the dollar against the yen. Sterling performed reasonably well yesterday, buoyed by a slight upward revision of fourth-quarter GDP growth to 0.8 per cent from a provisional estimate of 0.7 per cent. It closed mildly higher in London against the dollar at Dollars 1.4785, from Dollars 1.4755 on Monday. It also improved against the D-Mark, ending at DM2.5531 from DM2.5488, although analysts said this was mostly a reflection of D-Mark weakness. Indeed, Mr Mark Geddes, UK Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said the 'tone' in the market towards sterling was 'very negative'. He added that there had been a 'subtle change' in sentiment towards the pound since the rate cut of two weeks ago. 'Market attention has now shifted to when, and not if, interest rates will next be cut.' Against this background Mr Geddes said he was surprised at the optimistic tone of the report produced yesterday by the panel of six wise men who advise the government on economic policy. The panel said it did not believe tax increases that take effect in April would threaten the recovery. It did say, however, that it expected interest rates to rise next year. This view was taken to heart in the sterling futures market, with prices at the long end falling sharply. Yesterday afternoon the September 95 future had dropped by 21 points to trade at 93.92. The December 94 future was trading at 94.70, showing the market view that the base rate is likely to be 5.3 per cent at the end of the year - higher than the existing rate of 5.25 per cent. Some analysts said the impact of the report had probably been exaggerated by the fact that it came at a time when there is a general nervousness about interest rates. Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister of Canada's newly formed Liberal government, yesterday delivered his budget against the background of a market jittery about the state of fiscal and monetary policy. The Canadian dollar has recently been under considerable pressure, a problem exacerbated by the virtual disappearance of the historical interest rate differential with the US dollar. The gap on three-month Treasury bills has fallen to 33 basis points, the narrowest level in more than a decade, compared to a peak of 600 points early in 1990. The spread on 30-year bonds is currently 80 basis points. Mr Martin aggravated matters earlier this month when he said Canadian rates might fall below US rates. Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said Mr Martin would probably have done better to pursue this aim by stealth. Mr Geddes said the Canadian dollar might show short-term strength if the budget deficit announced were below CDollars 40bn. The government has been vocal in saying how difficult this would be to achieve, and posting a figure below this level would be a psychological fillip for the government and currency. The Bank of England yesterday provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.65bn of assistance, in line with its revised forecast liquidity shortage. The bulk of assistance was given through a Pounds 1.25bn repo arrangement at the prevailing interest rate of 5 5/32 per cent.</p>

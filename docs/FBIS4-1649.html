			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 1 (AFP)--China's state-run firms,  stuck in a quagmire of bureaucratic mismanagement and  half-hearted reforms, are still haemorrhaging funds at an  alarming rate, the People's Daily said Friday.    In a lengthy, signed commentary, the official communist  party  organ said reforms granting more autonomy to state enterprises  had not been fully implemented, resulting in "contradictions"  between management and government over industrial policy. "The  functions of the government and enterprises are mixed up" the  commentary said, causing damaging delays in such areas as the  purchase of sorely needed modern equipment.    Many state firms are still operating the "iron rice bowl"  system guaranteeing jobs for life, which burdens management with  welfare obligations that are incompatible with China's emerging  market economy, it added. At the same time, increased  production costs resulting from a shortage of energy and raw  materials are exacerbating the losses suffered by state sector  firms producing essential goods that are still subject to  government price controls.    Reform of the state sector is an extremely sensitive issue  in  China, given the inevitability of bankruptcies and mass layoffs  that goes with it. New fiscal reforms introduced at the  beginning of the year have also taken their toll, the newspaper  said, as many firms have lost essential financial and tax breaks.    Sorely unable to compete in an increasingly market-driven  economy, more than one third of China's 13,000 medium to large  state firms are in the red and a similar proportion in  difficulty. Losses in 1993 totalled around 30 billion yuan (3.4  billion dollars), up more than 20 percent from the previous year.    However, according to the People's Daily commentary, the  only  way out of the crisis is to deepen the reform programme and  create a national economic environment that will benefit the  state sector in the long term. Meanwhile, steps should be  taken to clarify and strengthen the administration of state  firms, improve product quality and upgrade technical equipment.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Upsets dismissed as Standard Chartered rises Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, insisted yesterday that upsets in the Hong Kong securities market and its bullion trading arm Mocatta had not affected profits and were unlikely to be repeated. It said the incidents, which led to a ban on it underwriting new securities issues in Hong Kong, and allegations that its staff bribed officials in the Philippines and Malaysia, had come to light due to tightening of its internal audit procedures. The bank increased its interim dividend 20 per cent to 2.25p, against 1.875p, as it disclosed a rise in pre-tax profit for the first six months to Pounds 237m, compared with Pounds 170m. Earnings per share rose to 14.7p from 9.3p. Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman, said that the ban on Hong Kong underwriting until next April had 'no effect on these figures of any significance at all' because the market in initial public offerings in the UK colony was going through a lull. Mr Gillam did not expect such incidents to occur again, although this could not be guaranteed. 'I cannot say we will never find anything else. We employ 30,000 people in a lot of countries, and people are people.' Loans and advances to customers were flat at Pounds 17.1bn, and Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said Standard Chartered was running down assets linked to commercial property in Hong Kong and other Asia-Pacific countries because of the risk. Profits in Hong Kong fell to Pounds 108m from Pounds 122m, partly due to a 20 per cent narrowing of its net interest margin. Mr Peter Wood, finance director, said this had mostly been caused by it taking on some Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in longer-term liabilities to match assets. African profits rose to Pounds 18m from Pounds 5m, and growth in India contributed to a Pounds 30m profit in the Middle East and south Asia, compared with a Pounds 7m loss. Standard Chartered is appealing against a Pounds 7.3m fine over its part in the Bombay securities trading scandal. Income from foreign exchange and securities dealing fell marginally to Pounds 103m from Pounds 104m. Net revenue rose to Pounds 812m from Pounds 779m, and expenses rose 7 per cent to Pounds 518m. Provisions for bad debts fell to Pounds 69m from Pounds 128m. The tier 1 capital ratio of shareholders' funds to assets weighted by risk rose to 7 per cent from 5.4 per cent. Although this is at the top end of UK bank ratios, Mr Gillam said it wanted to establish a record of retained earnings. The shares closed 16p down at 259p. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Beckenham in loss and seeks Pounds 2m BECKENHAM GROUP, the USM-traded engineer, yesterday called on shareholders for Pounds 1.9m net via a rights issue and also announced that it ran up a loss for the six months to end-April. The proceeds of the cash call would be used to continue the restructuring, strengthen the balance sheet and provide additional working capital. Turnover for the half year fell to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 26.5m) and at the pre-tax level the loss worked through at Pounds 771,000 compared with previous profits of Pounds 746,000. Directors described the result as unsatisfactory but said it was a 'considerable improvement' over the preceding six months' loss of Pounds 6.2m. The half-year deficit included a full provision of Pounds 164,000 against the effects of Olympia &amp; York, one of its larger customers, being placed in administration together with reorganisation and closure costs amounting to Pounds 386,000. Further reorganisation costs would be incurred in the second six months but the directors anticipated that reorganisation would be virtually completed by October 31. Interest charges rose by Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 364,000, well down, however, on the preceding half year's figure of Pounds 741,000. As a result of disposals, bank borrowings at June 30 totalled Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 9.7m at October 31 1991). Further disposals, together with the proceeds from the rights issue, should reduce indebtedness by a 'substantial' amount. Losses per share were 1.4p (earnings 1p) and the interim dividend is omitted  -0.5p was paid previously but the final was passed. The fully underwritten rights issue is of 35.51m shares on a 3-for-4 basis at 6p per share - in line with yesterday's close, down 1/2p.</p>

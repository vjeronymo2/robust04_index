			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Alcatel Cable rises 16% to FFr1.27bn ALCATEL Cable, the wire and cable subsidiary of Alcatel Alsthom, the French group which is the world's largest maker of telecommunication equipment, saw net profits increase by 16 per cent to FFr1.27bn (Dollars 220m) in 1991 from FFr1.1bn in 1990. The company, which recently reached agreement with the AEG arm of Daimler-Benz, the German industrial group, to buy its cable business, saw turnover rise by 12 per cent from FFr24.52bn to FFr27.48bn last year. The AEG deal, which was announced in October, came too late to affect Alcatel Cable's results for 1991 although it raised the latter's share of the German market from 10 to 25 per cent. However, Alcatel Cable had already made a number of acquisitions - including those of Vacha in eastern Germany and Orbitec in France - which did contribute during the year. Alcatel Alsthom recently announced an 11 per cent increase in consolidated sales to FFr159.9bn in 1991.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Warning on German forces: Bundeswehr not ready for active operations, says report THE German Bundeswehr is currently not in a position to be deployed on active operations, according to a damning report published yesterday by the parliamentary ombudsman responsibility for the armed forces. Even if the political parties in Bonn were able to agree a coherent policy on the use of German military units outside the Nato area, the Bundeswehr would be willing but not immediately able to carry it out, he warned. The primary reason is the upheaval caused by huge changes in structure and planning, as a result of military cutbacks, and the integration with east German units, he said. At the same time, German professional soldiers on long-term commissions are suffering a crisis of morale, because of uncertainty about their careers. Mr Alfred Biehle, who is responsible for an annual report to the German parliament on the state of the armed forces, issued an urgent appeal for political clarity on the role and financing of the military, to restore confidence in the ranks. His sweeping criticism of the government and political establishment comes at a moment when the issue of whether German troops can serve outside the Nato area threatens to split the ruling coalition and even bring down the government. The Free Democratic Party (FDP), including Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, is demanding that German crews be withdrawn from airborne reconnaissance aircraft (Awacs) in the Adriatic, if the UN security council decides to enforce the no-fly zone in Yugoslavia. The FDP says it cannot be used in such a combat-related role unless the German constitution is changed. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and their Christian Social Union sister party are adamant that the crews must stay on board the Awacs, which are operated by the Nato allies jointly. Mr Biehle, a member of the conservative CSU, said the lack of a clear policy from the political establishment was an important factor undermining morale, compounded by the drastic cuts in defence spending. 'For the armed forces, this has been a very difficult year,' he said yesterday. 'The army has had more demands made on it than ever before. The hope of getting binding decisions on a clear planning timescale is evaporating. 'I greatly regret that the discussion over the tasks and limitations on (military) operations has still not been concluded . . . Soldiers report frequently on the danger of becoming ever more isolated from their comrades in allied forces.' He rejected suggestions that the armed forces showed growing sympathies for right-wing political extremism, saying there had been just 61 cases of suspected right-wing actions involving soliders, in armed forces numbering 425,000. In only one case was an officer involved. 'There is no swing to the right in the army,' he said. Three suspected extremists have been detained after an anonymous caller threatened in the name of Adolf Hitler to bomb a refugee hostel, police said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. A police statement said the three were held on Monday after police received a telephone call concerning the home for asylum-seekers in Schleiden-Gemuend, just west of Bonn. Seventeen people were killed last year in racist violence.</p>

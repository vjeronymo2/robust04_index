			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: No date set for GPG return THE DATE of GPG's return from suspension is still not known. When questioned at yesterday's annual meeting. Sir Ron Brierley, chairman of the investment vehicle, said that the company was still in discussions with the Stock Exchange. An announcement would be made when appropriate. He added that he hoped it would not be too long as the circumstances in which the company had been suspended no longer applied. Sir Ron refused to appoint non-executive directors and faced strong questioning about the choice of preparing the accounts under the Financial Reporting Exposure Draft 1, which has not yet been adopted. The call for non-executives was made in connection with a share option scheme for directors and management. Sir Ron said he was a non-executive director and also thought that the existing management should be able to take responsibility for the scheme, under which he would benefit. The choice of the new draft was made, according to Sir Ron, because it was topical when the accounts were produced and he thought it would be adopted in the near future. He added: 'I feel that it is a very good and simple concept which provides a realistic picture of the company.' Under the new draft earnings per share came out 3.38p, whereas the present rules earnings would have been 1.58p. GPG's shares have been suspended at 23p in London since December 1990 when it was considered to be a shell. GPG is making a hostile bid with Brierley Investments, in which Sir Ron has a 2 per cent holding, for Australian Consolidated Investments, the former Bell Resources.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Asylmuratova - Covent Garden On Friday night, Altynai Asylmuratova made her debut in A Month in the Country. From our first sight of this Natalya Petrovna, leaning back on the chaise longue, divinely beautiful and fatally bored, the ballet was hers. There was such psychic concentration and such discreet power to her movement, that the course of this summer tragedy was inevitable, and inevitably touching. What Asylmuratova brings to ballet is grandeur of scale. Not that she distorts or exaggerates her roles, but the force of her presence and of her beauty, the broad horizons of her Kirov schooling, so increase the choreography's impact that her characterisations gain an extreme intensity. Yet nothing is disproportionate. Ashton's dances for Natalya, often a filigree of quick steps, are as lightly done as one could wish, and with what native authority does Asylmuratova seize upon those Polish dance attitudes with which Ashton responds to Chopin - the proud epaulement and bold gestures have a fiery rhythm and grace. Musical and physical nuance are matched with no less sensitive playing of the drama. The flare of temper when she finds her ward, Vera, in Belyayev's arms; Natalya's own uncertainties as she yields to him, are done, like everything else, with a complete naturalness and a complete understanding of Ashtonian manner. She speaks his language with lovely ease - both in the brief dialogues with Rakitin and her husband, and in the final eddying surrender to Belyayev. The incandescence of Asylmuratova's style, and of her interpretation, persuades us of the seriousness of this summer flirtation. She re-creates Turgenyev's world. Her magic also invites a vivid response from her colleagues - Derek Rencher's Rakitin seems even more devoted, Fiona Brockway's Vera more pathetic. Bruce Sansom repeats his decently youthful view of Belyayev - but one wonders what this Natalya sees in him. Friday night's Requiem, ending a fine triple bill, benefited from Viviana Durante's innocence in the Pie Jesu, and from Michael Nunn's simplicity in the Offertoire. MacMillan's choreography is as consolatory as Faure's music, and as potent.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EVERT WITHDRAWS FROM PRE-WIMBLEDON MATCH;  </P> <P> MAY MISS FAVORITE TOURNAMENT; INNER EAR INFECTION BLAMED  </P> <P> Chris Evert withdrew today from Wimbledon's major warm-up tournament because of  an ear infection and may miss next week's Grand Slam event.  </P> <P> Evert skipped the French Open a month ago, citing lack of motivation after  losing twice to low-ranked players.  </P> <P> When she returned to the United States, there was speculation that she also  might bypass Wimbledon, but after a few days' rest, Evert said she would  compete in that event because it is her favorite tournament.  </P> <P> To prepare for Wimbledon, where she is seeded fourth, and to gain match  fitness, Evert entered this week's $300,000 Virginia Slims event at Eastbourne.  </P> <P> Evert was scheduled to play a third-round match today against Raffaella Reggi  of Italy after two easy victories. But she defaulted because of an inner ear  infection that doctors said leaves her feeling sick and dizzy every time she  moves.  </P> <P> Geoffrey Wilson, a physician, said the infection could clear up in two days or  could last longer than a week.  </P> <P> Asked whether Evert would be fit to play her first-round match at Wimbledon,  scheduled for Tuesday, Wilson said: "That I cannot say. . . . No one can be  sure."  </P> <P> If Evert misses Wimbledon, in which she has reached at least the semifinals in  16 of her 17 appearances since she first played in 1972, she may never play in  the tournament again.  </P> <P> Although she spurned talk of immediate retirement, Evert said this week that  she would not continue playing for long and that she wants to raise a family.  </P></p>

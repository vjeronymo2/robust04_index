			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: A percentage of which market? Sir, Market definitions present notorious difficulties as is demonstrated by the Pentos claim that Dillons at its low in June had a market share of 31.5 per cent ('Pentos Pounds 36m in the red after exceptional costs', October 12). The annual value of the UK book market is some Pounds 2.5bn and Dillons' sales cannot be more than Pounds 200m, which is 8 per cent. Even if the market is defined more narrowly as consumer books, Pounds 200m equates to about 12 per cent. What market definition produces a figure of more than twice that level?

The survey is under the rubric  "Economics in the Mirror of Statistics. How They Made It Through  the Year."    [Text] People's standard of living, for the most  part, is not determined primarily by how revenues are divided  up, but by the amounts that go into the budget. And this depends  directly on total amounts earned by industry.    The information presented here is based on data  provided by the Municipal Directorate of Statistics.    Last year, 1993, the production output of industrial  enterprises in our city totaled 1,400 billion rubles at then  current prices, the value of which was 8.3 times greater than  the 1992 output. But in terms of comparative prices, the total  production output of industrial enterprises decreased by 5.8  percent (if the total for 1992 is compared to that of 1991, the  difference would be 16.6 percent).    More than half (that is, 64 percent) of the Novokusnetsk  enterprises lowered their outputs of industrial products. Among  them were the Kuznetskiy Metallurgical Combine (KMK) Joint Stock  Company (for 1993, this combine's output was 86 percent of 1992  production); the Novokuznetskaya Mine (89 percent); the  Polosukhinskaya Joint Stock Company (71 percent); the  Bungurskaya Joint Stock Company (88 percent); the Taldinskiy  Open Pit Mine (80 percent); and the Viakom Joint Stock  Company--the new name for the former meat combine (75 percent).    At the same time, the decrease in the number of persons  employed in the city's industrial enterprises in 1993 was  insignificant. The city's enterprises employed 111,565 people  (or, 99.4 percent of those employed in 1992). Labor  productivity, however, fell by 5.3 percent.    And now, some words about the dynamics of producing the main  kinds of goods in Novokuznetsk enterprises. In 1993, for  example, 9.5 percent less coal was extracted than in 1992. This  sharp decrease in extraction can be explained by the inability  of users to pay for the coal, caused mainly by the higher costs  of transportation services. Certain enterprises were forced to  halt coal mining completely. Thus in June 1993, the  Zaryanovskaya Mine did not extract any coal, and the  Baydayevskaya Mine brought out only 0.7 thousand tonnes  (compared to the May output of 49.1 thousand tonnes).    The output of the most important products in the  metallurgical industry increased, compared to 1992: From rolled  metal (by 7.1 percent), to agglomerate (by 10.4 percent), to  cast iron (by 3.6 percent), and steel (by 3.0 percent). For the  most part, all this production was the result of work done by  the Zapadno-Sibirskiy Metallurgical Combine Joint Stock Company.  In addition to the afore-mentioned KMK Joint Stock Company, two  other metallurgical enterprises decreased their production of  basic metal materials: The production of aluminum was 98.3  percent of the 1992 level and ferroalloys were 97 percent.    Speaking of 1993 totals for industry, it must be noted that  compared to 1992, the rates of decrease for volume of production  have slowed down somewhat.    Still, the percent by which production has decreased remains  large. This is due to the inability of consumers to pay for  products made in the city, increased costs of transportation,  lack of raw materials, and sharp increase in the costs of all  forms of energy.    With regard to the food branch of the city's industry,  products for which there is a specific and fairly stable demand  have also been affected by the overall trend of a continuing  decrease in output. The output for whole milk was 77 percent,  compared to 1992; meat--67 percent; bread and bakery  products--88 percent; and confectioner products--82 percent.    On the whole, production of consumer goods shrank by 14.8  percent in 1993.    Still, the data for 1993 alone do not provide any  understanding about the "abyss" in which our economy finds  itself. Let us, therefore, compare the dynamics of average daily  production of basic goods for the past four years--from 1990  through 1993.    The most important output of the city's metallurgical  complex  consists of rolled metal, cast iron, and steel. The daily  average output of cast iron fell from 28.131 thousand tonnes in  1990 to 19.025 in 1993 (18.32 in 1992). The average daily output  of steel decreased from 32.61 thousand tonnes in 1990 to 21.72  in 1993 (which is somewhat higher than the 1992 figure). Sharp  decreases also occurred in rolled metal: From a daily average  output of 22.34 thousand tonnes in 1990 to 16.39 in 1993.    While the metallurgical branch showed a definite, though  insignificant, increase in its daily average output in 1992, the  coal industry showed a different trend. In 1992 the daily  average output of coal decreased by 12.34 thousand tonnes and in  1993 it fell by nearly 5 thousand tonnes, to 44.65 thousand  tonnes. Similar trends can be seen in the output of construction  materials. Here are the figures for the average daily production  of cement in 1990, 1992, and 1993: 3.616, 2.45, and 1.99  thousand tonnes, respectively. The drop in prefabricated  reinforced concrete was even greater--from 1.316 thousand cubic  meters per day in 1990 to 0.4 thousand in 1993. The output of  aluminum and electrical energy decreased in the city, although  the rate of decrease was not quite so significant.    The general trends did not bypass the production of  foodstuffs either. The daily average output of whole milk in  1990 was 334.3 tonnes. In 1993 the figure was down to 106.05  tonnes. It is doubtful that this decrease of more than two  thirds in the output of a valuable product that is needed daily  is attributable solely to the increase in its cost.    This is also obvious in the dynamics of bread production and  pastry products. There is also a decrease here, from 162.76  tonnes per day in 1990 to 143.34 in 1993. Because of this we see  constant queues in bakeries.    Understandably, our city has contributed its share to the  rising inflationary spiral. The decrease in the output of the  basic types of products invariably reflects both on price  increases and on the inflation level, as well as on the standard  of living in general. We cannot become richer if we produce and  sell less and less.</p>

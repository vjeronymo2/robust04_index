			<p>BFN     [Text] Economic guarantees could be restored this week once  the executive promulgates the Law on Conspicuous Consumption and  Wholesales, Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez has said. He  appeared before the bicameral commission specially appointed by  Congress to study Decree 51.    Julio Sosa Rodriguez explained that the suspension of  guarantees was justified while the juridical basis to eliminate  the value added tax was determined. However, with this week's  promulgation of the Law on Conspicuous Consumption and  Wholesales, the intention of the government is to reinstate  economic guarantees.    In light of lawmakers' questions on whether the speculation  unleashed by the increase in dollar prices would prompt  authorities to maintain the measure allowing the executive to  implement price control actions, Sosa Rodriguez asserted there  are mechanisms that can be implemented. He added these  mechanisms do not have anything to do with the suspension of  economic guarantees.    The minister insisted the executive will use all resources  before implementing foreign exchange controls, because this  measure would not benefit the country. Sosa Rodriguez expressed  he hopes the situation will normalize with the implementation of  the new foreign exchange sales provision adopted by the Central  Bank. He stated there are no reasons to justify an uncontrolled  increase in U.S. currency.    The minister announced he will travel on Thursday to the  United States, where he will meet with representatives of the  IMF and the banking sector to explain Venezuela's situation, to  try to restore confidence among international economic sectors.    He hinted at the possibility the government may present in  the short term a compensatory bond plan for salaries and social  programs, which would benefit the poor. Nevertheless, he did not  make specific announcements because these measures are now under  study at the Ministries of Development and Labor.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> QUINTET IN A HARD BOP GROOVE  </P> <P> Man for man, the Harper Brothers Quintet, a group formed four years ago by the  drummer Winard Harper, 27, and trumpeter Philip Harper, 24, introduced Tuesday  evening at Catalina's, is the most brilliant new jazz group of the new decade.  </P> <P> The age at which greatness in jazz musicians emerges seems to have diminished  steadily over the years.  </P> <P> Justin Robinson, on alto sax, and Kevin Hayes, the pianist, are even more  astonishing than the leaders. Both are 21. Robinson's sound is strong, his  rhythmic nuances are personal and potent. Hayes, when not limning out  illustrious single note lines, manages to find dissonances and chordal  combinations you didn't know existed. Finally there is the dependable bassist,  Eric Lemon, 30.  </P> <P> With its two-man front line of trumpet and alto sax, the group is patterned  stylistically after the hard bop groups of the 1950s and '60s. Yet this is by  no means a nostalgia trip. These men bring their own prospective to values that  are timeless.  </P> <P> Various writers inside and outside the group have supplied the themes, which  are modestly attractive jumping off points for the strings of solos. In the  finale, Winard Harper contributed an ingenious solo, partly on the rims of his  snares, then with sticks on the high-hat cymbal.  </P> <P> The group offers an example of the extent to which unhyphenated, acoustic jazz  has persevered in an era of funk, rock and fusion. The quintet closes Saturday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN ALBUM: FARMER SEEKING SOMEONE BULLISH ON ALLIGATORS;  </P> <P> $1.5 MILLION WILL BUY HIS TOURIST ATTRACTION, INCLUDING 2,000 LINEAR FEET OF  THE SNAGGLETOOTHED REPTILES.  </P> <P> There is a sign pointing the way to John Hudson's 40-acre farm, but it's  hand-painted and nailed cockeyed to a pole and partially hidden by tall weeds  on a two-lane road so far back into Everglades country that you have to look  for it. The sign reads "Airboat Rides and Gators -- Straight Ahead."  </P> <P> We're not talking Disney World here. We're talking a piece of high ground in  the swamp, littered with derelict trucks and rusted camper bodies, and  populated by more than 4,000 of the most fearsome and fascinating creatures on  Earth. But on an average day, some 150 people, many from Europe, find their way  out here to take a look.  </P> <P> One recent morning Hudson broke away from a group of German tourists and leaned  over a low cinder-block wall to look into pens where several hundred young two  and three-foot-long alligators lay in the sunshine. With snaggletoothed  overbites and a slight upturn to their jawline, the animals seemed to be  smiling in warm contentment.  </P> <P> "Yep," said Hudson, a bearded 68-year-old with a resonant baritone that once  served him well as a Southern Baptist preacher, "gators have been good to me."  </P> <P> At the sound of Hudson's voice, the gators stampeded to the far end of the  enclosure and scrambled into a wriggling pile. "They recognize my voice and  they associate it with trouble," Hudson said with a laugh. "They think I might  be coming in to get them."  </P> <P> That day the gators had nothing to fear. In fact, the next time Hudson lassos  one of his alligators it might be to load it up for a truck ride to  Mississippi, where South Florida's only gator farmer intends to set up a larger  commercial operation. There, he said, he will produce 25,000 pounds of gator  meat a year by 1992. What Hudson has in mind is gator burgers, gator nuggets  and barbecue gator, available in supermarkets everywhere.  </P> <P> "Who eats gator meat?" he asks. "Anybody who's ever tried it. Low fat, low  cholesterol and high in protein."  </P> <P> In preparation for that day, Hudson's ramshackle, low-tech tourist attraction  is for sale. The asking price is $1.5 million. For that the buyer will get a  house, a big tin-roof shed, six airboats, several junked vehicles and 2,000  linear feet of live alligator, in whatever configuration desired.  </P> <P> "You could have 200 10-footers, 1,000 two-footers or any combination you want,"  Hudson said. "But I suggest the buyer take at least a couple of the 15-footers  out in the ponds there, because those are the ones people like to see."  </P> <P> Hudson claims his tourist business takes in an average of $1,000 a day.  Admission to the farm is $1, airboat rides through the saw grass are $7.50, and  when someone is there to open the snack bar, it's $3 for a gator burger on a  bun.  </P> <P> "A real entrepreneur could quadruple business here overnight," said Hudson,  whose small staff is composed of recovering alcoholics referred by a rescue  mission.  </P> <P> Hudson is a junior high school dropout, former casino owner and one-time  hellfire preacher from Alabama who bought an airboat ride business here, some  25 miles south of Miami, 13 years ago. In 1985, when the federal government  removed alligators from the endangered species list, Hudson was one of the  first in Florida to obtain a permit to raise them commercially.  </P> <P> As the price of gator meat and hide climbed (hide now sells for about $75 a  foot), Hudson spotted the potential in other locations. This year he became the  first of seven commercial operators to be licensed in Mississippi, according to  biologist Jim Lipe of the state's Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.  </P> <P> Hudson said he is packing up most of his gators and moving to the Gulf Coast  town of Pascagoula, Miss., to be near his four children and 11 grandchildren  and because in the colder winters, the reptiles will hibernate for up to four  months, slashing his feed costs.  </P> <P> He thinks gator meat could become as popular in the South as catfish. Lipe, for  one, doubts that. But Lipe has eaten gator meat, and describes it as "healthful  and very good. I like it fried," he said.  </P> <P> Hudson is bullish on gators, and not simply because of the economics of meat  and leather. "There is a worldwide fascination with the reptile that dates to  prehistoric times, and I think God gave this animal a special assignment," he  explained. "During times of drought, gator holes provide the only water to save  many other species.  </P> <P> "In Mississippi, we're going to use the proceeds of our operation to further  our work with recovering alcoholics. So truly the alligator is an animal of  salvation."  </P></p>

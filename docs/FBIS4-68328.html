Kavtarashvili; UDC 528.344:629.783]    [Abstract] Satellite geodesy holds decisive advantages over  other forms of geodesy, e.g., coordinates can be transmitted  thousands of kilometers very rapidly, and gravitational-field  parameters can be ascertained with a relatively small number of  ground stations. The accuracy of satellite measurements  increased dramatically with the use of satellite altimetry. The  Geo-IK satellite is the centerpiece of Russia's space-based  geodesy program. It flies in a circular orbit with inclinations  of 74 and 83, with its longitudinal axis aimed at the  center of the Earth. The service life of the satellite is less  than a year, and one or two are always aloft. The satellite is  equipped with a radio altimeter, an electronic interrogator  system relay, a timing and signalling system, and laser corner  reflectors. The next-generation Geo-IK-2 is under development.  The Kosmos-192, a navigation satellite launched in 1967, was  followed in 1979 by the Tsikada system. The successful use of  low-orbit satellite navigation systems by maritime consumers has  attracted attention to satellite navigation. A system that could  be used by aviation, maritime vessels, ground-transportation  systems, and spacecraft, however, would enable the user to  ascertain three spatial coordinates instantaneously, velocity  vector, and accurate time without an interrogator. The GLONASS  high-orbital navigation system, consisting of 12 satellites in  two orbital planes is serving well, but efforts are under way to  make it and the GPS system compatible.</p>

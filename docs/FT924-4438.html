			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Chubb margin rebuilding locked on course CHUBB SECURITY, which was floated off from Racal Electronics in October, yesterday said its strategy of rebuilding margins and cutting costs is on course. The group reported pre-tax profits up 92 per cent at Pounds 26.9m for the half year to October 9 on sales down 5 per cent at Pounds 328.3m. Earnings per share rose from 2.09p to 5.44p and the group is to pay a 1.5p interim dividend. Mr David Peacock, the chief executive who has overseen a rapid turnround in the company's fortunes, emphasised that Chubb, like Racal, has a policy of paying a dividend that is 2.5 to 3 times covered at the full year. Mr Peacock said that he did not think the security market was growing, in spite of rising crime rates. 'I think the market is still steady and our job is to increase our market share but we must recognise we are in a recessionary environment,' he said. Chubb had a 3 per cent share of a world-wide market worth Pounds 23bn. In the electronic security area, where the group sees most growth, the intention was to increase the 7.5 per cent share of the world-wide market, worth Pounds 5bn, by 2.5 percentage points over the next two years. Chubb's tax rate came down from 56 per cent to 41 per cent and Sir Ernest Harrison, the chairman, said he expected this to be 36 per cent 'over a period of time'. Net debt was reduced from a pro-forma Pounds 60m at the time of the demerger to Pounds 38.6m, giving gearing of 24.9 per cent. The group took an additional extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.9m to cover costs of closure and disposal of businesses, including an additional charge connected with the sale of Hoermann Sicherheitstechnik in Germany. COMMENT As one would expect two months after demerger, there were almost no surprises in yesterday's figures, apart from higher than expected exceptional reorganisation costs. The story of margin rebuilding and introduction of new products remains compelling. And first indications suggest that margins are indeed being re-built - up from 6 per cent to 10 per cent. But the shares, have had an exceptionally good run. Chubb's market capitalisation is also now within a whisker of the value Sir Ernest Harrison put on it during his successful defence of Williams' hostile bid last year. Profits forecast for the year at about Pounds 60m, give 12.1p of earnings, and a 19 times prospective multiple. It is hard to see much upside with the shares on this premium to the market.</p>

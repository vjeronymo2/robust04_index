"Orange County and Dan Quayle are both white bread. There should be  a great fit there, but there isn't," Englander said. Padberg said local  Republicans "are loyal, but not stupid. . . . Quayle may very well be qualified  to be president in eight years, but he will have to prove it." Mark I. Pinsky  and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

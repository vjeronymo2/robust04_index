			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Damascus, 26 Apr -- Oleg Soskovets, first deputy  chairman of the Russian Federation Government, who is on an  official visit to Syria, today held talks with General Mustafa  Talas, the Syrian deputy prime minister and minister of defense.    Yuriy Mikhaylov, the vice premier's advisor, told an  ITAR-TASS correspondent that the prospects for bilateral  cooperation were examined at the meeting. During the talks Oleg  Soskovets noted that Russia continues to view Syria as a  friendly state. "We must not waste all that we have achieved  before in our relations," he said. "We have been friends for too  long."    Mustafa Talas supported the position of the Russian first  vice premier. Nevertheless, the general noted a certain cooling  in mutual relations between the two states, particularly in the  last few years. He spoke of Syria's readiness to open a new  page in cooperation with Russia.    Oleg Soskovets described the agreement on cooperation  between  our two countries, which is being prepared for signing within  the framework of the Russian delegation's visit, as first and  foremost a political step. "The position of the Russian  leadership is clear -- to enter into normal cooperation," he  stressed.</p>

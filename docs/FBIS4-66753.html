			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ahmad al-'Attar: "Map for Egypt's Small </F> Industries; Creation of 17 Small Industry Complexes in  Governorates and New Towns; 525 Million Pounds for Cost of  Investment in Complexes Which Will Provide 60,000 New Work  Opportunities; Soft Terms for Acquisition of Industrial Units by  Small Investors"]    [Text] Industry and Mineral Resources Minister Dr. Ibrahim  Fawzi has asserted that he is currently drafting a small  industries map that calls for creating small industry complexes  in all parts of Egypt and that includes 17 complexes in numerous  governorates and new towns. The investment cost of creating  these complexes amounts to nearly 525 million pounds.    The minister added that this [step] comes within the context  of the Industry Ministry's interest in making efforts to  increase small industry activity because it is a main foundation  for achieving industrial development. Moreover, small industry  activity will result in increased utilization of numerous raw  minerals and agricultural materials through the creation of  small projects to produce a large number of goods. Small  industries will also help increase cooperation with medium and  big industries, especially in the exchange of components and  parts that each of these industries produces. The new complexes  will also create nearly 60,000 new work opportunities.    Dr. Ibrahim Fawzi further added that each small industry  complex will consist of units, each of which can be used to set  up a small project. These complexes will be supplied with all  basic utilities, such as water, sewerage, electricity, and  roads. Each small investor will be able to acquire one or more  units, up to a maximum of five units, if he shows that his  project requires such a number. Facilities will also be provided  when these units are sold to small investors, including  application of the installment-payment system and a grace period.    Two small industry complexes have already been built, one in  the town of 10 Ramadan over an area of 88,000 square meters. It  consists of 296 units and it has cost nearly 20 million pounds.  The second complex is in the town of Burj al-'Arab, Alexandria  Governorate. It has been built over an area of 167,000 square  meters; it consists of 410 industrial units; and it has cost  nearly 30 million pounds. The minister went on to add that  preparations are underway to build new small industry complexes.    Engineer 'Abd-al-Mun'im Isma'il, chairman of the Industrial  and Mining Projects Executive Agency, has said that a number of  projects are under construction in this regard, including a  small industry complex in al-Sadat Town over an area of 160,000  square meters. It consists of 384 units and will cost nearly 28  million pounds. Another complex is under construction in the  city of Aswan over an area of 54,000 square meters. It will  consist of 430 units and will cost 19 million pounds.    Engineer Isma'il also said that studies have been completed  on plans to build a number of other small industry complexes and  that steps are being taken to finance these complexes in  preparation for building them. These plans include a small  industry complex in al-Matariyah Town, al-Daqahliyah  Governorate, over an area of 220,000 square meters. It will  consist of 416 units and will cost nearly 40 million pounds.  They also include a complex in the industrial town of the city  of New Damietta over an area of 62,000 square meters. It will  consist of 110 industrial units and will cost nearly 13 million  pounds. The plans further include a complex to be built on an  area of 127,000 square meters on the east bank of the Nile River  at a distance of eight km from Bani Suwayf, consisting of 296  units and costing nearly 32 million pounds; a complex to be  built over an area of 150,000 square meters at a distance of 12  km from the new al-Minya Bridge, consisting of 288 units, and  costing nearly 34 million pounds; and a complex to be built on  the east bank of the Nile River at a distance of 14 km from  Asyut Governorate over an area of 143,000 square meters,  consisting of 258 units and costing nearly 35 million pounds.  This is in addition to a small industry complex to be built on  the east side of the Nile River at a distance of eight km from  Sawhaj Governorate over an area of 160,000 square meters,  consisting of 340 units and costing 39 million pounds; a complex  to be built at a distance of 10 km from the Suez Governorate  over an area of 150,000 square meters, consisting of 354 units  and costing nearly 40 million pounds; a complex to be built at a  distance of two km from Tanta, al- Gharbiyah Governorate, over  an area of 66,000 square meters, consisting of 136 units and  costing nearly 23 million pounds; and a complex to be built at a  distance of 29 km from Alexandria Governorate over an area of  252,000 square meters, consisting of 354 units and costing  nearly 51 million pounds. Engineer 'Abd-al-Mun'im Isma'il went  on to add that there are plans being studied to build four other  small industry complexes, including one in al-'Ubur Town; one in  Jamsah Town, al-Daqahliyah Governorate; one in Musturud  industrial zone, al-Qalyubiyah Governorate; and a complex at  distance of 12 km west of the city of Ismailia.</p>

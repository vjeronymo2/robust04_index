Six strains of Rickettsia  sibirica isolated at various times from patients and  D. nuttalli, D. silvarum, H. concinna ticks in  Siberia and Far East by the restriction fragment length  polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA fingerprinting methods are examined,  and the genotypes of the R. sibirica strains are  characterized. All strains under study have an identical DNA  restriction fragment distribution pattern when used with an  endonuclease set and the same hybridization zones with the DNA  probe. The findings attest to the absence of distinctions in the  genome of six R. sibirica strains isolated from  various sources in the native tick-borne rickettsiosis  etiological agent foci in Siberia and the Far East. Isolation of  similar strains during a prolonged period serves as an evidence  of their constant circulation which is probably responsible for  the observed stability of its epidemiologic manifestation in the  central zone of its areal. The study shows that R.  sibirica is closer to R. rickettsii, R. parkeri,  and R. slovaka, and the differences among them are at  a strain level. The study is partially financed by a grant from  Russia's National Scientific Technical Program for Priority  Genetics Trends. Figures 3; tables 2; references 18: 7 Russian,  11 Western.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> APPLE HAS EYE ON $2,000 PC FOR OFFICE USE  </P> <P> Apple Computer Inc. will work toward cultivating a low-end, less pricey  Macintosh personal computer for the office environment, the company's chief  executive officer told a user conference today.  </P> <P> John Sculley said managers and office workers can use the versatile Macintosh  for functions as diverse as designing graphics or linking all company employees  on an electronic mail network.  </P> <P> "We went from a machine that was a curiosity and excited the imagination to a  machine with full functionality," Sculley told a conference aimed specifically  at business users of Macintosh, first introduced by the Cupertino, Calif.,  company in 1984.  </P> <P> Apple's top manager said creating inexpensive and smaller Macintosh models that  can perform the same office tasks as the most powerful version now available  will be a top priority for the $4-billion company in the 1990s.  </P> <P> Sculley speculated that the inexpensive machines of the '90s, as powerful as  today's high-end models, will be priced between $1,500 and $2,000. Versions of  the powerful Macintosh IIx currently cost more than $7,500 each.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Most, North Bohemia, May 14 (CTK) -- The account of  the small privatisation has enough means for allocating 6  billion crowns (200 million USD) for environmental purposes,  chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM) and chairman of the  parliamentary budget committee Tomas Jezek told journalists  today.    The proposed programme of air purification should receive  enough money for its completion, he added. The sum which is  necessary for implementation of gas heating and elimination of  small and medium-sized sources of pollution was calculated by  the Environment Ministry, Jezek reported.    Jezek said he was surprised at the governmental position  which wanted to lower the sum to three billion crowns (100  million USD). "The parliamentary draft law is still in force,  while the government presents its position. However, the  parliament decides," Jezek said.    On May 11 the government approved the allocation of three  billion crowns, obtained from the proceeds of the small  privatisation, to the State Environment Fund.    Afterwards Premier Vaclav Klaus said that the deputies "by  error" had proposed to transfer 6.1 billion crowns for the  purpose. He explained that the maximum amount was 5 billion  crowns (160 million USD) because from the 30 billion (1 billion  USD) proceeds from the small privatisation some 20 billion had  been designated for privatisation of the health sector and 5  billion to settle the restitution claims.</p>

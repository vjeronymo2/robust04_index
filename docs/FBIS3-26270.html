We will  forever treasure, inherit, and carry forward the firm stand and  belief, the rich wisdom and experience, the lofty spirit and  morale, and the fine tradition and work style that was fostered  by veteran comrades during their long struggles and practice.  The great undertakings of reform and opening up at present have  entered a new stage of development. He urged veteran comrades  to give more assistance and support to the region's work so as  to promote the prosperous development of undertakings in various  fields.    Attending the tea party were veteran comrades who had long  worked in the autonomous region, including Ting Mao, Wang Duo,  Hao Xiushan, Batubagen, and Wang Zaitian.

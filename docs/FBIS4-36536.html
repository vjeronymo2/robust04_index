			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah by Rif'at </F> Sayyid Ahmad in Beirut's southern suburb; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Ahmad] The Arab and Islamic situation is now  experiencing changes and events, especially in light of  developments in the Arab-Zionist conflict. What is your general  assessment of this situation in light of these changes?    [Fadlallah] When we discuss the negotiations that seek to  end  this conflict, we note a prominent, vital point in these  negotiations. This point is that there is an Israeli decision  in line with a U.S. decision, and which is encouraged by the  United States, to turn the Arab world into one bloc that does  not react to any Zionist action or any Western interests,  especially those of the United States. The aim is to change the  term "Arab moderation" into "Arab capitulation." They are  trying to minimize its effect and express it in terms in line  with the new world order because the Arabs want to incorporate  themselves into this order.    Thus, we have noticed that Zionism, in coordination with the  United States, worked to humiliate the Palestinian negotiator  and exhaust the Palestinian people during the negotiations  phase. This caused political confusion to the negotiators, who  accepted the negotiations as a transitional measure that will  eventually lead to an Arab regime lacking the structure of a  state. This regime, which does not enjoy the people's support,  will join all other Arab regimes that suffer separation between  their officials and peoples. This will create complexities for  the self-rule officials as soon as the rule begins touching off  political and security disorder in which they will be unable to  adjust to the experiment that Israel said it will monitor prior  to deciding its stance on subsequent self-rule negotiations.    Israel will work to benefit from all contradictions in the  arena and will use them to cause political and security chaos in  the Palestinian situation. Israel will tell the world that the  Palestinian people are not qualified to govern themselves.  Therefore, we must know that there is a plan to cause confusion  for the Palestinians through the negotiations and that there is  a plan to humiliate the Palestinian man who will move to strike  out and kill. In such a situation, massacres will be committed  in the Palestinian arena and daily killings will occur without  any U.S. response except general talk about mutual violence.    On the other hand, we notice that the jihad operations  carried out by Islamist Palestinians have attracted much  attention from U.S. officials to the extent that they deal with  'Arafat based on his rejection of these operations. They want  'Arafat's rejection to be expressed in harsh words and strong  denunciation, not just regret, when the United States is  satisfied with just expressing regret for all massacres of  Muslims committed by the Jews.    We notice that the Israelis--with encouragement from the  United States--are working to demoralize the Palestinians so  that they will not contemplate any rejectionist stance as a  prelude to demoralizing the Arab and Islamic spirit. It is in  this context that we view Zionism's handling of the question of  ties with Syria which still stands with considerable  steadfastness through its demands countering the Israeli demands.    We notice that Israel sought to empty the Geneva summit of  every substantial point that would give Syria moral strength in  the view of the U.S. public and administration and we notice  that Israel is seeking through its statements to humiliate the  Syrian position.    From this quick review, we can deduce a political fact in  the political reality and the negotiations, namely that the  negotiations must result in the submission of the Arab spirit to  the Israeli character by imposing all sorts of political and  security pressures on the Arab arena so that the Arab will have  no choice but to say no to war and yes to all the morale-sapping  stands required of him.    In view of this, we believe that the Islamists -- who are  aware of their nation's issues of freedom through their belief  in one God and in freedom for all forces in the universe -- are  the ones confirming the movement of freedom through their jihad  activities, their political belief, and all their actions that  aim to restore vigor to the nation in one way or another.    [Ahmad] Moving on to the Lebanese file, I have noticed  several internal political developments in Lebanese life since  my arrival in Beirut, including the opening of the old Christian  files. In light of your experience and your role in Beirut, do  you believe that what is happening now is a sign that Lebanon's  health has been restored following the reconciliation, or is it  the start of a new stage in the internal struggles?    [Fadlallah] I believe that there is a point that we must  stress, namely that the harsh or lenient Lebanese decisions made  in the domestic arena, which are influenced by more than one  foreign side, do not stem from a purely internal Lebanese  reality. Even the issue of rebuilding the state, which is a  popular demand made by all Lebanese people, came as a result of  foreign decisions which had unleashed the war in Lebanon by  exploiting the Lebanese contradictions inside the country. They  were the ones that brought about peace when war stopped being of  any use or benefit to this international party or that regional  one. Therefore, there is a decision made through the al-Ta'if  accord which is wholly American, though it is under an Arab  umbrella and has Lebanese signatures. It was American-born but  was implemented by the Arabs. The al-Ta'if accord includes the  rebuilding of Lebanon in its calculations. The U.S. plan is  this: to eliminate the French influence which is active to a  great extent within the Maronite and Christian ranks and  possibly within some Islamic ranks that are appendages to  political Maronism.    The U.S. policy is to sweep away the French influence from  its positions, even as some of the latter are opening their eyes  to the new U.S. atmosphere. There is a French need for  influence that finds an advanced position for itself in  Christianity and specifically Maronism, through which it can  implement its policy by exploiting sectarian emotions.  Therefore, I believe that the plan is to rebuild the state in a  way that will establish U.S. influence in Lebanon. The United  States is planning Lebanon's future in a way that will make it  part of the future regional order and therefore there will be a  country that has the power to oppose any European, Islamic, or  Arab influence.    This is the plan. It is not the signal of a new phase in  sharp internal Lebanese instability that leads the country to  war because we believe that the intra-Lebanese war is over  because it is of no use any more to any international or  regional party and is not locally possible because the Lebanese  have exhausted all their energies in the war.    [Ahmad] Turning to political issues, the region, including  Lebanon of course, is being groomed for the so-called Middle  East market which, we believe, stands for finalizing greater  Israel. The word "market" is misleading and does not stand for  the truth. What is your assessment of that concept and the  general schemes associated with it?    [Fadlallah] I cannot confirm the issue of greater Israel.  First; judging by the nature of the political, economic, and  social climate being prepared for the region, the next stage  does not give Israel more than it is already taking from the  Arab-Israeli conciliation. Second; monitoring America's  actions, we see that it is trying to adjust the area to its  wishes, so that nothing passes unless it goes through America.  Even if Israel can afford to put some pressure on the U.S.  Administration in the Arab-Israeli conflict, we know that it  cannot exert such pressure when it comes to the American-Israeli  economic conflict. In other words, the Zionist lobby cannot  pressure the American administration into making concessions to  Israel. What can happen is the facilitation of Israeli  transactions in parallel with American ones.    America seeks a free hand in the oil-rich areas. If it is  trying to preclude any European, Russian, Japanese, or Chinese  role in oil-related matters, how can it make Israel a partner?  Israel, for its part, is planning a partnership with Europe and  America in that field. Therefore, I believe that the issue of a  Greater Israel is a finished dream.    There is another matter, however. Raising the issue of the  Middle East as a substitute for the Arab world derives from  plans to establish Israel as a natural member of the region.  Normally, Israel could not be part of a region made up of  Arabs. But if that region is turned into a Middle East, Israel  can be part of it. This is particularly true when we realize  that there is a future plan to divide the regional security  system into sections, with Turkey and Israel in the forefront,  giving Arabs a role inferior to that of Turkey and  disproportionate to the size of Arabs at the international  level. This is what makes us think that we have to undertake a  careful study of the region's economic market -- the water  economy, the oil economy, and the agricultural and industrial  economy -- against the American-European dispute concerning the  export of consumer or military goods to the Arab world.    Monitoring the future, we have to see economic matters in  their strategic perspective; whereas security-wise, we have to  view the future in light of the confrontation with the Islamic  inclination or the difficult conflicts involving native or  national movements that reality generates.    We also have to monitor the new plan America might work out  by encircling the Islamic Republic of Iran through a Middle East  steered by the American strategy that is open to other  strategies in the region.    [Ahmad] Are we content with the role of bystander or do you  have a specific vision of this confrontation?    [Fadlallah] We talk about monitoring because we are trying  to  analyze reality and future prospects. But in the meantime, we  are not neutral regarding that reality. As Islamists, we seek  to revive the Islamic inclination by all means possible. We  have our own rational and diligent study that measures reality  against objectives to distort that American-Israeli plan. As  Islamists, we proceed on the basis of integration with  pan-Arabists, that is if they are determined to free the Arab  political, security, and economic aspects from the American fist  and if they have not already sunk in the dreams America is  trying to make them live by using words like moderation and so  on.    I believe that we have to relate with nationalists,  pan-Arabists, and even with the Marxists who adopt a creed  different from ours. [passage omitted]    [Ahmad] A final word by Your Eminence to your readers in  Egypt.    [Fadlallah] As I speak about the great Islamic homeland in  Egypt, I tell all our kinsfolk, brothers, and fellow citizens  that they should preserve Egypt as a strength for Arabs,  Muslims, and Africa and as a source of strength for anyone who  seeks freedom and justice.    We believe that the Egyptian nation is one of the best and  most honest, open and loving nations. We do not count on the  regime--any regime--to stand against this intelligence game but  believe that, with its Islamic awareness, Christian openness,  and originality, the Egyptian nation will foil this intelligence  game.    We want to say to the Egyptians--the regime and people--that  the regime will not benefit from this kind of bloodshed, neither  now nor in the future because the international ploy does not  want this nation to be stable. God has urged us to argue our  cases in an amicable way, to promote the cause of God with  wisdom and friendly advice, to act with goodness to turn our  enemies into friends, to be patient over our differences and  problems to know how to reconcile our differences and solve our  problems.    We are sad, very sad, about what is happening in Egypt and  do  not believe that the Islamists mean harm to Egypt or to its  people. Perhaps some people differ with them over certain  methods and concepts but we can only say that they are loyal to  the Egyptian people and the Islamic cause. We remind the  Egyptians of what Imam 'Ali said about the renegades and we do  not want to talk about the Islamists as renegades or talk about  the regime this way. We are not in the habit of characterizing  people but we seek the idea: "Do not fight the renegades for  their mistakes because anyone who seeks right and errs is not  like one who seeks and does what is wrong."    If you claim that the Islamists are wrong--indeed, some of  them use the wrong methods for rightful ends--try to initiate a  broad and the best kind of dialogue to caution them about what  is wrong if there is anything and in this case their Islamic  origins will lead them to retreat from the wrong if they are  convinced. Those who believe that the state's engagement in  dialogue means a loss of prestige for the state are mistaken,  because the state's prestige is commensurate with the protection  it offers to its people and its persuading them to integrate  with it.    I ask all our regimes: You have fought wars against Israel  that destroyed your economy, security, and policy and are now  talking about peace with the Jews who are the fiercest enemies  of the believers but why don't you talk about peace with the  Muslims who believe in God, His messenger, and the world  hereafter? They might err in their interpretations and methods  but they were not wrong in testifying that there is no god but  God, that Muhammad is his messenger, that the Koran and the  world hereafter are true, and that anyone who does not care for  Muslims is not a Muslim.    Come to common agreement with the Muslims, come to common  agreement with people of other religions, come to common terms  with all the oppressed who seek freedom against all arrogant  people.</p>

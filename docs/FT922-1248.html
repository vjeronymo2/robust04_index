			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (5): Curbs on foreign borrowing LAST October, the government announced ceilings on new foreign borrowing for the next four years. A total of Dollars 5.6bn is permitted this year, divided between the central bank (Dollars 500m), state banks (Dollars 1bn), state enterprises (Dollars 1bn), private banks (Dollars 500m) and private enterprises (Dollars 2.6bn). The ceiling is to be gradually raised to Dollars 6.5bn by 1995, the increase being split between state enterprises and private companies. Since the announcement was made, private banks have handed in details of offshore borrowing to the central bank and waited for further news. Donor officials say Bank Indonesia has collated the figures and defined a mechanism by which banks will receive individual limits. There is considerable doubt, however, whether this mechanism will ever be implemented. Not only is it open to abuse, with preferred banks receiving more generous limits, it is also tantamount to a foreign exchange control and the antithesis of Indonesia's liberal exchange regime. In a recent report, the Asian Development Bank said: 'Foreign investor confidence has been eroded somewhat by the uncertainties caused by the dramatic policy measures'. The report described the ceilings as 'only a target (not a quota) for the private sector' but warned that 'until the economy recovers, restoration of that confidence cannot be expected'. The ceilings have since been watered down by a decree in April allowing 100 per cent foreign ownership of new companies. Previously, foreigners were only allowed full ownership of companies inside bonded zones such as Batam Island. The new decree applies to investments with a paid-up capital of more than Dollars 50m in the heavily populated provinces of Java and Sumatra. Projects with lesser capital must be situated in the more remote provinces to qualify. The government has said that ceilings on offshore borrowing do not apply to loans raised to support wholly foreign-owned projects. Under the new decree, investors must sell 5 per cent of their equity to an Indonesian company or individual within five years, and transfer 20 per cent within 20 years. There is no requirement to export production.</p>

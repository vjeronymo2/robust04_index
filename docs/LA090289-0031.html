			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GROSSMONT 2-A FOOTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS TO BE SETTLED  </P> <P> To get an idea of just how bizarre last season was in the Grossmont 2-A League,  look at Valhalla.  </P> <P> The Norsemen went to the playoffs for the first time in school history -- and  officially finished 0-11.  </P> <P> At the end of the regular season, it appeared there was a three-way tie for  first in the four-team league. But finding someone willing to take the title  was difficult.  </P> <P> Grossmont was playing the best of any league team by season's end but forfeited  two games because of an ineligible player. Then, for the same reason, Valhalla  forfeited its forfeit victory over Grossmont, giving a loss to both teams. The  result was that Santana and Valhalla each won its first league title as  co-champs, and Grossmont was knocked out of the playoffs.  </P> <P> But that wasn't the end. After the playoffs, Valhalla forfeited its entire  season.  </P> <P> "After what happened to Grossmont I asked (the players) not to wear (their  league champion patches)," Valhalla Coach Carl Iavelli said. "But most of them  didn't listen. I tried to sell them to (Santana Coach) Doug Coffin, but he  wouldn't take them. They were the wrong colors."  </P> <P> The first thing on the agenda for the coaches this season was a seminar in  making sure the paper work was properly filled out.  </P> <P> THE RACE  </P> <P> Top contenders: Grossmont (5-5, including two forfeits), Santana (6-4).  </P> <P> Surprise potential: Valhalla (6-5 before forfeiting season).  </P> <P> Hoping for improvement: El Cajon Valley (1-9), West Hills (first year).  </P> <P> Game of the year: Santana at Grossmont, Nov. 3. With majority of team  returning, Grossmont wants to prove who the league champion really was.  </P> <P> THE PLAYERS  </P> <P> The man: After being the "Mystery Man" last season, Grossmont quarterback  Trevor Hanks may get a chance to drop the first part of that this year. Hanks  was overshadowed by Mr. Everything -- Rick Daynes, who rushed for 792 yards,  caught 21 passes and played linebacker. Hanks quietly led the league with 975  yards passing and nearly 17.5% of his completions (80) were for touchdowns  (14).  </P> <P> Who will fill Rick Daynes shoes? All Jack Bewley had to do was take a couple  steps backward. Bewley (6-3, 210) learned the position last year while blocking  for Daynes at fullback. He was also an all-league middle linebacker.  </P> <P> "I don't think we will be losing much with Bewley," Grossmont Coach Judd  Hulbert said. "He's a little bigger than Daynes, and he has better hands."  </P> <P> Others to watch on offense: Santana quarterback Ferdi Hollis (6-2, 200)  returns, and Andy Penwarden (5-11, 180) will have to take over for running back  Steve Cardoza (15 touchdowns and 99 yards per game). Scott Lapinski (5-11, 220)  returns at running back for Valhalla. He rushed for 386 yards in six games  while playing hurt most of the season. Quarterback Joey Fitzgerald threw for  1,400 yards and 13 touchdowns against junior varsity competition for West  Hills.  </P> <P> Others to watch on defense: West Hills linebacker Craig Threlfall (6-0, 210) is  making an impression on league coaches, and he has yet to play a down against  varsity competition. Strong safety Jason Eatherton (6-0, 176) will lead an  improved Santana defense. Linebacker Mike Jackson (6-2, 225) and safety Erik  Weichelp (5-10, 175) are among seven returning starters for Grossmont's  league-leading defense.  </P> <P> THE INTANGIBLES  </P> <P> Returners with a vengeance: The theme around the Grossmont locker room this  season is "It's Hiller Time." With the bitter taste of last year in 18  returning lettermen's mouths, the Foothillers are ready to prove who was the  best team last season. Grossmont was knocked out of the playoffs when a rarely  used player was found to have violated an intra-district transfer rule.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of seniors, and they want to prove to everybody they should have  been in the playoffs," Hulbert said  </P> <P> With eight all-league players returning, several coaches said Grossmont could  be the best team in the conference. And that includes the 3-A league.  </P> <P> Tying up the playoffs: After the league almost wound up with three of its four  teams tied for the league title and in the playoffs, San Diego Section coaches  quickly decided to make an amendment to the post-season selection criteria.  Under normal circumstances, the league would have only been guaranteed one  playoff spot because there were just four teams. But section rules dictated  that all co-champions must be given a playoff berth. That would have meant that  one fourth of the 2-A playoff teams would have come from the Grossmont when  only one or possibly two normally would have been taken. In the future,  co-champions will not be guaranteed playoff spots.  </P> <P> New kid in town: West Hills will play its first varsity season with no seniors.  The Wolfpack were 8-2 against junior varsity teams last season, but Coach Steve  Sutton doesn't expect West Hills to be as successful against varsity  competition.  </P> <P> "I think the hard work will pay off when they're seniors," Sutton said. "Some  of the hard knocks they get will help them next year."  </P> <P> The addition of West Hills gives the league five teams and two guaranteed  berths in the playoffs.  </P></p>

At the seminar,  Sam Rangsi, Cambodian economy and finance minister, said the  Cambodian national budget faces constraints and financial  reserves are dwindling. The Cambodian Government has attempted  to undertake economic restructuring in order to become  self-reliant. Two measures have been planned to achieve this:  Economic policy must be continuous, laws must be transparent,  and foreign investors must be screened; and also the Cambodian  Government will soon devalue the riel to make the currency  stronger. According to the Cambodian finance minister, six  months have passed since the formation of the new Cambodian  Government, but the economy has not yet reached a stage that  will attract investors. The government does not have enough  money to pay the salaries of officials. This could lead to  demonstrations. For this reason, the Cambodian Government has  accelerated the targeted collection of taxes to stabilize the  country's economic position.</p>

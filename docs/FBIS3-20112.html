			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Giovanni Valentini: "Center Counterattacks: `We </F> Are the Government'"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] The Pact for Italy  turned up in force at the foreign press center for a group  picture in memory of the center-left. Mario Segni [Pact for  Italy leader] was flanked by socialist former Prime Minister  Giuliano Amato; Republican Secretary Giorgio La Malfa; Valerio  Zanone, former Liberal Party secretary and chairman; and  prospective Popular Party Secretary Buttiglione. "We are  competing," the Pact leader said, "because in fact there is not  a two-pole system; we represent the only government alliance.  The rest are merely electoral alliances, a fraud. Neither of  the two could form a solid government even if it did gain a  majority." La Malfa, with his political expertise, drew  journalists' attention to the physical presence of the center.  "As you can see, there are a lot of us at this table; and we are  all here together. The others cannot do this, however, neither  on the Right nor on the Left. This is the proof that the two  poles do not exist."    With the help of some slides from the marketing bureau  experts, which were shown and commented on by economist Mario  Baldassarri, the Pact highlighted what it considers its  adversaries' weak points. Forza Italia has presented 39  proposals for tax reductions and spending increases. That would  cause the public deficit to increase from 160 to 220 trillion  lire, while the ratio of the debit against GDP would rise from  117 to 125 percent. According to the Pact's analysis, the pole  of freedoms would bring us higher taxes, less development, and  more unemployment.    The center accused the National Alliance of pursuing "19th  century style statism" and of intending to reintroduce  corporations into the economy and into society. The League,  however, was accused of having drawn up a "program for the  republic of the Po Valley" that would grant greater powers to  Milan than those currently held by Rome.    The criticisms of the left-wing front were no less severe.  According to the center, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  is presenting "unacceptable and statist proposals"; it is  advocating "real socialism in inexorable installments"; it  threatens to increase fiscal pressure to 50 percent. As for  Communist Renewal, according to the Pact, it still embodies the  old paradox of the "party of struggle and of government." In  other words, its internal inconsistencies concern not only tax  on treasury bills but also our exit from NATO.    In their exchange with foreign journalists, Segni and his  group strongly emphasized that their alignment represents the  utmost renewal. "It was I," the promoter of the "yes" vote  proudly recalled, "who promoted the referendums and who set this  process in motion." Furthermore, there has been such extensive  renewal within the Pact's ranks that 85 percent of its  candidates are not former parliamentarians but ordinary members  of society: One of the prominent figures at the conference  table was university lecturer Augusto Fantozzi, considered one  of Italy's top tax experts, who is running for the Senate in  Rome.    Following these claims, it was natural that questions would  center on the personal background of the speakers, from Segni to  Guiliano Amato, from La Malfa to Zanone, all representatives and  survivors of the First Republic. Former Prime Minister Amato  made it clear that his decision to withdraw from politics was an  entirely personal one: "I have not put myself in quarantine, and  I intend to contribute to the change, both as a citizen and as  an academic." As for La Malfa and Zanone, it is well known that  the former has relinquished his candidacy, while the latter is  running for the Senate in a particularly difficult constituency  -- central Turin -- in order to counter "a right that is  liberal-democratic in name alone."    "The institutional reform is still only half finished,"  Segni  said in order to explain the transition, stressing the need to  change the electoral law by introducing two rounds and the  direct election of the prime minister. The Pact leader, the  center's candidate to the prime ministership, is still the only  politician officially in the race for the premiership, and it is  perhaps partly for that reason that he says repeatedly that "the  vote for the center is not a wasted vote," since "it excludes  the extremes" and averts the danger of Gianfranco Fini's  [Italian Social Movement and National Alliance leader] entering  the government, or the PDS and Communist Renewal together.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Milina Villasana from the "Early Morning" </F> newscast]    [Text] Foreign Relations Secretary Manuel Tello has  proposed on behalf of Mexico that the OECD assume international  leadership in search of solutions to world economic problems.  Mexico participated at the OECD meeting in Paris as the 25th  member this organization. Tello presented to the organization's  Council of Ministers an initiative that was backed by  representatives from Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Spain.    On the last day of meetings, the Mexican foreign secretary  asked the OECD to analyze the pertinence of institutions created  as a result of the Cold War to prevent a duplication of efforts  and to make operations more efficient. He said the organization  is prepared to initiate a global analysis of the international  economic cooperation system.    At the conclusion of the meeting, OECD President Jean Claude  Baye said in a document that Mexico's membership in the OECD is  a wonderful development. The OECD president added that OECD  members view the beginning of a new phase of development for the  organization and are pleased with Mexico's contribution.    This is the first time Mexico has participated as a full  member since it officially joined the organization in April.  The OECD includes the world's most industrialized countries.</p>

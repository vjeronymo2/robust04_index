			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> JUDGE WON'T BLOCK CAMPAIGN TRANSFERS  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge Wednesday refused to grant state Senate candidate Ron  Isles' request to block his two main opponents in the 31st District race from  using more than $21,000 in campaign funds.  </P> <P> Judge W.F. Rylaarsdam rejected Isles' argument that Assemblymen Gil Ferguson  and Frank Hill violated a campaign law when they transferred money from their  Assembly war chests to their Senate campaigns.  </P> <P> Hill (R-Whittier) moved more than $20,000 from his Assembly campaign account in  December; Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) transferred $1,000 of Assembly funds to  his Senate campaign the month before.  </P> <P> Both lawmakers said they received approval from Fair Political Practices  Commission officials before moving any funds.  </P> <P> Isles' attorney contended that the transfers violated two sections of  Proposition 73, a campaign reform measure approved by state voters last year.  </P> <P> Shandra Michioku, spokeswoman for the FPPC, said Wednesday that there is a  clause in the measure that requires candidates to use only campaign funds  gathered specifically for that race.  </P> <P> However, a federal court order in Sacramento allowed candidates to move  campaign funds within their own control while a trial concerning the  constitutionality of portions of Proposition 73 is in progress, Michioku said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Isles' attorney, Ed Haggerty, contended that Isles still had the  right as a private citizen to challenge the legality of the funds transfer.  </P> <P> Judge Rylaarsdam, without commenting on the case directly, rejected Isles'  request for a temporary restraining order and set up another hearing for Jan.  19.  </P> <P> The two assemblymen and Isles, a Brea city councilman, are the main GOP  candidates for the state Senate seat vacated by William Campbell (R-Hacienda  Heights), who resigned last month.  </P> <P> The primary in the heavily Republican district that stretches from West Covina  to Laguna Beach will be Feb. 6.  </P> <P> Hill's attorney, Roy Ogden, hailed the judge's decision and blasted Isles for  "coming into court and using the judiciary for political motives." Ferguson was  not represented by an attorney at the hearing. SHELBY GRAD  </P></p>

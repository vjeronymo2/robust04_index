			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Observer: Never say never EC finance ministers meeting today near Brussels to ponder the aftermath of the summer ERM crisis should have packed their history books. For there is a strong sense of deja vu imparted by that early August communique announcing that member states would be widening 'temporarily' the bands within which their currencies fluctuate. In September 1931, when Britain left the gold standard, Downing Street explained that the Bank of England would 'suspend for the time being' its obligation to exchange sterling for gold. Forty years later, it was Richard Nixon's turn to tell his country that he had decided to 'suspend temporarily' the dollar's convertibility into gold. In his celebrated TV broadcast of August 1971, Nixon also demonstrated that French politicians were not the only ones to vent their spleen on the markets when the going gets rough. The US president blamed 'international money speculators' for the dollar's woes. 'Because they thrive on crises, they help to create them,' he argued. It was a similar story the next year, when Anthony Barber, the UK chancellor, announced that sterling was pulling out as 'a temporary measure' from the ERM's forerunner, the currency snake. Sterling then stayed out of Europe's currency arrangements until the fateful decision to enter the ERM in October 1990. Ministers today will be hoping that August's suspension of the narrow-band ERM does not turn out to be as permanent as the 'temporary' steps of yesteryear.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106>   [Editorial Report] The following items on economic </F> developments in Croatia are drawn from recent issues of  periodicals published in the republic.  <H5>  Geofizika Employees Protest Firm's Privatization </H5>   The Zagreb weekly GLOBUS reported in its 22 April issue that  a few weeks earlier the director of the Geofizika enterprise in  Zagreb received in his office a stranger who greeted him with:  "Good morning, I am Mijo Meter, the new owner of your  enterprise." Meter then presented a photocopy of a sales  contract dated 29 March 1994 stating that he and two partners  from the United States had purchased all of Geofizika's stock  from the Croatian Privatization Fund. According to GLOBUS, Ivan  Penic, president of the fund, sold Geofizika without the consent  of the fund's management board. The weekly noted that it had not  heard of any other case of a firm being sold without a decision  by the management board. The contract, reproduced in GLOBUS,  states that Meter and his partners paid 2,020,000 German marks  [DM] for stock with a "nominal value" of DM845,656.08.    The arrival of the "new owner" caused "consternation" at  Geofizika, GLOBUS reported. When Meter requested that all the  company's files be turned over to him, the director replied that  the photocopied sales contract was not adequate proof that Meter  was indeed the new owner of Geofizika and that no one had  officially informed the enterprise that it had been sold.    GLOBUS expressed surprise that the Croatian Privatization  Fund sold Geofizika for only DM2 million, when, according to the  paper, it is worth DM40 million--with "its office building and  facilities alone" worth at least DM25 million. Furthermore,  GLOBUS noted, Geofizika is of "strategic" worth to Croatia  because it possesses valuable "top secret" documents on  exploratory oil drilling throughout former Yugoslavia and in  "many countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Central and South  America." GLOBUS reported that Geofizika used to conduct  geological and hydrological prospecting for INA Naftaplin, the  Zagreb-based petroleum and natural gas producer and processor,  and that in "late 1991 and early 1992" the two enterprises had  discussed merging. Commissions had been set up and negotiations  started, "but INA-Naftaplin became a state enterprise and  Geofizika a public enterprise subject to the law on  transformation of ownership and privatization," and thus the  "district court in Zagreb could no longer register this merger."    Geofizika personnel were not informed of the court's  decision  until six days after the expiration of the deadline for the  "self-transformation of ownership," i.e., the period in which  company employees could buy the company, GLOBUS said, and, in  accordance with the law, responsibility for Geofizika's  privatization had been transferred to the Privatization Fund.  The Geofizika workers council made a decision on 6 June 1992 to  try to salvage the workers' legal right to precedence in  purchasing shares of Geofizika stock, but the Croatian  Privatization Fund "obviously did not accept this proposal."    GLOBUS reported that Geofizika filed a complaint at the  Zagreb Commercial Court on 11 April asking that its sale to  Meter and his partners be declared null and void. GLOBUS also  said that the firm's employees had requested the Croatian  petroleum workers trade union, the president of the republic,  and numerous other government and business officials to provide  "aid and protection."  <H5>  Unpaid Bills Result in Power Cut-Offs in Zadar </H5>   A large number of Zadar enterprises were without electricity  on Monday, 18 April. The following day's issue of the Split  daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported that the general director of  the Croatian Electric Industry [HEP] had ordered the cut-off of  power to numerous enterprises with overdue electric bills. Zadar  enterprises and households owe HEP DM11.5 million, an average of  three months' worth of electricity consumption per user. Zadar  residents tried to prevent the cut-off of power by appealing to  the county government and chamber of commerce, arguing that the  state owed Zadar businesses several times the amount of the  overdue electric bills for their aid to the Croatian Army and to  refugees, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported. That did not help, the  paper remarked, adding that power had been cut off "on a large  scale" in business facilities and was being cut off gradually to  private households.    The director of the Bagat-Zadar precision mechanics  enterprise told a SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reporter that the firm,  which employs about 800 workers, owed HEP DM100,000, or  one-fifth of the amount the state owes Bagat-Zadar. The company  will lose DM30,000 a day from the halting of its operations. The  director of the Textile Industry-Zadar company said that his  company owes HEP DM400,000, while the state owes the company  DM200,000. According to the director, the power cut-off is  costing the company DM100,000 a day.  <H5>  Shares of Eight Enterprises Sold at Zagreb Auction </H5>   A total of 1,686 shares of eight enterprises were sold by  the  Croatian Privatization Fund for a total of DM190,200 at an 18  April auction in Zagreb, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported in its 19  April issue. As a result of low demand, the paper said, all the  shares were sold for the minimum price. Of the shares sold,  1,054 were in the Riviera enterprise of Porec, 451 in  Istraturist of Umag, 50 in Jadroplov of Split, 50 in PIK of  Vrbovec, 30 in Plovidba-Holding of Losinj, 24 in Liburnija  Hotels of Opatija, 20 in Jadrantourist of Rovinj, and four  shares of Drava of Osijek. Except for those of Liburnija Hotels,  with a price of DM1,000, all the shares sold for DM100.  <H5>  Croatian-Italian Joint Venture in Rijeka </H5>   The Lumic firm in Rijeka, a Croatian-Italian joint venture,  was founded two years ago and has been producing men's clothing  for export with a value of DM1.5 million per month. The 20 April  SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported that the firm employs 400 workers  and is located in a leased warehouse in the duty-free zone of  the port of Rijeka. The firm has invested more than DM7 million  in its facilities and equipment. Lumic's director told SLOBODNA  DALMACIJA that the Italian partner, which is responsible for  selling the clothing, is satisfied with the quality and  favorable manufacturing cost of the firm's products and is ready  to make additional investments. According to the director,  planned expansion of the firm will cost DM25-30 million.</p>

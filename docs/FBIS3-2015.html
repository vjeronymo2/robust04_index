Wu Yi, the Chinese foreign trade minister, said in Beijing  yesterday that bilateral trade has improve since a flurry of  high-level visits between the two sides last year.    Her view was shared by Robert Urban, visiting Belgian  Minister for Foreign Trade and European Affairs who announced  that his country would increase credit this year to finance more  exports to and investment in China.    "The Belgian government has urged its financial institutions  to provide more support for trade with China," he said yesterday  at a trade conference between China, Belgiur and Luxembourg.    Wu urged Belgium to provide more loans to promote bilateral  trade.    From 1979 to 1993, Belgium provided China with more than  $100  million in loans to support projects in energy, pharmaceuticals,  textiles electronic and environmental protection.    Last year, Belgium's exports to China surged 71.4 percent to  reach $786 million, while two-way trade hit an all-time high of  $1.39 billion Wu said China's trade deficit was more than $100  million with Belgium.    She said she hoped steps would be taken to narrow the  deficit.    China sent purchasing delegations to Belgium in 1991 and  1992. helping to clinch import contracts worth $54 million.    A follow-up delegation in 1993 nailed down imports worth  $250  million.    In particular, China has increased imports of advanced  technology and equipment from Belgium.    Last year, the country signed four import agreements in the  sector valued at more than $30 million.    Meanwhile, China's trade with Luxembourg also increased,  hitting a record high of $36 million last year.    The surge was bolstered mainly by imports of steel products  from the tiny European nation.</p>

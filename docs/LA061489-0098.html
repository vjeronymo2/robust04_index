			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> GRAND JURY BACKS PLAN FOR NEW FORENSIC LAB  </P> <P> The Orange County Grand Jury has recommended that county officials consider a  proposal by a private company to build a seven-story building in Santa Ana to  permanently house the Sheriff's Department forensic science unit.  </P> <P> The forensic unit, which analyzes and tests evidence gathered at crime scenes,  now operates out of two separate buildings in the Civic Center, a costly and  inefficient arrangement, the grand jury said. To consolidate operations and  provide more space for the Sheriff's Department crime lab, the grand jury  recommended that the Board of Supervisors consider a plan by Hutton Development  Co. to build a new forensic facility on the southwest corner of Flower Street  and Santa Ana Boulevard.  </P> <P> The company has proposed building twin, seven-story buildings on the 3.4-acre  site, along with a 1,200-space parking garage. One of the towers could be built  to county specifications for the forensics unit. It would then be leased to the  county. Officials estimate that the cost of a new forensics lab would be about  $25 million. Earlier this year, county officials rated the Hutton proposal the  best among five plans to relocate and consolidate the crime lab at a single  site.  </P> <P> "There is a critical need for more space," said Jodeane Harrod, chairwoman of  the grand jury's criminal justice committee. "Without new and expanded  facilities, we increasingly run the risk of jeopardizing critical evidence  needed in criminal investigations."  </P> <P> The supervisors are expected to consider the Hutton proposal next month.  </P></p>

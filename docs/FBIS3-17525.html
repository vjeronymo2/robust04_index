In particular,  the allocation of plots of land until the end of this year's  harvest campaign so as to not create turmoil during the field  work. The request by the Defense Ministry to allocate them plots  of land for farming has also been refused. Those attending the  meeting found it reasonable if the military, instead of owing  allotments, would cooperate with farmers and farms in the  production of agricultural products.    The government's meeting, which was chaired by Abbas  Dzhumagulov, discussed all the suggestions of the commission on  elaborating a resolution on the urgent measures aimed at  carrying out the republican land reform in accordance with the  president's decree. The commission has elaborated a precise  document that will be used as a manual by the agricultural  sector of the economy. In particular, the Minselkhozprod (?the  ministry of agricultural products) can only address issues  connected with land reform, and it is also made responsible for  it. It will cooperate with ministries and departments. The  agricultural committees on the sites will contribute to this.    The document also specified tasks of educational,  cattle-breeding, and seed farms, as well as some other issues.  Special emphasis was paid to the role of the mass media in  covering the land reform and ways of implementing it. The  document is to be published in the press.</p>

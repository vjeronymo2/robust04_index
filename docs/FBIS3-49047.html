Ivan Baba, deputy foreign affairs state  secretary, said regarding his talks in the Czech Republic today  that the Visegrad countries did not form a joint position prior  to the meeting. Peter Nyaradi reports from Prague.    [Nyaradi] Today's meeting had more of a technical than  political nature, Ivan Baba, deputy state secretary for foreign  affairs, said in Prague. [passage omitted]    After meeting Clinton, the Hungarian delegation will  separate  into three parties and everybody will meet their Czech  counterpart; that is, Arpad Goncz will meet President Havel in  the castle, Peter Boross will meet Prime Minister Klaus in the  government residency, and Geza Jeszenszky will get together with  Czech Foreign Minister Zieleniec in the ministry. [passage  omitted]    In reply to a question from Hungarian Radio on whether there  is any chance for political coordination of any kind between the  leaders of the Visegrad four, and whether they were able to  agree about this today, Ivan Baba said the following:    [Begin Baba recording] No agreement was reached about  political coordination. We agreed that they will (?try) to  coordinate their positions on [words indistinct] channels about  individual questions, and we already know that there will be a  meeting of defense ministers in Warsaw on 7 January. This can  also be considered as some kind of coordination. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yantai, 14 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)-- DAZHONG  RIBAO [POPULAR DAILY] reported today that the hearing of a  copyright lawsuit in which Xiao Rong and the Central Party  Literature Publishing House sued the Fenglai City Printing House  was concluded a few days ago at the Yantai City Intermediate  People's Court.    After hearing the case from both sides, the court found that  plaintiff Xiao Rong owns the copyright for the book My  Father, Deng Xiaoping and plaintiff Central Party  Literature Publishing House possesses the book's sole publishing  rights and the right to its format and graphic design. The  court also found that their legal rights and interests should be  protected by the law. Defendant Fenglai Printing House was  found to have infringed on the copyright of the book in  publishing it on the strength of a forged certification document  provided by another person and ordered to pay part of the civil  damages in accordance with the provisions of the "PRC Copyright  Law."    Mediation at the court resulted in a reconciliation between  the plaintiffs and the defendant. The Fenglai Printing House  agreed to place an announcement in XINWEN CHUBAN BAO [NEWS  PUBLISHING POST] apologizing to the Central Party Literature  Publishing House and Xiao Rong. The announcement is to be made  within a month after the reconciliation letter reaches the  plaintiffs. The defendant will also pay the Central Party  Literature Publishing House 30,000 yuan in compensation for  profit losses and Xiao Rong 15,000 yuan for unpaid royalties.</p>

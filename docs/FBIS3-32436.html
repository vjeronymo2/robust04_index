Vallarino, who was confirmed during the PDC convention held  yesterday at the Cosita Buena Ballroom, said that "there is an  atmosphere that makes PDC members feel stronger than ever. I  assure you that if we are united, we will take the bull by the  horns and tie the bell on the cat," Vallarino stressed,  receiving applause from the large crowd that filled the popular  dance hall. According to Vallarino, today more than ever "the  green machinery" is starting to move with all its force.    A special PDC National Congress was held yesterday to  confirm  Eduardo Vallarino as its presidential candidate, replacing  Ricardo Arias Calderon, who declined the candidacy for health  reasons. Raul Ossa and Rene Orillac were confirmed as first and  second vice presidential candidates, respectively.    In a statement for the media, PDC Legislator Raul Ossa said  that the PDC has now emerged as an alternative for the  Panamanian people, as there is a large percentage of Panamanians  who are undecided about the candidate of their preference. PDC  Legislator Erick Fidel Santamaria said that although Arias  Calderon is not currently leading the party, the PDC is stronger  than ever today.    Eduardo Vallarino, former president of the National Council  of Private Enterprise (CONEP) stressed the need to work hard so  Panamanians "can smile again" and recover their confidence in  democratic institutions. "I must say, without any doubt, that we  have the necessary strength to win the May 1994 elections," he  added.    Vallarino noted how important it is at this time for  Panamanians to change the attitude of hopelessness and look  forward to a better future. "We have a pact, which is a firm  commitment with the people..." he stressed. According to  Vallarino, the Panamanian people cannot go on living amid  uncertainty and instability. He also urged Panamanians not to  forget the actions of the past dictatorship.</p>

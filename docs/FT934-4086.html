			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Management: Life in the old dog yet - TQM's latest followers Most consultants these days will tell you that Total Quality Management  - one of the most pervasive business tools of the 1980s - has been eclipsed by other 'big ideas'. If they are right, today's formal launch of the new British Quality Foundation - under the chairmanship Sir Denys Henderson of ICI - looks rather oddly timed. It begs the question why heavyweight industrialists such as Peter Bonfield of ICL, Michael Hepher of British Telecom, Michael Heron of the Post Office, and Ken Sanders of Texas Instruments have joined Sir Denys on the BQF's beefed up board. The answer is that TQM - the gospel of focusing the attention of everyone in an organisation on the customer - is proving unexpectedly durable. Take last week's TQM conference in Paris organised by Renault and its then would-be merger partner Volvo, which attracted more than 1,000 executives on top of a veritable army of delegates from the two car companies. TQM may not yet have taken root in Europe in the same way that it has in the US and Japan - but the message from the Paris gathering is that a large and probably growing number of European companies still senses that quality is a vital part of management's search for the Holy Grail. Among those there to reaffirm their faith on the same platform were Paul Allaire, chairman and chief executive of the US Xerox Corporation, Bernard Fournier, chief executive of Rank Xerox (in which the US parent has a 51 per cent stake), and Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman and chief executive of Fuji Xerox (a joint venture between Fuji Photo Film and Rank Xerox). These companies have been banging the quality drum for a decade now, but it was interesting to hear Allaire say that it took until 1989 for the TQM philosophy to percolate right through the ranks. The Xerox bosses spoke about the challenge of keeping TQM fresh - one reason perhaps why they took the unusual step of all attending the same bash; they also drew on the group's international 'reach' to demonstrate that TQM can be adapted to local conditions. Henderson, who admits he used to be a touch cynical about TQM, now confesses to being 'a complete convert'. He describes it as 'a way of making better products at a better price, ensuring that even the shopfloor worker is aware of the customer'. The BQF, which has been given pump priming money and strong moral support by Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, aims to promote a wider understanding of TQM. But its most ambitious project will be launching a new UK quality award scheme, closely based on the approach of the European Foundation for Quality Management which in turn was inspired by the famous US Baldrige award. 'National awards are seen as a means of digging down into the smaller business,' says Malcolm Franks, ICI's group commerical manager. He has been seconded to the BQF as its first chief executive.</p>

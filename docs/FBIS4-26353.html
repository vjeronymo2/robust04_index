			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech delivered by Qian Qichen at the Fifth National </F> Meeting of Representatives of Returned Overseas Chinese and  Relatives of Overseas Chinese in Beijing on 14 June 1994: "Qian  Qichen's Speech Made on Behalf of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council at the Fifth National Meeting of  Representatives of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of  Overseas Chinese on 14 June 1994]    [Text] Deputies and Comrades:    The Fifth National Meeting of Representatives of Returned  Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese opened  solemnly today. This is a significant meeting for the overseas  Chinese sector, and is also a great event which the returned  overseas Chinese, the relatives of overseas Chinese, and the  vast number of Chinese nationals residing abroad, numbering more  than 30 million, have universally followed with interest. The  convocation of this meeting is of vital significance to further  mobilizing the vast numbers of returned overseas Chinese and  their relatives to conscientiously implement the guidelines of  the 14th Party National Congress and the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee and accelerating the  development of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, I  should like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend our  warm congratulations to this meeting; our best wishes to the  vast number of returned overseas Chinese, the relatives of  Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese nationals residing abroad; our  cordial greetings to the assiduous workers of overseas Chinese  affairs; and our respects to the advanced collectives and  individuals in overseas Chinese work, who will be commended at  this meeting.    Returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of overseas  Chinese,  and the vast number of Chinese nationals residing abroad have  made tremendous contributions to China's revolution and  construction in various historical periods and have written an  epic and historic chapter on the prosperity of the motherland  and the progress and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. During  the new historical period, the vast number of returned overseas  Chinese and their relatives are active in the posts of various  trades and professions. With a lofty sense of mission and  responsibility, they have enthusiastically devoted themselves to  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization undertakings,  have made brilliant achievements in bringing about economic  development and social progress, and have played a positive role  in the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the  motherland. The vast number of Chinese nationals residing  abroad are the most enthusiastic supporters of China's open-door  policy, its effort to develop foreign trade and economic  cooperation, and its scientific, technological, and cultural  exchange activities. Advancing hand in hand with the local  people, they have performed substantial work for the prosperity  and progress of the countries where they are residing as well as  for the development of friendly ties between these countries and  China. They have demonstrated utterly sincere feelings for the  reform and construction of the motherland.    The period between now and the middle of next century will  be  a great historic period of national rejuvenation and the  realization of socialist modernization in China. In the 1990's,  we will strive to achieve the second-step objective of  quadrupling GNP ahead of schedule so that the people will be  able to lead a relatively comfortable life, and the socialist  market economic structure will be initially established. In  line with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the  Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, we will resume our  sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao as scheduled and will  maintain long-term stability and prosperity there. We will also  push forward the great cause of reunifying the motherland in  accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems."  For these purposes, we must fully mobilize the initiative of  the entire people, including the returned overseas Chinese, the  relatives of overseas Chinese, and Chinese nationals residing  abroad. They have the fine tradition of loving their motherland  and home towns, and boast the advantage of extensive  relationships with the people and rich information resources  abroad. Hence, they are a major force in the country's drive  for modernization and will certainly make greater contributions  to the magnificent cause of rejuvenating and reunifying the  motherland.    This is a crucial year for China's socialist modernization  process. "Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening  wider to the outside world, promoting development, and  maintaining stability" are the tasks on which the overall  interest of the entire party and country hinges. The Overseas  Chinese affairs work should be consciously subordinate to and  serve this overall interest. Closely centering around this  overall interest, we must seriously put into practice various  principles and policies on Overseas Chinese affairs work in the  new period, must extensively unite and mobilize the returned  overseas Chinese and their relatives to devote themselves to  reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, must  enthusiastically promote trade and economic cooperation as well  as scientific, technological, and cultural exchange between the  Overseas Chinese and the motherland, must maintain social  stability, and must give impetus to economic development and  comprehensive social progress. The vast number of overseas  Chinese affairs workers should do all they can to forge ahead  with one heart and one mind in a bid to initiate a new situation  for Overseas Chinese affairs work.    The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese is  a mass organization of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives  of Overseas Chinese throughout the country under the party  leadership, and is a bridge and link between them and the party  and government. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, the federations of returned Overseas Chinese  at various levels have exercised a significant role in reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive. The vast number of  cadres of these federations have worked diligently and have made  brilliant achievements. Under the new situation, they are faced  with even heavier tasks, and their position and role are even  more important. The federations at various levels should be  guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, should adhere to the party's basic  line, should perform their work with an emphasis on economic  construction, and should exercise their functions in a  comprehensive way. They should exploit their own advantages  and, through their effective work, further mobilize and unite  the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives across the  country to devote greater efforts to pushing forward the  undertakings of reform, opening up, and modernization in China.  It is necessary to fully exercise the role of the returned  Overseas Chinese and their relatives in participating in the  deliberation and administration of state affairs and in  democratic supervision. Their legitimate rights and interests  in the country should be protected in accordance with the law.  It is also necessary to fully exploit the advantages of the  federations of returned Overseas Chinese in conducting  nongovernmental exchange and increasing contact with foreign  countries. We should give enthusiastic assistance to the  returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of Overseas Chinese,  and Chinese nationals residing abroad in their efforts to run  cultural, educational, public health, and other social welfare  undertakings in the country. Besides, it is necessary to bring  into full play the role of the federations of returned Overseas  Chinese in the building of socialist spiritual civilization and  make further efforts to strengthen such building in their home  towns. Through intensified reform and building, we should train  a contingent of overseas affairs workers who have both ability  and political integrity and who will enthusiastically serve the  returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of Overseas Chinese,  and Chinese nationals residing abroad. The work of the  federations of returned Overseas Chinese should be geared to the  needs of the grass-roots units and should go deep into the  realities of life. They should earnestly propagate and explain  the party's principles and policies and the important measures  on reform and opening up to the returned Overseas Chinese and  their relatives, get acquainted with their aspirations, show  concern for their weal and woe, and convey their views and  demands to the party and government in good time. These  federations should be built into vigorous and energetic "homes  of returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives" which are  trusted by the broad masses.    Deputies and comrades, the party and government always pay  serious attention to the role of the returned Overseas Chinese,  the relatives of Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese nationals  residing abroad in revolution and construction, as well as to  the work of overseas affairs. Under the new situation, the  party and government at all levels should further intensify and  improve leadership over overseas affairs work, should give full  rein to the initiative of the federations, and should  enthusiastically show concern for and give support to their  work. I profoundly believe that, after the current meeting, a  brand new situation of unity and endeavor in overseas affairs  work will certainly emerge. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the leadership of the party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, let us firmly  seize the opportunity, do solid work, forge ahead, and make  great efforts to build China into a prosperous, democratic,  civilized, and modernized socialist country and to safeguard  world peace and development!    I wish the meeting complete success!</p>

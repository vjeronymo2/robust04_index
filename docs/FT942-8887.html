			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Austrian brick group posts strong advance Wienerberger Baustoff-industrie, Austria's largest building materials group and one of the two largest brick manufacturers in Europe, yesterday reported a strong rise in profits for last year. It raised its dividend to 37 per cent compared with 34 per cent in 1992. Group profits before tax were Sch938m (Dollars 80m) - up almost 50 per cent on the Sch626m achieved in 1992 - on sales of Sch12.1bn compared with Sch11.7bn in 1992. Mr Erhard Schaschl, chief executive, said pre-tax profits would continue to rise this year, to around Sch1.1bn. He suggested the group would probably further increase its dividend in 1994. Wienerberger is the largest producer of bricks in Austria, Germany and Hungary, and it has an important share of the market for pipes. Its main shareholder is Creditanstalt-Bankverein, Austria's second-largest bank, which has a 51.6 per cent stake. The remaining capital is dispersed among private shareholders. It is one of the most liquid shares on the Vienna stock exchange. Treibacher Chemische Werke, Wienerberger's troubled alloys subsidiary, made a pre-tax loss of Sch113m, down from Sch157m in 1992. Turnover declined from Sch3.3bn in 1992 to Sch2.96bn last year.</p>

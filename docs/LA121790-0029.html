			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: ROSS TO GET ANOTHER CHANCE WITH 39'S  NEW 4:30 SHOW  </P> <P> KNSD-TV(Channel 39) has hired former KFMB-TV(Channel 8) anchorwoman Allison  Ross to host a new 4:30 p.m. weekday news show expected to debut in March.  </P> <P> In addition, the station is negotiating with KSDO-AM (1130) talk show host  Roger Hedgecock, the former mayor of San Diego, to play a major role in the  program.  </P> <P> "I'm excited," Ross said Friday. "I'm glad to be given another opportunity in  San Diego."  </P> <P> The concept of a 4:30 p.m. news show makes sense for Channel 39, which has been  struggling to find an adequate lead-in for its 5 p.m. news. Arbitron ratings  released last week for the November sweeps period showed the syndicated program  "Personalities" earning a meager 1 rating and 3 share at 4:30 p.m. Channel 8 is  the only other local station with a news show at 4:30 p.m.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be a typical co-anchor format," Ross said.  </P> <P> Ross has not been inactive in television since she left Channel 8 in June,  1989. Through her 12 years at the station, she became one of the most popular  news readers in town. But she eventually fell into disfavor at the station and  her contract was not renewed.  </P> <P> Since leaving Channel 8, Ross attracted attention because she gave interviews  discussing her bouts with depression. Earlier this year, she gave birth to a  daughter.  </P> <P> "I never had a chance to say good-by, but now I have a chance to say hello,"  Ross said.  </P> <P> While Ross is looking forward to a new job, Channel 8 is still struggling to  find a winning combination in the post-Ross era.  </P> <P> Channel 8 anchorman Stan Miller has agreed to a new deal with the station, but  that doesn't mean his future is in San Diego.  </P> <P> "It's hard to work in an environment where you feel you've done your best for 4  1/2 years and then all of a sudden, without warning, they pull the rug out from  under you," Miller said in a phone interview last week.  </P> <P> Clearly looking for something to spark the news show out of a ratings rut,  management has decided to move Miller from the main 5 p.m. newscast to the 6:30  p.m. show. In turn, 6:30 p.m. anchor Hal Clement, who has been at Channel 8 for  8,000 years, will take over the 5 p.m. show.  </P> <P> One problem: Miller's contract, which would have expired in May, specifically  called for him to anchor the main 5 p.m. newscast. By deciding to make the move  now instead of waiting until May, management was forced to renegotiate with  Miller.  </P> <P> The new deal is for only one year and includes a provision that he can leave at  any time if he gets a job in one of the country's five largest television  markets. Miller said he is already exploring that option.  </P> <P> Although he said the station has told him that the move is not a demotion, he  took it as such. He said the station never warned him that management was  unhappy with his work until he walked in on Election Night to learn that  Clement was to take the lead role in that evening's telecasts.  </P> <P> "They've killed my morale," Miller said. "I'll continue to do the best I can,  but I took it as definite vote of no confidence."  </P> <P> Miller said he expects Clement to do a good job and wished him the best, but  made clear that he believes the station made a mistake.  </P> <P> "I think they're clutching at straws," Miller said. "Personally, I don't think  I was the problem."  </P> <P> At the same time, the future of Miller's 5 p.m. partner is also in doubt. For  several months, Channel 8 has been advertising for an anchor, reportedly to  replace Susan Roesgen, Ross's replacement, who is widely believed to be on her  way out.  </P> <P> Former KCBQ owner and general manager Simon T is back in his La Jolla home,  relaxing after his sudden departure from the general manager job at KQLZ  (Pirate Radio). For the first time, Simon publicly acknowledged that his  departure was the result of a difference of opinion with program director/star  morning guy Scott Shannon.  </P> <P> In an interview Thursday, Simon said he wanted to move the hard rock station  toward a more contemporary hits format, a move Shannon resisted.  </P> <P> "I always knew that if I ever had a difference of opinion with the program  director, if he and I ever got into it, I knew I would potentially be on the  short end of the stick," Simon said.  </P> <P> Simon said the parting was amicable. Although he has been entertaining offers,  he plans to take a year off.  </P> <P> "My biggest challenge now is to remember not to dial 9 on my phone," Simon  said.  </P> <P> Irv Kass has decided to accept the Channel 39 news director job, replacing his  longtime friend and mentor Don Shafer, who was forced to resign two weeks ago.  . . .  </P> <P> KSDO staff members are calling it "bloody Monday." Management is calling it a  "restructuring." No one was laid off, according to general manager Mike  Shields, but several staff members have either left the station or found their  jobs reorganized. "When we restructured, we gave people options," Shields said.  "It was up to them to take them or not. Everybody was given a place to work."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, KSDO is attempting to negotiate a new deal with Michael Reagan,  whose contract expires next month. . . .  </P> <P> Add to the annals of awkward television moments last Thursday night's exchange  between Channel 10 sports guy Larry Sacknoff and anchorwoman Kimberly Hunt.  Sacknoff led his sports segment with a reference to Charger Leslie O'Neal's  accusations that an unidentified teammate was getting unwarranted publicity.  Sacknoff pointed out that most people thought the unidentified player was Billy  Ray Smith, a.k.a. Mr. Kimberly Hunt. He continually turned to Hunt, trying to  provoke a reaction. She just stared at him. . . .  </P> <P> Del Mar-based Frontline Video is producing "Powder Magazine," a skiing program  which debuts on ESPN at 10:30 p.m., Thursday. It is a sister to Frontline's  "Surfer Magazine." . . .  </P> <P> Channel 39 gave the U.S. Marines $10,000 for its "Toys for Tots" program,  believed to be the largest single contribution ever made to the San Diego  program. The money was raised last month in a promotion that aired during  "Wheel of Fortune."  </P></p>

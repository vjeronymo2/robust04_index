			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Letter: Soft commissions provide a vital motive force in stockbroking reform Sir, I read with interest your editorial on soft commissions ('Soft on soft commissions', March 3). Since Big Bang, commissions have been fully negotiable and so are set at a level and a rate to meet the needs of the client. To ban soft commissions would mean that such negotiating cannot take place and so abandon one of the motivating forces behind stockbroking reform. Soft commissions could be abused if the ultimate client was not aware of their use. Under Securities and Investments Board rules, however, the disclosure requirements are such that the client would be fully aware of their fund manager's approach to soft and how much they used it. With consultants now fully aware of the benefits of soft, they should ensure that their clients are provided with full information. With these rules and commercial disciplines in place disclosure is no longer an issue. What you ignored is that some integrated houses' approach to soft commissions has led to a potential abuse of another cornerstone of Big Bang: best execution. That prompted SIB to question the integrated houses' ability to achieve best execution and so the entire review of the strengths of soft commissions and agency broking. By using an integrated house, fund managers are locked in and have little independent control over the price they can trade at. I believe that, without best execution, soft commissions should not survive and that the integrated houses approach has been a cynical attempt to use a weak definition of best execution to garner business. You also ignore that benefits have passed on to the ultimate client. In another Greenwich Associates survey, they showed that the average fund management fee in the US (where soft is used much more) was 0.38 per cent, while in the UK it is only 0.19 per cent. Soft commissions should be used to control costs and so assist the ultimate client. Finally, you ignore what should be the real questions raised by soft commissions. Why are agency brokers used, and how do the 87 per cent of commissions which are not soft benefit the ultimate client? Clive Sinclair-Poulton, 125 High Holborn, London WC1V 6QA</p>

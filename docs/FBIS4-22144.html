Cherkasov] </F>   [Text] Receiving information about enemy and friendly  troops is inconceivable without a clear-cut organization of use  of three basic means of transmitting and distributing data on  the battlefield -- courier service, landline channels, and radio  communications. The rapid development of communications  equipment technology, the increase in troop mobility, and the  increase in requirements for providing information on a  real-time basis brings radio communications to the forefront,  with main importance given to radio frequency service [RFS].  However, up to the present it has never been taken into  consideration when planning combat operations.    It was precisely such a situation that arose at the very  start of Operation Desert Shield, when the transfer of units and  subunits of the Multinational Forces [MNF] to the area of the  conflict began without a general frequency plan -- list of  frequencies, time of their operation, callsigns, and procedure  for changing them. The lack of a plan was not an obstacle to  using the radio spectrum, but command and control of weapon  systems and troops depends on strict radio discipline when the  density of radio equipment on the battlefield increases.    As a rule, the radio frequency spectrum is the property of  each government, but the government of Saudi Arabia transferred  the right of its use to the unified Central Command [CENTCOM] of  the U.S. Armed Forces. At the beginning of the transfer (August  1990), troops arrived in the areas of combat operations without  the appropriate equipment and capabilities for recording and  allocating the spectrum. Several months were needed to develop  procedures and deploy the necessary equipment to allocate  operating frequencies among the thousands of radio nets which  oversaturated the airways over the territories of Saudi Arabia,  Kuwait, and Iraq.    In the initial stage, specialists tried to use frequency  spectrum management methods worked out during peacetime. They  were based on the concept of centralized management: Each  frequency is assigned and registered by the center. In this  connection, permanent data bases were created which were  carefully updated and registered as frequencies were allocated.  However, it proved to be impossible to maintain the data base as  a result of the constant change of the organization and  establishment of the arriving troops and their relocations.    The concept of centralized management assumes that the  technical characteristics and geographic coordinates are known  for each radio and that, for all practical purposes, it is  stationary or moves very little. Based on this, a calculation is  made of the range of reception and direction of propagation of  the radio signal. Next, the static characteristics are  consolidated into a frequency plan, the purpose of which is  separation of the radio stations in space and by frequency in  order to avoid mutual interference. All this is accomplished  with the use of highly productive computer equipment.    Each branch of the armed forces whose subunits and units  arrived in the theater of war transferred its own radio  frequency service system. And not a single one was compatible  with another. Operational-level specialists had virtually no  experience working on the scale of such a large theater. As a  rule, they practiced their operations at small exercises (like  the Bright Star exercises conducted in Egypt). The number of  requests for use of frequencies literally swept over the  service. In the initial stage, work came down to accounting for  and registration of requests relayed to the Electromagnetic  Compatibility Analysis Center of the U.S. Department of Defense  (Annapolis, Maryland). But this process, intended for work with  stationary communications equipment, cannot in any way satisfy  the needs of hundreds of mobile bodies operating close to one  another. As a result, the tasks of allocating the frequency  spectrum were entrusted to the U.S. Air Force Radio Frequency  Service Center at Buzzard's Point, Washington, D.C.    Traditionally, the Air Force, which has a large amount of  radio equipment, gave preference to the concept of centralized  use of the radio frequency service. This was because their air  bases are stationary, and the pilots reluctantly agreed to a  multiple shift of frequencies and callsigns, which, in their  opinion, increased risk during combat operations. The Navy  command authorities took this position for roughly the same  reasons. However, the dynamics of development of the operation,  the changing scope of the battlefield, and the huge number of  radios used in the Army and Marines required a different  approach.    The problems with frequency spectrum allocation began  immediately after arrival of the first aircraft with subunits of  the XVIII Airborne Corps. The RFS section of CENTCOM  Headquarters, which numbered one person, received the first  request from the XVIII Airborne Corps on 7 August 1990. By 1  October it still had not been satisfied. Having encountered such  a situation, corps specialists were forced to choose frequencies  independently for communications. In the words of one operator,  life forced them to use unauthorized frequencies. "The command  is not disturbed about what frequency you are operating on," he  said. "The main thing is carrying out the combat mission.  Therefore, I had two frequency lists -- one authorized for use  by CENTCOM Headquarters and one chosen by us. We carefully use  both, and there were no complications. If the enemy would have  been clever, he could have taken advantage of this shortcoming."    During operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, each  branch  of the armed forces occupied those frequencies that were best  suited for carrying out the missions, totally ignoring the  requirements and state of affairs of their colleagues. Actually,  there was a total lack of coordination at all echelons -- from  the level of the CENTCOM commander to the tactical level.    CENTCOM Headquarters tried to solve this problem; however,  the strict centralized radio frequency service oriented on  peacetime was crushed by the flow of information. The data base  of the CENTCOM radio frequency service registered radio  equipment by its location, and frequency allocation accomplished  from the United States did not at all satisfy the demands  imposed by a joint operation of such a scale. Specialists of the  35th Signal Brigade, XVIII Airborne Corps, arbitrarily allocated  frequencies for microwave relay communications, since they did  not even have a personal computer for this. A situation  developed in which units and subunits of the coalition forces,  using the entire existing frequency band, created constant  interference for one another, which led to a considerable  deterioration of the operating parameters of nets and an  increase in work outages.    This situation could not exist very long. Temporary measures  were taken to correct the situation. CENTCOM Headquarters  allocated among subunits blocks of the frequency band within  which they themselves accomplished dispatcher functions. Main  attention was given to the UHF band (220-404 MHz), the most  saturated with stations and interference. It was in this band  that tactical-level communications (satellite and  "air-to-ground-to-air") are accomplished and data transmission  and other systems operate. Despite the urgency of resolving this  matter, it took nearly two weeks to coordinate between the  bodies of the branches of the armed forces. The greatest  difficulty arose when examining the 4.4-5.0 GHz band. Powerful  transmitters of troposcatter communications systems and  low-power SHF transmitters operated in this band.    The lack of a radio frequency service also had a negative  effect on waging "electronic warfare." The task of compiling a  combined list of forbidden frequencies (on which jamming is  forbidden) proved to be virtually impossible. As a result,  sometimes there were gaps in conducting electronic warfare  operations.    Analyzing the results of combat operations, specialists made  the following conclusions:    1. Radio frequency service operates at all levels of  command;  however, frequency management is accomplished in each instance  by the operator.    2. RFS should be decentralized and operate in each echelon  of  transferred troops. The more echelons transferred, the greater  the need for decentralization.    3. Officers of the service must possess sufficient skill to  understand the requirements of units of his echelon.    4. Up to 90 percent of the frequency allocations should be  completed prior to the transfer of troops to a theater of  military operations, and the remaining 10 percent should be  completed at the destination, but without additional  administrative procedures.    5. When using different types of equipment in one band in a  limited geographical area, the frequency band must be allocated  proportionally in accordance with requirements, for example, for  air-ground-air communications, tactical satellite  communications, microwave relay communications, and so forth.    6. Allocation of frequency resources must be coordinated  with  the priorities of the commander in chief for the theater of  military operations.    7. Management of the frequency spectrum must be accomplished  in an optimum manner and in such a way as to permit joint use of  frequencies.    8. In planning, it is advisable to proceed from an overall  plan of actions and predict needs that may arise during the  course of development of combat operations and when individual  operations become complicated.    9. For accurate calculation of the electromagnetic  compatibility and mutual interference, it is necessary to have  available precise data on the technical characteristics of  equipment and order of troop deployment.    Despite the fact that today the majority of transmissions in  the radio frequency spectrum that are used in the U.S. Armed  Forces are encoded, the enemy can still use electronic [ELINT]  and communications intelligence [COMINT] assets to determine  troop combat formations. The most effective instrument in this  struggle is the frequency plan. It serves two goals: It is used  as a reference and as a means of communications security. In the  latter case, enemy ELINT and COMINT assets are counted by  arbitrary assignment of callsigns, regular changing of them, and  also changing of operating frequencies.    In recent years, the importance of a frequency plan has  decreased a means of countering COMINT and ELINT. This is caused  by the considerable spread of secure telephone communications at  the tactical level and also radio equipment with a low  likelihood of intercept; for example, Singars radios with a  programmable operating frequency. Now the frequency plan is used  mainly as a reference aid. This was graphically confirmed during  the course of the operation by U.S. Armed Forces in Grenada.  Soon after its conclusion, the commanders in chief in the  theater of military operations set the task of creating a  unified frequency plan which would include all units and  subunits under their command.    The National Security Agency [NSA] compiled such a frequency  plan for the main command of U.S. Armed Forces in the Atlantic,  which was tested in a series of exercises conducted. However, at  the start of Operation Desert Shield, after arriving in the area  of the conflict, units and subunits subordinate to this command  discovered that their frequency plan was not very effective. It  turned out to be incompatible with frequency allocations of  other commands of the U.S. Armed Forces and the coalition  troops, and also with the requirements of the country they were  in. They had to create a new frequency plan for operations  Desert Shield and Desert Storm. More than 10 variants were  developed, taking up about 500,000 pages of text. These  classified reference books were delivered on military transport  aircraft to Saudi Arabia, where they were distributed directly  among users.    Initially, a question arose as to what kind of a structure  the frequency plan should have -- composite to the platoon level  or just for the higher echelon (with tactical subunits  authorized to develop their own plans). The first viewpoint was  adopted, because practically all units subordinate to the  commander in chief of U.S. Armed Forces in the Atlantic prepared  their own plans with corresponding data bases, and in the event  the other solution was adopted, it would have taken considerable  time to revise them. In addition, the question of allocating  frequencies for the CENTCOM remained unclear. Thus, the  composite plan was the only acceptable alternative to quickly  solve the problem.    Development of the plan was accomplished when the pace of  transferring troops to the zone began to build up. On arrival,  many units and subunits used the most diverse frequency plans --  peacetime for operating at their permanent dispositions and  wartime for transfer to the European zone. (Before the war, a  frequency plan intended for use by the U.S. Army in the FRG and  certain other NATO countries was the only one formally developed  in the Persian Gulf zone).    The structure of the frequency plan is quite sensitive to  changes in the effective troop strength. Replacements and  decisions made at the last minute about leaving individual  subunits forced them to make a radical revision of the variant  already prepared, and to republish it.    Traditionally, frequency plans were compiled on paper in the  form of pamphlets, which are then disseminated to the units.  However, in the past decade, a question was raised about the  creation of electronic equipment for developing and  disseminating them directly in the localities independently of  central bodies. The main advantage of such a method is its  flexibility: The commander of an operational echelon changes the  structure of his forces himself and updates the frequency plan  in accordance with it. One year before the start of the Persian  Gulf conflict, a special commission of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of  Staff was created to study this matter. After conclusion of  combat operations and an analysis conducted by the commission,  it was concluded that before switching to electronic means, it  is necessary to have for each commander-in-chief and forces  subordinate to him a plan drawn up on paper for operations in an  emergency situation. It must ensure deployment of troops within  three days and their subsequent operations for three months.  Only later is it planned to compile a frequency plan using  special electronic equipment. According to the decision of the  JCS commission, this may be equipment based on a regular  personal computer developed by the U.S. Army under the special  program "An Electronic System for Compiling a Frequency Plan on  the Battlefield." Dissemination of frequency plans among  consumers will be accomplished using NSA data transmission and  dissemination networks or magnetic disks.

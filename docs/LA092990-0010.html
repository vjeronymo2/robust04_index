"Our culture is so rich in Southern California. We live with people from  everywhere."  </P> <P> Gabriels said she developed the idea for her class after meeting women of other  cultures. The city of Ventura is co-sponsoring the event and will receive half  the proceeds.  </P> <P> "We need to just learn about each other, and this is my way of doing it,"  Gabriels said.  </P> <P> Most of the classes will be from 7 to 10 p.m. Thursdays at 7050 E. Ralston St.  until Nov. 8. One will be 7 to 10 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 2. The fee is $40.  </P> <P> Classes include:  </P> <P> Thursday -- A Chumash Indian woman will share the history of her tribe, her  language and songs.  </P> <P> Oct. 11 -- A woman of Mexican descent will share a Death Day celebration to  honor ancestors.  </P> <P> Oct. 18 -- A professor at Ventura College who traveled to Africa will speak  about her ancestors and share African dancing and costumes.  </P> <P> Oct. 25 -- An Indian woman will demonstrate traditional hand painting.  </P> <P> Nov. 2 -- Women will share a Shabbat meal, a Hebrew tradition, through song,  food and candle lighting.

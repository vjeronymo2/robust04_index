Some 18,212,581,705 pesos of that total will reportedly come  from the general fund, while another 1,834,225,785 pesos will be  provided by special funds and 3,130,643,850 from outside  resources.    Some 12,156.9 million pesos, 52 percent of the general  total,  will be used for regular expenses, while 11,020.5 million, or 48  percent, will go for capital charges.    Acting Budget Director Jose Eligio Jaquez explained that the  12,156.9 million pesos earmarked for regular spending include  the Central Government's operating expenditures, amounting to  7,966.3 million, and interest on the foreign debt, totaling  1,623.8 million.    The official said the budget was drafted in accordance with  President Balaguer's instructions that it be realistic.    "In addition," he said, "we must pay special attention to  our  routine contributions to public and private institutions,  amounting to 2,043.7 million pesos."    The institutions receiving the bulk of the allocations are  the Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE), with 360 million,  the municipalities, with 406.7 million, civilian and military  pensions, totaling 274.8 million, and the liquified petroleum  gas subsidy, amounting to 360.5 million.    Of the 11,020.5 million pesos earmarked for capital charges,  2,799.4 million will reportedly go for agricultural construction  and plantations, 1,511.6 million for the purchase of machinery  and equipment, and 2,007.1 million for amortization of the  domestic and foreign debt. Capital contributions to public  institutions and enterprises will amount to 4,444.7 million  pesos.    The CDE will receive 1,418.9 million of the latter total,  while funding for the National Institute of Drinking Water and  Sewage (INAPA) will total 489 million. The Santo Domingo  Waterworks and Sewage Corporation (CAAN) will receive 530.1  million, and the National Institute of Water Resources will have  1,418.7 million.

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 28 April carries in its  regular 10-minute newscast three reports on the current  situation on the fronts in the republic.    The Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "last  night, at 1800 the chetniks launched a fierce tank and infantry  attack on the region of Boderiste which lasted until 2200. The  destructive tank and artillery fire was supported by fierce  antiaircraft guns and small arms' fire. Our reconnaissance  units' reports abound with information on the influx of fresh  Serbian reinforcements on the Brcko front. The chetniks are  placing artillery in almost all strongholds around the free  Brcko territory, while the enemy manpower is concentrating in  front of the positions of the 100th Motorized and 100th Infantry  Brigades in the areas of Vranovaca and Boderiste. At the same  time, the chetniks are reinforcing their positions around  Djukici and Boderiste with armored-mechanized hardware. Such  elaborate preparations for the continuation of the chetnik  offensive, whose first phase lasted a full 14 days, imply that  the future chetnik attacks on the free Brcko territory will be  fierce. However, it seems that not all Serbs in Brcko are ready  to continue the war against their former fellow citizens of  Muslim and Croatian nationality. Namely, this morning, at  around 0800, the Serbian Consultative Council clearly and  decisively rejected the criminal policy of the Serbian  Democratic Party."    Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation in the Bihac area  and says that "the joint attacks of Karadzic's fascists and  Abdic's rebel paramilitary forces continued overnight and this  morning on the free part of the Bihac commune. Indiscriminately  and at various times, the chetniks targeted the defense  positions on the Buzim, Bosanska Krupa, and [name indistinct]  part of the front. They continued using antiaircraft weaponry  on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau [words indistinct]. There is  no peace on demarcation lines with Abdic's paramilitary forces.  Provocations are registered continuously along all the defense  lines."    Correspondent Izudin Durakovic reports from Gracanica and  says that "in the early morning hours, the chetniks began their  attacks on the defense lines in the theater of operations of the  109th Doboj and 111th Gracanica Brigades. Using weapons of all  calibers from the well-known chetnik strongholds -- Sjenina,  Paleznica, Skipovac, Rajcevac, and Kostajnica -- the chetniks  fired the greatest number of shells at Obric, Vukovac, and  (?Banjik). This shelling is just preparation for the [words  indistinct] enemy infantry attacks [words indistinct]. Since  the enemy is not choosing his targets and shells are landing on  the town of Gracanica, a general alarm has been in effect since  0800 this morning. All the attacks over the past few weeks  imply that the chetniks have drawn up new borders and that this  explains the relentless attacks on the Doboj-Klokotnica,  Sjenina-Obric, and (?Tanjik)-Hukovac routes."</p>

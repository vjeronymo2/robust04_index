The 27 cooperatives and companies set up a coordinating  office for the new group in the maritime safety agency's office  in Wakkanai on the northern tip of Hokkaido.    The consultative body will consider safety measures with  regard to all foreign ships visiting Wakkanai port, but focusing  on Russian ships. Many of them lack shipowners' liability  insurance to pay for damages and rescue costs.    The group will also distribute Russian language pamphlets,  noting sites near the port where water is shallow and containing  information as to where repair work can be carried out.    It will also coordinate the quick provision of rescue  equipment when called for.    Visits by Russian ships have rapidly increased in parallel  with growing contacts between Japanese in Hokkaido, the  northernmost of Japan's four main islands, and Russians on  Sakhalin island, which is directly north.    Last year, 1,323 foreign ships made port calls at Wakkanai,  surpassing for the first time the number of such ships visiting  Otaru, a major Hokkaido port. Some 97 percent of the foreign  ships visiting Wakkanai were Russian.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 18 TASS -- President Yeltsin visited  today a special crack police division of the Interior Ministry  troops (the former Dzerzhinskiy Division).    On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the creation of  the division, the commander-in-chief viewed the parade of the  division's personnel and the performance of the special task  force. The president was invited to have lunch at the soldiers'  canteen and had a conversation with servicemen.    He was accompanied by Interior Minister Viktor Yerin and  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.    The history of the division is inseparably connected with  the  history of Russia and Moscow, its capital. Several generations  of officers and men, serving in the division, fulfilled their  duty with dignity. Nineteen of them were awarded the titles of  the hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation,  thousands were awarded orders and medals.    Yeltsin sent today a congratulatory message to soldiers,  sergeants, non-commissioned officers, officers and veterans of  the division.    "By successfully carrying out your tasks, especially during  the troublesome recent years, you contributed a great deal to  the preservation of civil peace in the country. I am confident  that you will continue to ensure public security, acting jointly  with other branches of the Interior Ministry, in the interests  of the consolidation of the Russian state," the message said.</p>

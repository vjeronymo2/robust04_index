Speaking at the international seminar on the process of  development in Central Asia and Caucasus, Va'ezi also said the  Islamic Republic was closely monitoring political, social and  economic developments in Central Asian and Caucasian republics.    It is the duty of all countries to contribute to the  reconstruction of Central Asian countries, the deputy foreign  minister said.    According to Va'ezi, ethnic disputes, civil war and  conflicts  with other countries constitute a major impediment to the  economic development of Central Asian and Caucasian republics.    In order to enable those countries to export their gas and  oil, the Islamic Republic has allowed them to use Iranian ports  along the Persian Gulf, he said, adding that "this is very  important and decisive."    He said the republics of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and  Azerbaijan can transport their oil and gas to other countries  via Iran.    The volume of trade between Iran and those countries have  reached 300 million dollars, Va'ezi said, adding "this is good  for the beginning."</p>

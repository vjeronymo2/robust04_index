			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: French insurers' man of influence builds a network - UAP chairman Jean Peyrelevade WHEN leading figures in French finance were asked to name the most influential figure in their field, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the biggest of the big French insurers, was top of the list. Mr Peyrelevade says he is unimpressed. 'It's of no interest to me at all,' he said, puffing contentedly on one of his favourite Havana cigars in his opulent office. However, as he is well aware, influence is important in the incestuous world of French commerce. Mr Peyrelevade owes his post at UAP to his standing with the ruling socialists; he was a senior aide to Mr Pierre Mauroy when the latter was prime minister. Mr Peyrelevade is making the most of his political connections as UAP - and the other two state-controlled insurers, Groupes des Assurances Nationales (GAN) and Assurances Generales de France (AGF) - prepare for partial privatisation possibly early next year. Partial privatisation, where the French government will sell minority stakes in the insurers, reducing its own holdings to as low as 51 per cent, comes at a sensitive time in the industry. The French insurers have just announced lack-lustre results for 1991, when they were hit by the economic slowdown and the problems of the Paris property market, where they are significant investors. UAP itself saw net profits slide by 11 per cent, from FFr4.22bn to FFr3.77bn (Dollars 690m), on turnover of FFr155.3bn. 'We are operating in a very competitive market, and in some sectors there is too much pressure on prices,' said Mr Peyrelevade. 'Contrary to what a lot of people say, I don't believe that things will be better in 1992.' The medium-term outlook, he believes, is brighter, particularly in life insurance, which ought to benefit from the forthcoming expansion of France's private pension system. In other sectors, he said, companies like UAP may have to 'risk losing market share in order to protect profitability by bringing prices up to reasonable levels again'. In the meantime UAP, like the other French insurers, is concentrating on augmenting its European network. It is already established as Europe's second largest insurance group - after Allianz of Germany - with significant interests in the UK, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Greece and the Netherlands. 'Our European coverage is satisfactory now with one or two exceptions,' said Mr Peyrelevade. One exception that he 'eventually' plans to address is the UK, where UAP hopes to diversify into non-life insurance. However, the immediate priority is Germany, the largest European insurance market, where UAP's presence is negligible. Mr Peyrelevade sees Colonia, the German insurer controlled by Victoire, a French insurance group, as UAP's key to the German market. UAP owns 34 per cent of Victoire which is, in turn, controlled by the Suez group, of which Mr Peyrelevade was once chairman. Mr Peyrelevade has, for months, been negotiating to swap part of UAP's Victoire shares for a stake in Colonia. So far Suez has held out. Some analysts suspect it is making the most of its negotiating power to try and strike a hard bargain. 'UAP is desperate to get into Germany and all it has to bargain with is a minority stake in Victoire,' said one analyst. 'UAP is over a barrel and Suez knows it.' The backdrop to the negotiations with Suez - which Mr Peyrelevade will not comment on - is the dialogue with the tial privatisation. Mr Peyrelevade says it is up to the government to decide the terms of the forthcoming share sales. It has to decide the amount of equity involved and whether the companies themselves will be able to raise capital. Behind the scenes, however, he, and the heads of the other large insurers, have been eager to express their opinions. Mr Peyrelevade sees partial privatisation as the next logical step in the development of the French public sector. Although he is committed to the concept of state investment in industry, as an advocate of a mixed economy he sees the state's role as lending stability as a 'long-term investor'. In its turn, he says, state-controlled companies, such as UAP, should lend stability to the private sector companies in which they have invested. Despite his support for state ownership, Mr Peyrelevade has argued for changes in the relationship between the government and the companies it controls. He believes the state's shareholding should be reduced. The 51 per cent minimum permitted under the new partial privatisation rules will 'do for the next few years', he says. In the longer term, however, he envisages the state reducing its investment until it becomes 'an ordinary minority shareholder'. By then, he argues, the other vestiges of state control - notably its right to appoint the heads of companies, like himself - should have disappeared. 'The same people would probably end up in charge,' he said, with the confidence of a man convinced he would have risen to the top whatever the system. 'But at least other shareholders would have their say.' In the meantime, the critical question for UAP and the other French insurers is whether they will be able to raise capital for themselves in the forthcoming share sales. Even as ardent a mixed economist as Mr Peyrelevade identifies the inability to raise capital - because of the constraints of state ownership - as a disadvantage for public sector companies such as UAP. He also recognises that it may have deterred some potential partners, if they were unwilling to work with a state-controlled concern. UAP is, for instance, locked out of the US market, where publicly-owned companies are not allowed to invest in local insurers. So far, Mr Peyrelevade claims, it has not been a large problem. 'After all, we have become Europe's second largest insurer by expanding from our own resources,' he said. 'But in the long term, unless we can raise external capital, we could suffer in comparison with our international competitors like Allianz.'</p>

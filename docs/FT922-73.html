			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Small businesses attack Tec policy SMALL businesses are poorly represented on the boards of Training and Enterprise Councils, according to a survey by the Federation of Small Businesses. Only nine of the Tecs that responded to the survey had a good spread of board members from the small-business sector while 37 had inadequate representation, the survey showed. Sixty-three of the 82 English and Welsh Tecs took part in the survey. With 97 per cent of all businesses employing fewer than 20 people, a strong case could be made for most of Tec board seats intended for employers to go to small businesses, the federation said. Ms Ro Pengelly, head of the federation's employment affairs, said: 'Adequate representation seems to be the exception rather than the rule. The survey revealed an unsympathetic attitude by many Tecs towards the small business sector.' Even when Tecs had small-business representatives, they often came from local enterprise agencies or the economic development units of local councils. They were business advisers rather than owner-managers of small businesses. The federation said Tecs often appeared confused about what a small business was. Most defined a small business as one employing fewer than 100 people, although the federation regarded that as a medium-sized business. Small businesses should be represented at the highest level on the Tecs and not just in advisory groups or policy forums, the federation said. The government guidelines say that local-business leaders on Tec boards should be selected for their individual qualities and not just as representatives of existing organisations. They also require boards to reflect an area's range of industry and commerce. Letters, Page 17</p>

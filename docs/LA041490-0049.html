			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS PALMDALE COUNCIL;  </P> <P> FINAL TALLY CONFIRMS VICTORIES OF 2 CHALLENGERS  </P> <P> The margin of victory narrowed Friday, but the result remained the same in the  Palmdale City Council election, as a final vote count confirmed victories by  two challengers who favor controlled growth over two pro-development  incumbents.  </P> <P> In semiofficial returns from Tuesday's election, challenger James Root held a  slim 26-vote lead over first-term incumbent Tom Smith, with 137 of the 4,153  ballots uncounted. When those ballots were tallied Friday, Root's lead slipped  to 15 votes, but that was more than enough.  </P> <P> "It's been a tough three days and a sleepless three nights," said Root, 37, a  high school teacher and homeowners group leader. "I feel a lot of relief right  now. It's been tense, and the tension had built up hour by hour, and day by  day."  </P> <P> Smith was unavailable for comment Friday but had said earlier that he would not  ask for a recount if Root had at least a 10-vote lead.  </P> <P> Root's victory means the Palmdale City Council, which had five pro-development  lawmakers, now will be split 3-to-2. Root ran a joint campaign, calling for  more controls on growth, with city Planning Commissioner James Ledford, the top  vote-getter in the 10-candidate race.  </P> <P> The final tally had been closely watched by supporters and foes of development  in Palmdale. Although they will be a minority on the council, Ledford and Root  together are expected to have some say in controlling development.  </P> <P> In the final tally, Ledford got 1,621 votes (20.7%), and Root got 1,500 votes  (19.2%), each winning four-year terms. Smith trailed with 1,485 votes (19%),  followed by Daniel Becker, the other losing incumbent, with 1,204 votes  (15.4%). None of the other candidates got more than 10%.  </P> <P> The new tally made no change in the outcome of the other two contests on the  Palmdale ballot. Mayor William (Pete) Knight got 60.8% of the vote to beat two  opponents and win a new two-year term. And a ballot measure to give the mayor a  four-year term starting in 1992 was defeated, 64.6% to 35.4%.  </P></p>

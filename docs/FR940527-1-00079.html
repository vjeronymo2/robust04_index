			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We reiterate that, to qualify for rural referral center  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1994, an osteopathic hospital's number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharges for its cost reporting period that began during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1993 would have to be at least 3,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Retention of Referral Center Status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 412.96(f) states that each hospital receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the referral center adjustment is reviewed every 3 years to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine if the hospital continues to meet the criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referral center status. To retain status as a referral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> center, a hospital must meet the criteria for classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a referral center specified in &sect;412.96 (b)(1) or (b)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or (c) for 2 of the last 3 years, or for the current year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A hospital may meet any one of the three sets of criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for individual years during the 3-year period or the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. For example, a hospital may meet the two mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in &sect;412.96(c)(1) (case-mix index) and (c)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (number of discharges) and the optional criterion in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(3) (medical staff) during the first year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the second or third year, the hospital may meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria under &sect;412.96(b)(1) (rural location and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate bed size).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A hospital must meet all of the criteria within any one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these three sections of the regulations in order to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the retention requirement for a given year. That is, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will have to meet all of the criteria of &sect;412.96(b)(1) or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;412.96(b)(2) or &sect;412.96(c). For example, if a hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the case-mix index standards in &sect;412.96(c)(1) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years 1 and 3 and the number of discharge standards in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;412.96(c)(2) in years 2 and 3, it will not meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retention criteria. All of the standards would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met in the same year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement for triennial review was originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added to the regulations in 1984, to be effective for cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1987 (the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the first 3 years of the referral center adjustment).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, three statutory moratoriums on the performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the triennial reviews were enacted by Congress. The third  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these moratoriums expires at the end of cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods that began during FY 1994. (See the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46310) for a detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explanation of the moratorium and the implementation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triennial reviews.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the expiration of the current moratorium, we will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begin reviewing each rural referral center's compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the triennial review criteria effective with cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods beginning on and after October 1, 1994. As noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, although rural referral centers will no longer be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid a higher standardized amount than other rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals, hospitals approved as rural referral centers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be entitled to higher disproportionate share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments and continue to receive preferential consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we believe it is important that only those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals that meet the rural referral center triennial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review criteria continue to be so classified. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective with cost reporting periods beginning on and after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1994, a hospital that has been classified as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referral center for at least 3 years will be subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triennial review criteria as discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with &sect;412.96(f)(2), the review process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is limited to the hospital's compliance during the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3 years. Thus, if a hospital meets the criteria in effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for at least 2 of the last 3 years or if it meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria in effect for the current year (that is, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria for FY 1995 outlined above in this section of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble), it will retain its status for another 3 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No hospital is subject to a review until the end of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third full cost reporting period as a referral center. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have constructed the following chart and example to aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals that qualify as referral centers under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria in &sect;412.96(c) in projecting whether they will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain their status as a referral center.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;412.96(f), to qualify for a 3-year extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective with cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1995,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hospital must meet the criteria in &sect;412.96(c) for FY 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or it must meet the criteria for 2 of the last 3 years as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,tp0,i1,xs25,xs25,xs25,r60 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1For the cost reporting period beginning during FY <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Use hospital's case-mix index for FY <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Use the discharges for the hospital's cost reporting period beginning during FY <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Use numerical standards as published in the Federal Register on <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 1994  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1992  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1992  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> September 1, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1991  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1991  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> September 1, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1990  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1990  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> August 30, 1991. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

This was seen in answers to Caracol's "Topic of the Day"  question: 33.8 percent of those surveyed said it violates  national sovereignty; 23.4 percent said Colombia has people to  build a school or a health center, which are the projects the  soldiers will work on; 18 percent felt the U.S. military  presence is an indication that these soldiers might invade the  country; 14.3 percent felt the goal is to install radar  stations; and 10.4 percent stated the government must fully  explain the U.S. military presence in the country.</p>

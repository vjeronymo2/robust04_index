			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Tax credit helps JCI hold earnings for year EXTERNAL factors in the form of favourable tax changes and a one-off dividend helped Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, the mining house, to record largely unchanged earnings in the year to June. The dividend was maintained at 132 cents per share on attributable earnings of 293 cents per share, against 298 cents last time. Equity accounted earnings rose slightly to 394 cents from 388 cents. Mr Pat Retief, chairman, reported that at the trading level the group had experienced another difficult year. Pre-tax profit fell by 10 per cent to R415.7m (Dollars 123m) from R463.8m. A R21m tax credit, however, boosted attributable earnings which, at R433.2m, were only marginally lower than 1992's R439.4m. Earnings also included a liquidation dividend from DAB Investments of about R22m. Equity accounted earnings rose to R582.4m from R571.9m, largely as a result of a R26m benefit from an adjustment to deferred tax provisions. For the second year in succession the portion of JCI's earnings derived from mining fell - to 36.4 per cent, or R212.1m, of the total from 42.4 per cent, or R242.8m. The group again earned more from its industrial and property interests which are mostly unmanaged. They contributed 39.7 per cent of earnings, or R231.7m against R259.3m last time. Most of the balance of income was in the form of fee income. Mr Retief said the contribution from platinum - JCI controls Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest producer - had fallen for the third year in succession. It contributed R85.4m, or 14.7 per cent of earnings. The gold division did well to more than double its contribution, while income from diamonds, mostly trading interests, rose. Mr Retief said coal, in which the group has invested more than R500m in recent years, continued to be a 'major disappointment'. On the industrial side, CMI, the ferrochrome producer, was hardest hit by recessionary conditions and made a substantial loss. Motor group Toyota also had a difficult year. Best performances came from publishing group Argus, South African Breweries, and the Premier Group in particular, where earnings rose by 16 per cent.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Construction Contracts: Bracknell shopping project Bracknell Forest Borough Council has selected HIGGS &amp; HILL as its new development partner for the Pounds 50m redevelopment of the Easthampstead retail site in the heart of Bracknell town centre. The proposed retail development will provide around 200,000 sq ft of additional shopping and 400 covered car parking spaces with direct access off the Ring. The development will comprise two anchor users, either department or variety stores, as well as 30 smaller shop units. The scheme will link the High Street and Broadway to complete the development of the town centre, giving great visual impact from the ring road. The area is currently occupied by a magistrates' court, police station, post office, library and borough council offices. All will be relocated into new accommodation for which most sites have already been identified.</p>

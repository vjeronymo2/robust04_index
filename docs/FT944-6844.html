			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / This Week: Sport CRICKET: Australia v England, November 25-29, 1st Test, Brisbane. Australia's curious decision not to enforced the follow-on, after skittling England out for a paltry 167, means that the 1st Test - and England's agony  -spills into this week. Spinner Phil Tufnell rediscovered the art of serious wicket-taking on the third day, but it looks like being a long, hard winter for England supporters. GOLF: Sun City Million Dollar Challenge, December 1-4, Sun City, Bophuthatswana. The course, designed by Gary Player, is spectacular and the prize money staggering. Twelve of the world's top golfers compete for Dollars 1m. On his home ground, US Open winner Ernie Els will be favourite with local fans and the bookies. CHESS: World Olympiad, December 1-13, Moscow. The battle between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov over who runs Russian chess means their side is likely to be missing Karpov's talents on Thursday, when the 120-nation biennial contest starts. Private banker Duncan Lawrie sponsors a Nigel Short-lead England team, which hopes to improve on the three silver medals and the bronze England have won in the past decade.</p>

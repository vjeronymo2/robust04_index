			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 236 VEHICLES IMPOUNDED IN POLICE SWEEP  </P> <P> Los Angeles police and Department of Transportation officers on Saturday  impounded 236 vehicles in an eight-hour sweep aimed at cutting the high number  of hit-and-run accidents in the San Fernando Valley, authorities said.  </P> <P> Officers impounded cars whose drivers had suspended or revoked licenses or  whose vehicle registrations expired more than one year ago, Sgt. Dennis Zine  said.  </P> <P> Such drivers account for the majority of hit-and-run crashes because they flee  accidents to avoid penalties for illegally operating their vehicles, Zine said.  </P> <P> Zine said of the 236 impounded vehicles, 189 were being driven by uninsured  motorists.  </P> <P> A total of 287 citations were issued, he said.  </P> <P> Zine said 38 police officers and 12 transportation department officers  participated in Saturday's operation, which he called the most successful of  its kind in the Valley.  </P> <P> It targeted the Van Nuys, North Hollywood and northeast Valley areas, he said.  </P> <P> In March, 101 vehicles were impounded in a similar operation conducted by 11  police officers, Zine said.  </P></p>

Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should  resolutely implement the arrangements of the party Central  committee and the State Council and adopt realistic and  effective measures to fulfill the three tasks of the  anticorruption struggle to be accomplished in the near future.  We must win notable results by the end of this year and never  do a superficial job so as to win the trust of the people.    Liu Fengyan, standing committee member of the municipal  party  committee and secretary of the municipal discipline inspection  commission, gave a report at the working meeting. He said: The  municipal party committee and government have adopted a firm  attitude and carried out down-to-earth work to implement the  arrangements of the party Central Committee, the State Council,  and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission for the  anticorruption struggle. Notable results have been won in some  aspects. Tianjin started early and carried out solid work to  check "wanton levies." It has by and large canceled the items of  wanton levies according to the explicit order of the State  Council. The municipal government publicized on two occasions  195 items of wanton levies to be canceled, and a fairly good job  has been done in this regard. After self-inspections, all  districts, counties, and bureaus have also canceled more than  300 items of wanton levies. The unhealthy trends of private  travels abroad (beyond the border) with public expenses has been  checked. Leading cadres of party and government organs  conducted earnest self-inspection and self-correction in line  with the five regulations on honesty and self-discipline. With  municipal-level leading bodies taking the lead, leading bodies  of departments, committees, offices, districts, counties, and  bureaus as well as the units at the county or section level have  held democratic meetings, where cadres who violated regulations  took the initiative in reporting their problems to the  organizations and corrected most of them, and where results of  the self-inspection and self-correction activities were made  public to cadres. The work to investigate and handle major and  serious cases is being carried out in depth, and a number of  criminal elements have been punished according to law. The  municipal discipline inspection commission recently also  organized inspection promotion groups and sent them to more than  40 units to inspect how major work is carried out, thus  developing in depth the anticorruption struggle.    Gao Dezhan pointed out in his speech: Tianjin's previous  anticorruption struggle has developed in a healthy manner, and  fairly good results have been achieved. However, development  has been uneven. As the year is drawing to an end, we should  pay more attention to and do a better job in the anticorruption  struggle in line with the arrangements of the party Central  Committee and the State Council and make sure that notable  results are achieved by the end of this year.    Gao Dezhan put forward five demands on the in-depth  anticorruption struggle:    First, we should further improve our understanding. Leading  cadres at all levels should further intensify the study of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of important theories on  correcting party style, intensifying efforts to build a clean  government, and opposing corruption, conscientiously implement  the guidelines of the important speeches of Comrades Jiang Zemin  and Li Peng on the anticorruption struggle, surmount various  obstacles, actively adhere to the principle of "attending to two  tasks simultaneously and achieving competence in both," adopt a  firm attitude to make the anticorruption struggle successful,  and never do a superficial job and lose the trust of the people.    Second, we must fulfill all the three tasks of the  anticorruption struggle to be accomplished in the near future in  line with central arrangements. All departments, committees,  offices, districts, counties, and bureaus should conduct an  inspection on their previous anticorruption struggle to find out  their problems and where they lag behind. After this, they  should give prominence to work priorities, pay close attention  to weak links, and solve problems one by one to achieve good  results. Leading cadres who did a poor job in self-inspection  and self- correction should step up efforts to take remedial  measures and never be vague on this matter. The honesty,  self-discipline, self-inspection, and self-correction of leading  bodies and leading cadres should be made public for the  supervision of the masses during the year-end democratic  appraisal of performance. Mistakes found during the inspection  should be corrected and dealt with according to regulations and  never recur. We should pool efforts to step up investigation  and handling of major and serious cases and conclude them more  rapidly. Regarding the endeavor to check wanton levies and  unhealthy trends in some trades, we should consolidate the  achievements already won and adopt measures to make it still  better. We must never slacken efforts in it.    Third, we should conscientiously implement the guidelines of  the "circular on strictly banning waste and extravagance like  using public funds to hold parties and buy gifts during the 1994  New Year and Spring Festival period" issued by the general  offices of the party Central Committee and the State Council and  establish a new style of honesty. The municipality has also  issued a document on this. Leading cadres at all levels should  maintain honesty and self-discipline, set an example in honesty,  and be clean and honest during the jubilant New Year and Spring  Festival. This should be a practical criterion to judge the  results of the previous anticorruption struggle and an important  indicator to show whether leading cadres are honest and  self-disciplined. Cadres found to have defied instructions and  violated the circular should be investigated and punished  strictly and promptly and never be tolerated.    Fourth, the more the anticorruption struggle is developed in  depth, the more we should have a correct and strict command of  principles and policies. We should always take economic  construction as the central task and serve better the endeavor  to promote reform and opening up and accelerate economic  development. We should adhere to the principle of seeking truth  from facts, adopt a firm attitude, and do down-to-earth work to  carry out the anticorruption struggle in a healthy and orderly  manner. We should soothe popular feeling and further boost the  enthusiasm of all the people of the municipality through the  anticorruption struggle.    Fifth, we should conscientiously strengthen organizational  leadership and do a good job in supervision and inspection.  Tianjin's anticorruption struggle has entered a crucial period,  and the period before the end of this year is very important to  determine whether notable results can be achieved. Party  committees and governments at all levels should attach great  importance to it and never slacken efforts in the struggle  despite their busy work. We should conscientiously strengthen  organizational leadership and apply the responsibility system to  every level which should be responsible for the work of the next  lower level. The municipal party committee and government will  organize an overall inspection in January next year on the  anticorruption struggle of all units.</p>

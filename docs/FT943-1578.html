			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right way to tackle drugs Sir, Your leader ('The role of a third party', September 21) only takes the argument half way. There are two evils associated with drugs. The first is the harm resulting from their use and the second is the incalculable damage to society inflicted by the crime resulting from their prohibition. In my opinion, the second is by far the greater and its continuance is a greater moral evil since it could be so easily removed by a stroke of the parliamentary pen. We would then be free to tackle drug use as we do tobacco or alcohol abuse. The distinction between soft drugs and hard is irrelevant.

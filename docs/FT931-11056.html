			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Menvier-Swain seeks Pounds 9m to help fund French buy MENVIER-SWAIN Group, the emergency lighting and fire alarms company, plans to raise Pounds 9m through a rights issue to help fund the acquisition of Nugelec, a French fire alarm system manufacturer for FFr84.8m (Pounds 10.6m). The company announced the planned acquisition and the proposed 1-for-8 rights issue at 520p a share, underwritten by Schroders, at the same time as reporting a 16 per cent increase in first half profits and a 22 per cent lift in the interim dividend. The profits growth reflected both organic growth and recent acquisitions. The shares closed down 2p at 603p yesterday. Separately the company also announced that Mr Charles Swain, president and a director, had placed 2.39m shares, representing a 16.7 per cent stake, with institutional investors at 573p a share yesterday. Mr Swain retains an interest in 550,000 shares. After the placement and rights issue the directors will hold 3.1m shares, representing 19 per cent of the equity. Menvier-Swain has been steadily building its operations in continental Europe through a string of small acquisitions, including one in Italy and another in Germany in the last six months. It already claims to be the market leader in Europe for emergency lighting with an overall 10 per cent share and aims to become the largest in terms of fire alarm systems as well. Paris-based Nugelec, which made pre-tax profits of FFr18m (FFr12.7m) on sales of FFr50.6m (FFr35m) in the year to December 31 1992, will link up with Luminox, Menvier's existing French subsidiary, to form a French group with a similar product range to Menvier-Swain's operations in the UK. Nugelec's sales are expected to decline by about 10 per cent this year because of a fall in sales to its biggest customer. Menvier-Swain will pay FFr79.8m in cash and FFr5m in shares. The interim results highlight the success of the group's expansion into continental Europe. Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31 increased to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 2.77m) with interest charges falling to Pounds 277,000 (Pounds 363,000). Sales grew by 27 per cent to Pounds 25m (Pounds 19.7m). Earnings per share increased from 13.3p to 14.9p. The interim dividend goes up from 2.7p to 3.3p. The USM-quoted company said it was considering moving to the main market.</p>

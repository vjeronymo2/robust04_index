Aircraft of the Uzbek militias,  which are led by General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, raided the  presidential palace, which is the headquarters of President  Borhanoddin Rabbani, Kabul Airport, the main intelligence  center, and other government positions. Sources close to the  militias have told AL-HAYAH that the raids are intended to pave  the way for an assault that they will launch jointly with the  supporters of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar to seize  control of Kabul.    It has also been reported that militia aircraft have,  moreover, raided the stronghold of the Ettehad-e Eslami, which  is led by Sheykh 'Abd-Rabb Rasul Seyyef, in Paghman, west of the  capital. It is well known that Seyyaf is a close associate of  the Afghan president.    Afghan diplomatic sources have reported that government  forces have downed a MiG-21 belonging to the militias in Paghman  and that they have killed General ['Abdol] Ghafar Pahlawan, a  most prominent Uzbek militia commander, in clashes between the  two sides in the city of Mazar-e Sharif, one of northern  Afghanistan's largest cities. These sources added that  Habibollah Beg, another Uzbek general, and 2,000 of his fighters  have surrendered to the government forces in Faryab Governorate.    Sources of the Jami'at-e Eslami, led by Rabbani, in Peshawar  have told AL-HAYAH that government aircraft have not taken part  in the Kabul battles because they have been busy raiding militia  positions in Mazar-e Sharif so as to strike these militias in  their stronghold.    Yesterday, Hekmatyar's supporters issued a statement  reiterating their demand that the president resign and  reaffirming their rejection of a cease-fire unless Rabbani  responds to this demand. A committee of field commanders has  declared its rejection of the demands of both sides and has  called for forming a new and neutral government.  <H5>  Imminent Assault </H5>   Sources close to Dostam have told AL-HAYAH that the air  raids  are in preparation for a fierce assault that the militias will  launch jointly with the Hezb-e Eslami, which is headed by Prime  Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, within 72 hours to seize Kabul.  The sources added that the air raids are intended to weaken and  destroy the government forces' defenses.    Yesterday, Pakistan closed its border in the face of  emigrants fleeing the war in the capital. Pakistani Government  sources have said that 14,000 Afghan citizens have crossed the  border into Pakistan since the battles started at the beginning  of this month.  <H5>  Calls for Peace </H5>   At a time when Pakistan has urged the feuding parties to  stop  the fighting, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has called for  an immediate truce and urged all Afghans to settle their  conflicts peacefully.    The Afghan Peace Committee, which is led by Field Commander  Jalaloddin Haqqani and which includes prominent 'ulema, field  commanders, and intellectuals, held a press conference in which  it has called for forming an expanded consultative council.</p>

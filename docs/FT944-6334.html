			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Don Quixote' in Stockholm - Ballet The Royal Swedish Ballet has just acquired Nureyev's staging of Don Quixote, and is dancing it splendidly. The company is not as well known here as it should be. Tours take it round the world, but not to London. It boasts more than 200 years of tradition, and a fine school. And the virtues of this schooling provide a buoyant strength for the new Don Quixote. There was a verve and enthusiasm to the performance I saw at the weekend which made the old ballet sparkle. The production was the more delightful by contrast with our own Royal Ballet's exercise in corpse-washing which was passed off under the same title. The Nureyev text is crammed with dances which insist upon a happy bravura. The story is cleverly told. John Lanchbery's edition of the score is jolly, and was driven spankingly along by the Russian conductor Renat Salavatov. Nadine Baylis's designs are fetchingly Hispanic. The production encourages its cast to fling any vestige of Nordic caution to the winds, and this the Swedes joyously do. Nureyev re-jigged the old ballet and inserted dances, yet never lost sight of the fact that though the piece is a theatrical war-horse, it is no spavined Rosinante, and can still gallop. So the first act bursts with toreadors, street-dancers, classical variations, knives, pas de deux, and every kind pimento-flavoured merriment. The second act offers gypsies, puppets, a classical dryad scene - and a very good one, too - and a windmill. The last act zips along. It is the most enjoyable of farragos. The Swedish dancers cope delightfully with all this, demonstrating a nice mixture of jokiness and academic good manners. Only the Kirov and Bolshoi know how much too far you can push the classic dance in being wildly Spanish. But the Swedes know how to flash and dash, and their 'school' means that movement is clear, generous. The ranks of soloists and corps de ballet are secure - variations were very well done, notably by Eugenia Zetterstrom as the Dryad Queen - and Madeleine Onne was a bright, endearing Kitri. She set out the choreography with a beguiling vivacity, and she pouts and flirts delightfully, striking sparks off character and dances with prettiest ease. Her Basilio was Jan-Erik Wikstrom, who is astonishing. A dancer in his early twenties, Wikstrom, has a physique rather like Nureyev's, and he takes to all the devilish complications that Nureyev stuffed into the role as if specially made for him. There results a reading that Nureyev might have envied. Wikstrom has a beautifully smooth technique. Nothing is forced, everything is fully stated, and steps, poses, melt into the ground or into the next phrase. He offers a physical cantilena as serene as that in Jussi Bjorling's singing. There is a bloom to what Wikstrom does, and a masculine grace devoid of mannerism. I thought at first he might prove too 'quiet' as an interpreter for a role that is about showing-off; but when the dance seizes him, he is a marvel, not least because of the elegance of his means. His reading has charm, and moments, as with Nureyev, when classicism is audacious, proud. Wikstrom's is a rare and beautiful talent. I have reported before on the Royal Swedish Ballet, with pleasure. This staging shows its artists at their admirable best. We really must see the company in London soon.</p>

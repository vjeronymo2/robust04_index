			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Chemical industry 'faces over-capacity challenge' WEST European ethylene manufacturers were warned yesterday they face a sustained period of unprofitability and cannot rely on demand growth to restore profits. The industry would require improbable annual economic growth rates approaching 6 per cent if it was to reach more acceptable profitability by 1995, said Mr Peter Kwant, vice-president of European petrochemicals at Shell International Chemical Company. Mr Kwant, speaking at the Financial Times Petrochemicals conference in London, said the European industry was mature, suffering from over-capacity, weak economic growth and high relative costs. Unless it closed its less efficient units, it would face the prospect of prolonged financial distress. The biggest challenge facing the industry remains over-capacity. Global capacity increased from 48m tonnes a year in 1986 to 70m, and would reach 90m tonnes by the end of the decade, warned Mr Stephen Pettit, chief executive of BP Chemicals' petrochemicals division. Worldwide demand growth would average only 5 per cent before the year 2000. Unless action was taken, European operating rates would not improve until 1994 and would not reach 95 per cent until the end of the decade. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer of Imperial Chemical Industries, said only a small start had been made in the restructuring and rationalisation required in all parts of the chemical industry. 'We are putting our heads in the sand if we do not recognise that in all branches of the industry there are too many players.' Although the number of European manufacturers had been reduced since 1980, there were too many in ethylene, low-density polyethylene, PVC and polypropylene. Many areas of speciality chemicals were also suffering from excess capacity, said Mr Hampel. However, Mr Pettit said there were not enough really uncompetitive crackers which were obvious candidates to influence significantly the capacity/demand imbalance. He called for the creation of a pan-European pipeline which would increase the merchant ethylene market and reduce the rapid swings in prices.</p>

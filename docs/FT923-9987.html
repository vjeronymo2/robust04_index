			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Books: A new wave celebration - Books for the Beach HAUNTS OF THE BLACK MASSEUR by Charles Sprawson Jonathan Cape Pounds 15.99, 307 pages SEVEN-TENTHS by James Hamilton-Paterson Hutchinson Pounds 16.99, 269 pages HERE ARE two books for the beach, celebrating as they do - in different ways  -swimming and the sea. Charles Sprawson's Haunts of the Black Masseur is, despite its opaque and inappropriate title (teasingly half-explained on page 255), straightforwardly a history and celebration of mankind's pleasure in the water. It apparently began life as an article and turning it into a book has left stretch-marks: some repetition and too many long outlines of the plots of novels that deal with swimming. Clearly, Sprawson has read virtually everything on the subject, which makes it shameful that there is neither index nor bibliography. That said, there is much to learn and enjoy - and some splendid photographs. As with so many human activities, the Classical period (especially Rome with its 800 public baths) represents a high point. Then came the Dark Ages, lasting in this case right up to the Romantics, during which most people regarded swimming as very eccentric. But with Goethe, Byron, Shelley, et al, it took off again and has never looked back. For the Romantics and their followers, swimming and the sea symbolised many things: heroic challenge, taken up by Byron in the Hellespont; liberation from the pressures of bourgeois life (until well on in the 19th century everyone swam naked); return to nature and the womb (in spite of Shelley's obsession with bathing and sailing, he never learned to swim, courting death through leaky boats and wild seamanship until he found it). In the 19th century, the English dominated swimming, using the breast-stroke, which had been universal since the dog-paddle disappeared in Elizabethan times. (It was common to learn to swim in the study, watching a frog in a bowl). Then came the crawl, and with it the 20th century has belonged to the other Anglo-Saxon nations and the Japanese. This century has also produced the diver and magnificent feats of daring and beauty, linking aquatics to art and show-business. Finally, Sprawson nicely chronicles for us the explosion of the private pool, both grand and domestic, and a return to the ubiquitous sybaritism of the Romans. James Hamilton-Paterson ranges more widely in Seven-Tenths (another opaque title, whose explanation is that seven-tenths of both the human body and the surface of the globe is water). There is swimming in this book too - through it runs a haunting autobiographical motif of a swimmer in mid-ocean who has drifted out of sight of his boat. But there is much else. A confessed non-scientist, Hamilton-Paterson is engagingly fascinated by the history of scientists' attempts to understand the sea and its creatures. He enjoys and is enjoyable on the subject of persistent misconceptions. For decades after everyone concerned should have known better, the view persisted that water became so dense at deeper levels that sinking ships and human bodies would remain suspended some way above the bottom. For a long time, it was theoretically shown (completely wrongly) that no life was possible in deep layers of the ocean. The author gives an exciting account of the heroic descents by William Beebe and others in small contraptions they built themselves and of the wonderful things they saw. There is a scientific detective story about coral reefs and how they were formed. As so often, it turns out that Darwin got it more or less right. Hamilton-Paterson is good on wrecks; the fascination they exert and the obsessive nature of the searches for them. After Robert Ballard finally succeeded in his quest for the Titanic he said: 'In a way, I am sad we found her'. What gives the book its special quality is the author's elegiac tone, his continuous musing on the emotional, ethical and psychological aspects of the subjects he discusses. There is a moving account of the USS Arizona, a warship sunk at Pearl Harbour which has not been raised but left as a uniquely dignified war memorial ('the only example of a monument which is viewed from above'). We are treated to a persuasive theory that the famous Caribbean pirates were homosexuals to a man. Then the discussion slides to modern pirates in the Philippines and the symbiotic relationship they have with the nomadic sea-people on whom they prey. And then to the nature of nomads and the loss to the human spirit which will be sustained when such people finally disappear from the world. The book indeed is primarily about loss. There are some passionate and well-documented attacks on the current spoliation of the ocean (the chapter on trawler-fishing in the North Sea is particularly horrifying). But the general tone is more subtle. It is well encapsulated by the only incident quoted in both books under revaew As early as 1907 Edmund Gosse lamented that no one would ever again see the wonderful world of the seaside rock-pools which his famous naturalist father had described so beautifully and reverently 50 years before, but which had then been destroyed by the invasion of amateur collectors stimulated by that very account.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Lloyd's probe raps syndicate chief THE UNDERWRITER of two of the heaviest loss-making syndicates at Lloyd's of London may not have appreciated the extent of his exposure to losses and bought insufficient reinsurance protection, an investigation has concluded. Details of the losses are contained in a report on Devonshire syndicates 216 and 833/834, whose losses in 1989 and 1990 exceeded Pounds 140m. The inquiry also discovered that 'the general air of hostility and apprehension that appears to have existed between Mr (Christopher) Bohling (the underwriter) and his staff would not have been conducive to the best running of the syndicates'. Both syndicates specialised in so-called 'spiral' reinsurance, covering the high-level losses of other syndicates and companies. About 2,000 Names - individuals whose assets support the insurance market - participated in one or more of these syndicates in 1989, 1990 and 1991. They face average losses of Pounds 100,000 each. Mr Alan Porter, chairman of the Devonshire Names Action group, said: 'This report confirms the group's worst suspicions concerning the management of the syndicates and strengthens the association's resolve to press for full compensation for affected Names.' The report into the syndicates, commissioned by the group, estimates that the syndicates' losses may eventually deteriorate to Pounds 450m when its accounts are finally closed. Trinity Square Services, one of the UK's largest run-off companies, carried out the report. The investigation, chaired by Mr Anthony Blake, a partner with accountants Neville Russell, took 17 months to complete. It discovered that a considerable portion of the syndicate's reinsurance programme was placed with the Korea Foreign Insurance programme. New managers made a 'considerable loss' when they settled these reinsurance policies in April.</p>

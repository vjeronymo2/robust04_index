			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: European shipping boom still elusive - But the strong dollar should encourage a revival Falling freight rates and lower ship values made 1992 a grim year for most European shipping companies. Nearly all the major bulk and liner shipping groups saw their shares head downwards, including such leading concerns as Denmark's AP Moller, the Netherland's Nedlloyd, Germany's Hapag-Lloyd and Norway's Bergesen. The current year may provide a revival, helped by a strong dollar, but the boom time that many had predicted for the 1990s remains as elusive as ever. For the bulk groups, much will depend on whether the tanker market recovers from last year's dire levels, and that in turn hinges a great deal on Opec output. Mr Ole Slorer, shipping analyst with NatWest Securities in London, comments: 'If Opec cuts its output by 1m barrels a day in the spring, the equivalent of 30 supertankers lose employment on an annual basis, so rates weaken.' Norway is one of Europe's two leading maritime nations, and the 35 per cent drop in its shipping index to 308 last year gave as clear a picture as anything of shipping company fortunes in 1992. At this level, the index is now less than a third of its peak 1,000 in early 1990. Shares in Bergesen, the big Norwegian bulk shipping group, fell to NKr91.50 from NKr130 in 1992. The collapse in tanker market rates and the crisis in the Norwegian financial sector took the group to a NKr32m loss at the eight months stage, although it may scrape back into profit for the year as a whole. Any move to raise vessel standards in the wake of the Braer shipping disaster in the Shetlands could well have a positive effect on a company such as Bergesen, which operates a high quality fleet of vessels. But it will not be a beneficiary if the action results in a blanket ban on ships over a certain age, because some of its ships, though well maintained, are also old. Shares in AP Moller's DS 1912 fell 18 per cent from DKr95,900 to DKr79,000, a smaller decline than the overall drop in the Danish stock market. The group, Denmark's biggest listed company, was insulated from the full effect of the poor tanker market by the broad spread of its shipping activities, in addition to its substantial North Sea oil and gas production operations. As for all liner shipping groups, its prospects in 1993 will be influenced by the prospects for world economy and trade. Nedlloyd, the Dutch shipping and transport group, was a special case, with its poor underlying performance again aggravated by its uneasy relation-ship with Mr Torstein Hagen, a major shareholder and a long-time critic of group strategy. Although Mr Hagen won a hard-fought battle for a place on Nedlloyd's supervisory board, the perception that financial problems might force him to sell much of his stake undermined the group's share price from mid-year onwards. This contributed to a 43 per cent fall in Nedlloyd's stock price over the year, from Fl 55.60 to Fl 31.70. Mr Hagen has recently resigned his board position, but 1993 may be another difficult one for the Dutch company because of its exposure to the slowing German economy. The same concern surrounds Hapag-Lloyd, the German liner shipping company whose shares fell 15 per cent to DM435 from DM515 in 1992. This year the expectation is that both bulk and liner markets will pick up, if only marginally. But whether shipping groups feel the full benefit of the trend is another matter. 'Financing costs and higher vessel operating costs mean that many companies will have worse figures in 1993 than 1992', says Mr Harald Moraeus Hanssen, shipping analyst with Fearnleys in Oslo. Shipping's perennial problem is that tonnage supply and demand are out of balance. It needs weak markets to induce significant scrapping to cut supply and push up rates. It also needs shipowners to show restraint when ordering new vessels. If this happens in 1993, then the bull market scenario will be that much nearer.</p>

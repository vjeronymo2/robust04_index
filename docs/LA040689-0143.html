			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Sports agent Norby Walters was a victim of "poisonous innuendo" and broke no  laws, a defense attorney said in his summation. But a federal prosecutor argued  in Chicago that Walters and associate Lloyd Bloom had perpetrated fraud.  </P> <P> Jurors were to begin deliberating the fate of Walters and Bloom today after  receiving instructions from U.S. District Judge George Marovich.  </P> <P> "This has been about fraud from day one and it will be about fraud when you go  back to that jury room," U.S Attorney Anton Valukas told jurors in his closing  arguments.  </P> <P> Walters, 58, and Bloom, 29, were charged with mail fraud, conspiracy to commit  fraud and racketeering, accused of luring dozens of college athletes with cash  and other gifts to sign contracts with them in violation of National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. rules, then using threats to keep the athletes in line.  </P> <P> "Mr. Walters may have violated NCAA rules but he never violated for an instant  any law," said Walters' attorney, Robert Gold.  </P></p>

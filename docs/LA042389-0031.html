			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARREST OF GAY MAN STIRS CLAIMS OF INJUSTICE  </P> <P> A man charged with interfering with Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies  outside a West Hollywood bar last week has accused deputies of mistreating him  because he is gay.  </P> <P> "It was like they (the deputies) wanted to make an example of me when all I did  was complain about their mistreatment of someone else," said Edward Michael  Crawford, 33, of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Sgt. Rick Cartwright of the sheriff's department said that Crawford, who was  arrested about 3:15 p.m. Tuesday, threatened deputies who had detained a man on  the street in view of the Gold Coast Bar, 8228 Santa Monica Blvd., where  Crawford was a patron.  </P> <P> Crawford, a chauffeur who is a citizen of West Germany, was charged with  interfering with a peace officer, a misdemeanor, and released on his own  recognizance. He is to be arraigned May 9 in Beverly Hills Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Cartwright said Crawford came out of the establishment and "began telling  officers they couldn't do what they were doing" and, after being told to leave,  "went back into the bar and brought out about six people" who began harassing  the officers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Different Story  </P> <P> However, Crawford and several other patrons of the bar told a different story.  </P> <P> They accused deputies of unjustly detaining the man who sheriff's officials  said was reportedly lying in the street, and of provoking a group of mostly gay  onlookers by "unjustly" arresting Crawford.  </P> <P> "It got very ugly, and it was uncalled for on the part of the deputies," said  the Rev. Bob Lucas, one of the bar patrons. "They acted as though they had come  to put down a full-scale riot."  </P> <P> Cartwright said that four patrol cars were called to the scene after the  arresting officer reported that a crowd had become unruly, but he said that  "there was absolutely no force used" and that the officers did nothing to  provoke anyone.  </P> <P> But several of the patrons, angered by what they said was "an unnecessary show  of force" aimed at members of the gay community, disputed the Sheriff's  Department's account of the incident.  </P> <P> "He (Crawford) never went back into the bar. He was arrested after walking over  to a pay phone to call the (West Hollywood) sheriff's station and complain  about what was going on," said Ron Tillinghast, who said he witnessed the  incident from inside the establishment.  </P> <P> The incident took place on La Jolla Avenue, near Santa Monica Boulevard. The  bar has windows that face both streets.  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials say the stretch of Santa Monica Boulevard where the  establishment is located is a hot spot for male prostitutes and street  hustlers, and that it is not uncommon for officers to approach and question  people who appear to be loitering there.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Man Wasn't Arrested  </P> <P> However, Tillinghast and others said that the man whose detention triggered the  incident was doing nothing to warrant being detained. The man, who was not  identified, was not arrested.  </P> <P> "He was sitting on a ledge against a bookstore across the street doing nothing  as far as we could tell," Tillinghast said. "That's what set things off.  Several of us had been noticing him there before the deputies showed up. People  inside the bar couldn't believe it when they saw the deputies stop and start  hassling him."  </P> <P> Crawford said he became upset when he saw the deputies approach the man "for no  apparent reason" and place him "in a spread-eagle position and begin frisking  him."  </P> <P> "There was a male and a female officer and the female officer, who appeared to  be a rookie because the other officer seemed to be instructing her how to  conduct the spread eagle, was the one actually doing the frisking, which also  surprised us," he said.  </P> <P> Crawford said that he went outside to complain to the deputies about the way  the man was being treated, and that the male deputy told him to "Get . . . away  from here, or I'll place you under arrest."  </P> <P> He said that he told the deputy he intended to report the incident to the  Sheriff's Department, and walked to a public telephone about 60 feet away to  call the sheriff's station.  </P> <P> "As I was talking to the dispatcher, trying to tell him what was going on, this  other deputy who'd driven up about then came over to where I was e and I heard  the first one (deputy) who'd told me to leave yell to him to detain me. And he  slammed the handcuffs on me."  </P> <P> Lt. Rudy Walker, who was in charge of the West Hollywood sheriff's station on  Thursday, said he was unfamiliar with the incident and could offer no details  beyond those provided by Cartwright. Capt. Rachel Burgess, who heads the  station, was on vacation.  </P> <P> "We're not going to try the matter in the newspapers," Walker said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Lucas, a gay rights activist who has often publicly commended the  Sheriff's Department for its law enforcement efforts, said he has asked Jack  Bollen, West Hollywood's public safety coordinator, to forward a formal  complaint about the incident to the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> "This community is at the boiling point, and I'm talking about gay people who  perceive that they are often mistreated (by the Sheriff's Department), and then  you have incidents like this that only reinforce that," he said. "We want the  city or someone to investigate this."  </P></p>

According to another decision, no member of Vladimir Meciar's  government will accept the president's request to exercise his  duties until the formation of a new cabinet.    The government has also agreed to recall all state  secretaries [deputy ministers] and all heads of ministerial  offices by 18 March. Meciar announced that he received two  letters from the president. In one of the letters, the  president notified him of his dismissal from the office of the  prime minister and in the second one, he was asked as the  chairman of the strongest political party to nominate a  representative of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]  who would attempt to form a new government. Meciar emphasized  that the HZDS was not going to enter into any government and was  going into opposition.</p>

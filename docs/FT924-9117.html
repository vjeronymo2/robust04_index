			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / UK decision irritates France FRANCE yesterday voiced dismay at UK Prime Minister John Major's decision to put off parliamentary ratification of the Maastricht treaty until after a second Danish referendum next May. The delay was 'very worrying' said Mrs Elizabeth Guigou, the European affairs minister. It risked undermining 'indispensable dynamism' in the whole process of ratifying the treaty on monetary and political union in Britain and Denmark, said Mr Daniel Bernard, foreign ministry spokesman. 'A more rapid British ratification would without doubt create a happy dynamic to help the Danes ratify,' he said. The foreign ministry accepted that Britain was entitled to some flexibility on the timing of Maastricht ratification, but officials were privately annoyed that Mr Major appeared to have withdrawn an assurance to President Francois Mitterrand that the Maastricht bill would pass through parliament by early next year. Britain's delay is doubly irritating to Mr Mitterrand, for whom European construction has been a constant priority. He took the biggest political risk of his career by putting the ratification of Maastricht to a referendum in September, in which victory was slim enough to inflict further damage on an already weak and divided ruling Socialist party. Another dose of suspense over the future of the treaty will hardly please the French president and could well provide fresh ammunition for opponents of Maastricht in the finely balanced French electorate.</p>

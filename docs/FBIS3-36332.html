The discussion is scheduled for next week.    Boris Yeltsin sent an address to both chambers of the  Russian  parliament reminding them that, according to the Constitution,  decisions are considered adopted if they receive support of more  than a half of the total constitutionally-envisaged number of  deputies.    However, while adopting interim procedural rules, lawmakers  interpreted the notion of the "total number of deputies" as the  total number of elected lawmakers, although several seats are  still vacant in each of the chambers.    The president requested the deputies "to bring the interim  rules in accordance with the Constitution".</p>

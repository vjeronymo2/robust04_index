			<p>BFN     [Text] Pusan, South Korea, May 6 (YONHAP) -- China has  officially demanded that a South Korean ship pay a 50,000-dollar  fine for violating Chinese territorial waters, Foreign Ministry  officials here said Friday.    The Jiangxi Provincial people's government officially  notified the South Korean Embassy in China that it is detaining  a Korean ship, "the 2d Songgwang-ho," and that it has decided to  fine the vessel 50,000 U.S. dollars for allegedly fishing in  Chinese waters.    Of the 50,000 dollars, the fine for illegal fishing is  30,000  dollars and that for violating China's territorial waters is  20,000 dollars.    The fine is about 20 times higher than that levied by South  Korea on ships violating its territorial waters and so runs  counter to the principle of equity, according to ministry  officials.    Besides, Sin Hyong-pok, captain of the Songgwang-ho, and the  other 10 crew members claim they did not violate Chinese waters  on purpose but lost control of the ship due to engine trouble.    Ministry officials, worried that the problem might develop  into a diplomatic tiff, said, "we will make efforts to persuade  China to lower the fine as well as return the crew as soon as  possible."    Chinese patrol ships captured the "Songgwang-ho" in the East  China Sea 175 miles southwest of Cheju Island's Mosulpo port  last Friday at 11 AM after seizing another fishing vessel, "the  Taehung- ho," and its 11 crew.    Both vessels were adrift after experiencing engine trouble,  according to the crew.    Meanwhile, China has not sent an official notification on  the  capture of the Taehung-ho, the Foreign Ministry said.</p>

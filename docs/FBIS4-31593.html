			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Miljenko Filipovic, commander of the </F> Zrinski Regiment, by Snjezana Dukic; place and date not given:  "If We Had Been Only 10 Minutes Late..."]    [Text] "The Zrinski Regiment has up to now been the best  and most elite unit of the Croatian Army [HV] in its  organization, its work, its structure, and its results. It is  the only unit of all the so-called special forces at the  beginning of the war which has survived to this day and has good  results. All the rest have fallen apart. We do not live on  memories like some people. Our performance results are almost  the same in 1991 and 1993," says Colonel Miljenko Filipovic,  commander of the Zrinski Regiment, a special unit of the Defense  Ministry, which celebrated its third anniversary the other day.    A resident of Zagreb who was born in Tomislavgrad, a soldier  in the Foreign Legion since 1984, his career is typical for  legionnaires. On the wall of the Zrinski Regiment Command in  Rakitje, there are several certificates of a parachutist, a  diver, a commando leader, an instructor in hand-to-hand  combat.... He has waged war throughout Africa from Djibouti,  Chad, and Zaire to Rwanda as a member of an elite platoon of  paratroops in the Legion. Motivated by events in Croatia, after  arriving from the field in Africa in late 1990, he decided to  leave the Foreign Legion. Although he still had two years of  service to go under his contract in the Legion, working out  cancellation of the contract through regular procedure was out  of the question.    [Filipovic] I could no longer wait. At that time, there was  a  crisis in the Gulf between Iraq and Kuwait and I knew that I  would be sent there, and that would have meant at least a year  of warfare. Through my brother, I managed to obtain a passport  and returned after seven years of being out of Croatia, and I  left the Legion once and for all.  <H5>  Fine Lads </H5>   [Dukic] At the beginning of the homeland war you trained  members of the Antiterrorist Unit [ATJ] in Lucko. You passed on  to them some of the knowledge and military skills from the  Legion?    [Filipovic] Yes, I was an instructor in Lucko, but that was  the police, and I am a professional soldier. There are big  differences between the army and the police, and I was bothered  most by the poor organization. To be sure, there were fine lads  there, but they were unaccustomed to waging war and to the  rigorous discipline that we had in the Legion. You do not become  a professional soldier overnight. It takes at least five years  for a soldier to go through training, to learn terrains, to  learn tactics, to become resourceful, to get a taste of war. It  takes more than pluck and bravery to wage war. You need  equipment, good weapons, which at that time we did not have, and  we were up against a well-equipped aggressor. We got our  bearings and acquired weapons however we could. In actuality,  the police were smuggling weapons in their own state. It sounds  very funny, but at the time that is how it was. The Lucko ATJ  was in those early days the unit principally responsible for all  actions. Those boys were ready for anything, and as soon as they  got a rifle in their hands they thought that they had everything  and could do everything. They would say: "Man, what can tanks do  to us...," and if tanks had come upon us at that moment they  would have run over us all. Now the Croatian Army is slowly  coming into its own. There will still be a great deal of work on  its structure, but now we have both weapons and materiel, and  the situation is no longer what it was in 1990.    [Dukic] When you transferred from the Lucko ATJ to the  Defense Ministry, you and Colonel General Ante Rosa were given  the task of forming the Zrinski Regiment. What did that look  like at the beginning?    [Filipovic] The regiment was formed on 18 May 1991 by order  of Gojko Susak, who at that time was deputy defense minister. On  the actual day it was created, we had 27 volunteers who had been  picked from among the 300 members of the MUP [Ministry of  Internal Affairs] at the training center in Kumrovec. They were  enrolled through a strict selection procedure and subject to  certain criteria, and that meant that they could not be over age  25, they had to have good psychophysical stability and  conditioning, they had to be without family obligations, young  men ready for anything....  <H5>  From Battle to Battle </H5>   [Dukic] After General Rosa left for his new post in the  Defense Ministry in the summer of 1991, you took over the place  of regimental commander. What were your first actions?    [Filipovic] As early as mid-June 1991, we went to our first  deployment in Vukovar, where our main task was to help in  organizing and training the Vukovar volunteers, and we assisted  Gen. Blago Zadra in a successful action to mop up Borovo  Naselje. Then came Hrvatska Kostajnica, which we took back with  one section of the 1st Guard Brigade. After that, the entire  unit went to Gospic, where in a lightning action on 5 September  we captured a convoy of armored vehicles of the former JNA  [Yugoslav People's Army] with 30 crew members, led by Gen.  Krstevski. I received an order from Zagreb to let them all go  home, but the "armor" remained in our hands. Then we took the  Kaniza military warehouse, which we literally emptied in a  single night. That meant a turning point in Gospic. The men were  armed, and other garrisons in the vicinity were also falling.  Toward the end of October, the regiment went to Metkovic with  the task of helping in military operations in the liberation of  Slano. In those actions, we took the most important elevation  above Slano--Timor hill. In Operation Maslenica, the Zrinski  Regiment played one of the more significant roles. Twice we  conquered Skabrnja, we liberated the area from Smokovici to  Murvica, we broke out onto the main highway, and we also rescued  Novigrad from a new breakthrough of the chetnik forces. Had we  been 10 minutes later that time, Novigrad would have fallen. We  took part in the liberation of Dubrovnik. We were the first to  take Golubov Kamen, but we had to withdraw because of poor  coordination with our other units.  <H5>  Held Back by Politics </H5>   [Dukic] So far, you have mainly talked about the more  important actions. However, the Zrinski Regiment did much more  than that, and some of your members even took part in battles on  the territory of Herceg-Bosna.    [Filipovic] Yes, toward the end of 1991 we were training  soldiers in Tomislavgrad. We took part in the battles on Kupres,  which I commanded personally. The regiment liberated  three-fourths of Kupres, but in the end it fell nevertheless,  through no fault of ours.    [Dukic] Whose fault was it that Kupres fell, and how did you  come to be a soldier of the Croatian Army in Bosnia and  Herzegovina anyway?    [Filipovic] I know whose fault it was, but I do not want to  talk about that now. Nevertheless, this was the beginning of the  war in Herceg-Bosna, the army was not organized, the people were  not ready. We had no one to rely on, and we were not able to  carry all the burden ourselves. This is where we had our first  men killed, and I myself was wounded. After it fell, we remained  for a time in Herzegovina, helping to build the Croatian Defense  Council [HVO].    You see, I was born in Tomislavgrad, and I was fighting in  Herceg-Bosna as a volunteer. I cannot leave the graves of my  ancestors to anyone. Absolutely not! Incidentally, when war  broke out in Croatia, most of the volunteers came from  Herzegovina, and they only went back to defend their own.    [Dukic] To what extent did political decisions and the  signing of cease-fire agreements make the situation more  difficult in the field?    [Filipovic] I am not interested in changes of policy,  because  I am above all a professional soldier. I am here to defend my  homeland, my people, to respect its will. Few people in the  world recognized Croatia in 1990 and 1991. It did not suit  anyone for the former Yugoslavia to fall apart, and it is  natural that it should have been extremely difficult for our  politicians. But it must also be clear that politics was always  holding us, the army, back. The Croatian Army is now  sufficiently strong and well enough armed to take back all its  borders. Let our politicians continue to go on solving  everything by peaceful means, but if that is not possible, we  are available.  <H5>  A Great Deal of Experience </H5>   [Dukic] What in your opinion is the key factor in building  the Croatian Army?    [Filipovic] The Croatian Army will be among the best so long  as the command positions are held by those who went through the  entire homeland war waging war, who will be able to contribute  thanks to their experience. We may also graduate from military  schools at the university level and academies, but there is no  substitute for practical experience.... The homeland war  represents a great deal of experience of life and military  experience, an important school. This cannot be learned  anywhere, but only in war, out in the field!    [Dukic] What lies ahead for the Zrinski Regiment?    [Filipovic] In the new structure of the Croatian Army, the  Zrinski Regiment will be part of the 1st Croatian Guard Corps,  but we will continue to be a combat unit with special  importance. The training of our members is being conducted from  sunup to sundown. The requirements include conditioning drills,  martial arts, parachute jumps, diver training, exercises in  military tactics, and the recognition and handling of all types  of weapons. There is not a moment's pause in all this. We are  constantly learning, drilling, improving ourselves to be as  good, strong, and ready as we can to protect Croatia and the  Croatian people.</p>

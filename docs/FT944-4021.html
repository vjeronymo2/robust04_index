			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Nafta aims for swift Chilean entry: US expected to request 'fast-track' negotiating powers from Congress Leaders of the US, Canada and Mexico will announce tomorrow an immediate start to work on bringing Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement. The announcement will be made at a press conference following the conclusion of the Summit of the Americas in Miami tomorrow, at which the Chile's President Eduardo Frei will also be present. Five working groups of trade experts from the four nations will be established to examine Chile's readiness to join Nafta. The first meeting of specialists from the three current member states will meet before Christmas to discuss the broad principles to cover Chile's incorporation into the accord. In the next step, the US administration is expected in the spring to introduce a trade bill into Congress that would grant it 'fast track' negotiating powers. It is not yet clear whether the administration will request fast track only for Chile, or attempt to secure broader fast track authority. Fast track avoids line-by-line scrutiny by Congress of trade accords negotiated by the administration, restricting the legislature to a vote for the agreements on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. The tentative timetable would be for the agreement to be negotiated in time to present it to the US Congress by next October and to be ratified before the year's end. This would avoid the accord becoming embroiled in the 1996 presidential election campaign. The technical aspects of the negotiation are, for the most part, not expected to be difficult. In many respects - intellectual property protection, for example - Chilean legislation offers higher standards than in some existing Nafta members. Chile has indicated its willingness to sign on to labour and environment 'side accords' that accompanied Nafta, though not all the issues negotiated with Mexico - for example those relating to the Mexico-US border - will be relevant. The working groups - there were 10 in the case of Mexico and a maximum of five for Chile - will cover issues such as market access measures, trade remedies such as subsidies and anti-dumping rules, agriculture and dispute settlement. A broad commitment to leaving the existing Nafta treaty unchanged is expected to emerge, although some areas may need minor alterations. The plans to expand Nafta and the establishment at the summit of 2005 as the year to complete negotiations on a free trade accord covering all of the Americas were expected to underpin the success of the summit. Until a few weeks ago many Latin American governments had not expected much of substance to emerge from the summit. The summit will also agree to follow-up meetings by the hemisphere's trade ministers next June and in the following March.</p>

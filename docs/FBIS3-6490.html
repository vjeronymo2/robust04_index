			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Field] </F>   [Text] Auckland, March 18 (AFP) -- Life used to be languid  in the Cook Islands but its secretive offshore banking operation  has now put the Pacific archipelago at the centre of a hurricane  of claims of corruption and tax-dodging.    Cook Island understanding of it is deliberately hindered by  laws which make it illegal to discuss tax laws publicly, while  in New Zealand, where commercial papers have been leaked, High  Court orders have kept the issue out of the headlines.    The head of the New Zealand First party, Winston Peters, on  Wednesday accused the Cooks' government of a role in defrauding  governments in Australia, Japan and New Zealand of "untold  millions" in tax revenue.    It was done, he said, by dual bookkeeping -- issuing  certificates to foreign companies saying they had paid  withholding tax in the Cooks when, in fact, they had not. He  said the Cooks pocketed a share of the money the companies saved  by not paying tax in their home countries.    "Put simply, the government of the Cook Islands collects tax  but gives it back to the favoured and malevolent few," he  declared.    Corrupt officials in Australia, New Zealand and the Cook  Islands were responsible for the system, he charged.    Peters' attack followed similar allegations made in  Rarotonga, the islands' capital, on March 2 by Richard McDonald,  former director of the Cooks' government auditing, and who is  now an opposition candidate in general elections next Thursday.    Cooks Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Henry denies any  corruption  involved in his country's status as a tax haven.    "Our position has been and will continue to be that there  has  been no false certificates issued," he said.    But another politician, opposition Cooks' Alliance leader  Norman George who was once in Sir Geoffrey's cabinet, made no  sec@et the whole rationale of the operation was to make money by  helping people not pay taxes in other countries.    "The more revenue we get the easier it is on the other  (Cooks) taxpayers -- we do not want to break laws to get it but  if we can do it legally then it we should," George said.    The ruling National Party successfully prevented Peters on  16  previous occasions from tabling papers that he says prove his  claim.    But this time, the party in a tactical blunder forgot to  raise the necessary oral objection to his production of papers.    Known as the "wine box" papers, for the way they first  arrived in New Zealand, they are internal documents of Hong  Kong-based European Pacific International (EPI).    EPI is a mysterious organisation whose activities are  closely  protected by the Cook Islands laws, and it is believed to be the  vehicle for encouraging and channelling corporate funds int@ the  tax haven.    It was founded by Australian David Lloyd who, with Sir  Geoffrey, established the Cooks' offshore banking in 1981.    EPI's New Zealand representative David Lloyd rebutted any  suggestion of wrongdoing, saying the company had at all times  worked within the laws of countries where it does business.    At the same time, however, he angrily attacked Peters for  tabling "confidential" documents that, he said, had been  "stolen" from the company.    In a further development Thursday, an arm of EPI, the  European Pacific Trust Co., won a court order in Rarotonga  preventing another opposition group, the Democratic Party, from  using "specified documents" related to the controversy, the  party said.    EPI, contending that publication of the documents would do  enormous harm to the Cooks, has also taken court action to gag  three New Zealand media outlets from publishing them.</p>

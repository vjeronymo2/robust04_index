			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Recipe for reform lacks dash of spice: Elections have strengthened India's PM but he still needs to rally support The ghost of the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque, which has haunted India for a year, has been laid to rest. The verdict from six state elections held last month is clear. Though vote counting has yet to be completed, the electorate has rejected the militancy propagated by the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata party. Supporters of the BJP, the main opposition to the ruling Congress (I) party in parliament, unleashed widespread violence and political unrest after they stormed the mosque last December, resulting in more than 2,000 deaths. At the time of the riots the BJP's support was rising. Before Ayodhya, the BJP controlled four of the six states. Now it will run just two. The BJP's defeat comes as a relief to the Congress party and Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, who even a few months ago feared the BJP might do well enough in the state polls to give unstoppable impetus to its demands for an early general election. The outcome is thus the prospect of greater political stability for the government than seemed likely earlier this year. Mr Rao, who was under attack from within his own party for failing to combat the BJP with any vigour, has seen his softly-softly approach vindicated. Now he can look forward to leading the party and the country at least until the next general election due in 1996. Mr H K L Bhagat, the Congress party president, says: 'The results have strengthened the party and strengthened the prime minister.' Businessmen have also welcomed the poll result as it provides some assurance of political stability at a time of economic change; so too have stock market investors who yesterday sent the Bombay Stock Exchange's index up 59.71 to 3,292.85 on the first trading day following the election results. Mr Tarun Das, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, a leading employers' organisation, says: 'Stability at the political level is good news for the economy and for investors, including foreign investors.' However, the fact that the government is now relatively stable does not mean that it is popular. The election results show that Indians remain disillusioned with their national political leaders. The fall in BJP support was not matched by any surge in enthusiasm for Congress. Without such enthusiasm, Mr Rao and his party will find it difficult to carry out controversial policies - notably the economic liberalisation he started in 1991. The appeal of Mr Rao's Congress party has worn thin nearly 50 years after it came to power as a nation-builder, leaving Indians looking for a new direction among their political leaders. Some have found it in the BJP's brand of Hindu nationalism, though, as the state polls show, others, such as those who voted for the populist coalition in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh, are repelled by the party's militant Hindu nationalism. Nearly one third of Indian voters were eligible to vote in the state elections which took place in four states - Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh - where the BJP had previously held power; and in two other small states - the city of Delhi and the north-eastern state of Mizoram. Congress benefited from the anti-BJP vote mainly in the states where it was the only credible alternative - Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, where it overturned BJP majorities, and Rajasthan, where it reinforced its position as the largest opposition party. But in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state and the heartland of north Indian politics, the anti-BJP vote was captured not by Congress but a powerful third force in the form of the alliance between the Samajwadi party and the Bahujan Samaj party, representing mainly the deprived lower castes. Congress won just 28 seats in the 425-member state assembly which it once dominated. The BJP may be down but it is not out. It remains the single largest party in Uttar Pradesh with 176 seats. It retained control of Rajasthan and won Delhi, where state-level polls were held for the first time in 40 years. Mr K R Malkani, the BJP's spokesman, says the party needs to broaden its support. He claims it suffered because it was wrongly portrayed as a one-issue party committed to claiming the site of the Ayodhya mosque for a Hindu temple. 'We have to explain ourselves better to the average man.' Many middle-class Indians have sympathy for the BJP because they see it as a vigorous alternative to an over-conservative, tired-looking Congress. One leading busi-nessman says: 'If the BJP can develop a non-religious agenda, it could yet be the party of the future.' However, at least until the 1996 national elections, it is Congress which is in power. It will have opportunities for legislative action as early as today, when parliament meets for its winter session. It is already preparing the next tranche of its economic reforms for publication in the 1994-95 budget in February. Mr Manmohan Singh, the reform-minded finance minister, has indicated the budget will bring further reductions in customs duties, tax reforms and measures to ease private companies' entry into insurance and other industries dominated by state enterprises. He may also further liberalise foreign exchange controls. However, the political obstacles to further radical reform remain daunting. Congress generally is willing to accept economic liberalisation - such as customs duty cuts and incentives for exporters and foreign investors - but only if it can be achieved without too much political hardship. But, with a few honourable exceptions, MPs are loath to contemplate more painful measures - such as relaxing tough labour laws which prevent companies sacking workers and cutting jobs in the overmanned public sector, which absorbs about two-thirds of India's organised labour. As Mr P Chidambaram, a pro-reform MP and former commerce minister, says: 'There is support for reform. But a critical mass of support is absent.' Mr Manmohan Singh believes that a pro-reform consensus is steadily growing both in Congress and in the country at large. Economic reform was not an issue in last month's state polls, not least because the BJP generally supports liberalisation. But Janata Dal and other parties of the left which have been strong critics of pro-market reform fared badly at the elections. MPs have good reason to be wary of radical reform. In the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh, the outgoing BJP administration pursued exemplary pro-market economic reforms - including trimming state spending, cutting subsidies for apple farmers and introducing a no-work, no-pay rule for civil servants who went on strike (which they often did). The result was electoral disaster. But Mr Chidambaram believes that support for reforms could grow with a stronger lead from New Delhi. Even cost-cutting in state-owned industry and other controversial measures are possible, he says. At the Confederation of Indian Industry, Mr Das agrees: 'Reforms are on Manmohan Singh's agenda. I believe the prime minister will now let him get on with it.'</p>

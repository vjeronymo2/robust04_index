			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mark Ashurst] </F>   [Text] The continuing stand-off in Natal between regional  premier Frank Mdalose and the ANC over the allocation of key  ministerial portfolios in the provincial legislature followed a  crucial miscalculation by ANC Natal leader Jacob Zuma, sources  within the ANC said at the weekend.    But the ANC has not discarded the possibility of resorting  to  court actions to remedy the situation. The sources said Zuma  agreed to accept an Inkatha victory in the province at a private  meeting with ANC President Nelson Mandela during the weekend of  April 30-May 1.    The ANC's decision to accept the poll in Natal was based on  Zuma's confidence that Mdlalose would "co-operate" in the Natal  cabinet in the interests of national reconciliation. ANC hopes  for a settlement were pinned on talks between Mandela and  Inkatha Freedom Party leader Chief Buthelezi, who were set to  meet in Cape Town last night. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said  there was little sign of goodwill at provincial level.    In a speech to the Natal legislature on Friday, Buthelezi  appealed to the Premier and the cabinet to resist making deals  at leadership level. Democracy would be "smashed on the rocks  of expediency" if deals were done in secret "to appear  reasonable", he said.    Inkatha was awarded 51 percent of the Natal vote in last  month's election, and currently holds six of the 10 ministerial  seats in the new cabinet. The ANC has refused to accept the  three portfolios offered to it and is demanding the police  portfolio described by ANC Midlands chairman Harry Gwala as "the  difference between liberation and oppression in Natal".    Natal University analyst Mary de Haas said ANC leaders were  primarily concerned with reducing violence by not provoking  Inkatha. However, any decision to concede such a substantial  victory to Inkatha was "short-sighted in the extreme".    ANC-aligned lawyers confirmed they had sworn affidavits from  Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials claiming that  Inkatha's final poll was the result of "massive fraud". The ANC  last week suspended an application to the Special Electoral  Court from its Natal region to review the election result.    Niehaus confirmed that the ANC objections were suspended in  the interests of finding a political settlement in Natal. The  possibility of reversing this decision could give the ANC added  "leverage" in negotiations with Inkatha.    Further, if Inkatha remained intransigent, the  Constitutional  Court could be asked to declare the Natal cabinet's decisions  null and void on grounds that the cabinet was not properly  constituted. Administrators could then be appointed to run the  province, he said.    Zuma had "a good working relationship" with Mdlalose, said  De  Haas. The dispute over portfolio allocations reflected  intervention by hardline factions within Inkatha, at whose  insistence Prince Zulu Gideon had been granted a seat in the  cabinet in favour of Mike Tarr.    IEC chairman Johann Kriegler confirmed that political  parties  had been involved in negotiations with the IEC during the  elections count. The IEC had hoped to resolve objections lodged  by parties over the IEC's handling of the elections, he said.</p>

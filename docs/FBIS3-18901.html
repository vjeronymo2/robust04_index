Talking to  newspersons in Geneva yesterday, the minister of state for  external affairs, Mr. Salman Khursheed, however, ruled out  negotiation of the status of Kashmir, which is an integral part  of the country. Mr. Khursheed said that Pakistan has no locus  standi to teach India on human rights. He welcomed the U.S.  decision to avoid any reference to Kashmir.    Earlier, in her address to the Human Rights Commission, the  leader of the U.S. delegation, Ms. Geraldine Ferraro, made no  reference to Jammu and Kashmir or the alleged violation of human  rights in her six-page statement. Hailing the virtues of  democracy, she said that democracy puts no chain around a  nation's neck. Ms. Ferraro said true democracies allow their  people the chance to breathe, dream, and to grow. Reports say  that the U.S. delegation leader made it clear that Washington  will abstain from voting on the Pakistani resolution.    The European Union of 12 members has also decided to abstain  from voting on the resolution. As reported earlier, China has  described the Pak-sponsored resolution on Kashmir as out of  context. Iran has regretted terrorist activities being promoted  by Islamabad in Kashmir.</p>

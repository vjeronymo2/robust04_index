			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Figures draw veil over jobless women: Why official unemployment statistics may not give a complete picture MRS Gillian Shephard, the first Conservative woman employment secretary, and the first with a specific brief for women, will today announce unemployment figures which may underestimate female unemployment by up to 250,000. Government figures for February showed that 12.8 per cent of the male workforce was unemployed, compared with 5.3 per cent for women. The figures classify as unemployed only those who can claim benefit, and exclude many women who are jobless and available for work. The Unemployment Unit, a pressure group for the unemployed, said many women immediately disappeared from the count when the definition was changed in 1982. The Employment Institute, an independent research body, said women experienced more breaks from employment than men and were more likely to work part-time, so were less likely to accumulate the necessary National Insurance contributions to qualify for unemployment benefit. An unemployed married woman who is eligible for unemployment benefit may not be eligible for means-tested income support because of her husband's earnings, and would not be counted as unemployed when her husband's entitlement to unemployment benefit expired after a year without work. One way of assessing the degree to which the rules distort the measurement of women's unemployment is to compare the claimant count with survey-based measures of unemployment such as those provided by the International Labour Organisation. This bases its definition of unemployment on being out of work and actively looking for a job. The ILO estimated UK unemployment at 9.4 per cent of the workforce last year  -8.3 per cent for women and 10.1 per cent for men. Government figures showed unemployment at 10.7 per cent for men and 4.5 per cent for women. The ILO's results are reinforced by figures produced in the UK's labour-force survey, which is based on the same definition. According to the Employment Institute the survey approach can also disguise the real extent of female unemployment, because unemployed women are less likely than men to say they are immediately available for work because they often have to make arrangements for childcare. In addition jobless women often fail to perceive themselves as such because they are actively doing housework. The National Institute for Social Research forecasts that on government figures the ratio of female-to-male unemployment will widen slightly, reflecting the continuing shake-out in the manufacturing and construction industries where men are more strongly represented. But the bad news for the government is that employment can pick up sharply among women with little impact on the unemployment figures.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BENEFIT FOR ALLEN JACKSON  </P> <P> Though there was an abundance of blues played Sunday at the benefit for bassist  Allen Jackson, the mood was far from blue. The long fund-raiser, held in the  clubhouse of the Chester Washington Golf Course and produced by vocalist Lorez  Alexandria, was an intimate jazz party that also served as a celebration of the  Los Angeles-based musicians who turned out on behalf of their friend and  colleague.  </P> <P> The event's loose, jam-session feel made for a number of groups with  mix-and-match personnel. Pianist Gildo Mahones took a turn with drummer Al  Williams' Jazz Society until regular pianist Bobby Pierce arrived. Mahones was  back at the keyboard with trumpeter Hugh Bell for a rendition of "Bye-Bye  Blackbird," before Pierce took the piano seat again with Don and Alicia  Cunningham. Art Hillery played with both Clora Bryant's group and with Teddy  Edwards. Vibraphonist Raphael seemed to stand in with just about everybody.  </P> <P> Edwards' two-tune set, which featured the saxophonist's slippery, thematic  style, included a warm introduction to Walter Gross' "Tenderly" and the pushy,  bluesy lines of Edwards' own "Get Up and Get It." Both garnered long ovations  for the soloists.  </P> <P> The evening's most emotional moment came when Jackson, suffering from bone  cancer, arrived and spoke briefly to the audience, thanking them for their  support. Jackson's words, fittingly enough, were followed by a lively  performance from the vocal team of Don and Alicia Cunningham, with whom the  bassist once worked. BILL KOHLHAASE  </P></p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Women amid 'male camaraderie': A look at moves to counter sexual discrimination in the office Miss Samantha Phillips, the insurance broker who yesterday won her case of sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal against Willis Corroon, did not, in the end, convince the industrial tribunal that she had been sexually harassed by her manager on a business trip. Nonetheless the case has served to highlight the difficulties of women who work in what the tribunal yesterday described as 'an atmosphere of male camaraderie'. Sexual harassment has become a high-profile issue - treated increasingly seriously by large employers - since 1986 when it was recognised as an offence under the Sex Discrimination Act. Organisations as diverse as the European Commission, British Telecommunications and Goldman Sachs have made offenders leave following complaints of harassment. Publicity surrounding the issue has encouraged increasing numbers of women - and a handful of men - to complain. Last year the Equal Opportunities Commission received 793 complaints about sexual harassment, 58 per cent up on the previous year. The commission believes this is 'the tip of the iceberg'. Ms Jayne Monkhouse, head of the commission's employment practices unit, said: 'People make a claim of sexual harassment when they are at their wits' end. A lot of women suffer a low level of harassment, such as persistent name calling, pin-ups or pornography on their computers, which they try to put up with.' Surveys suggest that a majority of women suffer some form of sexual harassment at work. When the Industrial Society surveyed 1,727 men and women last year, 45 per cent said they had experienced some form of sexual harassment. Nine out of 10 of the complaints were from women. The commission believes women are most vulnerable where they are in a minority, such as in the fire service or police. They also receive a disproportionate number of complaints from women in small organisations, where managers or owners of the business are often the culprits. Large organisations are taking the issue increasingly seriously. Nearly all public-sector employers and a majority of the largest private-sector employers have policies to deal with sexual harassment. Part of the impetus for these policies is that their existence will provide some protection should the company be taken to an industrial tribunal. Companies are potentially exposed to large claims following the European Court's removal of the Pounds 11,000 ceiling on compensation for sexual discrimination last year. Most company policies are in line with the European Commission code of practice issued three years ago. This recommends that companies put out a clear statement of principle condemning all harassment, train managers to deal with problems, and set up informal and formal avenues for investigating complaints and disciplining culprits. Few UK companies go as far as many US businesses, which sometimes adopt blanket prohibitions on employees touching or dating colleagues. Nonetheless, many companies issue comprehensive guidelines. Midland Bank, for instance, sends staff a three-monthly circular reminding them of the definition of sexual harassment. Its definition of unacceptable behaviour includes 'staring and leering', pin-ups, unsolicited and unwanted gifts, the use of explicit language, unwanted propositions, deliberate body contact, groping and fondling. Complaints at the bank are investigated by staff from an unrelated department. If a preliminary inquiry finds grounds for suspicion, the accused staff member is suspended while a full inquiry takes place. If found guilty, the employee will be dismissed. In practice, implementation of anti-harassment policies does not always live up to the theory. Mr Michael Rubenstein, editor of Equal Opportunities Review, said: 'The big problem now is going from paper to practice.' Problems often arise when companies decide to move one of the employees. Since most cases involve an offender who is senior to the victim, companies are often inclined to transfer the victim. Mr Rubenstein said this would deter people from coming forward. 'If the complainant is punished for the behaviour of the harasser, it may undercut the whole policy.' The attitude of the employer is crucial. Many women still fear that they will be pilloried or ostracised if they complain. The fear of humiliating publicity associated with a tribunal hearing is a strong deterrent to seeking legal redress. In spite of the growing commitment by large employers to tackle the problems, many employees still feel they have no option but to suffer it. The weak state of the job market has worsened the problems, according to Ms Monkhouse. 'People often put up with behaviour when in a more fluid job market they would just walk out.'</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UN chief to visit North Korea Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary general, will visit North Korea later this month when the question of opening the country's suspected nuclear sites to inspection will be raised, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York. A UN official emphasised last night, however, that this was not the purpose of the visit, which was at Pyongyang's invitation. Efforts to obtain North Korean compliance with the terms of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty are being made by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the US.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Indover Bank launches three-year FRN There was a dearth of new eurobond issues yesterday, with bond markets nervous ahead of the US FOMC monetary policy meeting. Syndicate managers said conditions have worsened in recent days, with eurobond spreads over the underlying government bond market widening most markedly in the dollar and sterling sectors. 'The dollar market has recently been underpinned by good retail flows but these have now slowed,' said Mr Tim Skeet, senior vice-president at Kidder Peabody. 'The dollar market is suffering from uncertainty caused by the FOMC, quarter-end considerations and the fact that retail flows out of Switzerland and Benelux countries have slowed, particularly at the long-end of the market,' he said. Attention today is likely to turn to Lebanon's debut eurobond offering of Dollars 300m of three-year fixed-rate notes, increased yesterday from Dollars 150m due to unexpectedly strong demand. The bonds are expected to carry a coupon of around 10 per cent, yielding around 325 to 350 basis points over US government bonds. Indover Bank, a Dutch subsidiary of the Indonesian central bank, launched its first foray into the international capital markets with a Dollars 125m offering of three-year floating-rate notes, offering a spread of 67 1/2 basis points over three-month Libor. Lead manager HSBC Markets said 70 per cent of the bonds were sold into Europe, with the remainder placed in South East Asia. 'This is the bank's first transaction and it was anxious to come into the mainstream of the market, which at the moment is the short-term, floating-rate dollar sector,' it said. The Kingdom of Belgium's DM1bn offering of five-year bonds, which was launched on Monday, was priced yesterday to yield 25 basis points over German government bonds, which some syndicate managers said was expensive. Hongkong International Terminals, a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa, is expected to launch a Dollars 1.74bn offering of 10-year floating-rate notes in the next 10 days. The notes will carry a coupon of Libor plus 85 basis points, with a call option at the end of the fourth year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that as long as  he is prime minister no tax will be imposed on stock market  profits. I opposed such a move in the past, and I still oppose  it, Rabin said. The prime minister reiterated that the stock  market does not reflect the economy, which is growing. The  stock exchange is not a casino but an institute for calculated  investments. Our Tel Aviv economic correspondent Ya'ir Fiedel  reports that Rabin said the economy is generally in excellent  shape, except for certain areas, such as inflation and housing  prices, which require pinpointed treatment. Rabin was addressing  business leaders.</p>

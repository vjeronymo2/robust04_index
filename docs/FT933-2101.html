			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / MPs dispute a Budget 'saving': Ivor Owen says financial debate may be denied to backbenchers THE RIGHT of all backbench MPs to probe and challenge key tax proposals made in the Budget will be removed if new procedures for streamlining debate on the finance bill are adopted. The Commons procedure committee has recommended that the entire committee stage of the bill, when the provisions implementing the Budget proposals are subjected to line-by-line scrutiny, should be handled by a standing committee with a membership of about 50 MPs. The two or three-day committee stage on the floor of the House, in which every backbencher is able to vote if not speak in support of specific amendments, would be abandoned. Earlier this year some Tory backbenchers used this stage to join with opposition MPs in condemning the extension of VAT to domestic fuel. They did so in the knowledge that their protests would be widely reported on television and radio as well as by the press. Such exposure is seldom secured by speeches made in a standing committee. Mr Nick Budgen, Conservative MP for Wolverhampton south west and an outspoken critic of the policies which contributed to inflation reaching 10.9 per cent when Mrs Thatcher stepped down from the premiership, will oppose the change. Mr Budgen said: 'The whole process of the House of Commons being able to protest at financial proposals will be weakened.' Another critic is Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, who believes that the change proposed for the committee stage of the finance bill is a step too far. He insists that 'really important tax issues should be discussed on the floor of the House'. Mr Denzil Davies, a treasury minister in the last Labour government, said the finance bill was usually the most important measure in a parliamentary session and if the procedure committee's proposal were to be adopted it would be 'an extremely retrograde step'. Until 1968 the entire committee stage was dealt with on the floor of the House, with MPs frequently sitting late into the night poring over the details of controversial tax proposals. Critics said that the priority accorded to the committee stage of the bill encouraged filibustering by opposition parties, with the result that complex tax clauses were often dealt with by bleary-eyed MPs at two or three o'clock in the morning. This resulted in frequent complaints that such antics brought the House into disrepute. Splitting the committee stage so that all MPs retained the right to participate in the examination of the most important aspects of the bill, with the less controversial sections dealt with by the restricted numbers serving on a standing committee, has proved a workable compromise. In arguing the case for change the procedure committee claims that the splitting device was no more than a sop to those who regarded the removal of any part of the finance bill from the floor of the House as 'revolutionary'.</p>

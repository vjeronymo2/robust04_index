			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: Tory MPs take focus off Blair's chance to shine Tory backbenchers were accused of engaging in a phased withdrawal from the Commons yesterday when Mr Tony Blair took the leading role in a debate on law and order. It was his first opportunity to star from the Opposition front bench as shadow home secretary since emerging as clear favourite to succeed Mr John Smith as Labour leader. As Mr Blair's most prominent supporters arranged themselves around him in a phalanx designed to ensure favourable exposure on television, government whips seemed intent on ensuring that he had a minimal audience on the Tory back benches. Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall north, complained that the Tory whips were trying to empty the government back benches. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, said she did not know what the Conservative whips were up to. 'As far as I am concerned I am totally riveted on Mr Blair.' Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, also sought to play down the significance of the occasion by deputing Mr Charles Wardle, a junior minister, to reply to Mr Blair. The shadow home secretary renewed his claim that Labour was the only party with an effective policy on law and order by seeking to include crime prevention among the statutory duties of local authorities. Moving a new clause to the police and magistrates' courts bill, he said it would reinforce community policing and had the support of local authorities and senior police bodies. Mr Blair charged the government with trying to impose national objectives and refusing, because of Tory dogma, to allow local needs to take precedence in crime prevention. Mr Wardle said that Mr Blair's speech, far from being a 'landmark contribution' to the law-and-order debate, had consisted of one bland generalisation after another. The minister said that there was no need to impose new statutory duties on local authorities because they were already participating in partnerships to promote crime prevention.</p>

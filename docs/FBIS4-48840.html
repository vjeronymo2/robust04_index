			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Today the RPF [Rwandan  Patriotic Front] combatants captured the important Ruhango trade  center. The Ruhango trade center, which is located in Tambwe  Commune, Ruhango Subprefecture, is the most important  marketplace in the country. Traders from various neighboring  countries like Burundi, Zaire, Tanzania, and Uganda meet each  other there. The Ruhango trade center, which has fallen into  the hands of RPF combatants, is located some 20 km south of the  capital of Gitarama Prefecture, and some 12 km from Buyanza.    The RPF combatants are making progress in their fight  against  the country's enemies to put an end to the massacres of innocent  people.</p>

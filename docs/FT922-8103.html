			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Package tours The notion that last year's collapse of International Leisure Group would stabilise the package holiday market is looking suspect. Prices of early season holidays are already being heavily discounted. Perhaps more revealing, yesterday's figures from the Civil Aviation Authority for the 1991 season showed that tour operators in general remained stubbornly over-optimistic about capacity. Their estimates for this year's volume look the more difficult to attain, not least because pre-election doubts may have caused buyers to delay holiday bookings along with new cars and houses. It also looks as if consumers are less prepared to pay in advance and are booking later, perhaps in the hope that nervous operators will concede price reductions. That will erode the seasonal cash benefit traditionally enjoyed by the tour companies. Admittedly, this year's peak season bookings are reported as healthy at this stage. All the same, the startling rise of Airtours' shares, which outperformed the market by more than 300 per cent last year, is unlikely to be repeated in a hurry. Investors will doubtless be alert for further signs that the package holiday business is reverting to type.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Brothers, our great and militant Palestinian  people, our glorious Arab nation: Serious questions, usually  dodged by Israeli leaders, resurfaced following the heroic  'Afula operation, effected by heroes of the Palestinian  revolution, which left a heroic martyr bomber dead and close to  50 Israelis dead or wounded.    The first question is: Why all the foot dragging and  compromising in putting into practice PLO-Israel agreements  calling for an Israeli withdrawal, deployment of Palestinian  police, and the transfer of power to Palestinian authorities?    The general consensus is that the responsibility [for the  'Afula operation] must be borne by the Israeli Government  because it is letting itself be swayed by extremists, settlers,  and army generals who thrive on war and bloodshed. The result  has been massacres perpetrated against the Palestinian people at  the Ibrahimi Mosque, in Hebron itself, in the Jabalyah camp in  Gaza, and throughout the Palestinian territory where the  Palestinians are being killed at random.    We have been telling the Israelis that violence breeds  violence and that blood [words indistinct] and that they should  honor agreements to which they put their signatures and observe  agreed upon dates. If the Israeli Government had met the 13  December date for implementation of the accord, much of the  chaste blood spilled in Hebron, Gaza, Khan Yunus, Janin,  Tulkarm, and Ramallah would have been spared. However, in  appeasing terror and terrorists in the settler and military  communities, the Israeli Government is turning a deaf ear to the  voice of truth, and the result is a vicious cycle of violence,  suffering, and blood.    Will the 'Afula operation bring the Israeli leadership to  its  senses? Will the Israeli leaders understand that killing  Palestinians cannot but have a price? Will they learn the  lesson that the protection of human life depends on the  establishment of peace rather than [words indistinct] and  procrastination.    It is hoped that acts of violence will give pause to all the  parties and prompt increased determination to reach the kind of  peace that obtains security for all concerned, saves lives on  all sides, and assures Palestinian rights, without which peace  will remain elusive.</p>

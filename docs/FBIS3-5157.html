He was responding to a  question by Asian Airline and Aerospace, a publication produced  during the Asian Aerospace 94 show which ended last week, about  the perceived emergence of an arms race between the three  countries. The minister said that an abrupt or significant U.S.  withdrawal may lead to these countries feeling more insecure or  wanting to fill the vacuum.    According to the International Institute for Strategic  Studies, China has the world's largest armed forces with three  million troops while India has 1.2 million. Compared with these  two giants, Japan's armed forces of 238,000 is miniscule.  "Either way, it will mean that they will build up their military  capabilities," Dr Yeo pointed out. "And if any of them becomes  assertive, the result will be tension and instability in the  region."    He explained that the "restraining presence" of the U.S.  meant that countries need not be as worried about their  potential enemies and can focus their attention and resources on  economic development rather than building up their military  capabilities.    Asked about the region's two hot spots -- the Spratlys and  the Korean Peninsula -- he said that the potential for conflict  in the South China Sea would be greatly increased if oil and gas  were discovered.    "However, so long as the countries involved are willing to  abide by internationally accepted codes of conduct in resolving  this territorial dispute, it was less likely that there will be  open conflict in the region," he said.    On tension in the Korean Peninsula, he commented that an  arms  race could be triggered off in north-east Asia if Pyongyang  developed a nuclear bomb. "Japan could feel so threatened that  it proceeds to develop a nuclear capacity of its own," he said.  Such a turn of events would in turn prompt China and the two  Koreas to accelerate their military build-up. "An arms race in  northeast Asia will create tensions that could destabilise the  entire Asia-Pacific," he noted.    The minister said that because of the uncertainty in the  region in the post-Cold War era, "security is something we  cannot take for granted". He said: "Singapore believes that the  best means to maintain peace and stability is to develop an  understanding among the countries here as well as those  countries which can make an impact on our security, such as the  U.S., China, Russia, Australia and Japan."    This was why the Republic strongly supported the Asean  Regional Forum (ARF) which provides the framework for  multilateral discussions of security issues on a regular basis.  It would also enhance the close defence relations and  cooperation which had been built up over the years, he said.    Touching on Singapore's role in the discussions of security  issues on a collective basis, he said that being small, it could  not influence the course of events. "But by acting together with  other Asean countries, we have a role to play in cooling down  any potential conflict which may arise in the region."</p>

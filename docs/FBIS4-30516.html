			<p>BFN     [Text] Port Vila, June 28 (AFP) -- Vanuatu will maintain a  ban on log exports and cut back licences for foreign companies  operating on the timber-rich island of Erromono Prime Minister  Maxime Carlot said Tuesday.    "If you added all the logging quotas allowed so far, this  would mean that in no time, Erromango would become a desert",  Carlot told AFP in an interview.    He said his government would risk legal action for breach of  contract over the ban, imposed on June 20 because of mounting  concern about exploitation of Vanuatu's natural resources by  foreign companies.    European Union member countries represented here officially  expressed concern to Carlot over logging in the island state  last May.    An estimated 8,000 cubic meters (10,400 cubic yards) of logs  is stockpiled at the Erromango port of Ipota after a ship from  Hong Kong was forced to leave the island state's capital Port  Vila without its cargo.    Carlot denied any official protest had been received from  the  companies. But said he had suggested to them that they bring  the facilities to mill the logs here. "If they did that, they  would gain in the long run", he said.    He met officials from the logging companies currently  licensed to operate on the southern Vanuatu island, two from  Malaysia, one Chinese and a Malaysia-Vanuatu joint-venture.    "At one stage, quite a few ministers came to tell me that  such and such a company was bad and that this other one was good  and now, there are four companies licensed to operate on  Erromango and export the unprocessed logs."    Carlot said according to new government policy guidelines,  Malaysian company Parklane, forced last week to suspend  operations, would be allowed to log 15,000 cubic meters a year.  Two others, Pacific Veneers and Erro Lumber, would be allowed  5,000 cubic metres each.    The Chinese-based Kingwood company would be denied the right  to log on Erromango and would have to negotiate on another  island.    "I know some companies won't be happy and will put the  pressure on us to obtain what they want," said Carlot.    "But as long as I'll be here, they won't get their way. By  doing this, I think I'm protecting the future generations."</p>

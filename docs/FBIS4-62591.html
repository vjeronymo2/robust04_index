			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Russian Army Once Again Arrives </F> in Caucasus. First in Abkhazia, Then in Karabakh and  Azerbaijan"]    [Text] Over the next few days around 5,000 Russian  soldiers and officers from Leningrad Military District's 45th  Motorized Rifle Division, the Volga District's 27th Motorized  Rifle Division, and units stationed in the Moscow area will fly  out to the Transcaucasus on a peacemaking mission in order to  take up combat positions along the contact line between the  Georgian and Abkhazian troops and the Nagorno-Karabakh and  Azerbaijani troops. Your IZVESTIYA correspondent learned of  this from a well informed Russian Defense Ministry source.    Bearing in mind the fact that there are already around  25,000  troops at Russia's military bases in Georgia and Armenia and on  Abkhazian territory, the total grouping will be fairly  impressive although it will not exceed the limits laid down by  the treaty on reducing conventional arms.    Furthermore, 2,500-3,000 Russian "blue helmets" may turn up  in Abkhazia far sooner than they fly to Azerbaijan. Agreement  was reached to that effect during the Abkhazian-Georgian talks  in Moscow 14 May. The draft of the relevant directive is  already on the Russian president's desk and, although the  Georgian parliament's negative reaction to this agreement is  well known -- some deputies in Tbilisi even described it as  "total capitulation" -- Eduard Shevardnadze's support for it is  assured and the document is expected to be signed any day now.    The Russian troops are to be stationed along the Inguri  River  on the Abkhazian side and also in Galskiy Rayon and the Kodor  Gorge. Many experts believe that this is the only means of first  stopping the bloodshed in this area and creating the conditions  for the return of refugees, who, according to various sources,  number over 250,000.    The talks held at the Russian Defense Ministry on the eve of  the publication of this edition of the newspaper involving the  leaders of the Russian, Azerbaijani, Armenian, and  Nagorno-Karabakh military departments were also filled with  concern to stop the bloodshed. They were headed by Army General  Pavel Grachev. As in recent years, the "older brother" had a  tough, exacting discussion with his "foolish younger brothers,"  sometimes resorting to ultimatums. He even made a threat:  Unless the sides agree right now on a cease-fire and fulfill  the protocol signed 18 February, they can clear off home.    The "younger brothers" agreed submissively. The Azerbaijani  minister's feeble attempt to link disengagement with the  immediate liberation of the occupied territories was cut short  by Grachev's remark that this point is already been enshrined in  the February protocol and it is the military's task to resolve  not political issues but issues within their direct purview.    The military decided on a cease-fire as of 0000 hours on 17  May and also agreed to determine the lines of disengagement  between the warring forces and their materiel prior to 24 May;  moreover, the Russian minister indicated this line in advance --  the distance from the contact line was agreed at a symmetrical  5-10 km. In some cases, where the neutral zone passes through  population centers, the disengagement will be asymmetrical, the  aim being to protect the interests of the population still  living in these areas and not create fresh floods of refugees.  Gen. Grachev said: "There will be no refugees wherever my  soldiers are. I give you my guarantee of that."    Following the disengagement of the warring parties' forces  and materiel 1,800 CIS soldiers and officers will be brought  into the security zone. "The CIS is Russia," Grachev said. In  addition, Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, leader of Russia's  peacemaking forces and Grachev's deputy, will be given a  reinforced motorized rifle battalion to respond immediately to  any truce violators. Forty-nine well armed observation posts,  including infantry fighting vehicles and tanks, will be set up  along the border between the warring sides with the task of  keeping the peace.    The Azerbaijani side's request for the Russian peacemakers  to  include CSCE observers won unconditional support, but it was  agreed not to wait for them. The cost of each day of bloodshed  is all too great. All parties pledged to pay for the Russian  troops' presence in the conflict zone. Azerbaijan, Armenia, and  Nagorno-Karabakh each pledged to pay 33 percent of all  expenditure, while Russia was allocated 1 percent, although  everyone realized that you can hardly wait for money from anyone  and Russia will have to pay for everything.    Needless to say, the protocol on the introduction of troops  into the Azerbaijani-Karabakh conflict zone, like the agreement  to station Russian soldiers between the warring sides in Georgia  and Abkhazia, does not resolve all the problems. Moreover, they  even exacerbate them: The United Nations has not given Russia a  peacemaking mandate for its army, the consent of the parliaments  of the states involved in the conflict has not been secured, the  Russian troops' presence on the territory of sovereign countries  has no legal status, the presence of observation posts alone is  still no guarantee of peace and tranquillity in the region --  there are all too many weapons there and all too many people  have gotten accustomed to feeding themselves not by working but  by war and looting -- but.... There is hope of an end to the  large-scale bloodshed, an end to the wars in the Caucasus --  incidentally these wars have been going on for 130 years now,  and that is quite some time.    The war-weary peoples of the Transcaucasus are still relying  on Russia and its army. Politicians must not kill that faith.</p>

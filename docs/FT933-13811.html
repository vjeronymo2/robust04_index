			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / German businessmen look for backing from Russian premier: Energy ventures await political support from Moscow THE GERMAN business community yesterday called on Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, to give top level political support to three industrial joint ventures in Russia designed to modernise the republic's energy infrastructure and bring in hard currency. Meeting the Russian prime minister on the second day of his three-day visit to Germany, the eastern trade committee of the German industry federation, the BDI, said all three projects were ready to go ahead if financing could be assured on the Russian side. 'The Russians tell us they want more investment. Now it is up to them to deliver the necessary conditions for the investments to proceed,' said Mr Victor Vogt, head of the foreign trade department at the Cologne chamber of commerce and industry. The largest project is a joint venture between Ruhrgas, Germany's largest gas importer, and Purneftegaz, the gas producer in western Siberia. The 25-year venture plans to extract 6bn cubic metres of gas from the Siberian oil fields each year. Ruhrgas, which has been negotiating with its Russian partners for more than a year, says the additional energy produced by the joint venture would provide Russia with a steady flow of hard currency. This could be used to repay debts incurred on the Russian side. The project requires an initial investment of Dollars 1bn. Other projects include the installation of gas turbines at at St Petersburg power station by the German subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Scandinavian power equipment group. Siemens, the German energy and engineering group, is also negotiating the possibility of modernising a conventional power station in Konakova under a contract worth DM120m (Dollars 70m). German businessmen also called on the Russian delegation to clarify the legal and financial framework for joint ventures in Russia. Top priorities include the need to define clearly who on the Russian side - the company, the regional authorities or the central government - has the real decision-making power. Worries were also voiced concerning the DM2bn owed to German enterprises over the past two years which are not covered by state guarantees. The German government has set its Hermes export guarantees at DM5bn and has, on a project basis, allocated up to DM4bn of guarantees this year to east German companies. But economics ministry officials say the government is unwilling to extend such credit guarantees to west German concerns. The Russian side has repeatedly called on Bonn to include west German companies which are key participants in the energy sector.</p>

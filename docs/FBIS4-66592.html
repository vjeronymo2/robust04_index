			<p>CSO     [Text] President Bill Clinton's recent remarks on human  rights in Kashmir violate all diplomatic norms and India is  perfectly justified in reacting angrily, a former American  Ambassador to India, Mr William Clark, has said.    The Clinton Administration has indeed changed the neutral  policies on Kashmir pursued by both Democratic and Republican  Administrations for several years, he said at a briefing on the  India chair and his upcoming Indian visit at the Foreign Press  Centre of the United States Information Agency (USIA) in  Washington.    Mr Clark is leaving for India on Sunday and hopes to be able  to meet the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, the Finance  Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, and leaders of industry to mobilize  moral and material support for the Japan chair at the Centre for  Strategic and International Studies where he holds the Japan  chair and is a senior adviser on Asia.    Mr Clark who improved Indo-American relations, sees his work  being undone by the Clinton Administration, conceded that U.S.  "interest in India has over time in Washington not been  proportionate to its size."    "It has been very hard to keep India on the scope and it is  very hard to do that today. The majority of articles that appear  in the American press deal with Kashmir, Punjab--though that has  fallen out--or the less positive aspects of society," he said.    On Mr Clinton's mistakes over Kashmir, Mr Clark said that  during his confirmation hearings, he had emphasised the Shimla  agreement. "I still think that it is the right way to do it. I  won't talk about this Administration's handling of it but it has  a slightly different approach."    Mr Clark, the U.S. Envoy to New Delhi from 1989 to 1992,  thought that part of the reason for the deterioration in  Indo-U.S. relations was the long delay in nominating an  Ambassador to India.    Analysing why the Clinton Administration's India policy  appears to have taken a turn for the worse, Mr Clark said: "This  President clearly wants to be a domestic President, who tries to  limit his foreign policy time as much as he can. He is driven by  Bosnia and Somalia and other things. It is not surprising that  India does not necessarily get up that high in (Mr Clinton's)  thought."    Referring to the new Pakistani Envoy to the United States,  Ms Maleeha Lodhi's speech raking up Kashmir while presenting her  credentials, he said it was ""unprofessional," although he  added, "but then Lodhi is not a professional and so I cannot  blame her."    President Clinton had backed Ms Lodhi, saying, "We share  Pakistan's concerns about human rights abuses in Kashmir."    Mr Clark has no clue as to what might have prompted Mr  Clinton's remark. "I cannot explain that one. You should ask the  White House," he replied to a query.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> CITY BUDGET REFLECTS FINANCIAL STRENGTH  </P> <P> The city adopted its first-ever budget last week, getting off to a healthy  start with anticipated 1990-91 revenues of $14.2 million.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel, the county's 29th city and one of its wealthiest, was formed by  a landslide vote last November. The first budget calls for expenditures of  $13.7 million.  </P> <P> The budget includes items that reflect Laguna Niguel's inauguration into  cityhood: a $400,000 transitional fee to the county, entry signs to the city  and new furniture and supplies.  </P> <P> Most cities wouldn't envy those expenses. However, the city also boasts a  burgeoning population and commercial community. The population of what is now  the city has swollen from 9,000 to 45,000 since 1977, according to Councilman  James F. Krembas.  </P> <P> Property taxes will be the single biggest contributor to the budget, accounting  for 21% of the city's revenues, or $4.7 million. Sales taxes will contribute  $2.2 million, or 10% of the revenues.  </P> <P> Included is $3.4 million owed the Sheriff's Department under contract with the  city for police services, said Dennis Miura, city finance director. But those  services were to be assumed by the city as of Sunday, "and we actually have to  pay for (them) out of the revenues we generate," Miura said.  </P> <P> Over the last seven months, the city contracted with the county for building  and safety inspections, engineering and planning services, and police and fire  protection, Miura said. In its budget, Laguna Niguel reimburses the county  $400,000 for those services, in keeping with its agreement with the county  Local Agency Formation Commission.  </P> <P> Other one-time expenses include $150,000 for transition liability insurance;  $300,000 for the city's preparation of its General Plan, a blueprint for  commercial and residential construction; $250,000 for a Crown Valley Community  Park Master Plan, and other money to buy computer equipment.  </P> <P> Capital improvement plans call for various road projects, including repaving  Camino Capistrano at a cost of $264,000. The city will spend an estimated  $500,000 on other road projects.  </P> <P> Also, the city plans to spend nearly $900,000 on parks and recreation projects,  including $416,700 on playground equipment, ball field and other improvements  at neighborhood parks, and $35,000 for an expansion of the Crown Valley  Community Park Amphitheatre.

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (9): Financiers with the highest profile - The rise of Fay, Richwhite MERCHANT bankers Sir Michael Fay and David Richwhite are symbols of the successes of the economic reforms launched under the Labour government from 1984. Their company Fay, Richwhite has been at the centre of much of the state asset sales either as adviser, facilitator or financier. They have been involved in many corporate mergers and takeovers. Last week they agreed to sell their 27 per cent holding in Bank of New Zealand, which has been acquired by National Australia Bank. Fay, Richwhite has a vigorous, fast-growing operation in Australia and is also represented in money market operations in Britain, the centre of its European operations. In New Zealand's list of wealthy people, the two regularly feature near the top. And Sir Michael has become something of a national folk hero through his dogged attempts to win the America's Cup: twice on the water and once through a special challenge and ensuing protracted court actions in New York. The two have been partners since 1975, and both are 43. Sir Michael, a lawyer, met Mr Richwhite in the early 1970s when both worked for a pioneering merchant bank, Securitibank. The pair have a reputation for good timing: both resigned to set up their own business well before Securitibank's collapse in December 1976. Only once have they been caught out: when they rushed to buy the stake in the Bank of New Zealand in 1989. The bank later discovered it had massive bad debts totalling NZDollars 1.4bn in Australia, and Mr Richwhite has said they failed to do their homework properly. Early days for the partnership were difficult: the two operated from a tiny office and experimented with property speculation, financing restaurants and films. However they prospered from the early 1980s when controls were put on interest rates as part of a freeze. As early supporters of the Labour government of Mr David Lange and Sir Roger Douglas, they helped set in motion the reforms of the Rogernomics years, and are quick to say they made a fortune out of being the first, and for a time the only, players in the Euro-Kiwi financial markets which took advantage of the lifting on controls on currency and investment. Their company took an active role in advising the government on possible asset sales. They handled the biggest sale of all, Telecom, to Bell Atlantic and Ameritech for NZDollars 4.2bn in 1989, also being responsible for Telecom's international public float last year. Both men are now seen as key figures in the Auckland establishment. They are personally charming: attributes which have helped them rise to the top of acceptability from running what was considered a fringe operation in a remarkably short period of time. Sir Michael has the high profile: Mr Richwhite is cast as the backroom boy who makes sure the company and all its deals run smoothly. Fay, Richwhite is New Zealand's most prominent financing organisation, and appears determined to stay that way.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TVS shows interest in TV arm of Carlton TVS Entertainment has expressed an interest in Zenith, the independent television production company controlled by Carlton Communications. TVS, which lost its south of England franchise in last year's competitive tenders, is in the midst of deciding what its role should be when its franchise runs out in December. One option is to buy a number of stakes in production and facilities companies, another is to sell all its assets. Ironically the 1990 Broadcasting Act which brought TVS to its knees is also the reason why a large stake in Zenith is up for sale. Under the Act, broadcasters can own no more than 15 per cent of an independent production company if it is to retain its independent status. The status is commercially important because all of Britain's broadcasters have to commission at least 25 per cent of their output from independent producers.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading LONDON derivatives traders were once again caught out by the strength of US shares and by the close of trading there were signs of a squeeze developing in the cash and futures markets. June FT-SE futures got off to a strong start as locals who had carried a short position overnight were forced to cover their books following the large gains in the previous session on Wall Street. But doubts about the ability of US shares to continue to rally prompted a setback in futures, which traded for much of the morning below the 30 point fair value premium to the spot index. Instead, it was the cash market which led the way, absorbing the selling pressure and moved towards its all-time high. A squeeze developed in the futures market just before the close, which gave a boost to the stock market. June FT-SE contract closed at 2,582, up 33 points on the day, while its premium to the spot index expanded to 39 points against 30 the previous day. Glaxo options were actively traded as one broker crossed a large block of June 700 calls. But options specialists were surprised by the 7,474 lot turnover, equivalent to 7.4m shares and double activity in the underlying securities. Hanson August 240 calls and Grand Met April calls were also busy.</p>

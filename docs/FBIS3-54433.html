In talks with officials in Tabriz on 16 January,  Geydarov said he regretted the Islamic countries' indifference  to the effort by Islamic peoples to solve their problems and  said that all Islamic peoples must make a concerted effort to  solve the existing problems. He asserted: Some 20 percent of  Azerbaijan's territory is occupied by Armenia. Some 1 million  people in Azerbaijan, which has a population of 7 million, have  lost their homes and property. They are living as refugees  right now.    Geydarov thanked the Islamic Republic of Iran for its  humanitarian aid to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic [NAR].    NAR University President Gasanov has said his university is  prepared to establish a new college for religious studies and  teaching Persian language and literature with the help of  Iranian lecturers. Gasanov arrived in Iran together with  Geydarov to participate in the seminary conference on  development in the Caucasus and Central Asia. In a statement to  our correspondent in Tabriz on Sunday [16 January], Gasanov  stressed the need to improve scientific and cultural cooperation  between the NAR and the Islamic Republic of Iran.    During his 24-hour visit to Tabriz, Gasanov held talks with  the officials of the State University on the exchange of  students and lecturers.</p>

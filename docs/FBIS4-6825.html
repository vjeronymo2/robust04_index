			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- North Korea celebrates  the 62nd anniversary of the founding of its armed forces on  Monday, April 25.    The reclusive communist state founded the regular "Korean  People's Army" on Feb. 8, 1948, and formerly observed this date  as Armed Forces Day until 1978, when it opted for April 25 on  the ground that it was on April 25, 1932, that Kim Il-song  organized and became the first commander of the irregular  "Korean People's Revolutionary Army."    The change was intended to date the origin of the regular  Korean People's Army back to the irregular guerrillas during the  days of Japanese rule, which has a great bearing on North  Korea's military strategy today.    By ascribing the regular army to the irregular troops that  waged guerrilla warfare against Japan in the 1930s, North Korea  attaches importance to the art of unconventional warfare in its  military strategy. This strategy calls for forming a second  front in the rear area of South Korea by infiltrating guerrilla  troops for a mix of regular and irregular warfare to turn the  whole of South Korea into a huge battleground.    North Korea's Armed Forces should thus be viewed as an  important instrument of its strategy to communize South Korea by  force for eventual reunification, analysts say. The strategy's  objective is communist reunification of Korea, and to achieve  this aim North Korea is pursuing "the four great military lines"  while strengthening "the three great revolutionary  capabilities." The four great military lines are guidelines of  action for the military based on the chuche (self-reliance)  ideology.    North Korea has developed its military strategy with a mix  of  the Chinese people's warfare strategy, the former Soviet Union's  modern warfare strategy and the lessons of the Korean,  Vietnamese and Persian Gulf conflicts. Based on the concept of  offensive war, the strategy calls for sweeping the whole of  South Korea in a blitzkrieg action or invading the Seoul area in  a limited but lightning-quick war.    For this purpose, North Korea maintains mechanized and  mobile  troops, as well as special troops [to] infiltrate South Korea's  rear area. It has also dug tunnels across the Demilitarized  Zone as infiltration avenues.    North Korea's defense structure is patterned after those of  the former Soviet Union and China, and the Ministry of Armed  Forces is not a part of the Administrative Council (cabinet) but  under the direct control of the Workers' (communist) Party  Central Military Commission and the National Defense Committee  -- unlike cabinet ministries. And the chief of General Staff is  directly responsible to the Armed Forces minister and controls  the three branches of the Army, Navy and Air Force.    Kim Chong-il, son and heir-apparent of President Kim  Il-song,  became the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army in  February 1991, a marshal in April 1992 and chairman of the  National Defense Committee in April 1993, taking a firm grip on  the Armed Forces. The Army has 16 corps, in addition to tank and  special force commands.    According to NAEWOE press, the official North Korea watcher  here, the North Korean Army has 3,700 tanks, 2,500 armored  personnel carriers and 9,800 artillery pieces, in addition to  12,000 anti-aircraft guns.    Batteries of 240mm multiple rocket-launching systems are  intensively deployed along the Western part of the front line.  Each of these systems can launch 24 rounds of ammunition at a  target as far as 24 kilometers, and Patriot missiles are  reportedly not effective against this rapid-fire artillery.    North Korea's missile capabilities include AT-3/4 anti-tank  missiles and improved scud missiles.    The special troops of North Korea number 100,000, including  20,000 paratroopers and special marines.    The North Korean Navy has some 700 ships, including 26  submarines. It recently began improving its fleet of  submarines, missile ships and torpedo boats.    The North Korean Air Force boasts 1,600 aircraft, including  60 MiG-23 and MiG-29 fighters.    North Korea's nuclear capability includes a 4,000-kw  experimental reactor imported from the former Soviet Union in  1965, a 3,000-kw reactor completed recently and a 200,000-kw  reactor under construction.    In the 1960s, Pyongyang began developing its chemical and  biological warfare capabilities. Today, it is known to have gas  and germ weapons. North Korea has also developed a device  capable of delivering these horrible weapons to targets in South  Korea.    North Korea is said to be capable of producing 100 improved  Scud-B missiles with a range of 500 kilometers annually for  export to Iran and other countries. Now, it is reportedly  developing a new model with a range of 1,000 kilometers, known  as the Nodong-1.    Noteworthy is that North Korea deploys 65 percent of its  ground forces, 60 percent of its ships and 40 percent of its Air  Force below the line drawn between Pyongyang and Wonsan, a  position close enough to the Demilitarized Zone for the North  Koreans to launch a blitzkieg on South Korea whenever they want.</p>

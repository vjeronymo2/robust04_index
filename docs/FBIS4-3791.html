			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Red Cross officials leave Beijing today after  failing to reach agreement with China over access to prisons.  There had been some expectation that China would make  concessions ahead of the United States decision on the renewal  of trade benefits in June. However, Angelo Gnadinger, who headed  the Red Cross delegation of three, said last night there  remained "more to be done". "We have not finished all the work.  We are just in the midst of it," he said.    Three meetings were held during the week with Chinese  officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. China gave no  indications when another meeting might be held, but did not rule  out further talks in May, Gnadinger said.    Sources at the Red Cross had thought that China might seek a  "quick solution" in light of the U.S. decision on renewing Most  Favoured Nation (MFN) status in June. China is understood to  want to limit the definition of prisoners to those convicted of  crimes, a sticking point with the Red Cross, which seeks to  visit "all detainees".    Improving conditions for prisoners "such as allowing access  to prisons by international humanitarian and human rights  organisations" is one condition of Bill Clinton's presidential  executive order governing the renewal of MFN.</p>

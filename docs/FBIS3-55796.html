The event could be  considered an exception since previously not a single former  Soviet republic had succeeded in getting Russia to assign it  cash.    The Russian Goskomsotrudnichestvo [State Committee for  Cooperation with Commonwealth Members] confirmed that cash worth  30 billion rubles [R] had been imported into Tajikistan and that  intergovernment agreements between the two countries have  stipulated a sum of R60 billion.    Actually all leading workers at the Goskomsotrudnichestvo  with whom we talked were very reluctant to provide information  and asked not to be named. This behavior is entirely  understandable since we can now expect a sharply negative  response from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, and some other  countries of nearby foreign parts which have sought but have not  gotten the same favor from Russia.    Why has an exception been made for Tajikistan? One deputy  chairman of the Goskomsotrudnichestvo called this a "big  exception" made "by force of circumstances." It is not hard to  guess what these circumstances are -- the complete collapse of  the Tajik economy, the continuing war on its borders, and  Russia's interests in this region.    On the other hand it is wrong to suppose that Tajikistan has  now fully entered the ruble zone and has joined its money area  with Russia. Yet this view does exist among Tajik leaders. But  the rubles were not supplied for nothing but as a state credit.  And on the same terms which have been set for other republics  and primarily the transfer of gold and currency reserves to  Russia. It is true that there are not so many of these reserves  in Russia so the agreement stipulates that the supply of cash be  compensated largely through the mortgage of property. But from  talks with Goskomsotrudnichestvo staffers it could be understood  that the specific establishments to be mortgaged have not yet  been determined.    In addition the credit has been supplied for six months,  during which period Tajikistan must fulfill all terms for really  entering the ruble zone. And these terms provide for the  complete subordination of the national bank to the Central Bank  of Russia, the coordination of tax, customs, and budget policy,  and the implementation of economic reforms. If the Tajik  leaders manage to do all this within six months then they are  relieved of their obligation to service the credit provided to  them. Otherwise they will pay in full.</p>

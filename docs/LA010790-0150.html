			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> BRADLEY ADOPTING NEW STANCE ON GROWTH;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE MAYOR, HERETOFORE STRONGLY PRO-DEVELOPMENT, VOICES OPPOSITION  TO TWO HUGE PROJECTS.  </P> <P> For years a champion of powerful real estate developers, Los Angeles Mayor Tom  Bradley twice in the last month has spoken out against big developments,  inviting the question of how much he is willing to break with the past as he  struggles to regain the public's good will.  </P> <P> Last week Bradley urged the city attorney to join a homeowners' lawsuit  opposing a planned 875,000-square-foot commercial project at the Santa Monica  Airport. Last month, he moved to scale down the huge Porter Ranch project  proposed for the West San Fernando Valley by Nathan Shapell, a developer who  has contributed more than $40,000 to Bradley over the last five years.  </P> <P> With the City Council frequently acquiescing in developers' plans, the  development issue gives Bradley a chance to seize the political initiative at a  time when he badly needs to reassert his leadership -- after a year in which  the mayor spent much of his time answering charges of unethical behavior.  </P> <P> Bradley's aides say the mayor's recent positions -- each delivered with no  small amount of public relations fanfare -- should be seen as a signal that the  mayor is prepared to take a more aggressive stand against some development.  </P> <P> "If it means intervening in the case of an individual project, the mayor is  capable of doing it and willing to do it," said Mark Fabiani, Bradley's new  chief of staff. "When he stands up with a homeowners' group or publicizes a  lawsuit he supports, he can have a unique impact on public policy."  </P> <P> So far, however, the mayor's actions have aroused more skepticism than optimism  among veterans of the neighborhood battles over growth -- confrontations that  often have seen Bradley using his influence on behalf of developers.  </P> <P> "The mayor is taking a lot of heat for his various improprieties. So, he's  jumping in on the side of the citizens, saying, 'Look at what a good guy I am!'  But he's not coming to grips with the problems," said Gordon Murley, president  of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., the largest organization of  homeowner groups in the city.  </P> <P> Other critics of the mayor point out that, although he opposed development in  Santa Monica, he remained silent about a major project in his own back yard, a  massive office complex just west of the Harbor Freeway that the City Council  approved in December over strenuous objections of the city planning staff.  </P> <P> The critics also point out that despite his reservations about Porter Ranch,  Bradley never objected to the size of the mammoth project.  </P> <P> A true indication of the mayor's resolve, they say, will be whether Bradley  chooses to contest controversial projects in the city's Fairfax District and on  the western edge of the expanding downtown.  </P> <P> There, proposed developments pose a formidable challenge to streets, sewers and  air quality that are already severely overtaxed. Moreover, they are sectors of  the city represented by influential council members, who could make life  miserable for Bradley by harping on questions of financial propriety that the  mayor is trying to put behind him.  </P> <P> "The mayor doesn't have the luxury to antagonize the people who have been more  than fair to him during the past year," said one member of the council, who  asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> Although many slow-growth activists dismiss the mayor's recent conduct as  political posturing, he is managing to kindle some expectations.  </P> <P> "We were real pleased that the mayor came out in opposition to Porter Ranch.  Likewise in Santa Monica," said Diana Plotkin, a leader of a neighborhood  campaign against two proposed commercial centers near Farmers Market in the  Fairfax District. "We want to believe that Bradley will be ready to get just as  tough closer to home."  </P> <P> Plotkin's neighborhood has been a hotbed of homeowner activism for several  years, and the expected showdown over the Farmers Market development could turn  out to be one of the most bitter anti-growth struggles in years. The developers  envision 3 million to 4 million square feet of offices, stores and residences  in the heart of one of the city's densest and most-traveled neighborhoods. The  opponents have retained a staff of consultants, including a lawyer, a geologist  and a traffic consultant, and are girding for a lengthy legal battle.  </P> <P> "If we have to file a lawsuit against the city, we will do it," Plotkin said.  </P> <P> Intervention by Bradley could pit him against Council President John Ferraro,  who represents the Fairfax District. Ferraro is an old political opponent of  Bradley who has emerged over the years as one of the city's most durable  politicians.  </P> <P> "Can we expect to see the mayor take on a regional commercial center in John  Ferraro's back yard?" asked one member of the council. "Don't bet on it."  </P> <P> Jane Blumenfeld, Bradley's deputy in charge of city planning policy, said the  mayor will be taking a hard look at the proposals affecting the Farmers Market  neighborhood, as well as additional developments proposed near Los Angeles  International Airport and for downtown west of the Harbor Freeway.  </P> <P> Blumenfeld's presence in the mayor's office, more than any other single factor,  explains the optimism that some slow-growth advocates are feeling these days  about Bradley's policies toward development.  </P> <P> During the 18 months she has been in office, Blumenfeld has been the chief  architect of a series of initiatives aimed at achieving air quality  improvement, reduced traffic congestion and better design of new commercial  buildings.  </P> <P> Moreover, Blumenfeld was the author of Bradley's 10-point critique of the  Porter Ranch project, which argued that its spread-out design and separation of  homes, stores and offices would lead to excessive dependence on the automobile.  </P> <P> Critics of the mayor's intervention with Porter Ranch say the agreement he  ultimately reached with Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area where  the ranch is planned, failed to address the greatest risk posed by the  development -- the threat of flooding caused by overbuilding in hilly terrain.  </P> <P> "The mayor got into it too late and never consulted with the people who were  most concerned," said Murley of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns.  </P> <P> "All Bradley did was make an enemy of Bernson, and then realizing the  foolishness of that, tried to patch it over with a compromise that no one  liked," said a confidential City Hall source close to the negotiations between  Bernson and Bradley.  </P> <P> Blumenfeld and Fabiani conceded that the mayor's office became involved "too  late in the process" at Porter Ranch, but they defended the outcome of the  mayor's intervention. As a result of the Bradley-Bernson compromise, 18% of the  nearly 4,000 housing units to be built will be set aside for poor people and  traffic will be limited through a 25% reduction in parking available at a  planned office complex.  </P> <P> In the future, Fabiani said, the mayor will get involved earlier in projects  and try to persuade a majority of the council to back him.  </P></p>

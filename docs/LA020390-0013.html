			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : FROM FILMS TO CONCERTS  </P> <P> Olivia Barash is probably best known to audiences from her role as Emilio  Estevez's UFO-nut girlfriend in the perpetually rented cult-film favorite "Repo  Man" (in which she uttered the "Casablanca"-like immortal closing words, "I'm  glad I tortured you!"). It was a somewhat sexy role, but one contrived to make  her seem even more girlish and certainly more naive than her age at the time,  which was a young 18.  </P> <P> Now, on hiatus from acting and fronting a band called 13th Step five years  later, Barash is a regular on the local rock club circuit.  </P> <P> "I always play younger" in the movies, she says, but on the concert stage she  seems to be playing much older, much more world-wise -- exuding the betrayed  fury of a Melissa Etheridge, but with a tougher, meatier musical edge.  </P> <P> "People who come knowing me as an actress probably don't expect that it's going  to be as moving an experience," says Barash, "because a lot of the actresses  who sing do the disco kind of songs that are written for them. And this stuff  really comes from the heart and soul and gut.  </P> <P> "I consider myself a musician first. This sounds really corny, but I think it's  my calling. But there's this taboo about being an actress and a singer, and  since I had films out before my music is out in front of the public, I'm gonna  have to really prove that I'm gonna knock their socks off as a musician."  </P> <P> Still, if being an actress is a slight liability to one's legitimate rock rep,  having been in "Repo Man" isn't: "The people that are into that movie are  people that would be into our music."  </P> <P> Barash's next film role (her first since playing an SLA member in Paul  Schrader's "Patty Hearst") will be a cameo as a Sunset Strip folk singer in the  Oliver Stone's upcoming "The Doors."  </P> <P> But right now acting remains secondary to 13th Step. The guitar-based quartet  has finished a six-song EP to be released in April; the live schedule includes  stops tonight at Al's Bar, Wednesday at Club Lingerie and frequent appearances  at the Coconut Teaszer.

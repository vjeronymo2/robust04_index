			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian Association for Human Rights today  appealed to the amir of the State of Kuwait for an immediate  pardon to 10 Palestinian students who were sentenced to death by  the Kuwait State Security Court on 12 June last year.    The association requests the amir of Kuwait to respond to  the  appeal of the families and kinfolk of those sentenced to pardon  their sons during these holy months and on the occasion of the  blessed 'Id al-Adha.    It is worth mentioning that the appeal court will issue its  ruling about the sentences against the students on 30 May in  response to the appeal submitted by the convicted students.</p>

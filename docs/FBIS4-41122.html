			<p>BFN     [Text] Over the past two years, about 15,000 officers have  been discharged from the Belarusian Armed Forces. These were  basically individuals entitled to pensions or those who did not  wish to continue their service. At the same, the number of  officers who were born in Belarus has noticeably increased.  While such officers used to represent 16 percent of all  personnel in the Belarusian Armed Fores, this ratio has risen to  47 percent today. It is estimated that with new graduates from  the military schools joining the Armed Forces, this number will  climb to 53-55 percent. In as little as one year, Belarus-born  servicemen will account for 65 percent of the Belarusian Army,  RID agency reported.</p>

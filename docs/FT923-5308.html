			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / A US policy on Iraq that excludes nothing: Bush's tougher stance may have consequences for all concerned THE possibility of renewed US air strikes against Iraq will remain high  - at least until voters pass judgment on President George Bush in early November - but the impact of the latest development in American Middle East policy seems certain to trouble whoever occupies the White House well beyond next year. By creating an air exclusion zone over southern Iraq, Mr Bush has led the US a step deeper into the quagmire he sought so hard to avoid by limiting the Gulf war to the expulsion of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. Saudi Arabia has had to accept an active American military presence for the foreseeable future, something both sides wanted to avoid. The alliance created to win the Gulf war victory can no longer stand the strain of public examination, as has been made clear by the questionable insistence of its leading members that United Nations Security Council resolutions cover the present military action. And by providing protection for two thirds of the Iraqi population, the US, Britain and France must take a greater responsibility for that country's political evolution. For obvious political reasons, Mr Bush has chosen to present this latest military action as essentially humanitarian: to protect the Shia population of southern Iraq against further suffering at the hands of President Saddam Hussein. To have suggested that the primary target is the removal of the Iraqi leader could but cast doubts on his overall Gulf war strategy at an electorally sensitive moment. Less than 18 months ago, the Shias of southern Iraq were deemed of far less consequence to the western-led alliance than the Kurds in the north, even though their treatment at the hands of Baghdad was equally repugnant. Now, the Bush administration has persuaded itself that not only are the Iraqi Shias worthy of protection but that they care little for their co-religionists in Iran and that Tehran stands faint chance of drawing them into its sphere of influence. It is a bold shift of attitude for a government whose priority throughout the last decade was to contain Iran and its export of militant Islamic fundamentalism, even to the extent of lending support to Mr Saddam. One immediate consequence has been to unite most of the Arab world, Iran and Turkey in opposition to the air exclusion zone which they fear will divide Iraq into three, with the ruling Sunni minority controlling only the landlocked central sector and almost none of the country's oil resources. The longer that Mr Saddam or his group retains power, the less likely it will be that the Kurds, and eventually the Shias, will be willing to relinquish the political gains they have made. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are the only two governments in the Gulf actively supporting the allied action and by so doing are emphasising, their dependence on Washington. Early this year, the mood in Riyadh was one of self-congratulation. The Americans had appeared from over the horizon, had done the job, been paid and were going home. There must be less jubilation now. The sound of US warplanes taking off can again be heard. While some officials in Washington are congratulating themselves on the extra security provided for western oil supplies, others are wary of the October election in Kuwait, which is unlikely to enhance the image of that country's rulers. How these pressures and commitments evolve in the short term may depend on the fate of Mr Saddam. His support at the centre may have been enhanced by the new threat posed to the unity of Iraq, but there is no doubt that sanctions are biting deeper. If the latter is bearing heavily on the Iraqi leader, he might well step up his defiance of UN resolutions, sure that Mr Bush will react militarily and hopeful that the effect will be to distract the public and unite them against America. He has nothing to gain by accepting the status quo. The worst that can happen to Mr Bush is that he will not be re-elected, despite having led his country to its greatest self-acclaimed feat of arms since the Second World War. The sight of Mr Saddam still in power would be a miserable bequest to his successor, the more so since the US has in the past month chosen to bind itself more closely to unpredictable players, and to events which will not be controlled by military power alone. Russia, aligning itself more closely with the west, announced yesterday it was sending two warships to the Gulf to help enforce United Nations resolutions on Iraq, Reuter reports from Moscow. The armed forces chief-of-staff, Colonel-General Viktor Dubynin, told Itar-Tass news agency that the anti-submarine ship, Admiral Vinogradov, and a tanker, Boris Butoma, would sail from Vladivostok and be in the Gulf before the end of the month.</p>

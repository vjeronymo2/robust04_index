			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ad Accounts Shifted: Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft General Foods division said it  has realigned assignments for its advertising agencies.  </P> <P> The biggest shift in ad assignments gives the Maxwell House coffee account back  to the agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which lost it only 16 months ago to New  York-based D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles. In other major account moves,  Kraft gave the Chicago-based Leo Burnett agency responsibility in the United  States for Kraft Real Mayonnaise advertising while J. Walter Thompson of New  York gets the Miracle Whip salad dressing account.  </P></p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television Thames TV may have lost its London franchise but the company is still alive and well (and nowadays part of Pearson, owners of the FT). Today's new comedy Law And Disorder, with Penelope Keith playing a sports car driving widow who combines the professions of barrister and writer of children's books, is a Thames production. They begin (8.00 ITV) with a yarn about a hot air balloon landing in a field and frightening a prize bull to death. If that doesn't appeal, Horizon on BBC2 looks into the reasons why mammoths became extinct a mere 3,500 years ago (8.00 BBC2). In the second episode of John Mortimer's series about an auction house, Under The Hammer, Richard Wilson , whom we are accustomed to see as the irritable pensioner Victor Meldrew, finds himself romantically involved with a younger colleague (9.00 ITV). Cutting Edge shows what a nurse has to do to earn her Pounds 24 a day: anything up to a 14-hour shift, and the tasks of waitress, cleaner, and social worker (9.00 C4). If you missed the opening episode of Middlemarch it is repeated on BBC1 (10.10).</p>

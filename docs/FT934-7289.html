			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Prison officers to challenge dispute ruling PRISON officers yesterday decided to challenge Thursday's High Court judgment that they had no right to take industrial action. The challenge comes as the Prison Officers' Association faces removal from the government's list of trade unions. The association yesterday wrote to its members telling them to comply with the court's instruction to call off three days of industrial action planned for next week. Mr John Bartell, its chairman, said the association planned legal action to overturn the court ruling. 'We will go to trial over this issue. The court decision will lead to more chaos and disruption in the prison service than our industrial action would ever have done.' The Trades Union Congress said it was seeking an urgent meeting with leaders of the 30,000-member association, which said it intended to 'step back and let the government sort out the chaos'. The government stressed it had not intended to remove union rights from prison officers. The Home Office said: 'Matters could not be left as they are. We want to move quickly to restore their rights under employment laws.' The judgment may raise human rights questions for the government, which has already been forced to reconsider its stance on union membership at GCHQ. The association had planned not to accept prisoners brought by the police or Group 4, the private security company, from Monday, in a protest over privatisation and prison overcrowding. Mr Justice May, in granting the injunction, accepted the government's arguments that because prison officers hold the office of constables they are not protected under employment law if they take industrial action that breaches their contracts. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said many questions needed to be resolved to put industrial relations in the prison service, including relations with the association, on a proper footing. There was a need to extend to prison officers 'the appropriate elements of employment protection legislation which they do not currently enjoy, including access to industrial tribunals; and to provide arrangements by which prison officers' remuneration can be settled'.</p>

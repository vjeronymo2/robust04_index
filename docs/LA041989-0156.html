			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRUMP QUOTED AS CALLING LEONA HELMSLEY 'DISGRACE'  </P> <P> Donald Trump, the billionaire developer who's been called a few names himself,  has called real estate executive Leona (The Queen) Helmsley "a disgrace" and a  destroyer of her husband's reputation, it was reported today.  </P> <P> The New York Post quoted an anonymous source close to Trump as saying the  impetus for the attack was a dispute about a Helmsley-owned piece of property  in Atlantic City.  </P> <P> The newspaper said Trump wrote Leona Helmsley on April 5:  </P> <P> "When God created Leona, the world received no favors. Without the veil of  Harry Helmsley, you would be a nonentity. You would not be able to randomly  fire and abuse people in order to make yourself happy. . . .  </P> <P> "Over the last number of years I have watched as you have virtually destroyed  my friend, and a once-great and respected man, Harry Helmsley."  </P> <P> Leona Helmsley, who styles herself "The Queen" in ads for Helmsley hotels, and  her husband, Harry, are awaiting trial on tax evasion charges.  </P> <P> She cited the pending criminal case in declining to comment on Trump's letter,  the newspaper said.  </P> <P> It said Trump would not elaborate on his attack, other than to add: "She's a  disgrace to the industry and a disgrace to humanity in general."  </P> <P> The newspaper reported that its source said Leona Helmsley has refused to  transfer to Trump the lease on a small parcel amid other property in Atlantic  City recently bought by Trump.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRWAVES TURN PATRIOTIC FOR FOURTH OF JULY;  </P> <P> RADIO  </P> <P> SPECIALS: KRTH-FM (101.1) for the 13th year airs its "Firecracker 300," which  counts down the top 300 pop hits ever, according to an audience survey. . . .  Shadow Steele of Pirate Radio (100.3 FM) will celebrate the holiday by  broadcasting from Gladstone's 4-Fish in Malibu, noon until 4 p.m. The coverage  continues with a free fireworks display from a barge off the coast from 9 p.m.  to midnight. Information: GL4-FISH.  </P> <P> At 2 p.m. KIIS (102.7 FM) begins to provide periodic coverage of the Rose Bowl  Americafest, a five-hour combination of fireworks, music and marching bands. In  addition to what is touted as the largest pyromusical event on the West Coast,  the Rose Bowl celebration features performances by Wilson Phillips, Michael  Bolton, Glenn Medeiros, The Cover Girls, Alisha and A'me Lorain. Rick Dees will  appear on the program along with others from the KIIS crew, including Magic  Matt, Hollywood Hamilton and Ellen K.  </P> <P> MUSIC: KCRW-FM (89.9) will pay tribute to two musical giants, Irving Berlin and  Louis Armstrong. Host Ian Whitcomb features rare and unusual recordings of  Berlin songs from noon until 3 p.m. One such piece will be "Reaching for the  Moon" which was deleted from the 1929 movie of the same title. Berlin is heard  singing "This Is the Army Mr. Jones" from his 1942 Broadway Review "This Is the  Army." A patriotic Berlin wrote the review to help the war cause, according to  program host Whitcomb, who said of the composer's rare recordings, "People  forget that he was a performer before he became a song writer. He was probably  very critical of himself."  </P> <P> Also on KCRW, from 3 to 5 p.m. Louis Armstrong, who would have been 90 years  old today, is revealed via recorded interviews with Armstrong himself as well  as other musicians and music critics. Host Billy Taylor explores Armstrong's  influence on the Swing Era and modern pop music.  </P> <P> Music personality Don Kirshner begins the day at 5 a.m. on KRLA (1110 AM) with  a special look at the "British Invasion" of music in America during the '60s.

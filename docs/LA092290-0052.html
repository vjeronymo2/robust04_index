			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> EL CAMINO REAL WINS BEHIND 3 TOUCHDOWNS FROM MARINE  </P> <P> Ryan Marine scored a touchdown in each of the first three quarters to spark El  Camino Real High to a 21-7 victory over Monroe in a nonleague football game at  Monroe on Friday night.  </P> <P> The Conquistadores played an outstanding defensive game, applying a bevy of  brutal hits in the secondary while holding Monroe to just 32 yards on the  ground.  </P> <P> Juan Hernandez set up El Camino Real's first touchdown when he recovered a  fumble on Monroe's eight yard-line on the second offensive play of the game.  </P> <P> Marine took over from there, breaking two tackles on an eight-yard touchdown  run up the middle.  </P> <P> Monroe tied the score, 7-7, with 2 minutes 50 seconds to go in the first half  on Ramy Antoun's 34-yard pass to Gene Hodge, who caught the ball over his left  shoulder in the end zone.  </P> <P> But El Camino Real wasn't about to settle for a halftime tie. The  Conquistadores marched 63 yards in seven plays, Marine scoring his second  touchdown on an eight-yard run.  </P> <P> Marine finished with 85 yards in 18 carries, and teammate Chris Griggs added 50  yards in seven carries.  </P> <P> The go-ahead score was set up on a 39-yard pass from Evan Howland to Jon  Speier, who was lying on his back at the eight-yard line when the ball  deflected off a defender and landed between his legs.  </P> <P> El Camino Real's third score came quickly after intermission. Starting from  their own 32-yard line after the kickoff, the Conquistadores used the tandem of  Marine and Griggs to move downfield in five plays. Marine scored is final  touchdown on a 19-yard dash off left tackle.  </P> <P> Monroe's Jason St. John, a 6-foot, 190-pound converted tackle, made his debut  at fullback but carried just seven times for 16 yards. Andrew Rich, a  sophomore, was the leading rusher for Monroe, carrying seven times for 19  yards.  </P> <P> Antoun was the offensive star for Monroe, completing seven of 18 passes for 100  yards. But he threw two interceptions and was twice called for intentional  grounding.  </P> <P> Hodge, a 5-9, 140-pound senior, caught four passes for 48 yards for Monroe.  </P></p>

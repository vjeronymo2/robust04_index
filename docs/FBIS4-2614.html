			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Scientific and  technological cooperation between China and the United States,  which benefits both countries, has vast potential and promising  prospects, said Chinese State Councillor Song Jian, who is to  leave here for the United States tomorrow.    Before departure for attending the sixth meeting of the  joint  commission of the Sino-U.S. scientific and technological  cooperation, Song, also minister in charge of the science  commission, told XINHUA that the scientific and technological  cooperation between China and the United States began in 1979,  when Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping visited the United States and  signed an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation  with then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter.    On the basis of the agreement, he said, the two countries  have in the past 15 years reached cooperative accords in 29  fields including education, agriculture, oceanography, public  health, environmental protection and basic science, launched  more than 1,000 cooperative programs and exchanged more than  10,000 personnel.    Song listed some of the fruits achieved through bilateral  cooperation, which included the establishment of Beijing  electron- positron collider, Sino-U.S. joint investigation on  the west Pacific Ocean and the setting up of China seismic data  network. These items are of great scientific and economic  significance, he added.    Such cooperation is beneficial to both sides, the State  Councillor said, adding that the U.S. side can get 150 thousand  mini-films and other materials from China's seismic data network  every year, which are of important value to the study of seismic  forecasting and basic seismic study.    In agricultural aspect, Song noted, China has offered U.S.  side a rich assortment of agricultural resources.    Meanwhile, Song added, the Chinese side has learned and  absorbed the advanced scientific theories and management,  mastered some of advanced scientific methods and technology and  trained scientific talents.    Sino-U.S. joint commission on scientific and technological  cooperation hold its meetings every two years in the capitals of  the two countries by turns and the forthcoming Washington  session is the sixth meeting of the commission, which will be  co-chaired by Song and John Gibbons, U.S. Director of the Office  of Science and Technology Policy.    The agenda of the Washington meeting will include a review  of  achievements of Sino-U.S. scientific and technological  cooperation, intensive discussions on further cooperation in  public health, environmental protection, energy and materials,  besides probing ways for businessmen's involvement in these  aspects.    The two countries will sign new agreements and renew old  ones  for scientific and technological cooperation.    Song believed that his U.S. tour will help enhance Sino-U.S.  scientific and technological cooperation to a new height.    As a noted scientist, Song said that science and technology  belong to all the mankind. The Chinese scientists are willing  to make new and greater contributions to the international  scientific and technological cooperation, he said.</p>

The consolidated plan must identify the developments in the jurisdictions that are participating in an approved HUD Comprehensive Grant program. Activities covered by the consolidated plan that are being coordinated or jointly funded with the public housing Comprehensive Grant program must be identified by project and referenced to the approved Comprehensive Grant program. Examples of joint projects are efforts to revitalize neighborhoods surrounding public housing projects (either current or proposed); cooperation in provision of resident programs and services; coordination of local drug elimination or anti-crime strategies; upgrading of police, fire, schools, and other services; and economic development projects in or near public housing projects to tie in with self-sufficiency efforts for residents.

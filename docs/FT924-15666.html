			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (44): Hunting for prime prospects - Customer Profiles COMPUTERISED databases have been the mainstay of Dunn Humby, a marketing consultancy whose services include strategic and tactical market planning. Its founders left the CACI consultancy to apply the same techniques to the commercial sector as CACI has used successfully in the consumer market. 'Mosaic and Acorn are clever, but not enough to analyse businesses,' comments Edwina Dunn, director of Dunn Humby. The company provides a service identifying people and companies as prime prospects on a one-off basis. It does so by creating a customer profile from data provided by the client, and matching it to wider data sources. Dunn Humby looked at a number of resources, including BT connections, and Telephone Data Services, TDS - 'the larger databases tended to have a limited number of details about a great number of companies. We wanted to know a lot about a little - we wanted a rich, accurate data-source, so that we could segment by employees, turnover, size or any other factor.' Dunn Humby chose Lotus One Source's Private+ product for its depth of detail, but also uses TDS and selected specialised databases such as Keystroke Knowledge, for government data. Dunn Humby takes the data supplied by the customer (usually these are limited to address, contact details and order history), loads it into the Oracle system, and matches company records with those within Lotus UK Private+. The customer data is then combined with additional data from One Source, such as detailed business description, financial and locational details. From this cocktail of data, it builds up a sophisticated profile of existing customers, which is then used against the Private+ listings to identify potential customers - 'to sell on different levels, you really need details,' concludes Ms Dunn. 'The clever thing about the One Source data is that it lays out the relationships - parent, subsidiary. That is unusual, but an essential part of what we call 'relationship marketing.' '</p>

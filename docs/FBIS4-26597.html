			<p>BFN     [Text] To further enhance the quality of its propaganda  and make good preparations for providing Beijing with our radio  programs, the news station under the Hunan People's Radio  Network recently conscientiously summed up and analyzed its past  propaganda work. It will make proper adjustments in its  programming effective 20 June.    The adjusted programming will retain its distinctive  features  while giving more prominence to news broadcasting. From morning  till night, news will be broadcasted at the most important  times. The former "International News" program carried at 2200  [1500 GMT] will be moved to 0610 [2210 GMT], and there will be a  10-minute program called "Night News" to increase efficiency.    The previous "Daily Morning News" will be replaced by  "Yesterday's Guide." In addition, the "738 News Hotline" and  "738 Live Studio" will be merged and broadcasted from 1810 to  1855 [1010 to 1055 GMT]. This will enable the program  presenters to host their program more easily and will encourage  the audience to participate in the hotline.    As part of the change, a small number of specialized  programs  will also be adjusted. The "Rural World" program carried at  1830 [1030 GMT] will be replaced by the "Urban and Rural  Panorama" program broadcasted at 0730 [2330 GMT] and 2030 [1230  GMT]. Both "Hunan Night Talk" and "Audience Voice" will be  dropped in favor of more literature and art programs.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO COURTROOMS INCREASE -- BUT SO DO PITFALLS;  </P> <P> LAW: TRAILBLAZING METHOD OF REPLACING PAPER WITH VIDEO HAS CREATED NEW WAYS FOR  THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO GO AFOUL. FOR EXAMPLE, A JUDGE ACCIDENTALLY TAPED OVER  PREVIOUS TESTIMONY.  </P> <P> Judicial mistakes come in almost inexhaustible variety, but Judge Ellen B.  Ewing found a novel one: She erased the only record of eyewitness testimony in  a manslaughter case.  </P> <P> Ewing is the chief judge of the Louisville circuit courts, the only major court  system in America that has completely eliminated paper and gone to videotape  for trial transcripts.  </P> <P> When she forgot to turn off the videotape during a noon recess soon after the  system was installed in 1985, the cameras whirred steadily as she ate lunch,  then automatically rewound and accidentally taped over the morning's record  with new testimony in the afternoon.  </P> <P> Ewing's inadvertent erasure represents only one of the perils of video  courtrooms, which have spread from Kentucky to 60 courtrooms in 11 states in  the last five years. Judges have forgotten to turn on the cameras, testimony  has been inaudible, appeals have taken months to prepare as lawyers struggled  with unfamiliar video records and court reporters have lost their government  jobs. But the use of video transcripts is growing dramatically from Maryland to  Hawaii.  </P> <P> "I don't feel as if any system is perfect," said Judge Laurence Higgins, who  has been on the bench 14 years, "but this is the greatest thing that has  happened to me as a trial judge in my lifetime."  </P> <P> Kentucky, having worked out many of the bugs in its trailblazing system,  preserves the official record of 40% of all trials on videotape. It saves  money, provides faster service and more accurate transcripts, according to  Kentucky Chief Justice Robert F. Stephens. The number of video courts is  growing as fast as Kentucky finds $50,000 per courtroom to install the  equipment.  </P> <P> In Kentucky courts where it is used, videotape provides the only official  record; when a case is appealed, the appellate lawyers hand the state Supreme  Court tape, not paper.  </P> <P> Virginia has a pilot project under way in one courtroom in Roanoke, and  Maryland has installed cameras in the Prince Georges County circuit court of  Judge Darlene Perry. The District of Columbia is not using video. Nationwide,  four federal courts are expected to begin an experimental program within weeks.  </P> <P> The National Center for State Courts, after an exhaustive survey, concluded  that "video recording is a viable method of court reporting that compares  favorably with traditional court reporting."  </P> <P> But as a steadily growing number of state and federal courtrooms are wired for  cameras, some appellate lawyers and judges question whether videotape is too  time-consuming and cumbersome to review, and court reporters -- fighting hard  to save their jobs -- are demanding that the supposed advantages of video be  seriously examined.  </P> <P> "If a court is having personnel problems, just bringing in a machine is not a  creative approach," said Marshall S. Jorpeland, communications director of the  National Shorthand Reporters Assn. "Video is just another tool, it looks great  and sounds fantastic, but 50 years from now reporters will still be needed and  courts will still have the human element involved to make sure everything's  working."  </P> <P> To be sure, there have been problems. Curtis Clay, convicted of slaying his  live-in girlfriend in Lexington, Ky., won the right to a new trial in 1989 when  courtroom videotape ran out unnoticed while he was being questioned by his  lawyer and cross-examined by prosecutors. The judge ruled that a reconstruction  of his testimony did "not constitute a record of sufficient completeness for  appellate consideration."  </P> <P> U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Gilbert S. Merritt called his first  experience handling the appeal of a burglary conviction using a Kentucky  videotape transcript a "dismaying encounter." He said it did not provide an  "adequate basis for review . . . it was marginally audible."  </P> <P> Because of the lack of a written transcript, "the parties could not engage with  the bench in resolving simple factual questions about what happened at trial,"  Merritt said. "Oral argument about the events of the trial became, at times, an  exercise in futility."  </P> <P> "I think we jumped into this a little too soon," said Kentucky Court of Appeals  Judge Charles B. Lester. "I think this can be developed eventually."  </P> <P> Right now, however, he said: "It takes a lot more time to sit and watch a trial  than to scan a typed transcript. . . . It has shifted costs up to our level; we  are paying lawyers to sit and watch television. We just have to grind through  and waste an awful lot of time."  </P> <P> Further, Lester said in an interview, because the voice-activated system  focuses on the loudest noise, "every time a spectator walks in, I get a  beautiful segment of doors. I could prepare quite a beautiful ad for doors,  every kind of door that exists in a trial courtroom."  </P> <P> Ewing, in accidentally erasing testimony, provided novel grounds for appeal.  But the Kentucky Supreme Court refused to grant a new trial, saying a narrative  statement reconstructing the record from trial notes was sufficient to give the  convicted man a "full and fair appellate review."  </P> <P> Kentucky officials say updated equipment in the voice-activated system has  eliminated many of the mechanical and sound problems. Human error has been  minimized, they say, by new devices that prevent erasures and alert the  courtroom audience when the cameras are not operating by the installation of  two lights on the front of the judge's bench. Even so, the Curtis Clay case  still occurred.  </P> <P> "My feelings have changed over the years," said Frank Heft, chief of the  appeals division of the Public Defender office in Louisville. "In the beginning  there were a lot of technical problems (and) it was particularly difficult  hearing bench conferences. Most technical problems are now resolved, it is  rare. . . . The biggest problem is the time involved in reviewing transcripts.  We've adjusted."  </P> <P> Three factors fuel the move to video -- money, time and convenience. The  National Center for State Courts found that Kentucky, which paid low  court-reporter salaries before the introduction of video, reduced court  reporting costs by 15% in actual dollars over a 4-year period, not counting the  fact that salaries would normally have increased with inflation over the  period. The state has spent the savings on video equipment for new courtrooms  and hiring law clerks to help the judges.  </P> <P> Other states, which have kept more detailed cost records, say video-recording  costs are "roughly one-half as much as traditional reporting," according to the  National Center for State Courts.  </P> <P> Court reporters say both costs and delays have merely been shifted around among  the parties involved in litigation. "Court reporters are much less expensive"  than video, said Laura Kogut, immediate past president of the Kentucky  Shorthand Reporters Assn. If a case is appealed, "you're paying attorneys $150  hour to watch TV."  </P> <P> Court reporters say that instead of having to wait for transcripts to be  prepared, delays have been shifted to the appeals process as attorneys take  longer to study video records to prepare their briefs. "Attorneys have been  cited by the (state) Supreme Court for not getting their briefs in in a timely  matter," said Teri Hockersmith, a Louisville court reporter.  </P> <P> Higgins said Kentucky became a trailblazer in courtroom video because  "necessity is the mother of invention."  </P> <P> Higgins said he volunteered to have cameras installed in his courtroom and  turned them on one morning after he had delayed a trial for three days because  of the absence of a court reporter. It was not the first time video recording  had been tried -- it had been started and abandoned in Ohio and Tennessee --  but new, unobtrusive, inexpensive equipment that could be operated by a judge  made it a more attractive proposition.  </P> <P> "It wasn't done out of spite or meanness," he said.  </P></p>

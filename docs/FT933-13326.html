			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television You could scarcely call it a night of classic television (though there are plenty of repeats including The Good Life and French And Saunders both on BBC1) but if you pick your way carefully around the schedules you can have quite an entertaining evening. The series London Wildlife Challenge, available in the metropolis, looked at first like just another yoof venture, with a presenter speaking estuary English accompanied by a stooge, the two of them chasing around London - almost literally - after wild geese. Actually Chris Packham has proved that, regardless of the trendy blond hairstyle and the stone-washed black denim he is a knowledgeable and entertaining biologist (7.30 ITV). Far Flung Floyd began well last week with Keith Floyd cooking in a Vietnamese street market, a boat, and a volley-ball court. Today he is in Bangkok cooking another fish curry on a long tailed boat(8.30 BBC2). Then, the oddity of the evening, A For Abba with John Peel investigating the appeal of the Swedish quartet (9.30 BBC1) - which is a bit like getting Floyd to review the Wimpy Bars.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Bank staff set to reach lowest total since 1985 Staff working for big British banking groups are likely to fall this year to the lowest total since 1985, British Bankers' Association figures suggest. The total number of staff at the nine leading banks is expected to be below 300,000 this year, compared with last year's 300,100. Part-time jobs are assuming greater importance, with their numbers remaining reasonably stable - around the 48,000 mark - but rising by 500 between 1992 and 1993. The figures also give a clear picture of how the high street banks operate, showing a decline in the number of branches and an increase in the number of cash machines. Almost 11,500 branches were operated last year by the nine banking groups covered by the statistics. This is the lowest total since 1983, when the annual figures were first collected. The rate of closures has fallen, however, since the sharp drops of 500 or 600 a year over the past few years. Within the overall total, Abbey National and National Westminster Bank increased their numbers of branches slightly. Co-operative Bank and Yorkshire Bank also extended their branch networks to a limited degree. The number of cash machines has already significantly outstripped the number of branches, and for the high street banks could well exceed a total of 15,000 this year. Co-operative Bank, whose cash machine total rose from 89 to 119, had one of the biggest increases. Customers' use of bank services is also reflected in the figures, which reveal that the use of overdrafts is still falling while the proportion of longer-term lending by individuals and companies continues to rise. Use of plastic cards as a form of credit has continued to increase, the association says, perhaps to some extent as a result of the declining use of overdrafts. The growing use of debit cards has been even more striking: the value of retail transactions in which they are used rose from Pounds 1.7bn in 1989 to Pounds 17.9bn in 1993. The figures also confirm the banks' success in gaining mortgage business last year, showing that they won almost 50 per cent of UK net mortgage lending last year - about twice the 1983 proportion.

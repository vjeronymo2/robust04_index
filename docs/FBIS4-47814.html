			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tim Cohen] </F>   [Text] A bruising fight for the deputy presidency had  developed between ANC chairman Thabo Mbeki and secretary-general  Cyril Ramaphosa, while Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee and  Finance Minister Derek Keys were likely to hold their posts, ANC  insiders speculated yesterday.    Mandela, who is due to announce his Cabinet next week, is  likely to select three to five "Cabinet secretaries" to oversee  Cabinet Departments and make up the ANC's exclusive "inner  sanctum".    Tipped for these posts are Mbeki or Ramaphosa to oversee  Foreign Affairs and Defence, ANC economic planning department  head Trevor Manuel to oversee economic and financial matters and  SACP [South-African Communist Party] chairman Joe Slovo to  oversee judicial and constitutional issues. Other Cabinet  secretaries will oversee welfare, education, social services and  administration.    Having a "cabinet within a Cabinet" would allow Mandela to  retain Keys and Coetsee in their posts by making them  responsible to a higher, but less experienced, authority.    The debate over a Reconstruction and Development portfolio  is  continuing, with some arguing that it would cut across too many  other portfolios. Former COSATU [Congress of South African  Trade Unions] general secretary Jay Naidoo is favoured to take  such a portfolio.    Other good bets would be mainly from the ANC's national  executive committee, including: Law and Order -- Sydney  Mufamadi; Trade and Industry -- Tito Mboweni; Mineral and Energy  Affairs -- Marcel Golding; Health -- Nkosazana Zuma; Posts and  Telecommunications -- Pallo Jordan; Science and Technology --  Mohammed Valli Moosa; Women and Youth -- Gertrude Shope;  Information -- Gill Marcus; Sport -- Steve Tshwete;  Constitutional Development -- Zola Skweyiya; and Commission for  Administration -- Josiah Jele.    Other NP [National Party] members could be Foreign Minister  Pik Botha, Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Botha,  Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer and Public  Enterprises Minister Dawie de Villiers. Meyer could be offered  Justice, but speculation that Botha will retain Foreign Affairs  is understood to be unfounded.    Mandela has indicated his desire to placate right-wing  whites  and could retain Agriculture Minister Kraai van Niekerk or his  deputy, Tobie Meyer.    He also wants to include a PAC member in the Cabinet and  could be constitutionally required to include Inkatha leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Several minor posts, including Transport,  Water Affairs and Forestry, could go to these candidates.    Education could go to ANC education desk head John Samuels,  although he may not be elected in which case Randell van den  Heever could be a candidate.    Former ANC Youth League leader Peter Mokaba has positioned  himself to be Tourism Minister, while Mac Maharaj and Pravin  Gordhan are likely to be included. Former COSATU members,  including Chris Dlamini and Alec Erwin, seem likely candidates  for Manpower Minister.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>   [Excerpts] Knesset Members [MK] Avraham Burg and Rafi Elul  are initiating a move to abolish the law for direct election of  prime minister, or at least to postpone its implementation.  This initiative is backed by many of the Labor's dovish members  of the Kefar Hayaroq and Mashov circles, who last Thursday set  up a joint front to promote the it.    MK Burg said that this week he will present the Knesset with  an offer to amend the law. The amendment states that the  implementation of the law will be postponed until after all the  basic laws have been incorporated into a state constitution. In  the congregation last Thursday, MK Burg called for a "democratic  jihad" against the direct election law. He warned against "a  severe harm to Israel's democratic regime and civil rights if  the law is implemented before all the basic laws -- designed to  secure the civil rights of Israel's citizens -- are passed."    Also, MK Elul intends to propose that one-third of the  Knesset members be elected through regional elections for  individual candidates.    Most of those supporting the Burg-Elul initiative belong to  the "Peres camp" in Labor. It is therefore believed that Peres  is behind the initiative. Party members have also expressed  fear that Rabin might view this initiative as a plot to unseat  him and reignite the confrontation between him and Peres.    Some of Rabin's associates maintain that Peres "is behind  the  revolt by Labor secretaries of local labor councils," aimed at  weakening Rabin. At the same time, Peres' associates are  accusing Rabin of "selling his soul to Ramon, and not minding to  sell the party to Ramon as well."    [In the same issue of HA'ARETZ, pages A1 and A10, a 800-word  report by Yerah Tal and Gid'on Alon on the negotiations for the  establishment of the Histadrut labor federation coalition adds  that "Labor sources have said that Rabin's functioning as party  chairman is one of the reasons for the expanding crisis in the  negotiations between Labor and Ram, Hayim Ramon's list."  "Senior Labor members of the negotiating team charged that  Rabin is to blame for legitimizing moves by Ramon's men to set  up a coalition with Likud members in the Histadrut and in local  labor councils." The report adds that "the gloomy mood in Labor  is also the result of the difficulties in expanding the  government coalition in the wake of the deadlocked negotiations  with SHAS, the Torah Observing Sephardim."]    Tension between Rabin and Peres has been rising recently in  view of this situation. A senior Labor source said over the  weekend that Peres was offended when Rabin rejected his request  to head the negotiating team with Syria for several months in  order to bring about a breakthrough on this track. "Peres is  frustrated these days. The agreement with Jordan is, in fact,  completed; the process with the Palestinians is rolling; and the  Syrian track is sealed off to Peres. Hence his bitter feeling  toward Rabin," the Labor source said. He added that he expects  the open conflict between the two to resume soon. [passage  omitted]    Another idea raised recently is an offer by MK Dalya Itzik  to  amend the party constitution so that a Labor prime minister  could not also serve as party chairman, and for the two roles to  be absolutely separate. MK Itzik believes that the amendment  will not be applicable in the next Knesset elections. Therefore  she intends to appeal to Rabin and the party institutions to  appoint an emergency leadership for the party. This leadership  will have to mend the rifts in the party and prepare it for the  1996 elections.    MK Itzik suggests that Rabin delegate some of his authority  as party chairman to three senior party members who will run  party affairs with him until the elections, and attempt to  rehabilitate it. The evident candidate for the role of party  chairman is Shim'on Peres, but Itzik avoids suggesting this for  fear of being charged of having considerations associated with  party camps. This is the reason she is suggesting that Rabin  delegate authority to three people, not just one. This is also  called for in view of the expected difficulties in electing one  person acceptable to all. [passage omitted]    The crisis in Labor yielded yet another debate regarding  internal elections. Many party members are demanding that the  primary system be abrogated, viewing it as the root of all that  is evil in the party. MK Gedalya Gal opposes the system,  claiming that "it leads to the phenomenon of rebellion we are  witnessing in the party today." MK's Burg and Hagay Merom, on  the other hand, suggest that the party hold open primaries.  [passage omitted]</p>

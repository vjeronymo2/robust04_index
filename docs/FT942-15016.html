			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Cost of living 'up 3.7% in year' A family of four will need to have had a 2.8 per cent increase in its income in the year to February in order to maintain its standard of living, Reward Group, a research and consultancy business, says today. The group's survey calculates the income needed to maintain the standard of living of eight families. It finds that the overall cost of goods and services rose 3.7 per cent in the year to February, but private housing costs fell 2 per cent thanks to lower mortgage rates and lower local taxes. The most expensive place is London, followed by Woking, Surrey; Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire; Slough, Berkshire; and Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. The cheapest place is Northern Ireland, followed by Thurso, Highland; and Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan. If housing is ignored, the most expensive places are Lerwick, Shetland; Chingford, Essex; Manchester; Ealing, west London; and Maidstone, Kent. The cheapest are Billingham, Cleveland; and Wolverhampton, West Midlands. The survey found that over the past five years, costs have risen in the north compared to the national average, while lower house prices have reduced the relative cost of living in the south.

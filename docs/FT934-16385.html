			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Strategists plump for Pacific Rim PACIFIC RIM equity markets, already attracting US analysts, continue to win converts. The global strategy team at Nomura in London has doubled its model portfolio weighting for Hong Kong to 6 per cent and is introducing Malaysia with 3 per cent and the Philippines and Korea with 2 per cent each. The re-rating, at the expense of the US, doubles Nomura's total weighting for emerging markets to 20 per cent. Mr Nicholas Knight, who heads the Nomura team, said that the attractions were growth rates which look outstandingly good by western standards, and generally reasonable market valuations. Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley, which again raised its Hong Kong weighting yesterday, suggested that one outcome of events in Moscow could be convergence between Russia and China if an authoritarian, pro-reform government was installed. He advised building equity weightings in the Far East, particularly connected to the China story, at the expense of Europe.</p>

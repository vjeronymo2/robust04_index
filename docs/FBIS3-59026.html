The document is ready for signing, the ministry said, adding  that it enables people in both countries to cross the border  into the other country regardless of official border crossings  and to stay in the other signatory country's border area. The  agreement includes third country nationals exempt from visa  requirements for both of the two signatory countries and the  European Union.    The agreement is a sign of good relations between Germany  and  the Czech Republic, German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther  said, adding he hoped it would spark development in the tourist  industry and other kinds of enterprise in the area.    The Czech Government approved a Czech-German Border Treaty  on  Thursday [13 January], Czech Government Office Spokesman  Ladislav Pistora said, pointing out that the agreement on border  area traffic approved by the German ministry is a separate and  different document.    Governments of neighboring countries conclude agreements on  border area traffic as a matter of routine, Czech Foreign  Ministry Spokeswoman Lucie Pilipova said, adding that such  documents include an arrangement on border facility maintenance.</p>

Khodakova, Scientific Research Institute of  Biology, Rostov-na-Donu State University; UDC 577.352.5]    [Abstract] A study of the effects of hypobaric hypoxia  equivalent to an altitude of 9000 m and to sea level on the  stability of erythrocyte, lysosome, and mitochondrial membranes  was based on a number of assumptions and previously established  facts. The researchers had earlier ascertained that hypobaric  hypoxia destabilizes erythrocyte membranes and results in an  increase in serum levels of extraerythrocyte hemoglobin, total  peroxidase activity, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  activity. Such hypoxia also changes the permeability of  lysosomal membranes and the activity of lysosomal peptide  hydrolases and disrupts the structures of the mitochondrial  membrane and the catalytic properties of monoaminooxidase. Since  the psychotropic drug pirazidol inhibits lipid peroxidation  rate, the researchers hypothesized that the administration of  the drug ahead of time would stabilize membranes and help to  raise the body's resistance to hypoxia. In white male rats  confined for three hours in an altitude chamber with an  atmospheric pressure of 0.029 mPa, the administration of the  pirazidol prevented a rise in the serum levels of hemoglobin,  total iron, and total peroxidase activity. The overall activity  of lysosomal acidic peptide hydrolases in all tissues and the  free activity in the brain and liver did not differ from  control, and the pulmonary activity of enzymes in soluble  fraction was even 27 percent lower than in control animals. The  administration of the drug also prevented any change in  substrate specificity in mitochondrial fraction, as well as  enzyme release to soluble fraction.

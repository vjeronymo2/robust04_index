			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why paying off the mortgage is worthwhile - A look at the best way of reducing your home loan HOMEOWNERS have now seen their monthly mortgage payments reduced by one-third or more in just over two years. Borrowers with the Halifax, the country's largest lender, were paying 15.4 per cent interest on variable rate mortgages in October 1990 but are now paying 8.55 per cent. For many people, the reduction in rates has eased finances to the extent that they may be able to afford to make capital repayments on their mortgage. If homeowners already have adequate savings and pay off credit card bills in full each month, they may choose either to save more money or reduce the size of their mortgage to Pounds 30,000 (interest payments over this amount are not tax-deductible). The main argument for reducing the size of a mortgage is that the interest is likely to be far higher than the return savings can earn in a bank or building society. While the standard variable rate mortgage at Halifax is at present 8.55 per cent, it is only paying out between six and 6.6 per cent net on its Premium Xtra account for a basic rate taxpayer. These percentages include a 0.25 per cent bonus payable on the anniversary of the account if no capital withdrawals are made. The return for a higher-rate taxpayer is only between 4.8 and 5.25 per cent net. Put another way, if you are a higher rate taxpayer, with a mortgage of more than Pounds 30,000, you would need to be earning gross interest of 14.25 per cent - and 11.4 per cent gross if you are a basic rate taxpayer - for it to be cost-effective not to repay the mortgage at 8.55 per cent. There are, of course, other considerations. Inflation at 3.6 per cent is low at the moment but now that the UK is out of the discipline of the exchange rate mechanism, it is possible that annual inflation will become larger than interest rates, thereby eroding the size of your debt. You may also prefer to invest in equities in the hope of obtaining higher returns than those in a bank or building society. But if you do decide to reduce the size of your mortgage, the difference in monthly repayments can be startling. The table shows that by paying off Pounds 10,000 of a Pounds 40,000 loan, interest on a repayment mortgage will fall to just over Pounds 200 a month from Pounds 273.65 a month at current interest rates. You would be better off by over Pounds 160 a month by reducing your repayment mortgage by Pounds 20,000 from either Pounds 80,000 or Pounds 60,000. Before increasing payments to your lender, you should decide between one of two strategies. You may wish to reduce the capital and spread the remainder over the existing term of the loan, which will result in reduced monthly interest payments. Alternatively, your main aim may be to shorten the term of the loan, say from 25 years to 10 years or even less. In either case, it is important to consult your lender over the best way of achieving your aim, otherwise you could be in for a shock. Paul Burgin, of Abbey National, says that the worst thing to do is to send off a cheque without explaining what it is for. You should state that it is a capital repayment and ask for your monthly interest payments to be recalculated accordingly. If you do not make this clear, Abbey will assume it is overpayment of interest and it will not be taken into account until the end of the year. Many borrowers opt for an annual repayment review, which is to their benefit when interest rates are rising but to their disadvantage when they are falling. The majority of borrowers at Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester are on annual review and the calculation is done by the society on December 31 with the change coming into effect for borrowers on March 1. 'Formerly you would not see any benefit for 13 months if you made a payment in February, without telling us what it was for,' said C&amp;G. So long as the society is now told that an increased payment represents a capital repayment, a recalculation will be made. C&amp;G will assume the increased payment is to enable you to reduce the term of the loan if your mortgage is on a repayment basis. If you want the reduced capital paid over the existing term of the loan, you must tell C&amp;G. By contrast, Lloyds Bank will assume the opposite. Unless you tell the bank otherwise, Lloyds will assume that you will want to make payments on your reduced capital over the same term. This underlines the importance of consulting your lender. Borrowers with endowment mortgages can also reduce the size of their debt. An endowment is an interest-only mortgage where part of the monthly payments is paid to a life company which invests the money primarily in equities in the hope that when the policy matures, it will have grown by enough to pay off the capital. Anything that remains can be taken by the householder as a tax-free lump sum. By reducing the size of the capital, you will pay less interest. But the size of the premiums you pay to the life company will remain constant throughout the term of the mortgage. When the endowment matures, you should be able to keep more of the tax-free lump sum since the size of the capital, which the policy needs to repay, will have been reduced. Most lenders prefer the mortgage to be reduced with a lump sum rather than through regular payments, although the Royal Bank of Scotland says that it will treat increased monthly payments as capital repayments as long as the borrower consults the bank. But National Westminster bank will charge an administration fee if capital repayments are made more than twice a year. The Alliance &amp; Leicester building society will only consider amounts of Pounds 500 and above as capital repayments, and lesser amounts will be left to languish until the end of the year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MONTHLY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AT 8.55 PER CENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 25 year term (Pounds ) size of                 ------------ Endowment ------------   loan    Repayment     interest  +  premium     =    total  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 30,000       203.31       160.33        37.5         197.83 40,000       273.65       231.58        49.76        281.34 60,000       437.18       374.08        74.27        448.35 80,000       600.71       516.58        98.73        615.31  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Halifax.

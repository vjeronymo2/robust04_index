			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The official bloc of the CCD [Democratic  Constituent Congress] on 27 May approved the bill that includes  special, agricultural, and hydroelectric projects in the  privatization process, disregarding the opposition's warning.    Therefore, large hydroelectric projects such as Olmos,  Chavimochic, Majes, Tinajones, and Jequetepeque-Zana; the San  Lorenzo irrigation project; and the Huinco and Marcapomacocha  Machu Pichu hydroelectric plants, among others, can be sold.    The organizations, production units, and other projects  under  the state's responsibility also can be sold.    The new law that changes Legislative Decree No. 674 for  Promoting Private Investments in State Enterprises also grants  full powers to the Privatization Commission (Copri) to carry out  the auctions.

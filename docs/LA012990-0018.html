			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLISEUM  </P> <P> I'm sorry, but I just can't understand all the sentimental crying about  remodeling the Los Angeles Coliseum (letters, Jan. 13). I suspect that those  who are crying the loudest are people who never go there.  </P> <P> The Coliseum is a 60-year-old stadium that needs more than the face lift it  received prior to the 1984 Olympics, it needs major reconstructive surgery. The  proposed remodeling, which would be done at no expense to the taxpayers, would  transform the Coliseum from an outdated facility to a modern facility and would  retain the east end peristyle that distinguishes the Coliseum from other  stadiums.  </P> <P> Remodeling the Coliseum would not only allow us to keep a valuable NFL  franchise in Los Angeles (the Raiders), but it would enhance the South-Central  area of the city.  </P> <P> Please don't let sentiment stand in the way of progress or the Coliseum could  become a seldom used monument to stupidity.  </P> <P> DAVE VRCHOTA  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: What is a share option? A share option is a right to acquire shares in the future at a price which is usually fixed when the option is granted, writes David Cohen. Virtually every big UK company has an approved 'executive' scheme under which the directors and chosen executives can receive an option over shares worth up to four times their salary. The price payable when such an option is 'exercised' - that is, converted into shares - will generally be the share price at the grant date. There is a set period during which options can be exercised, at the end of which they expire. Exercising options more than three years but less than 10 after the grant date gives some tax advantages. Suppose, say, that you are head-hunted to be finance director of a quoted company at a salary of Pounds 150,000, and that you are also promised a four-times-salary share option. The option is granted in November 1994 when the share price is Pounds 2. You will, therefore, have the right to buy 300,000 shares (Pounds 150,000 x 4 / 2) any time between 1998 and 2004. If your prime aim is to make as much money as possible out of your option - rather than to become a shareholder in your employer - you will wait until you think the share price has peaked. Then you will buy the shares and sell them immediately. The profit you make will be highly sensitive to movements in the share price. For example, while a sale price of Pounds 2.40 will net you Pounds 120,000 (40p x 300,000), a price rise of a further 10 per cent to Pounds 2.60 will boost your windfall by 50 per cent to Pounds 180,000 (60p x 300,000). This gearing effect is, of course, characteristic of traded options and other 'derivative' instruments. The real joy of executive options is that there is no risk of losing money. Having paid nothing for his right, the executive will exercise it only if he can do so profitably. If he cannot, he simply ditches it or allows it to lapse.</p>

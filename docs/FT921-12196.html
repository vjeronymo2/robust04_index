			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Threat to electrical retailers predicted THE RETAILING arms of the recently privatised electricity companies are emerging as a significant threat to established electrical goods retailers, according to Corporate Intelligence Group, the retail consultancy. It suggests that this month's merger of the retailing and servicing interests of South Western Electricity and South Wales Electricity to create a business with combined sales of Pounds 70m represents the future. The consultancy expects more mergers and identifies London Electricity and Seeboard as interested parties. Shop sales by the 15 electricity companies in 1991 were about Pounds 850m, with appliances accounting for 80 per cent. The electricity companies represent the UK's second-biggest electrical retailing concern after Dixons. Most of the 1,000 electricity company outlets are on high streets, however, where trading efficiencies are lower than at edge-of-town superstores. Retail Research Report.

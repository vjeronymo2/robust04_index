			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 30 Mar (EFE) -- The adoption of a single 15  percent tariff for all its imports, which Peru will propose to  its Andean Group partners on 4 April, is a precondition for the  country to once again assume all its obligations within the  group, some of which Peru relinquished in 1992.    On 4 and 5 April, the Andean delegates will hold a  commission  meeting in Caracas to debate the Peruvian situation and its  tariff proposal. The commission is the top Andean Group body.    The proposal will be made by Minister of Industry, Tourism,  Commerce, and Integration Liliana Canale.    This situation began in August 1992 when Peru asked its  Andean partners Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela to  cancel its obligations regarding the liberalization program and  the minimum external tariff until 31 December 1993. On that  date, the deadline for Peru to fully reassume its obligations  was moved to 30 April 1994.    Peru has engaged in commercial deals with its Andean  partners  since August 1992 through bilateral agreements, which also will  expire on 30 April.    The Peruvian Government currently is operating with two  types  of tariffs, 25 and 15 percent, though the latter is more widely  used -- it applies to 99.5 percent of Peruvian imports.    Peruvian entrepreneurs, who are rather distrustful of the  tariff issue, demand a return to the Andean Group, but  respecting the Barahona document in which four tariffs were  proposed.    The tariffs are 5, 10, 15, and 20 percent, but they are not  being enforced yet because tariffs have not been established yet  for a group of Andean products.    The entrepreneurs claim that setting a single 15 percent  tariff will harm several enterprises because the importation of  products for production of goods for Peruvians will pay a 15  percent tariff, while the other Andean countries will pay only 5  percent for the same products.    In the face of this criticism, the government believes it  cannot change its policy just to favor some sectors.    The Industry Ministry stated that, contrary to what  industrialists have claimed, the Andean market is not vital to  Peru because it accounts for only 8.7 percent of Peruvian  exports, while the European Union (EU) accounts for 30 percent,  the United States for 20 percent, other Latin American countries  for 10 percent, and Japan for the same percentage as the entire  Andean Group.    Consequently, the Andean nations will concentrate their  attention on the Peruvian proposal on 4 April and on the way in  which the proposal will be considered and processed by Andean  Group members.</p>

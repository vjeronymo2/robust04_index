			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / What the experts say Colin Webster commercial director National Power 'It is for government to decide by how much there should be a larger market for British coal over and above the tonnages which have been involved in discussions between the coal producers, the generators and the regional electricity companies. We are both willing and able to use larger amounts of UK-produced coal provided a market can be found for the electricity generated from it and fair mechanisms can be agreed to meet the additional costs.' Generators' monopoly power is criticised in the report which calls for tougher price controls Neil Clarke chairman British Coal 'The report supports our consistently stated view that only a radical transformation of the market would change the prospects of many of our collieries. I am pleased that this report points the way to a more stable and secure future for our miners. It is a cool and rational assessment of the benefit of maintaining a substantial indigenous coal mining business for years to come.' British Coal would get up to Pounds 500m in subsidies over five years to become competitive with world prices John Collier chairman Nuclear Electric 'The recommendations open the way for a secure future for coal and nuclear power in the UK. In particular the committee has taken full account of our argument that there should be no sense in closing our nuclear stations early to make room for coal. . . it's far cheaper to run our stations than to close them. I'm happy with the suggestion that the fossil fuel levy and the company's inherited liabilities should both be taken away from Nuclear Electric.' Nuclear Electric would lose some of its levy revenue, but also some clean-up liabilities John Harris chairman East Midlands Electricity 'I disagree with the suggestion that franchise on the provision of electricity supply should be extended from 1994 to 1998. This will increase electricity prices. But I go along with the general thrust of the report which is that there should be government subsidy to keep pits open. . . The miners will have to ensure that in the next few years their pits will become more competitive. However I would want to see that the subsidy is not open-ended.' Regional suppliers would have to buy electricity generated from UK coal or risk losing licence Tony Craven Walker chief executive Monument Oil &amp; Gas 'In identifying the need to provide for non-domestic quality gas, the committee has recognised the requirement to utilise Britain's energy reserves to maximum efficiency. I welcome the recognition of the project to develop four oil and gas fields in Liverpool Bay, north Wales, which has been suspended pending the outcome of the energy review.' Independent gas projects have been accused of stealing coal's market Arthur Scargill president NUM 'The report is unacceptable to the NUM and to mining communities. In spite of overwhelming evidence, the committee has refused to address the problem of the rigged market which led to the unlawful and irrational closure decisions. We find it incredible and inexplicable. . . that the committee has refused to recommend the phasing out of expensive nuclear power. . . and has not recommended stopping the 'dash for gas'.' Unions may win reprieve for thousands of jobs, but may lose out on cost-cutting Eamonn Butler director Adam Smith Institute 'Any subsidy to coal will cost jobs elsewhere in the oil and gas industries. It will also cost jobs among ordinary taxpayers. Businesses who are finding it difficult at the moment will face higher tax bills and employ less people for less time as a result.' Committee claims the measures are ultimately aimed at fostering a better energy market Lord Melchett executive director Greenpeace 'The committee appears will to have neglected the environment in favour of a quick fix designed to address political expediencies. Instead of subsidising just one declining and polluting industry, the nuclear industry, it is proposing to prop up another, the coal industry, without addressing the long-term future environmental and economic results of such a decision.' Environmentalists may have to face the fact that while many measures would promote clean-coal technology more coal would be burned</p>

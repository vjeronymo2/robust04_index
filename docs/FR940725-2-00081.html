Schwarz, Jr., M.D.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Docket No. 88&hyph;42, 54 FR 16422 (1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering whether grounds exist to revoke Respondent's DEA registration, the administrative law judge found factors one through four relevant in light of the evidence regarding the prescriptions Respondent issued to the informant and undercover police officer; his transfer of controlled substances among patients; the action taken by the Board; and Respondent's subsequent conviction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that the informant obtained Valium from the Respondent on her first visit to him, although she presented no medical condition warranting the prescription. The administrative law judge also found that on the next visit, the informant told Respondent that her boyfriend swapped some of the previously prescribed Valium for Seconal; Respondent warned the informant that she should not use the drug ``just to get high''; and the informant did not indicate any medical need for controlled substances. Nonetheless, Respondent gave the informant a prescription for Seconal. In addition, Respondent issued prescriptions for Seconal for the informant and the undercover officer when they visited him together; when the informant later visited Respondent by herself; and when the officer subsequently visited Respondent by himself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that the Respondent took no medical history and conducted no physical examinations during any of the visits, and that neither of the individuals demonstrated a medical need for the prescriptions they received. Therefore, the administrative law judge found that Respondent's prescriptions to the informant and the officer were not issued for a legitimate medical purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge further found that although Respondent conceded that he was ``lax'' in his prescribing of controlled substances, he has not acknowledged that he abused the privileges he held as a DEA registrant, and that under the circumstances, little credence should be placed upon Respondent's testimony that he will be more careful in the future if permitted to retain his DEA registration in Schedules III through V. Therefore, Judge Bittner concluded that Respondent's continued registration would not be consistent with the public interest, and recommended that Respondent's DEA registration be revoked and that any pending applications be denied. The Respondent filed exceptions to the administrative law judge's recommendation incorporating the arguments in his post-hearing brief filed on July 17, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator having considered the entire record adopts the administrative law judge's findings of fact, conclusion of law, and recommended ruling in its entirety. The Deputy Administrator considered the arguments made by Respondent in his exceptions to the extent already considered by the administrative law judge in rendering her recommendation and adopted herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AB3370967, issued to James H. Brown, M.D., be and it hereby is, revoked, and any pending applications be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 24, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

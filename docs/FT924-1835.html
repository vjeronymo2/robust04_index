			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Caution on Bosnia reflects risks of entanglement MR JOHN MAJOR'S cautious response yesterday to calls for military enforcement of the United Nations no-fly zone over war-torn Bosnia reflects growing concern at the risks of an ever more dangerous military entanglement. As international momentum builds for much tougher action against Serbian forces, senior ministers are engaged in an intense debate about the political and military risks facing the government. Some of Mr Major's colleagues - notably Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary - are concerned that without further restraint Serbia will become increasingly confident in its dismissal of international pressure. Mr Hurd's assessment is that the combination of sanctions and public opprobrium so far has done little to curb the Serbs' territorial ambitions. The end result might be the spread of the present conflict in Bosnia to Macedonia and Kosovo, in turn sparking a full-scale war in the Balkans. His fears are shared by many ministerial colleagues. Yet there is a substantial voice in the cabinet arguing also that Britain cannot run the risk to the lives of 2,400 British troops that would result from a decision by the UN to shoot down Serbian aircraft in the no-fly zone. As one minister put it: 'American planes can safely shoot down Serbian helicopters. They could not prevent the Serbs from retaliating against our ground forces.' Mr Malcolm Rikfind, the defence secretary, has warned repeatedly of the risk of heavy casualties. The most cautious in the cabinet argue also that there is no political pressure on the government to risk the lives of British troops. Although public opinion may be outraged by the barbaric behaviour of Serbian forces, it shares the fears of the government about deeper military involvement. Such tension was evident in Mr Major's response to MPs when he was pressed by Mr John Smith to join the US and France in pressing for a new UN resolution to allow the use of military force to halt Serbian flights. Mr Major - who will discuss the crisis in weekend talks in Washington with President George Bush - was careful not to dismiss the possibility of a new UN resolution. His officials regard it as inevitable. But by emphasising the risks - both to the UN humanitarian effort and to the lives of British troops - he underlined that Britain favoured a steady ratcheting upwards in the pressure on Serbia rather than an immediate 'shoot-to-kill' policy against Serbian aircraft. The prime minister will also suggest to President Bush alternative ways to intensify pressure on the Serbs. Whitehall officials have been drawing up plans to intensify sanctions - possibly including the breaking of telecommunications links and the derecognition of all Serbian diplomats. More controversially, officials have also been examining the possibility of suggesting an end of the blanket UN embargo on arms shipments to the region. Some ministers believe there is a strong moral case to break from traditional international practice and agree to arm the Bosnians, whose equipment is far inferior to that of the Serbs. Even those measures would carry risks. The humanitarian convoys in Bosnia depend on Serbian acquiescence. Were its enemies to be better armed, Serbia might well withdraw such co-operation, attack British troops and pour more of its own regular forces into Bosnia. Against that background, it is easy to understand Mr Major's caution.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 25 POSSIBLE U.S. CAGERS ANNOUNCED  </P> <P> The names of 25 players who survived the first cuts of the U.S. Men's National  Team trials were announced by USA Basketball today, including four players from  the national champion University of Nevada-Las Vegas team.  </P> <P> Nineteen players from the trials, along with six athletes who were granted  waivers, will now converge on Duke University June 15-17 for a mini-camp. There  the team will be cut to 15 to compete in the Goodwill Games in Seattle July  23-29, according to Craig Miller, a spokesman for USA Basketball.  </P> <P> A team of 12 will be dressed for play in the FIBA World Championship game in  Argentina Aug. 8-19, Miller said.  </P> <P> The four-day camp wrapped up Monday night. Forty-seven players attended the  trials.  </P> <P> "We're very pleased with the efforts that were given at the camp," said head  coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke. "It made the decision very difficult, however,  that's the type of decision the selection committee wanted.  </P> <P> "The youngsters who were brought forward give us a lot of versatility. We have  good size, quickness, and a nice mix of youth and experience. We're hoping that  the waiver people will also be available at Duke and we'll cut down to a more  workable number after the mini-camp at Duke."  </P> <P> The 19 athletes who participated in the trials and were selected for the  Durham, N.C. mini-camp include: Kenny Anderson (Georgia Tech); Randy Brown (New  Mexico State); Todd Day (Arkansas); Chris Gatling (Old Dominion); Robert Horry  (Alabama); Robert Hurley (Duke); James Jackson (Ohio State); Christian Laettner  (Duke); Kevin Lynch (Minnesota); Lee Mayberry (Arkansas); Chris Mills  (Arizona); Billy Owens (Syracuse); Mark Randall (Kansas); Sean Rooks (Arizona);  Chris Smith (Connecticut); Doug Smith (Missouri); Bryant Stith (Virginia);  Clarence Weatherspoon (Southern Mississippi), and Henry Williams (North  Carolina-Charlotte).  </P> <P> Six athletes who applied for and were granted a trial waiver include: Greg  Anthony (UNLV); Stacey Augmon (UNLV); Danny Ferry (Duke graduate); Anderson  Hunt (UNLV); Larry Johnson (UNLV), and Alonzo Mourning (Georgetown University).  </P></p>

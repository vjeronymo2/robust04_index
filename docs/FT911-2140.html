			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Unions call for first Tube strike on May 9 UNIONS at London Under-ground called yesterday for a one-day strike a week tomorrow. The strike call came even though they had agreed earlier to talks tomorrow at Acas, the conciliation service, aimed at settling a dispute over job losses. The strike would be the first in a series unless a settlement is reached. Mr Richard Rosser, general secretary of the TSSA white collar union, said he was hopeful for a solution but 'people will have to shift their positions, not least London Underground'. Although London Underground has also agreed to tomorrow's Acas talks it said yesterday that the size of the workforce was an issue for management. The dispute is over London Underground's plan to shed more than 1,000 jobs, reducing the total to 21,500. Management has refused union requests for arbitration through internal railway negotiating machinery. London Underground said it was prepared to go to Acas to explore whether there was any common ground between the two sides. Acas will talk to the unions and management separately; there are no plans for the two sides to meet. The call for a stoppage next Thursday follows a ballot of both the TSSA and RMT unions in which members voted 2-1 in favour of strike action. Mr Rosser said it was necessary to order action soon because his union's legal mandate would run out on May 17. Unions are required by the law to start action within 28 days of the end of a ballot. The RMT and TSSA want to co-ordinate their action. The RMT said: 'We hope the talks will not be a cosmetic meeting.'</p>

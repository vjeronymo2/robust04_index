			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BLOOMINGDALE'S STAFF HEARS NEWS WITH SHOCK, CONFIDENCE  </P> <P> As Bloomingdale's staff prepared to open shop this morning, Chairman Marvin  Traub's somber voice suddenly echoed over the loudspeaker, announcing that the  parent company of their beloved Bloomie's had filed for bankruptcy protection.  </P> <P> "He said this wasn't the beginning of the end and not to worry.  </P> <P> But everyone just stood there. One woman said she felt like World War II had  just been announced," said one employee who sells ties in the century-old  mid-town department store.  </P> <P> But most staff said New York's glitziest store is too special to fall victim to  unpaid bills.  </P> <P> "Bloomingdale's will always be here. New Yorkers will not let it go out of  business. This store is a landmark," one saleswoman in accessories said.  </P> <P> A customer agreed, saying: "It's special, uniquely New York. This store is a  flagship. Take a look at who comes here to shop -- it's the people who set the  style in New York.'  </P></p>

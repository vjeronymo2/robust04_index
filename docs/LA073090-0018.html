			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Say It Ain't So, Joe!: There doesn't seem to be a new dawn for NBC's troubled  "Today" show and its three hosts -- Bryant Gumbel, Deborah Norville and Joe  Garagiola. Despite a revamped format and the return of Garagiola as co-host,  "Today" last week suffered its lowest ratings in nearly seven years, according  to Nielsen audience estimates.  </P> <P> While ABC's "Good Morning America" won its 29th consecutive ratings victory  with a 4.2 average, "Today" was well behind with a 2.9, its lowest average  since the week of Aug. 6, 1983, when it had a 2.8 average. "CBS This Morning"  remained a distant third with a 2.2 average. (Each ratings point represents  921,000 homes.) "Today" is attempting to recover from a ratings slide that  began in January after 13-year veteran Jane Pauley left the show. She was its  co-host when it hit its previous ratings low in 1983.

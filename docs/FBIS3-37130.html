			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, a CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY correspondent  spoke to Mr. Otar Beridze, minister of justice of the Abkhazian  Autonomous Republic, who is a member of a group of experts at  the Moscow negotiations over the statute of Abkhazia. During  the telephone conversation, he said that in comparison with the  first round of the negotiations, the second one was a step  forward because detailed discussion started on the issue of a  future political statute of Abkhazia, of course, within the  context of Georgia's integrity. Delimitation of functions of the  central governing bodies, the parliament, various government  agencies, and other issues have been discussed. The  negotiations stopped at this stage.    During the negotiations, Mr. Otar Beridze said, we had to  speak about the recent tragedy in Galiy Rayon. Based on the  official statements made by our government and the parliament,  our group of experts made an appropriate statement, as well. It  has been published in the Russian press. The text of the  statement was sent to representatives of the United Nations and  the CSCE. The Abkhazian party reacted to our statement in  silence claiming that they did not want to be involved in  arguments since they had their own views on the events.    The issue of the return of refugees was also discussed  during  the negotiations. However, the Abkhazian party still insisted  that the return of the displaced be carried out on the basis of  the filtration. Unfortunately, the Russian representatives  backed up this idea. The Georgian party considered this way of  formulating the problem as absolutely unacceptable.    In conclusion, Otar Beridze said that the group of experts  would still have meetings in Moscow after the third round of  negotiations on the settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict,  planned to be held in Geneva on 22 February.</p>

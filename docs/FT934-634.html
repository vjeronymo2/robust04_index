			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Go-ahead urged for Alusuisse bid Lawson Mardon, the international packaging group, yesterday urged shareholders to accept a CDollars 555m (USDollars 420.4m) takeover offer by Alusuisse-Lonza Holding, the Swiss industrial group. Alusuisse is to proceed with its CDollars 14-per-share cash bid after a month-long examination of Lawson's operations and financial statements. Lawson directors said the offer was 40 per cent above the highest price at which Lawson shares have traded this year. CS First Boston has provided an opinion that the offer is fair to Lawson's public shareholders. The offer expires on January 14. Cragnotti and Partners, the Italian investment group controlled by Mr Sergio Cragnotti, earlier agreed to tender its 52 per cent stake. Mr Cragnotti last week removed a cloud over Lawson by agreeing to a lifetime trading ban and a CDollars 2.7m payment to settle allegations of securities law violations brought by the Ontario Securities Commission. Although Lawson's head office is in Canada, about four-fifths of its revenues come from Europe, especially the UK. Alusuisse, which has substantial packaging interests through its subsidiary A-L Packaging, has been attracted by Lawson's strong market share in the folding carton, flexible packaging and label markets. A-L Packaging is a significant participant in flexible packaging, but its interests are centred on France and Germany. It is keen to expand its product line and its geographic reach.</p>

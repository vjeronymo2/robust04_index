			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAUTE SEATS;  </P> <P> TRACY FONG DESIGNS CHAIRS WITH AN ASIAN FLAVOR AND A SENSE OF HUMOR  </P> <P> IN A FRESH, new melding of Pacific Rim influences, Southern California designer  Tracy Fong is recasting a traditional Asian form in an urbane and inviting new  hybrid that is familiar -- but strikingly futuristic. She updates traditional  rattan, used for centuries for furniture making in the Orient, by combining it  with rich woods, leathers and modern geometric shapes.  </P> <P> Two years out of Pasadena's Art Center College of Design, Fong works at the  family business, Fong Brothers (the longtime L.A. company was called Tropi-Cal  until it was renamed in January). She designs extraordinary chairs that use  common materials in decidedly uncommon ways. In her revolutionary Arc chair, an  ample mahogany base with inverted-pyramid legs joins a metal-framed,  woven-wicker back. Her burgundy Surabaya chair uses rattan peel (the outside of  the rattan palm) as a kind of upholstery fabric over foam.  </P> <P> Fong once studied amusement-park design, and her furniture reflects her subtle  sense of humor. Her Joanne chair, for example, is named for the friend whose  signature scallop-shaped doodle she used as the basis for a seat design. The  strength of Fong's work, a daring break from tradition, lies in her chairs' new  forms -- simple, clean and geometric. At the heart of her work is a painstaking  craftsman ethic. For Fong and the whole new generation of furniture makers,  that is the secret -- and most basic -- ingredient. BARBARA THORNBURG  </P></p>

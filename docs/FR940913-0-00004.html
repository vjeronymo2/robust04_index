			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees Not Converted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees who are not converted to term appointments will become subject to the time limits set out in these regulations when they reach the expiration date of their current appointments. Their appointments may be further extended only in accordance with these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact of Downsizing and Need for Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters expressed concern that imposing more restrictive limits now could inhibit agencies' ability to deal with significant budget reductions and downsizing. They suggested either that authority to extend temporary appointments beyond 2 years be delegated to agencies or that OPM consider mission needs and downsizing when acting on extension requests. One commenter also asked whether agencies would have to request each extension separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the regulations, OPM may approve extensions beyond 2 years (24 months total service) in response to major reorganization, downsizing, or other unusual circumstances. While normal workload fluctuations would not meet this condition, an unusual degree of fluctuation resulting from governmentwide staffing changes and resource reductions may justify extensions. We will entertain requests on that basis and consider each agency's situation on its merits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requests based on agencywide restructuring downsizing would be submitted by the agency's headquarters, specifying the conditions, locations, and timeframe for the extensions. OPM approval would cover all extensions meeting the agreed upon conditions during the authorized time period so there would be no need for individual requests. Agencies would submit individual extension requests to the appropriate OPM service center to meet one-time needs (e.g., to complete construction work delayed by unusually severe weather).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tracking and Documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several agencies stated that their personnel record systems might not provide specific information needed to administer the new requirements (particularly the prohibition against making a new temporary appointment to a position that had been filled by temporary appointment for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, of the preceding 3 years). They stated that their systems may not clearly identify ``same or successor'' positions as defined in the regulations. One agency suggested that the supervisory certification required by the regulations be accepted as documentation that time limits are met. Another agency suggested dropping the certification requirement in line with the NPR recommendation to reduce unproductive paperwork. Some agencies asked how the limits would apply when an agency has several identical jobs in the same commuting area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have adopted the suggestion to use the supervisory certification to document compliance with time limits. This suggestion is consistent with the NPR recommendation to make managers and supervisors accountable for personnel actions. It is also practical a personnel officer or higher level official may not have enough information to determine compliance. The supervisor or manager filling a job knows, or should know, whether it has previously been filled temporarily and whether its duties are substantially the same as a previous temporary position. The supervisory certification is not unproductive paperwork, but is an alternative to more burdensome tracking requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the regulations the time limits apply to positions within the same local commuting area and major subdivision of the agency. We believe each agency can and should identify its own major subdivisions. Often, we expect that these will coincide with the competitive areas established by the agency for RIF. However, in applying these regulations, an agency may use any objective criteria that clearly distinguish separate functional areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When an agency has identical positions within a major subdivision and commuting area,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> successive  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> temporary appointments to those positions would be subject to the 2-year (24 month) aggregate limitation. However, the limit would be calculated separately for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> simultaneous  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> temporary appointments to the positions. The difference is that recurring needs could potentially be met through permanent or term appointments with a less-than-full-time work schedule. Purely temporary needs_regardless of the number of jobs involved_could not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seasonal Positions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal to permit unlimited extensions of temporary appointments to jobs involving less than 6 months (1,040 hours) of seasonal or intermittent work a year raised some practical concerns among managers and employees in agencies with substantial seasonal or intermittent hiring. They believe that managers should not be forced to terminate experienced employees who work more than 6 months in a season to meet emergency or uncontrollable workload demands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When employees are regularly needed for 6 months or more in a year, the seasonal jobs are not truly temporary and should be filled by term or permanent appointments. However, we agree that flexibility is needed when an employee who normally works less than 6 months a year exceeds the limit in a single season. Therefore, the final regulations provide that OPM may approve exceptions to the 6-month limit. We expect that most such exceptions will be requested on a case-by-case basis from the appropriate OPM service center. However, we would consider requests to use an alternative method of calculation (e.g., averaging service over several seasons) if an agency demonstrates that its system and its tracking capacity will produce long-term compliance with the regulation. Requests for approval of alternate methods should be submitted through the agency's headquarters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

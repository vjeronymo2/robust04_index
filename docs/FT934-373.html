			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / German bidder kept in Seoul rail contract race South Korea yesterday said that it was extending negotiations for its Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) high-speed railway project into next year, and that it had asked a German consortium, which had appeared to have lost the battle for the contract, to maintain its offer. The statement seemed to be aimed at putting pressure on GEC-Alsthom, the UK-French transport and engineering group, which is negotiating the high-speed rail contract with the South Korean authorities. GEC-Alsthom, which defeated a consortium headed by Siemens to win the right to negotiate the contract in August, had expected to conclude the deal by the end of this year. Industry observers said that several sticking points remained in the negotiations. These included the terms of technology transfer from the UK-French group to its Korean partners, such as Hyundai Precision Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries. GEC-Alsthom, which builds the French train a grande vitesse (high-speed train), played down the implications of the South Korean decision. 'We remain the priority bidder,' the company said, adding that an extension of negotiations was normal in such an important contract. 'The Korean authorities are trying, perhaps, to increase the pressure on us. That is logical in the course of negotiations,' the UK-French group said. The extension of negotiations and the request to maintain its bid will, however, encourage Siemens and its partners in the German consortium. 'Of course we are still interested,' said an official from AEG, the engineering group which is part of the German consortium. The South Korean contract to build a high-speed line from Seoul to the southern port of Pusan is regarded by the rival groups as a key strategic project, which would leave the winner strongly placed in the international market for high-speed trains. The importance of the contract has prompted fierce competition between GEC-Alsthom and Siemens. The UK-French group was forced to cut its offer price by more than 30 per cent in order to win the right to negotiate the contract.</p>

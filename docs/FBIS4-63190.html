			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Russia sets up a new structure  in its armed Forces -- mobile forces which will include rapid  deployment forces and instant reaction forces, Colonel-General  Vladimir Semyonov, commander-in-chief of these forces, told a  news conference at the main headquarters of the land forces  today.    According to the general, these changes are envisaged by the  military reform and requirements of the main provisions of  Russia's military doctrine. Vladimir Semyonov called the  establishment of the mobile forces a "coerced measure".    "We were forced to do this due to the current political  situation in Russia and the new views developed by military  science and strategy," the commander-in-chief said.    The mobile forces, the colonel-general noted, will be used  at  a "threatening period". With the outbreak of local and other  conflicts, Vladimir Semyonov noted, these forces will be moved  to the necessary regions "for a short period of time". For  instant- reaction forces this period will be twenty-four hours  and for rapid deployment forces -- several days.    The commander-in-chief determined some tasks to be resolved  by the mobile forces: The inadmissibility of spreading of local  conflicts, the localization of large scale conflicts and the  creation of conditions for strategical deployment of Russian  Armed Forces.    The colonel-general believes that the mobile forces will be  best staffed in the Russian Armed Forces. They will also  include units and subunits of land and airborne troops, military  transport and combat aircraft and other units from fighting  services and branches of arms.</p>

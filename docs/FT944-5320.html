			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: Business blockbusters Managing change and setting strategy are the two big corporate imperatives of the moment - and there is no escaping them in the bookshops. A rough search this week unearthed at least 20 current UK business titles with one or other of these words in the name (and sometimes both): the US scorecard probably runs to hundreds. Competing for the Future by Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad (Harvard Business Press, Pounds 21.95) - in many people's view the business blockbuster of the year - has neither change nor strategy on its cover but is unambiguously a book about strategy. Its inspirational approach is calculated to appeal to business leaders bogged down, bored and frustrated by restructuring and business process re-engineering. The central message is that if you are sufficiently imaginative and forward looking there is no limit to what your company can achieve. The bad news is that it is not an easy read. Another 'important' book to get good notices this year wasMichael Goold and Andrew Campbell's Corporate Level Strategy (John Wiley, Pounds 24.95). It develops their 1987 analysis of the three ways in which parent companies typically approach their businesses, namely through financial control (giving individual managers a lot of freedom), strategic planning (meaning close involvement with the development of future plans) and strategic control (somewhere between the other two). Its disturbing conclusion is that most 'multibusiness' companies do not add value to their subsidiaries; rather they destroy it. Less widely acclaimed, but nevertheless a candidate for post-Christmas browsing despite its near 600 pages, is The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook by Peter Senge and others (Nicholas Brealey Publishing, Pounds 19.95). The lead author's previous book, The Fifth Discipline, introduced the now rather overworked idea of the 'learning organisation': his follow up is highly practical, packed with case studies, cross references and (rather pretentiously) wide margins for the executive scribbler. By contrast, Charles Handy's The Empty Raincoat (Century, Pounds 12.99) is both philosophical and a winner, having topped the best seller lists for much of 1994. It is still well worth picking up, even if the main themes seem less provocative than a year ago: those who have missed it thus far may wish to wait for the paperback version due next spring. If Handy has achieved the status of Britain's leading management guru, the man he arguably replaced is as prolific as ever. Sir John Harvey-Jones's All Together Now (Heinemann, Pounds 15) is his new guide to managing people. It discusses recruitment and selection, coaching and the daily management of staff, and attitudes to training technology. The combination of Harvey-Jones and HR (human resources) is unlikely to disappoint. Those looking for a more daring gift, notably modern women married to unreconstructed males, might slip their partner Michael Roper's Masculinity and the British Organisation Man since 1945 (Oxford University Press, Pounds 25). Its conclusion that the classic macho manager is under threat from new technology and corporate restructuring seems bound to irritate. Carrie Herbert's Eliminating Sexual Harassment at Work (David Fulton, Pounds 12.99) - a guide aimed mainly at personnel and training specialists - could prove an equally barbed gesture. On the lighter side, Snapshots from Hell by Peter Robinson (Nicholas Brealey Publishing, Pounds 9.99) is a surprisingly readable - and at times highly entertaining - account of one ex Reagan speechwriter's experience of business school. One for the MBA or would-be MBA who has everything. John O'Keefe's Mind Openers for Managers (Harper Collins, Pounds 5.99) - described as 'magic' by Paul Daniels - is notable for being written by a Mandarin speaking hockey international who is now regional vice-president of Procter and Gamble in Europe. If nothing else, its collection of 'mind opening' riddles, slogans and proverbs is an improvement on what comes out of the average Christmas cracker. (Example: a young boy had never hugged a girl in his life. He wanted to learn about hugging so he got out a book called How to Hug. To his disappointment when he got home he found it was not about how to hug at all. What had happened? Answer: He had taken out a volume of an encyclopedia). At the moment, though, my plan is to relax with Curiosities of Golf by Jonathan Rice (Pavilion Books, Pounds 12.99), which has a delightful cover and from which I have so far extracted the important fact that an unnamed Greek man holed in one at the 135-yard 8th hole on the pitch and putt course at Edgwarebury, Hertfordshire in 1978 - apparently the only golf shot he ever struck. Now that sounds like a real business book . . .</p>

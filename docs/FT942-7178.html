			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Tepco surprises with profit rise Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the world's largest private sector electric utility company, reported a slight increase in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31. Unconsolidated pre-tax earnings were Y159.9bn (Dollars 1.5bn), up 1 per cent on the previous year, on turnover higher by 0.4 per cent at Y4,721bn. The figures surprised analysts, who had expected a difficult economic and regulatory environment to be reflected in lower earnings. Last autumn, Tepco was required by the government to cut its charges to offset windfall gains caused by the appreciation of the yen. A large proportion of the company's costs are oil imports, which fell in price as the yen rose, and Tepco's tariffs were reduced by an average 1.6 per cent. Higher demand brought on by a cold winter partially offset the impact of lower prices, but the overall effect was to depress operating profit by 2.5 per cent. However, sharply lower interest rates boosted earnings at the pre-tax level. Like most utility companies, Tepco carries a heavy debt burden, and the steep fall in the cost of borrowing throughout the year cut interest costs. A company spokesman said that debt service costs were around Y4bn lower than had been forecast at the half-year. The company expects a difficult 1994. Last week the government announced that utility charges would be frozen for the coming year, and Tepco forecast a 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y140bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova report: "Hard Work and Fine Words"] </F>   [Text] Most politicians who took part in the Civic Accord  Assembly came along with the firm intention of signing the  Treaty on Social Accord. Your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent  was told by Anatoliy Tyazhlov, head of the Moscow Oblast  administration, that he like others is carrying out the  population's mandate. "The people have told us politicians on  many occasions: Stop these battles and finally get down to the  business of the economy and the social program." That is what  we must now tackle in earnest, A. Tyazhlov believes. It is his  conviction that the process of accord should "go downward": At  any rate the oblast leadership intends to implement a similar  conciliation procedure in the Moscow region. The Treaty must  not be just an action on the part of Moscow and the Kremlin.    The Democratic Party of Russia is insisting on the Treaty's  being given real substance; it is pressing for the process to be  continued in conciliation procedures and for common solutions to  be found in the economy and in policy, foreign policy included.  Its leader Nikolay Travkin believes that the Treaty is designed  to "launch the process" and is therefore essential as the first  step on this difficult road. Federation Council member Vladimir  Podoprigora is convinced that the signing is an extremely  important moment, heralding an end to the stereotypical quest  for an enemy that has become entrenched over many decades.  People may express different political ideas, but they realize  that the interests of society and the country are paramount and  so renounce confrontation. The deputy hopes that a social  atmosphere geared to accord can also prevail upon the hardline  opposition, but in order for this he thinks it necessary to stop  bad-mouthing those who have not signed the treaty. The  opposition's opinion must be taken into consideration in order  to adjust one's own policy and formulate the optimum state  decisions.    This idea was indirectly reaffirmed by Gennadiy Zyuganov,  leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, who did  not sign the treaty but said in the lobbies that the idea of  accord is not alien to Communists and they will do their part to  secure accord. But we would like to see concrete steps from the  president and the government, G. Zyuganov said. We would like  to see dialogue, support for the agro-industrial complex, and a  real fight against corruption.    Representatives of the "Yabloko" deputies' faction did not  sign the agreement on civic peace yesterday either. But that  does not mean that the faction renounces accord, so one of its  leaders, Vladimir Lukin, said. On the contrary it is willing to  take an active part in all specific measures to establish real  civic peace and promote real reforms, movement toward democracy,  and maximum accord during this movement.    Nor did the Textile and Light Industry Workers' Trade Union  immediately decide to subscribe to the Treaty. The position in  the sector is a complex one, the trade union's chairman, Tatyana  Sosnina, said. We held a protest action and picketed the  government building but then we met with Viktor Chernomyrdin,  decisions were adopted regarding support for the sector, and a  sectoral wage agreement was signed. After which the presidium  and the trade union's grassroots organizations authorized their  leader to sign the treaty. Tatyana Sosnina believes that the  treaty should be supplemented with concrete documents and that  there should be economic "roundtables," where trade unions could  highlight their position and protect working people's interests.    The document will work, Federation Council Deputy Chairman  Valeryan Viktorov said, if all contracting parties really want  to make definite concessions and compromises. The stabilization  of the economic processes is undoubtedly one of the main  conditions for accord in society. But the economy is now  perhaps to a greater extent the hostage of politics, he said.  If we can reach accord, things will be easier in the economy  too. And the reverse will also happen: A normal economy will  gradually stabilize the political process.    Everyone needs social accord. It is essential above all in  order to extricate Russia from the protracted and profound  economic crisis. As Akhsarbek Galazov, president of North  Ossetia, said figuratively, it is necessary to unite in order  for everyone to survive our cold political winter and to save  Russia.</p>

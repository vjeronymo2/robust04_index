			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Hong Kong brothers may buy debt THE Hong Kong brothers negotiating to acquire Battersea Power station and its 31-acre site in south London confirmed yesterday that they would start by buying the bank debt on the development. The deal to buy out the debt, which is expected to be concluded within the next few days, will be the first stage in gaining overall control of the site which is owned by Battersea Leisure, a company controlled by Mr John Broome, the property developer and theme-park owner. Mr George and Mr Victor Hwang - the brothers who also go under the name Wong, the western equivalent of their name - will in effect become Mr Broome's lenders on the site which they will then be able to claim as collateral for loans which are in default. The size of the debt has not been disclosed but with interest it is likely by now to be more than Pounds 100m. The banking syndicate led by Bank of America is likely to be selling the debt at a considerable discount. Just how or when the transfer of the site to the Hwangs will happen is not yet clear but it is understood that Mr Broome's role in the development is unlikely to continue for a great length of time although a decision on his role has not yet been made. It emerged yesterday that Mr Broome had been facing increasing pressure over the past month from the local authority, Wandsworth, over more than Pounds 200,000 of outstanding building and legal fees owed by Battersea Leisure. Mr Broome has just over a week to appeal against a court decision taxing him for an estimated Pounds 20,000 in legal costs involved in the council's legal pursuit of Pounds 170,000 owed on overdue building fees. The sum of Pounds 170,000 was agreed to in an out-of-court settlement by all the parties concerned last summer but remains unpaid. Mr Guy Senior, chairman of the council's planning committee, said yesterday that over the last month the issue has been the subject of renewed correspondence and meetings between Mr Broome and the council. Mr Senior said: 'We have made it clear that if we do not receive the money we are owed we shall seek to have a statutory order served on the company and have it declared insolvent.'</p>

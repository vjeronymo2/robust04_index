The poll reveals that the public cannot help but feel  concerned about the deterioration of local politics, a  phenomenon which is spreading and striking down to the roots. Of  the numerous local political irregularities, the worst one is  the abuse of power by local government officials in buying and  reselling land for profit. This problem has reached a serious or  very serious extent, according to as many as one-third of the  voters. [passage omitted]    In addition, embezzlement, corruption, and the  underworld's interference in politics have become so serious  that the public cannot remain indifferent. Over one-fifth of the  voters (22.5 percent) point out unequivocally that embezzlement  and corruption have become a rather serious problem among local  governments. Another serious problem, in the opinion of  one-fifth of the public (20.2 percent), is interference in  politics by the underworld.    In terms of counties and cities, the voters hold that  political deterioration is most serious in Taipei, Taoyuan, and  Tainan counties. These counties, they say, are the top three as  far as embezzlement, corruption and land speculation by local  officials are concerned. Among the interviewees in Taoyuan, 73.1  percent point out the seriousness of land speculation by county  officials. The same problem is revealed by nearly 70 percent of  the interviewees in both Taipei and Tainan counties. Meanwhile,  as many as 77.4 percent of the interviewees in Taipei County say  that abuse of power by local councilors in buying and reselling  land for profit has reached a serious extent.    The problem that government officials and councilors are  profiteering from land speculation by taking advantage of their  privileges, such as access to land rezoning plans, is not  limited to just a few counties and cities. More than one-half of  the interviewees in 10 of the province's 21 counties and cities  hold that land speculation by local officials and councilors has  become a serious problem (counties and cities where land  speculation by government officials has reached a serious extent  are Taoyuan County, Tainan County, Taipei County, Taichung City,  Hsinchu County, Taichung County, Tainan City, Changhua County,  Hualien County, and Chia-I City; those with a serious problem of  land speculation by councilors are Taipei County, Taichung City,  Tainan County, Tainan City, Chia-I City, Taichung County,  Pingtung County, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City, and Keelung City).    In addition to embezzlement and land speculation, the  rampancy of the underworld is another cause for public concern.  Yunlin County, Chia-I City, and Changhua County are the three  places noted for the rampancy of the "underworld." About  one-half of the local public say that the underworld's  interference in politics is serious.    However, what makes us feel relieved is that despite the  worsening situation in most counties and cities, there are some  comparatively clean places. In Ilan County, Nantou County, and  Hsinchu City, only less than 20 percent of the people say that  their local governments have a serious problem of embezzlement  and corruption.    As for who should be held responsible for the  deteriorating political style, close to one half (45.5 percent)  of the voters agree the chief reason for the worsening situation  is that political parties need assistance from land-holding  financial groups and the underworld in winning the election.    Now that all political parties and candidates are well  aware of the voters' discontent with interference in politics by  landholding financial groups and the underworld and are trying  to break off relations with them, what are the images of the  candidates of various parties in the eyes of voters?    According to the poll, though the Kuomintang has put forth  the slogan of "opposing embezzlement and ferreting out vote  buying" in its election campaign, the voters' greatest concern  is still the relations between the Kuomintang candidates and  land holding financial groups, considering the fact that it is  hard for the Kuomintang, a longtime ruling party, to sever its  mutually dependent ties with local political factions and  financial groups. Close to 40 percent (37 percent) of the voters  express concern about the Kuomintang candidates' relations with  land holding financial groups.    Although the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] has  pledged to be corruption-free, still over one-quarter (26.3  percent) of the voters express concern about the relations  between the DPP candidates and land holding financial groups.  [passage omitted]    While the Kuomintang and DPP candidates, in the voters'  eyes, have different degrees of relations with land holding  financial groups, the two big parties' relations with the  underworld are more or less the same and equally deserve concern  according to about one-third of the voters.    Of the three principal parties, the Chinese New Party  [CNP], which was founded not long ago, has nominated only a few  candidates for the election. The vast majority of the public  still take a cautious and reserved attitude toward this party,  which styles itself as a party "opposed to embezzlement and with  a new clean image." Upwards of 60 percent of the voters say that  they are unclear about the CNP candidates' relations with land  holding financial groups and the underworld.    Who should be held responsible for the serious political  irregularities and the deteriorating social and political style  in various localities? Now that all kinds of political  irregularities have sprung up, who should be relied upon to  improve the local political style? Most people say it is  necessary to rely upon "the public themselves." It appears that  the awakening of the local "people's force" has loomed up in our  country.    According to the poll, over 30 percent of the people  interviewed hold that "the public themselves" should undertake  the greatest responsibility for the deteriorating local  political style, and they are also most capable of improving the  situation. [passage omitted]    Apart from the public, county magistrates and city mayors,  usually regarded as the local people's parental officials,  should also bear the primary responsibility for the  deteriorating local political style (26.9 percent). In some  people's opinion, county magistrates and city mayors, who  control local resources and are responsible for local  development, are the next capable persons to improve the local  political style--they are only second to the public in such  capability (20.8 percent).    To improve the local political style, voters not only "put  demands on themselves," but also place high expectations on the  news media which sways public opinion. "Exposure of inside  information by the media can help make the people aware of  government officials' embezzlement and their abuse of power for  land speculation. It can also reeducate the people," says an  individual in the interview.    A fact worthy of attention: As far as individuals are  concerned, the public believe that, in the central government,  President Li, holding the nation's supreme power and noted for  his strong leadership, is the most capable person to improve the  local political style; his importance in this regard surpasses  the premier, the president of the Judicial Yuan, the minister of  justice, and the provincial governor. This opinion is, on the  one hand, indicative of President Li's prestige among the  people. On the other hand, it shows the expectation that the  people put on the highest official in the hope that "action at  the top will be followed by those below and will set an example  for the people." This matter deserves earnest consideration by  President Li, who has evoked the people's concern because of his  frequent uses of an "illegally established golf court" and the  purchase of an expensive villa in Tahsi.    With regard to the concrete steps to begin with in  improving the local political style, many people hope that the  government will "take down-to-earth action to arrest embezzlers  and members of the underworld" (45.2 percent). As for the people  themselves, some express the hope to use their ballots to  boycott those candidates supported by land holding financial  groups and the underworld (36.3 percent).    Ironically, among the four choices of action to improve  the political style, the "Sunshine Act," which used to be  considered as a very promising approach, is not well supported  by the people interviewed. As a matter of fact, in the lists of  public servants' assets released separately of late, the  disputable "super-low property value" disclosed by a number of  officials has become a topic of people's leisure conversation in  our country. The result of the poll in this respect seems to  reflect that the public have not much confidence in the  "Sunshine Act." [passage omitted]</p>

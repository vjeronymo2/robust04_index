			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Output figures give little hope for US recovery FURTHER falls in housing starts and industrial production yesterday appeared to offer little prospect of an early US recovery from recession. The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 9 per cent in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000. But the fall was influenced by weather fluctuations and may have been a reaction to a sharp increase in starts in February. Building permits - regarded as the best guide to future construction activity - rose 2 1/2 per cent. The second consecutive monthly increase suggests that January may have marked the low point of the housing cycle. Industrial production fell 0.3 per cent last month. This was roughly in line with Wall Street expectations and represented an easing of the rate of decline after falls in factory output of 0.5 per cent and 0.9 per cent in January and February respectively. Officials said industrial production declined at an annual rate of just over 9 per cent in the first quarter as a whole. This compared with an annual rate of decline of 7 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. The latest figures, which follow reports of a 0.8 per cent decline in retail sales in March and weak car sales in early April, offer little comfort for economists expecting a rapid economic rebound following victory in the Gulf war. The consensus view, however, remains that the recession will bottom out sometime during the summer. The Federal Reserve appears to be adopting a 'wait and see' approach. Having left short-term interest rates uncut last week, it may now wait until April employment figures are available in early May before reassessing its monetary stance. In the first quarter, housing starts were 12 per cent lower than in the final quarter of last year. But in spite of the dip last month, starts in March were nearly 6 1/2 per cent above the low point reached in January. The decline in industrial production last month was broadly based, reflecting continued weakness in business equipment, construction supplies, and durable materials. Capacity utilisation dropped 0.4 points to 78.7 per cent, its lowest level since autumn 1986. Total production in March was 3.3 per cent below its level of a year ago and nearly 5 per cent below the peak hit last September.</p>

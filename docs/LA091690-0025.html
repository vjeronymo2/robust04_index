			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAND DELUSIONS;  </P> <P> ARABISM: SADDAM HUSSEIN IS BUT THE LATEST MIDDLE EAST LEADER WHO WOULD UNITE  THE LONG-DIVIDED ARAB WORLD -- AND TIME IS ON HIS SIDE  </P> <P> The unrealized dream of a unified Arab world is a potent and enduring force in  Arab politics. To the outsider, however, this may seem off: The Arab people are  victimized, first and foremost, by their own governments and leaders. Many  Arabs enthusiastically agree. But they would add that the source of the problem  lies in the drive of the outsider to divide, manipulate and weaken the Arab  world.  </P> <P> Indeed, until the 20th Century, borders meant very little in the Middle East.  Historically, it was the city, not the state, that was the significant  political unit. Even today, when an Arab traveller indicates he is en route to  Cairo or Damascus, the words he uses could also be translated to mean "Egypt"  or "Syria." The territorial states that have emerged were literally innovations  imposed by Euorpeans.  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein, like aspiring Arab nationalists before him, promises to shape  the region along Arab lines and to thwart efforts to keep the Arab world  divided unto itself. Although his promises sound cynical and transparently  self-serving, it would be wrong to dismiss the power of his words. The longer  the Iraqi leader is able to hold out against the world, the more credible his  calls for widespread Arab support will become. The well-worn vernacular of Arab  nationalism may be his most effective weapon.  </P> <P> Arab nationalism -- the idea that the Arabs constitute a single distinctive  nation united by a history and a common language -- emerged only in the latter  half of the 19th Century. But it was not transformed into effective political  programs until the post-World War II era, when the Arabs broke free of their  European masters.  </P> <P> The ideal of Pan-Arabism is reflected in the voting rules of the Arab League,  which call for decision-making by consensus. In the continuing Persian Gulf  crisis, the rule has been set aside, a measure of the strength of the response  evoked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> It is no accident that minorities -- Christians and heretical Muslims -- have  often been enthusiastic proponents of Arab nationalism. By appealing to a  universal identity, they hope to mask the qualities that make them different.  In the government-controlled press of Iraq and Syria, the sectarian groups that  make up society are virtually never discussed, except as anti-Arab enemies of  the nation. Hafez Assad of Syria, whose Alawite sect accounts for less than 15%  of Syria's population, claims his country to be the beating heart of Arab  nationalism, of which he is its leading advocate.  </P> <P> In Iraq, the politically dominant Sunni Muslims make up less than 25% of the  population but, buttressed by Baathism (Arab renaissance), Hussein emphasizes  his nationalist credentials, not his sectarian ones. In reality, both countries  are more like rival family businesses than governments.  </P> <P> The ideology that underpins each regime is drawn from Baathism, which advocates  the creation of a larger Arab nation as the ultimate expression of freedom.  Damascus and Baghdad each claim to be Baathism's authentic voice. In both  capitals, Syria and Iraq are formally described as merely regions of the larger  Arab nation. In practice, Syria has shown no desire to extend its influence to  Iraq. But Iraq -- larger, richer, more powerful -- has shown no such reticence.  </P> <P> Baathism has a significant following in Lebanon, as well as in the Arab states  of the Persian Gulf. Reportedly, the pro-Iraq branch of the party has made  significant inroads into Mauritania, where Iraq has spread dinars generously  and built a base of popular support. Mauritania may be important as a site for  the testing of Iraqi rocket missiles, so there is a practical basis for this  far-afield effort to spread the word according to Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nasserism  </P> <P> No Arab leader has been able to duplicate the appeal of President Gamal Abdul  Nasser of Egypt, whose emotional speeches moved an Arab generation. The  high-water mark of his influence came in 1958, when Syria fused with Egypt to  become the United Arab Republic. This experiment in unification ended three  years later, when Egyptian control began to wear away and the Syrians grew  weary of playing junior partner.  </P> <P> Even after his catastrophic defeat in the Six Day War in 1967, Nasser  maintained his grip on the political soul of the Arab world, where he was  simply referred to as al-raais (the president). Once asked to define the Arab  nation, he answered that it ends where his propaganda no longer arouses an  echo. Nasser's dreams were put to rest by his successor, Anwar Sadat, who  concluded that rhetoric would not feed Egypt.  </P> <P> The man who proclaimed himself heir to Nasserism was Moammar Kadafi, the  unguided missile who has led Libya for the past 20 years and whom President  Sadat once described as being "crazy in the head." Kadafi is the undisputed  record holder for the most numerous schemes to unify the Arab world. During his  reign, he has signed unification agreements with four Arab states -- Egypt,  Morocco, Tunisia and Syria. It is widely presumed that it is not Kadafi's  personal magnetism that attracts partners, but his money.  </P> <P> In one of his many memorable remarks, the Libyan leader noted, after signing  the unification agreement with Syria in 1980: "Either Libya turns into a  unionist state and merges with Syria and bears the losses of the Arab nation,  or I shall go to the Galilee as a commando myself with my rifle." Commando  Moammar was never spotted in northern Israel, but the abortive Syrian-Libyan  merger did enliven a few political poster collections.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Greater Syria  </P> <P> The states of the Fertile Crescent -- Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon -- were  created, with some reluctance, by Britain and France out of the spoils of World  War I. Britain, most especially France, aimed to hold onto the Arab mandates  they were granted by the League of Nations in 1920.  </P> <P> With its large Christian community, Lebanon was a natural ally of France, so  Paris carved liberal chunks out of Syria to create what was hoped to be a  viable "Greater Lebanon." The added areas, of course, were inhabited by  fast-growing Muslim communities, which would outnumber Christians within a few  decades.  </P> <P> The Syrian state is technically younger than that of Lebanon. But Syria is a  venerable place name -- cited even in the Bible. The geographical excisions  performed by France did not heal well. Instead, they have kept the idea alive,  among some Syrians, that Lebanon is properly a part of Syria.  </P> <P> The idea of a Greater Syria -- including Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine -- as a  geographical and cultural unit has reverberated in Arab politics for decades.  It was enthusiastically promoted by King Abdallah, the ruler of Jordan and the  grandfather of King Hussein, until his assassination in 1951.  </P> <P> Syria gave birth to the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, which ven includes the  island of Cyprus in its definition of Greater Syria. The party, a rival to the  Baath party, is illegal in Syria, but it still counts a few thousand adherents  in Lebanon, which is a political museum of Middle East parties and movements.  </P> <P> President Assad's frequent reference to Syria as the "beating heart of Arab  nationalism" is not without reason. Damascus was the principal setting for much  of the formative writing on Pan-Arabism, and Assad has been true to that  tradition.  </P> <P> But during his 20-year tenure as Syrian president, Assad has sought to  establish a loose association of pliant regimes atop of which he would  skillfully, but quietly, call the important shots. Assad's dream has been  frustrated by Lebanon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Greater Iraq?  </P> <P> There is no question that Hussein sees himself as a man of history -- indeed, a  redeemer of history. As one of his Iraqi admirers said recently, Iraqi leaders  200 years from now want their people to look back on the era of Hussein.  </P> <P> In large measure, the Iraqi president owes his rise to regional prominence to  the revolution in non-Arab Iran. Following the fall of the Shah, it was feared  that the self-styled "Islamic Revolution" of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini would  lurch across the Middle East like a crazed behemoth; Iraq quickly emerged as  the state that could tame the beast.  </P> <P> Hussein, of course, had his own problems with the new regime in Iran. Over half  of Iraq's population is Shiite Muslim, and in the fervor of the moment, it was  thought that the appearance of the revolution might prove overwhelming to him.  As it turned out, the ayatollah's dream of exporting the revolution proved  easier said than done. It foundered in Iraq and, over time, even in  disintegrating Lebanon.  </P> <P> Seizing upon the chaos and disorganization gripping revolutionary Iran, Hussein  invaded in September, 1980. His goal was to redraw his border with Iran,  thereby grabbing the rich, Arab-inhabited oil fields of Khuzistan. Among  Hussein's firmest supporters -- in addition to the United States, France and  Britain -- was the Emirate of Kuwait.  </P> <P> A cursory glance at a map of the gulf indicates the significance of Kuwait to  Hussein. Even if the tiny state were not awash in oil, it would still be a key  geographic impediment to Iraq's access to the sea.  </P> <P> Hussein has not, of course, invented Iraq's claims on Kuwaiti territory. Since  Kuwait's independence in 1961, Iraq has towered over its tiny neighbor like a  sullen bully. In 1961, an Iraqi invasion was only forestalled by the prompt  intervention of the British; in 1973, the Kuwaiti prime minister was bluntly  told that Iraq would not recognize Kuwait's independence unless it agreed to  cede the oil-rich and strategically located islands of Warda and Bubiyan. Iraq  enforced her claims by unilaterally deploying soldiers on Kuwaiti territory.  </P> <P> For the moment, Hussein's dream of a greater Iraq is checked by an  international consensus. But he is, as the Arab proverb advises, a man who will  kiss a dog in order to take something from it. His remarkable opening to Iran  has already produced a restoration of diplomatic relations and a modest breach  in the economic blockade. Clearly, it would be a great mistake to underestimate  him, or the appeal of his nationalist message.  </P> <P> Pan-Arabism may be a delusion, but men have chased delusions throughout  history, often with disastrous consequences. Arbitrary borders, autocratic  government and political failure combine to form potent negative evidence of  the cost of division and the failure of the Arab world to successfully confront  Israel. Hussein offers to rectify this.  </P> <P> It is not surprising that many, but by no means all, Arab governments resist  and resent his offer. But Arabs living under oppression and in privation are a  natural support base for Hussein; it was entirely predictable that stateless  Palestinians would find inspiration in his words of Arab nationalism.  </P> <P> Since the death of Nasser, the Arab world has been waiting for a hero. Others  -- Assad, Kadafi -- have tried out for the role and failed. Now it is Hussein's  turn. The longer he succeeds in frustrating the efforts of George Bush and  Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the more difficult it will become for his Arab opponents  to stand shoulder to shoulder with his enemies. Delusion or not, the dream of  an Arab nation is a powerful one, and it looks as though Hussein will wield the  dream more skillfully than his opponents have presumed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Four Unfulfilled Dreams: The vision of one Arab nation united by a common  history and language has been a driving force in Arab politics. In part, the  region's history since World War II can be told in a series of maps reflecting  how successive Arab leaders would realize that dream.  </P> <P> Nasser's Dream: Egypt and Syria  </P> <P> Saddam's Dream: Iran, Kuwait, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and 'Palestine'  </P> <P> Assad'd Dream: Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and 'Palestine'  </P> <P> Khomeini's Dream: Iran, Southern Iraq, Lebanon, Kuwait, Gulf coast of Saudi  Arabia and Bahrain  </P></p>

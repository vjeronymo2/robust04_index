			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pressure on ICI STOCK market prospects for ICI shares continued to dwindle yesterday as even the most enthusiastic analysts felt constrained to lower profit forecasts for the chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant. The shares were down 24 at the day's low but rallied to close 14 off at 1021p. In spite of being a buyer of the stock, Mr Andrew Benson, BZW's chemicals analyst, reduced his current year forecast by Pounds 140m to Pounds 560m and shaved next year's estimate by Pounds 20m to Pounds 750m. The current year figure brings BZW near the level of Smith New Court's, the superbear, which has consistently led market forecasts downwards and which produced lower predictions on Tuesday. Mr Benson acknowledges the dragging effect of an uncompetitive pound and the slowdown in the European chemicals industry. However, he still believes in the fundamental value of the company and its scope for growth. Although viewed as the classic stock to track the All-Share Index, ICI has underperformed dramatically since the end of September, when the first reassessments of the company's prospects began to appear. Glaxo downgraded An early rise for Glaxo was sharply reversed after analysts in the US and UK cut their forecasts and ratings for the international drugs group. Smith Barney, the US securities house, downgraded several pharmaceutical stocks and removed Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham from its recommended list. Analyst Ms Christina Heuer, traditionally one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Glaxo, lowered her ratings on a number of stocks because of concern over slowing sales growth, potential healthcare legislation and earnings expansion. In the UK, Lehman Brothers cut its earnings per share growth estimate to 13 per cent from 16 per cent and downgraded its rating on the stock. The moves follow a sweeping reassessment of the sector by Goldman Sachs at the end of last week. Glaxo was up 12 in early trading but ended a net 25 down at 756p. SmithKline 'A' fell 21 to 504p and the Units 20 to 442p. Reckitt &amp; Colman rallied 19 to 624p after weakness prompted by downgradings. The two classes of HSBC shares were the pick of the bank sector, the London-registered stock moving ahead 4 to 478p and the Hong Kong stock closing 7 higher at 464p, after suggestions of buy notes from at least two of the big London broking firms. The boost to Standard Chartered's balance sheet from the sale of its Hong Kong headquarters continued to sustain the shares, which gained 2 at 570p. Shares in Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, maintained their upward trend, settling a further 3 firmer at 322p with dealers noting good demand for the stock from one of the market's leading broking houses and at least two sizeable agency crosses executed at 320p a share. Reports that Warburg Securities had recommended a switch from the composite insurers into Prudential saw the latter move up 3 to 308p. Guardian Royal was the worst of the composites, the shares sliding 9 to 173p on 1.8m traded. Worries about the impact of the current round of price cutting in the package holiday business were generally shrugged aside and Airtours, rallied well to close 3 ahead at 278p. A number of second-line media and printing companies performed strongly as investors looked for recovery stocks. BZW was highlighting the potential for several, particularly advertising agency Gold Greenlees Trott. The bank's media specialist Mr Vighnesh Padiachy believes the shares will outperform the All-Share Index next year and says; 'They could quite easily double if there is a UK recovery.' GGT improved 13 to 251p. Meanwhile, Abbot Mead Vickers rose 20 to 402p, Watmough lifted 20 to 540p and Portals gained 10 to 475p. Engineer Siebe dropped 6 to 438p as analysts questioned the recent strong performance. Some have been saying that the group might be building up to a bid which would necessitate a fairly heavy rights issue. One suggested that Siebe was casting its eye over Midlands-based Glynwed International (off 3 at 357p). Elsewhere in the sector, TI Group lost 13 at 308p as investors' interest in the stock subsided. Concern that at about 4.5 per cent the yield does not offer enough protection also affected the stock. Wheway halved in price to 6p after announcing that it had called off merger talks with McLeod Russel Holdings. Wheway also announced a full-year loss of Pounds 3.5m after exceptionals and no dividend. P &amp; O fell 16 to 500p on profit-taking moved in following the move by European rating agency IBCA to downgrade P&amp;O's senior long term debt rating to A from A plus. The oil sector was one of the few areas of the market to register good gains, with sentiment helped by a firm showing by the dollar and minor progress by crude oil prices. BP managed a 3 rise at 237 1/2 p on good turnover of 5.6m while Shell, with its impressive balance sheet and dividend growth prospects, moved up 4 to 549p after above-average turnover of 6.1m shares. There was no shortage of buyers for Lasmo, 2 up at 156p on 3.4m, after the oil flow from the well drilled on 16/12a 18 in the South Birch field in the North Sea in which Lasmo has a 58.85 per cent stake. The latest exploration success off Burma by Premier Consolidated Oilfields triggered another good performance by Premier shares which moved up to 25 1/2 p before settling a net  1/2 up at 24 1/2 p. Turnover jumped to over 4m shares. Cairn Energy was another to make good progress, the shares adding 2 more to 34p, for a two-day gain of 5. The recent surge was triggered by a strong buy recommendation issued by Strauss Turnbull, highlighting the strong Details of an oil discovery 23b in the North Sea by a consortium led by Amerada Hess promoted a surge of buying interest in Pict Petroleum and Aran Energy, both of which are involved in the discovery. Aran rose 1 1/2 to 18 1/2 p, while Pict edged up 3 to 101p. The see-saw performance of recent newcomer Tadpole Technology continued. The shares, raced up to 168p yesterday before easing to close a net 11 higher at 162p. BICC, the cables to engineering group, moved up a further 4 to 336p, responding to a positive note published by BZW. The broking house highlighted BICC's improving cashflow and recovery profile.

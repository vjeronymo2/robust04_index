			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by al-'Amaliqah Forces' Commander Colonel 'Ali </F> al-Ja'ithi; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] From this area in the Abyan Governorate and from  the al-'Amaliqah camp in the town of Zinjibar, I am happy to  reassure our people and all our colleagues and brothers in the  Armed Forces that the situation in the Abyan Governorate is  stable and that our Armed Forces are completely in control of  the governorate and that the Armed Forces units and al-'Amaliqah  men are on the outskirts of Aden, only 15 to 20 km from Aden.  The fighting is continuing with a great momentum and with high  morale. What is rumored by the media of the secessionists,  liars, and charlatans, the advocates of apostasy and secession,  is baseless. Their units have been liquidated, whether in  Abyan, the 20th Brigade, the Madram Brigade, or the [YSP]  militia and party units here, as well as all of the units they  sent to Abyan such as the 30th Brigade, the Unity Brigade  dispatched from Hadhramaut, and the 5th Brigade that arrived  from Aden. These units were confronted with firmness, faith,  and with high morale and a great number of them were destroyed.    The enemy is being utterly defeated. Its defeat has been  reflected in its psychology. It has now started to hit cities  and civilians with missiles and artillery. We have avoided  fighting in cities because we regard ourselves as protectors of  people and citizens. We have avoided that in order to preserve  citizen's lives and property. But the defeated and the confused  ones choose civilians as their victims.</p>

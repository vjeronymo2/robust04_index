Out of 275  deputies, four abstained, 179 voted for, and 92 voted against  investigating Mitsotakis' responsibility, while six deputies  abstained, 164 voted for, and 106 voted against investigating  Bakoyianni's responsibility.    The Chamber of Deputies had earlier rejected a proposal  submitted by New Democracy [ND] deputies to hold a joint debate  on the phone-tapping issue involving Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou during 1985-1989. The rejection of the proposal  caused the postponement of the relevant prosecution to be lifted.    PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], KKE [Greek Communist  Party], and Political Spring supported the formation of an  investigative committee. Political Spring voted against an  investigation into Bakoyianni's responsibilities in the  phone-tapping scandal.    Addressing the Chamber of Deputies, Mitsotakis and  Bakoyianni  denied all charges. Mitsotakis said that the man who revealed  the issue, Khristos Mavrikis, was paid to implicate him and his  daughter. He stressed that although he challenged Papandreou to  accept a joint investigation of the 1985-1989 phone tappings,  the entire issue should be dropped.    Discussing Mavrikis, Bakoyianni said that contrary to  Mavrikis' allegations, she did not own the house on Arvaniou  Street during the disputed period.    Eleven ND deputies, nine PASOK deputies, two KKE deputies,  and one Political Spring deputy did not attend yesterday's  Chamber of Deputies session.</p>

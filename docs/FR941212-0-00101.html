L. 89&hyph;506; 80 Stat. 306), Pub. L. 93&hyph;253, 16 March 1974 (88 Stat. 50), and Pub. L. 97&hyph;124, 29 December 1981, and as implemented by the Attorney General's Regulations (28 CFR 14.1&hyph;14.11). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.70  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Scope. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) This subpart prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural requirements for the administrative settlement of claims against the United States under the FTCA and the implementing Attorney General's Regulations (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix H) based on death, personal injury, or damage to or loss of property that accrues on or after 18 January 1967. If a conflict exists between this subpart and the Attorney General's Regulations, the latter governs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Citations to cases interpreting and applying the FTCA are contained in the Federal Tort Claims Handbook provided by USARCS. That handbook should be used in conjunction with this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.71  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims payable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Unless otherwise prescribed, claims for death, personal injury, or damage to or loss of property (real or personal) are payable under this subpart if the injury or damage is caused by negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of military personnel or civilian employees of the DA or DOD while acting within the scope of their employment under circumstances in which the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred. The FTCA is a limited consent to liability without which the United States is immune. Similarly, there is no Federal cause of action created by the Constitution that would permit a damage recovery because of the Fifth Amendment or any other constitutional provision. Immunity must be expressly waived, as by the FTCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) An ``employee of the Government'' (28 U.S.C. 2671) includes the following categories of tortfeasors for which the Army is responsible: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Military personnel (members of the Army), including but not limited to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Members on full-time active duty in a pay status, including members_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Assigned to units performing active service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Serving as ROTC instructors.

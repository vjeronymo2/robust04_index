			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Ciments Francais sales slips 2% in three months SALES volumes at Ciments Francais, the world's third largest cement maker, fell by 2 per cent in the first three months of the year, but the group does not expect a drop in business for the whole of 1991. Mr Pierre Conso, the group chairman, warned yesterday that 1991 would be 'a year of transition' from the previous five years of growth. Net profits at Ciments Francais rose by 16.3 per cent to FFr1.3bn (Dollars 229.8m) last year on turnover up by 23.9 per cent to FFr15.45bn. The group, holder of second place in the French cement industry after Lafarge Coppee  - the world's largest  - said the downturn in demand was worst in North America, where the group made 16.5 per cent of its sales last year. Volumes in the US and Canada fell by up to 25 per cent in the first quarter of 1991, reflecting the impact of a hard winter on construction activity, coming on top of the recession, said Mr Conso. French demand picked up slightly in April, while sales through the first quarter were holding up well in Morocco and Turkey, where Ciments Francais is building two plants, as well as in Greece and Spain.</p>

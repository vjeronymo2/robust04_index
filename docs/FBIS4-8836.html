			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Emin Barci: "The Banking System -- Time for </F> Changes"]    [Text] I was prompted to write this article by a  conversation with an angry businessman who was being put through  a rigmarole in the hall of the Tirana bank. He was trying to  pay a duty of several million leks to the customs office of  another district. He possessed the money, but was in a fix.  The problem was that this money was on deposit in foreign  currency. This created two problems: If he paid through his  account, he would have to incur a severe loss because the bank  used one exchange rate and the customs duty calculated on the  basis of another used on the parallel market. The second problem  arose as a result of trying to solve the first. He tried to  withdraw the required sum in foreign currency, but was faced  with the fact that he could not withdraw more than $5,000 a day.  The entire sum that he was required to pay would take weeks.    This is only one of the many problems one encounters in the  banking system today. One very serious weakness is the failure  to use classic banking documents that the world has used for  centuries. One of these is the check. Checks are not used for  foreign currency withdrawals. They are replaced by a standard  white form called a "foreign currency withdrawal request" that  records the sum and is signed and stamped by the applicant.  There is of course no question of such documents as bank  guarantees, internal letters of credit, etc. The existence of  bank guarantees or internal letters of credit would greatly  accelerate the movement of money. There would no longer be any  need for people to carry briefcases full of money, which often  leads to the murder of businessmen: Instead, the briefcase  could contain a single piece of paper that becomes valid when  the seller and purchaser come to an agreement. Moreover, the  existence of such documents, in cases where the purchaser  receives the goods before paying, gives the seller security and  stops him bothering the purchaser. The existence of such  documents would greatly ease the work of customs and tax  offices. Such a practice would then lead to money that has  accumulated in pockets and bags being put on deposit, which  would improve control over the money supply and develop credit  policy.    Let us consider the latter for a moment. There is  dissatisfaction on both sides over this. Clients complain that  credit is still very tight, and that obtaining a loan involves a  great deal of time, bureaucracy, and, why not, in many cases  bribes. Meanwhile, the banks for their part also complain of  irregularities on the part of borrowers, who fail to observe  repayment schedules or do not pay the loan back at all. The  banks' complaints extend to the courts, which fail to repossess  properties mortgaged by borrowers.    Deposits now earn 20 percent interest a year, compared with  32 percept last year. This 12 percent fall is explained by the  decline in inflation. However, both ordinary people and  businessmen think differently. They think that, in comparison  with one year ago, one can buy fewer goods and services with the  same amount of money. For ordinary people, this means higher,  not lower inflation. Bank specialists have a different opinion.  They argue that an interest rate of 32 percent was artificial  and was forced on them in order to attract money to the bank.  Once this aim was achieved, the problem was how to pay this  rate of interest. The main way to do so was by granting credit.  However, at a time when there was little domestic investment,  this credit was only short-term, and part of it was never  returned. Under such circumstances, the simplest response was  to lower the level of interest on deposits. However, the main  problem with interest rates is that they are artificial and are  of an administrative nature. As long as securities genuinely  tied to a real estate market do not exist one cannot talk about  the cost of money or, as a result, of a real interest rate that  responds to supply and demand for the lek.    The final point concerns bank secrecy, which is one of the  most vital elements for the existence and growth of the banking  system. There are suspicions that the state administration  interferes in our banking system through the State Control  Commission, the Financial Police, the National Intelligence  Service, and the Investigator's Office. Perhaps a special law  should be drafted for this, clearly laying down the  circumstances under which deposits can be inspected. These  occasions, like the organs so authorized, should be as few and  serious as possible.</p>

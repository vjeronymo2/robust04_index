			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Technology: Fighting those phobias 'TECHNO-PHOBIA,' says Dan Gookin, 'is a sign of our times.' Anyone who has fumbled with the controls on a video recorder, become confused by the digital display on a camera, or cursed at a computer will know what he means. Encouragingly for a country still struggling out of a harsh recession, people in Britain are somewhat more comfortable with today's technology than those in France, Germany or the US. While 55 per cent of French, 50 per cent of German, and 55 per cent of US adults and teenagers are techno-phobic, the figure for Britain is 46 per cent. The findings come from research by Dell Computer of the US. Gookin, a US author who has written books such as PCs for Dummies for those who shy away from anything mechanical or electronic, reckons technology has passed many people by. Commenting on the research, he says: 'One of the main reasons many people are paranoid about technology is that no one in the industry has bothered to help them understand how simple it is to use and what it specifically can do for them. Most manuals are as difficult to understand as a graduate-level course in quantum physics.' Not surprisingly, Dell's research shows younger people are less afraid of technology than their elders. The fact that it carried out the research at all is a sign that computer companies are increasingly nervous that business and individual users may be left behind by the bewildering pace of development in the jargon-ridden world of information technology. Increasingly, therefore, computer and software companies try to highlight the benefits and applications of their products rather than the technological content. But managers steeped in the fast-evolving world of electronics often find it hard to keep their message clear.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Are New Horizons Being Opened Up?"] </F>   [Text] The Republic of Azerbaijan has requested Turkey to  arrange for the military training of the Azeri army officers.    According to reports received from news agencies, Geydar  Aliyev made that request at the end of his 4-day visit to Turkey.    Political circles in the region are not inclined to grant  much weight to that statement by Geydar Aliyev who has a special  reputation for being a very complex personality. Since he  assumed power on June 30, Aliyev has been playing in various  ways with the regional powers - with Moscow and Tehran and now  with Ankara. Aliyev's courtship of Ankara started quite  recently, for bilateral ties between Baku and Ankara had not  been very warm after the downfall of Abulfaz Elchibey who  depended greatly on the Turkish support.    Some of the well-informed political observers in the region  evaluate Geydar Aliyev's recent statement only as a means of  provoking the other regional countries specially Russia.    Surprisingly it seems that Russia has been pursing the  affairs of the new independent states quite closely in spite of  the chaotic social and economic situation in that country.    It is true of course that the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis still  goes on, but it seems that the recent victories gained by the  Azeris in battle fronts could serve to deflate somewhat the  Armenian military pride and make them settle for more realistic  peace talks.    The Armenians military victories of the previous months had  encouraged them to adopt a very demanding position. At the same  time the economic situation in Yerevan is reportedly much more  chaotic then it is in Baku.    In the opinion of political observers, after the recent trip  to Moscow by Morteza Banki, the director of the Central Asia  Department of the Iranian Foreign Ministry and his negotiations  with some of the Russian authorities, and the consequent  expression of willingness on the part of Moscow to seek a  political settlement for the crisis in the Caucasus in  collaboration with Iran presents new hopeful prospects.    It has been clearly demonstrated in the course of the futile  military encounters of the past few years that the Caucasian  issue could not be resolved with the aid of powers that are at a  geographical distance from the nucleus of the conflict. The  crisis could only be resolved by the regional powers with the  collaboration of the two warring countries.    There remains, however, one source of worry. In the process  of action Russia had already blocked the efforts of the Minsk  group to reach a political settlement. Is Russia going to  perform that role again in connection with the new peace  initiative that is being undertaken by Iran, Turkey and Russia?</p>

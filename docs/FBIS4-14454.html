			<p>BFN     [Text] Acting Russian Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin  believes that the economic slump will be overcome and economic  growth will begin late in 1994-early in 1995. He addressed  those present at the round-table discussions in Moscow in which  U.S. businessmen also took part.    Dubinin said that financial stabilization is becoming a  reality. Inflation rates are reducing and by the end of the  year, he believes, inflation will not exceed 5-7% a month.    We are entering a new stage of economic development, he  said.  Deals in rubles are becoming more profitable. This makes it  possible to stabilize the currency rate though we do not face  the task of making the currency rate fixed, he said.    Dubinin said Russian reforms are aimed at achieving  financial  stabilization and the overcoming of inflation.    Shock therapy did not work, said Dubinin.    The key to success in the anti-inflation policy is in the  draft budget, he said. In line with the draft budget, the  deficit for 1994 will not exceed 10% of GNP and only  50%, he  said, will be covered by Central Bank emission, while the other  50% will be covered by government bonds and the  attraction of  foreign loans.    Russia will not agree to accept loans with high interest, he  said.    Dubinin also said that the talks will continue with the  Paris  and London clubs of creditor countries on restructuring Russia's  external debt.    Dubinin called on representatives of U.S. industrial circles  to cooperate to raise money from the United States which could  be used for investments into the Russian economy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 6 May at the first Global Conference on  Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States,  President Fidel Castro said nongovernment organizations [NGO's]  have become a very powerful force in international policy.    In an informal meeting with NGO representatives from the  Caribbean, Pacific, Mediterranean, and Atlantic regions at the  (Sherbon Center) in Bridgetown, Fidel Castro said these  organizations are fully aware of policies concerning  environmental and other matters.    At the beginning of the meeting, (Jean Franz), coordinator  of  such Caribbean organizations, recalled the support expressed for  Cuba in the recently concluded forum of those organizations. A  resolution was approved defending the Cuban people's right to  choose its own model for alternative development and condemning  the U.S. Administration for the economic and financial blockade  against Cuba.    Fidel Castro expresssed thanks for the expressions of  support  and solidarity and added: We must change the negative  environment the United States has created around Cuba with the  blockade which prompts serious problems in the supply of  foodstuff, medicines, and many other products essential to our  development.    Fidel Castro received lengthy applause from the people when  he said: We feel like friends, like brethren among you, and for  this reason I am leaving this country and this conference with a  feeling of joy.    Among other subjects discussed during the informal meeting,  the Cuban leader joked about speculations on the state of his  health which appeared in the local press and about which he was  asked several times by reporters from a Miami television station  who traveled to Bridgetown on learning of the Cuban statesman's  presence in that capital.    You are continuously asking me about the state of my health,  and whether I sat down before and after the speech at the  plenary session. In fact, I can no longer do the many things I  used to do in Sierra Maestra days, but I still walk a great deal  and swim for several hours, Castro said.    In his final remarks, Fidel Castro underscored the  importance  of that meeting in organizing an action strategy to defend the  islands from the serious problems that are threatening them,  such as pollution, radioactive wastes, and climatic changes.</p>

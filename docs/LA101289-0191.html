			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORRECTION MADE TO WATER BAGEL RECIPE  </P> <P> The amount of all-purpose flour was incorrect in last week's Judy Zeidler story  on Iz's Water Bagels recipe. The entire corrected recipes follows.  </P> <P> IZ'S WATER BAGELS  </P> <P> 2 cups cold tap water  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 3/4 tablespoon salt  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon malt  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon oil  </P> <P> 8 cups high gluten flour (12% to 13%) (or 8 cups all-purpose flour plus 4  tablespoons powdered gluten)  </P> <P> 5 teaspoons dry yeast  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon yellow cornmeal  </P> <P> In bowl of electric mixer, using dough hook, blend water, sugar, salt, malt and  oil. Combine 6 cups flour and yeast and add to bowl, blending until dough comes  together. Add remaining flour, beating until smooth. (If any dry flour mixture  remains in bottom of bowl, add several drops of water to moisten and continue  beating 5 minutes.)  </P> <P> Transfer to wooden board but do not add any oil, water or additional flour.  Cover with towel and let rest 5 minutes.  </P> <P> Divide dough into 15 pieces, each weighing about 3 ounces. Keep covered with  towel while shaping each piece. Knead by folding each piece in half and pushing  out any air-pockets. Then, fold in half and knead again. Shape into rope about  5-inches long, then form into doughnut shape. Overlap ends by about 1 inch and  knead into smooth perfect circle. Repeat with remaining dough.  </P> <P> Sprinkle cornmeal on wooden board and place bagels on top. Cover with towel and  let rest 5 minutes.  </P> <P> Fill large pot with water and bring to boil. Drop 4 to 6 bagels (do not crowd)  into boiling water and boil 10 seconds only. Bagels should rise to top of  water. Using slotted spoon, transfer to wire rack and drain. Then place on  parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees 10 minutes or until golden  brown. Makes about 15 bagels.  </P> <P> Variations:  </P> <P> Onion-Poppy Seed Bagels -- After boiling and draining bagels, press top of each  bagel into mixture of chopped onion mixed with poppy seeds. Bake as directed.  </P> <P> Egg Bagels -- Using recipe for water bagels, place 2 or 3 egg yolks in 2-cup  measure and add enough water to measure 2 cups. Use as liquid in recipe.  </P></p>

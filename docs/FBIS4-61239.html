			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Ovcharov reportage: "Volost Resurrected in </F> Yaroslav Rural Areas"]    [Text] Yaroslavl -- The administration of the first Volost  in today's Russia -- Borovskaya Volost -- which has been  resurrected within its former, prerevolutionary borders and  embraces the territories of three former rural administrations  and one settlement administration in Nekrasovskiy Rayon, has  begun work in Yaroslavl Oblast. When you hear for the first  time the word "volost," which is known only from books, doubt  involuntarily sets in: Why is such a reorganization necessary?  Is it a just a change of nameplate? A fad?  <H5>  I Want Very Much To Be an Official </H5>   In reply to my questions, Nikolay Anikanov, administration  head in Nekrasovskiy Rayon, where these events are currently  taking place, and architect of the volost's resurrection in  rural areas, objected strongly: No, there can be no question of  any fad. Government by the volost represents a completely  self-financing self-governing rural territory with its own  budget and bank account. In the final analysis, it represents a  reduction in the army of officials in rural areas.    Anikanov considers that the system of government in the  rural  areas -- whether in the form of rural soviets or the rural  administration -- has discredited itself once and for all and  become obsolete. Take note of the fact that in each rural  administration (and this is usually the territory of a kolkhoz  or sovkhoz) there are up to 10 officials. The wages of each is  sometimes five times higher than that of a machine operator or a  milkmaid.    The rural administration's second problem is that it lacks  its own budget. Its head has no interest at all in collecting  taxes because he knows: These taxes will just the same leave  the area and end up in the rayon, oblast, or republic budget,  and after that it will be necessary to beg for pennies from the  rayon or oblast, like alms in the church porch, in order to  repair a well in disrepair or to take firewood for the winter to  an old lady living on her own.  <H5>  The Elder Will Judge Your Case </H5>   We took great pains to break this system and to make the  territory self-financing for the first time, Anikanov continued.  That is, it is a question of the authorities having a vital  interest in the development on their territory of diverse  industrial and agricultural production facilities from which  taxes will accumulate in the local budget.    But there is also a second issue. That of actually  implementing local self-government and not just talking about  it. A law on this has, as we know, been adopted, but it is not  working as there are no corresponding power structures. This is  why, having set a course to resurrect volost power, we began  this process from the bottom and not from the top, electing at  village assemblies in the rayon elders to represent about 300  inhabitants each. What is more they have very wide-ranging  rights. I consider the village elder, Anikanov says, to be at  one time deputy to the volost head, judge, and land-surveyor who  can sternly make whomsoever he sees fit answer for disturbing  the public order, distribute hayfields, and pass judgments on  squabbling neighbors in his role as justice of the peace.    Own Bank Account    I came across the first volost head in post-communist Russia  in the government premises temporarily housed in the former  Krasnoprofinternovskiy settlement administration building. The  Russian tricolor is already fluttering above the government  premises, though there is no new nameplate yet. Aleksey  Andreyev, 47, is impatiently waiting for a tractor and trailer  from the rayon which he has been promised and which will plow  pensioners' truck gardens and transport firewood. Borovskaya  Volost has already opened an account at the bank. The first  autonomous budget for this year has been put together and (here  is an amazing thing) income exceeds expenditure by as much as 50  million rubles [R]. Now the most important thing is to obtain  this money as quickly as possible and release it for the  people's benefit.    One other thing about which the volost head is presently  concerned is cadres. Under conditions of the territory's  self-financing and self-government, volost administration  workers should possess completely different professional  qualities than workers of the abolished rural administrations.  Incidentally, there are now two new posts in the volost  government's staff -- that of tax collector and land-tenure  regulator. At the same time as the compact 15-strong volost  government staff is being formed, rural administration staffers  are working out their last days in their former positions.  These are real people, mostly women, who have children. This  is a vexed question. But come what may, 10 officials must go.  In this volost alone R25 million will be saved which will be  spent entirely on the needs of its population.    In the wake of the first Borovskaya Volost, Rayon  Administration Head Nikolay Anikanov says, all 18 rural and  settlement administrations in the rayon will be transformed into  8 volosts by the end of the year (which will make a saving of  about R200 million by reducing staff).    Anikanov does not consider the transition to the volost  system of governing rural territories to be a panacea. It is  hardly necessary to redraw the whole map of the country in an  unthinking and wholesale manner. It is necessary first of all  to introduce volost government in those places where the  infrastructure is well developed.</p>

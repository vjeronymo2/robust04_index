			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIE WAS A HEAD CASE FOR AZTECS;  </P> <P> LUGINBILL SAYS TEAM MADE 'ATROCIOUS' MENTAL ERRORS  </P> <P> The state of the San Diego State football team was upgraded from "despicable"  to "atrocious" Sunday by Coach Al Luginbill.  </P> <P> At least it sounded like an upgrade.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a lack of physical effort," Luginbill said of SDSU's performance in  Saturday's 41-41 tie with Cal State Fullerton. "Mentally, we were atrocious."  </P> <P> Because they were mental rather than physical errors, Luginbill said he is  encouraged that the players can learn from their mistakes. He was a bit more  positive than he was late Saturday night, when he called his team's performance  "despicable" minutes after the game.  </P> <P> Luginbill wasn't the only one in the Aztec locker room late Saturday night who  was having trouble explaining how SDSU could enter a game few thought it would  lose and still be able to figure out a way not to win.  </P> <P> "I just can't explain it," said running back Darrin Wagner, who gained 162  yards on 22 carries but fumbled at the SDSU 20 with 7:35 left. That set up a  touchdown that put Cal State Fullerton ahead, 38-34.  </P> <P> "We should have blown them out," Wagner said. "They shouldn't have even scored,  the way we played last week (against UCLA). But nobody was pumped up like last  week. Everyone was just standing around."  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton noticed, especially running back Mike Pringle, who gained  158 yards on 25 rushes, caught six passes for 34 yards and one touchdown and  returned three kickoffs for 110 yards.  </P> <P> "The attitude in the other locker room was, 'Cal State Who?' " Pringle said.  "We showed them."  </P> <P> Said SDSU defensive tackle Pio Sagapolutele: "They're Cal State Fullerton, and  there's a stereotype when you think of them. But they beat us in every category  of the game. We're lucky we came out with a tie."  </P> <P> After watching films Sunday, Luginbill said he plans to change some personnel  on the kickoff teams during practice this week. Breakdowns on kickoffs  contributed to SDSU's poor field position several times. Of 13 Cal State  Fullerton drives, all but two started at the Titans' own 32 or better. Nine of  SDSU's 13 drives started at the Aztecs' own 26 or worse.  </P> <P> Junior safety Morey Paul, who was ejected after a personal foul late in the  first quarter Saturday, met with Luginbill Sunday and will begin the week on  the second team. His situation will be evaluated day to day.  </P> <P> "His status on the trip to Utah will be dependent upon his attitude in this  week's practices," Luginbill said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> Utah, SDSU's next opponent, was beaten, 67-20, by Hawaii late Saturday . . .  SDSU's 41-41 tie with Cal State Fullerton is the second highest scoring  Division I tie in NCAA history. The highest was between San Jose State and Utah  State in 1979, a 48-48 tie. . . . The 41 points scored by SDSU were the most in  a non-winning effort in school history. . . . Senior guard Damon Baldwin  dislocated his left elbow in Saturday's game and is doubtful for this week's  game in Utah. . . . How excited was Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy after  the tie? "I wish we had a fight song to sing," he said. . . . In three games,  SDSU has been called for 27 penalties (200 yards). Aztec opponents have been  called for 14 penalties (106 yards). . . . The crowd of 15,721 Saturday was the  lowest to attend an SDSU game in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium since Nov. 23,  1985, when just 10,343 showed up to watch SDSU play New Mexico.  </P></p>

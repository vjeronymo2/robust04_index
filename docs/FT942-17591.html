			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Empire Stores Empire Stores Group, the Bradford-based mail order company owned by Redoute Catalogue, the French mail order group, returned to profit in 1993 with Pounds 3m before tax. The result ended two years of losses to the tune of Pounds 8m in 1991 and Pounds 2.7m in 1992. The company said the turnround was due to the recovery plan put in place in 1991 following the acquisition by Redoute. It was also announced yesterday that Redoute is merging with Pinault-Printemps Group, which previously owned 54.4 per cent.</p>

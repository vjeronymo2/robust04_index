			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Speaker elected in Ukraine Mr Oleksandr Moroz was yesterday elected chairman of the new Ukrainian parliament in a secret ballot. The selection of Mr Moroz, leader of the Socialist party, is the first important decision taken by Ukraine's new legislature, but its significance is unclear. On one hand, Mr Moroz's election to one of the most powerful posts in the Ukrainian government suggests that most MPs lean towards the Socialist party's anti-reform platform and favour the restoration of closer ties with Russia. However, Socialist MPs do not hold a majority of the seats in parliament. Ukrainian observers have suggested that Mr Moroz, who is known to be a Ukrainian patriot, may have entered into an unlikely alliance with Rukh, the pro-reform, democratic nationalist faction in the legislature. No matter which political line Mr Moroz eventually takes, it was apparent from his acceptance speech that the new parliamentary chairman aims to continue the heated constitutional battle in Ukraine. In a veiled attack on President Leonid Kravchuk, who is struggling to retain his grip on the nation, Mr Moroz said that the legislature, rather than the presidency, should be the centre of governmental authority. Ukraine still has no post-Soviet constitution and is ruled by a Soviet-era document, amended so many times that it is unclear which branches have which powers.</p>

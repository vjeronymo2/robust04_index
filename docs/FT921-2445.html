			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (17): Keeping tabs on 7,500 product prices - User View: A complex job that once took two weeks can now be finished in a couple of hours JIM NAPLES uses Computer Associates' SuperCalc5 spreadsheet package to produce price lists for the 7,500 products his company sells in eight price bands. Mr Naples is managing director of Matsushita Automation Controls, the UK subsidiary of Matsushita Electric Works, one of the top 40 industrial companies in Japan. Matsushita Electric Works is the world's biggest manufacturer of electro-mechanical relays and also makes other automation control components and systems, such as vision recognition systems, testing systems and programmable controllers. Mr Naples and his 20 UK staff in Milton Keynes get product numbers and prices in Deutsche Marks on magnetic discs from the European headquarters in Munich. He has set up a spreadsheet which takes this data, applies factors such as exchange rates and freight costs and produces a UK price list. The calculations are complicated by the fact that products are offered in eight price bands, typically depending on the quantities ordered. Sections of the price list, for example those relating to particular product ranges, can be run off and sent to customers if required - 'we do some basic editing of the look of the page, using SuperCalc, and can make it quite attractive,' he says. Price updates come from Germany every month and it takes about five minutes to calculate the new UK prices. In the early 1980s, the price list was prepared manually, using a calculator, a job which took two weeks. In 1984 the company bought SuperCalc2, but that only handled 250 rows - and therefore 250 products - at a time. This meant the program had to be run 20 or 30 times - 'we've gone from a total time of two weeks to three days using SuperCalc2 and now to a couple of hours for the total job using SuperCalc5,' he says. Jim Naples, an electrical and electronics engineer, wrote the spreadsheet program himself - 'it was nothing very clever: just a case of looking at SuperCalc's capabilities and deciding how to use them.' The other main use is budgeting. Matsushita, typical of Japanese companies, plans far ahead, so Mr Naples produces five-year forecasts for the UK business. These can include factors such as planned orders, turnover, expenditure and the target profit on product types. Alongside these five-year models are spreadsheets of monthly forecasts and actual results, for easy comparison of plans and performance. He has also written a spreadsheet to help him decide when to buy marks, yen and dollars to pay for products bought from Matsushita in Germany, Japan and Thailand. He can enter different assumptions about exchange rates to decide whether to stay with sterling for the time being or buy one of the other currencies. Matsushita Automation Controls uses PCs for tasks ranging from computer-aided design to word processing. Mr Naples runs SuperCalc on an Amstrad 386SX. 'The only thing we've not been too happy about is that after we bought SuperCalc5 for nearly Pounds 400, Computer Associates cut the price to Pounds 79,' says Mr Naples. But he adds: 'Even so, it was a super deal at the old price - and it's fantastic at the new price, especially when I consider what I pay for my children's computer games.'</p>

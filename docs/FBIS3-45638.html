Zhu Rongji, vice premier and governor of  the People's Bank of China, gave an important speech at the  closing session. He fully affirmed the achievements in  financial work last year. Setting forth this year's guidelines  for financial work, he forwarded a three-point demand on the  vast number of cadres and workers in the financial system.    Zhu Rongji said: The CPC Central Committee and State Council  decided last June to strengthen and improve macroeconomic  regulation and control of the national economy through  rectification of financial order. Acting in accordance with the  CPC Central Committee and State Council plan, the vast numbers  of cadres and workers in the financial system firmly observed  the "three agreed rules" in rectifying financial order, strictly  enforcing financial discipline, pushing forward financial  reform, and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control,  thereby swiftly reversing the chaotic financial situation.  Afterward, they promptly studied and analyzed the new  development and problems in the national economy. In line with  the demand to "stop dishonest practices and promote healthy  trends," they exercised the right amount of macroeconomic  regulation and control and firmly and decisively adjusted the  direction in the use of funds. As a result, over 99 percent of  the state's key projects have obtained the necessary funds;  there have been no IOU's in purchasing agricultural produce; the  strained situation in the working capital of major production  enterprises and foreign trade firms has been essentially eased;  and the excessive fluctuation in the development of the national  economy has been avoided effectively avoided. At the same time,  the over-issue of money has been curtailed; the total volume of  money supply for the year has been controlled within the  predetermined target; the market exchange rate has been  consistently stable; and the state foreign exchange reserves  have increased. Facts have demonstrated that the vast numbers  of cadres and workers in the financial system are a contingent  capable of standing the test, and they are trustworthy and able  to fight. Zhu Rongji expressed appreciation and extended  regards to them on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State  Council.    Zhu Rongji pointed out: Some problems popped up in our  economic work during the first half of 1993. Through the  strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control, we have  ameliorated these problems to some extent; however, we have not  fundamentally addressed the profound problems. We have not set  up a risk mechanism to restrain investment in fixed assets, and  the inflationary pressure could build up at any time. The State  Council has established guidelines for this year's financial  work as follows: continuing the rectification of financial  order, steadily promoting financial reform, strictly controlling  total credit supply, and earnestly strengthening financial  supervision and management.    He said: We made great achievements in rectifying financial  order last year. However, this does not mean the task of  rectifying financial order has been accomplished. Rectifying  financial order will be an arduous long-term task for the  financial system and it must be persistently carried out without  relaxing our efforts.    Zhu Rongji called for continuous implementation of the  "three  agreed rules" set forth at the national conference on financial  work last July. At the same time, he forwarded three additional  demands on the vast numbers of financial cadres and workers:    1. Strictly control the total credit supply. The key to  controlling the total credit supply is in limiting loans  extended by banks at all levels to finance investment in fixed  assets. Beginning this year, loans for key projects in  infrastructure and basic industries will be arranged in a  unified manner by the newly established state development bank;  all other banks shall not use funds earmarked for non-fixed  assets projects, particularly funds to be used as working  capital, to finance investment in fixed assets. Banks at all  levels shall not provide any loans to any unauthorized projects,  projects beyond the total credit line, or components of an  unauthorized project; the planned total credit line must not be  exceeded even by one yuan. Investigation will be conducted to  trace the responsibility of those who resort to illegitimate  means to break the total credit line.    2. Once their policy-oriented businesses are divested,  specialized banks shall begin their transition toward commercial  banks. They shall make bold moves this year to explore and  pioneer. In consideration of the fact that state-owned  enterprises are currently in the process of changing their  operating mechanism, specialized banks shall first implement a  funding system based on the ratio of the enterprises' assets and  liability within the limit of their credit line and then  gradually establish a mechanism for self-restraint and  risk-taking to assume responsibility for their own management  decisions and profits and losses. In coordination with the  enforcement of the "Bankruptcy Law," they shall make good use of  the reserves for doubtful and bad loans, which have been  increased this year.    3. Branches of the People's Bank of China at all levels  shall earnestly change their functions and play a leading role  in supervising and managing regional financial activities.  Branches and sub-branches shall truly concentrate their  energies on stabilizing currency and supervising and managing  financial activities. At present, they shall make particular  efforts to prevent the resurge of unauthorized fund raising  activities by stopping every unauthorized one. Only by  controlling unauthorized loans and fund-raising activities can  we limit investment in fixed assets and reduce the inflationary  pressure.    Zhu Rongji urged the vast numbers of financial cadres and  workers to strengthen the building of their ranks by earnestly  studying the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" and actively, correctly, and comprehensively grasp and  implement Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. He urged them to earnestly implement  Comrade Xiaoping's instruction, "operate the bank the way a bank  should be operated" and refrain from operating the bank like a  "currency issuance company" or a "safe," still less making the  bank a locked "safe."    Zhu Rongji concluded by urging all financial workers to  unite, pluck up their spirits, and in accordance with the  demands of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, accomplish in an all-around way every financial task.  He urged them to make persistent efforts to carry out the  struggle against corruption and, under the leadership of the CPC  Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core,  successfully handle the relationship between development and  stability to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy development  of the national economy.    Zhou Zhengqing, vice governor of the People's Bank of China,  delivered a work report at the beginning of the conference.</p>

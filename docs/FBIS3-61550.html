			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. M. Baranov, V. S. Koltunov, and T. P. </F> Zharova; UDC 546.799.3]    [Abstract] A correlation has been detected between the  reactivity of organic hydrazine derivatives and the inductive  properties of the radical-substituent as in the reaction with  NpO[.sup]+2[/][.sub]2[/] ions. It has been demonstrated that a  lengthening the hydrocarbon chain, particularly from methyl to  ethylhydrazine, results in a lowering in the reduction rate of  Np(VI). It may thus be expected that further substitution of the  ethyl group with propyl would lead to further reduction in the  reactivity of hydrazine. In the present work the reaction rate  constant for the reduction of Np(VI) to Np(V) with  isopropoyhydrazine was determined to be 19  liter[.sup]0.1[/]/mole[.sup]0.1[/] at 25.2 C and  ionic strength  = 2. Activation energy and entropy are E =  69.4 kJ/mole, S[.sup]*[/] = 30 J/moleK. The reaction  mechanism fits a general oxidation mechanism for hydrazine  derivatives with single electron oxidizers.

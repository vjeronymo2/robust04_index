			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE ;  </P> <P> AZT SYRUP VERSION READY  </P> <P> The Burroughs Wellcome Co. announced plans Wednesday to market a  strawberry-flavored syrup version of the AIDS-fighting drug AZT. AZT or  zidovudine -- the sole government-approved drug to directly fight the AIDS  virus -- is available only in capsule form.  </P> <P> "This new (syrup) formulation should provide more flexibility in making dosage  adjustments and be particularly useful to patients who have difficulty  swallowing capsules," said Kathryn Pattishall of Burroughs Wellcome.  </P> <P> The AZT syrup, which the Food and Drug Administration recently judged to be as  effective as the capsules, will be available at pharmacies in four to six  weeks, Burroughs Wellcome said.  </P> <P> Jean McGuire, director of the AIDS Action Council, said the new formulation  should prove helpful to AIDS patients who have problems swallowing because of  mouth and throat infections or sores.  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Unidanmark hit by loss provisions THE Unidanmark banking group plunged even more heavily into loss last year after making substantial increases in loss provisions on building and property in the UK, the US and Denmark. Net losses increased to DKr1.65bn (Dollars 262m) from DKr1.09bn in 1990 after bad loss provisions increased to DKr5.4bn, against DKr3.5bn, which was about 3.0 per cent of outstanding loans and guarantees. The group's capital ratio was 10.4 per cent, but it was achieved partly by slimming the balance sheet by DKr16.4bn to DKr263.1bn. The bank plans to raise at least DKr1bn in supplementary loan capital through a bond issue next week. Despite two years with substantial losses, the bank plans to pay an unchanged dividend of DKr10 a share. Mr Steen Rasmussen, chief executive, said the bank had topped up provisions in the building and property sector, as well as on loans to the former Soviet Union (which are now fully covered by provisions) in order that the bank could be certain that provisions will now decline. He said the bank performed well on its ordinary business, with profit before expenses rising by DKr1.42bn to DKr11.20bn. Expenses were also under control, rising by 2.5 per cent to DKr6.58bn.</p>

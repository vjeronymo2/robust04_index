			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN PILOTS END STRIKE BUT JOBS ARE GONE  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines' pilots voted late Wednesday to end a bitter nine-month  walkout, but the airline's mechanics said they would continue to strike.  </P> <P> The pilots' decision to end their strike is largely symbolic because Eastern  has replaced the 1,800 striking pilots and says it has no jobs to offer them.  </P> <P> Eastern's pilots voted to end their dispute one day after President Bush vetoed  legislation that would have created a blue-ribbon panel to investigate the  strike. In his veto message, Bush said that Congress, which would have set up  the panel, had no business interfering in contract disputes.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the pilots said the congressional panel had been the union's  last hope to resolve its differences with Eastern and its parent company, Texas  Air Corp. "We ran out of options," said the spokesman, pilot Wayne Dolan.  </P> <P> Charles Bryan, head of the striking machinists, was angered by the pilots'  move.  </P> <P> "Our ranks are unaffected by this," Bryan said from his home in Miami. "The  strike continues. We were the ones who were carrying the strike anyway for the  last two or three months.  </P> <P> "Eastern has been desperate for maintenance and ground support," he added. "We  are unchanged by this decision."  </P> <P> However, airline analysts said that the striking machinists also have been  replaced.  </P> <P> Bryan said "it is unclear to me" why the pilots ended their strike. "Eastern  claims they had all the pilots they needed when the pilots broke ranks and many  crossed the picket lines in August."  </P> <P> Art Kent, a spokesman for Texas Air, said that the pilots' decision to end the  strike was "a very interesting development," adding: "It is unfortunate that it  did not come earlier. We could have avoided all the trauma and heartache which  has affected Eastern and its employees."  </P> <P> Kent said that Eastern had no jobs available for the striking pilots, but he  said that they could add their names to a waiting list that already contains  200 names.  </P> <P> "We hope the pilots' action indicates a real willingness to sit down and work  out the terms whereby Eastern and all its pilots can come together," he said.  </P> <P> The Eastern pilots walked off the job on March 5 to support the striking  International Assn. of Machinists, which represents mechanics and other ground  workers. The strike's immediate impact was significant, forcing Eastern to  cancel 90% of its flights and lay off 7,000 non-union workers.  </P> <P> On March 9, a crippled Eastern filed for bankruptcy court protection from its  creditors, then slowly began rebuilding as a much smaller airline. To raise  money, it sold about one-third of its 255 aircraft as well as its profitable  Northeast shuttle operations, which New York real-estate magnate Donald Trump  now owns. It is talking with American Airlines about the possible sale of its  Latin America routes.  </P> <P> The unions had hoped to force Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo to sell Eastern,  and the strike's high point occurred in April, when Lorenzo did agree to sell  the airline to a group headed by former baseball commissioner Peter V.  Ueberroth for $464 million.  </P> <P> But the deal fell apart when the unions demanded that Lorenzo step down before  the sale was completed and Lorenzo refused.  </P> <P> Eastern now has 1,800 pilots flying about 780 flights a day to 85 cities, down  from 3,600 pilots and nearly 1,100 daily flights before the strike.  </P> <P> The participation of the pilots had been crucial to the machinists' strike,  because pilots are difficult to replace. But many Eastern pilots became  disillusioned as the strike wore on, and 800 eventually returned to work.  Another 800 pilots retired or went to work for other airlines.  </P> <P> Also, the strike forced a rift in the leadership of Eastern's pilots' union.  The members voted to replace its conciliatory chairman with Skip Copeland, a  hard-liner when it comes to management relations. On Wednesday, he accused  Lorenzo of dismantling Eastern with a "scorched-earth policy."  </P> <P> The machinists struck the airline over a contract dispute. Eastern sought $150  million in wage concessions, but the machinists sought $50 million in higher  pay. Union officers said that most of Eastern's 8,500 machinists have remained  on strike.  </P> <P> Denise Gellene reported from Los Angeles and Robert E. Dallos from New York.  </P></p>

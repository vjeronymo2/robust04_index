			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Czech group plans placing Bonton, a Czech entertainment group with interests ranging from record stores to video production, is to raise up to Dollars 15m in a private placing of shares with international institutions. The transaction will be one of the first of its kind in the Czech Republic and could value Bonton at up to Dollars 70m. Proceeds will be used for acquisitions and to reduce debt.

The company had turnover last year of over Dollars 8m and made profits of Kc837,000 (Dollars 30,000), according to CS First Boston Prague, which is arranging the placing. Turnover this year is estimated at Kc600m (Dollars 21.4m) following acquisitions. The share placing is expected to be completed in October. Bonton may seek a stock market listing in two years' time.</p>

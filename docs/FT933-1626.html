			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Ford and Vauxhall to cut output FORD and Vauxhall are to cut production sharply at their Halewood and Luton car plants next month because of the impact of the continuing steep decline in sales of new cars in continental Europe. The further reductions follow the announcements earlier this week that Nissan is being forced to halve production at its Sunderland plant during November and December, and that Vauxhall is cutting output at its Luton plant this month. Ford is to eliminate 18 shifts at its plant at Halewood, Merseyside, during October, the equivalent of stopping production for two weeks. The short-time working at Halewood, which produces the Ford Escort, will cause the loss of about 7,000 cars - more than a third of the plant's planned output. By the end of October Ford will have cut 42 shifts at Halewood this year. About 16 per cent of Halewood's production of cars and vans was exported last year, but Ford yesterday said that in the face of the big fall in demand in continental European markets it had been forced to stop car exports from the plant. Ford will cut one shift during October at its plant in Dagenham, Essex, which produces the Fiesta small car, while the Transit van plant at Southampton will work a four-day week. Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, yesterday said that it would be forced to stop production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra for at least two weeks at its plant at Luton, Bedfordshire, during October with the loss of around 8,000 cars. The Luton plant has been one of those hit hardest by short-time working since the beginning of the year, and by the end of October it will already have lost the equivalent of 10 weeks of production. The plant will produce no cars in the first and fourth weeks of October. The Luton plant has been badly affected during September with the loss of 14 shifts, including a complete halt in production this week. Vauxhall said that it expected its plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, which produces the Astra, to work normally during October after losing 11 shifts during September. Both Ford and Vauxhall said yesterday that there would be no lay-offs at the Halewood and Luton plants, and that workers would be brought in for additional training programmes.</p>

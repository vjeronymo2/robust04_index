			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UN warns Iraq on missile delay IRAQ was warned by the United Nations Security Council last night that it must comply with orders to destroy materials used in its Scud-type missile programme. The tough UN admonition of Baghdad came after Iraq rejected a UN deadline to begin destroying missile-related materials. Instead it called for further talks with the UN on other uses for these materials. The Iraqi attitude, widely seen as delaying tactics and a test of western nerve, has again raised the prospect of punitive measures against President Saddam Hussein. The Security Council warned Iraq of the 'serious consequences' of continued failure to comply with its orders. But in an apparent concession, the UN also agreed to receive a high-level delegation being sent to New York by Baghdad. The elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was ordered in the UN ceasefire resolution bringing an end to the Gulf war last year. Destruction of missile-related equipment was to have started last Wednesday, but the deadline was extended to last night. In a written response to UN pressure for immediate co-operation, Iraq asked to convert missile-related material for other uses. It could be used in making liquid fuel tanks and to make explosives for road construction. It could also be used in a shorter-range missile programme acceptable to the UN. Baghdad asked the UN to put off a final decision until an Iraqi delegation goes to New York early in March. The delegation is expected to press for economic sanctions, including the oil embargo, to be lifted, linking this with the scrapping of weapons. Mr Thomas Pickering, the US diplomat who is current president of the UN Security Council, termed Iraq's reply as 'seven pages of No'. Later, in a strongly worded statement on behalf of the 15 member nations of the Security Council, he called on Iraq to co-operate with the UN weapons inspectors now in Baghdad. It was up to these UN men alone to decide what Iraqi weapons materials must be destroyed, he said. Iraq was ordered immediately to carry out all its obligations under UN resolutions and to communicate without further delay an authoritative, unconditional acknowledgement of its agreement.</p>

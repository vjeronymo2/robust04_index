			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Canada seeks China trade boost Canada's new Liberal government will trade more with China and ask fewer questions about human rights, Mr Raymond Chan, secretary of state for Asia-Pacific, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Ottawa. 'To help promote human rights, we have to help them increase their living standards and at the same time create more cultural ties and have more communication,' he said. Mr Chan, 42, who emigrated from Hong Kong in 1969, said he would visit China, Hong Kong and Thailand next month.</p>

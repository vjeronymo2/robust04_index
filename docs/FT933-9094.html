			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / China draws up rules for exchanges CHINA'S Communist party has issued new regulations aimed at stamping out corruption in the country's two infant stock exchanges. The move follows a drive against corruption within the party's own ranks. The regulations lay down that the two bodies charged with overseeing the stock exchanges, the State Council Securities Policy Committee and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, must comply with 23 rules. Mr Zhu Lin, secretary general of the CSRC, has been quoted by the official press as saying the new rules will 'place securities officials under the supervision of the public and prevent insider trading'. The 89 employees of the two organisations face the sack if they are caught taking bribes, while companies that try to bribe them risk having their licences suspended and any new stock issues cancelled. The stock exchange in Shanghai opened in 1990 while the exchange in Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, started operating the following year. Although there are about 100 listed companies, observers believe that more than 3,000 companies are trading stock. The lack of a securities law was highlighted last August when trading on the Shenzhen exchange was suspended temporarily after hundreds of people rioted over the corrupt allocation of new shares.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Yesterday [18 February], in view of another mainland  airliner being hijacked to Taiwan, Wu Po-hsiung, interior  minister and head of the group on handling matters related to  hijacking under the Executive Yuan, reiterated the government's  stand of strongly condemning hijackings. He also stressed that  because of security considerations, Taiwan will continue to  employ the principle of handling separately the hijackers and  the airplane concerned, and the repatriation of the hijacked  airplane.    Wu Po-hsiung said that the repeated hijackings of Communist  China's civilian passenger planes to Taiwan has exposed  Communist China's serious gaps in its security checks. He added  that the fundamental way to solve the problem of hijackings lies  in Communist China's strengthening its interior security  measures.    Meanwhile, Kao Kung-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland  Affairs Council and its spokesman, said that because of the  repeated occurrences of the hijacking of mainland airliners to  Taiwan, he hoped that the mainland authorities will show  sincerity, hold follow-up working-level talks as soon as  possible, and sign an agreement on the repatriation of hijackers  as quickly as possible so that mainland hijackers can be  repatriated according to the stipulations of the agreement.    Yesterday, the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], in  addition  to employing its channels for contacts with the mainland's  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] and  informing its counterpart about information concerning the  hijacking, also called on the mainland authorities to adopt  positive measures to effectively put a stop to hijackings. It  also expressed the hope that the SEF-ARATS talks will quickly  reach an agreement on the agenda concerning the repatriation of  hijackers at the fourth working-level consultations meeting to  be held in Beijing at the end of March.</p>

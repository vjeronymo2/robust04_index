			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Arts: Reimann's 'Das Schloss' - Opera Aribert Reimann's Kafka opera, Das Schloss (The Castle), could hardly have made a more auspicious start in life. Its premiere at the Berlin Festival last September has been quickly followed by two other productions, most recently in Berne. And yet the work cannot be described as 'popular'. It makes extreme demands on an audience's concentration and the resources of a provincial theatre. On that basis, the Berne ensemble can be proud of its achievement - even if its courage sometimes outweighed its mastery of Reimann's music. In Berlin, Das Schloss came across as a bleak, three-hour parable of xenophobia and bureaucracy, draped in music of elaborate invention. I found myself admiring it a lot less in Berne. Kafka's novel about K - the figure who arrives in a wintry village with a commission to work as land-surveyor at the Castle - does not lend itself easily to the theatre. K himself does not have any personality (in the novel his speech is all indirect): we simply see him reacting passively to the rebuffs and betrayals of a succession of colourful, heartless characters. Nor is there much dramatic development: K's predicament at the end is the same as at the start. Reimann organises his material into nine 'frames' capturing situations in the novel - but music and dialogue offer no more than different slants to the same picture. Eike Gramss' production, designed by Eberhard Matthies and Renate Schmitzer, placed the work somewhere between Theatre of the Absurd, black comedy and philosophical fable - with a few Expressionist touches thrown in for good measure. The permanent set consisted of a bare white room, with mysterious side entrances and a backdrop opening up to reveal sky and snow. Distantly visible in the first and last scenes was the Castle itself, looking more like a motel than a Kafkaesque tower. Costumes were 20th century middle-European, with K resembling a cross between a shaven-headed Dutchman and the universal hobo. Jan Frank Danckaert missed the air of weary puzzlement essential to the role (memorably created by Wolfgang Schone in Berlin), but the supporting cast, led by Gottfried Driesch's farcical Mayor, Elisabeth Hornung's witch-like Landlady and Uwe Schonbeck's enigmatic Burgel, offered a collection of richly contrasted character-portraits. The orchestral performance under Andreas Delfs would have benefitted from greater textural clarity and more incisive brass perorations - but the chamber-music sophistication of Reimann's instrumental writing (the opposite, as in so much of this opera, to Lear) was faithfully recreated.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW CLASS SITES STUDIED FOR EXPELLED  STUDENTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles school officials said Tuesday that they are no longer considering  Hughes Junior High School in Woodland Hills as a potential site to house  classes for students expelled from regular schools because of weapons  possession or assaults.  </P> <P> The district instead is exploring several options, including housing such  students at some of the 38 adult education schools throughout Los Angeles or at  sites used by dropout prevention programs, said Barry Mostovoy, administrative  consultant for school operations.  </P> <P> Mostovoy said community opposition played a role in the district's decision to  drop Hughes, a closed school used for administrative offices, as a possible  site. School board member Julie Korenstein, who represents Woodland Hills,  opposed the proposal, as did City Councilwoman Joy Picus.  </P> <P> Both officials said they had received complaints from nearby residents who  feared an increase in crime and lower property values in the neighborhood.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Minister of Railways Gennadiy </F> Fadeyev by Aleksandr Rybakov; date, place not given: "Ministry  of Railways Outlines New Railroad Schedule. Interview with  Russian Minister of Railways Gennadiy Fadeyev"]    [Text]    [Rybakov] Gennadiy Matveyevich, as minister, which form of  transport do you use most frequently -- aircraft or the train?    [Fadeyev] The train of course. It is cheaper and more  reliable.    [Rybakov] Why?    [Fadeyev] Take safety. Last year seven people died in  accidents. Whereas 37,000 died on the roads, 222 died in the  air, whereas the figures were nine and 30 for river and maritime  transport respectively. You can direct a host of complaints at  railroad workers bar one: Trains run despite the general crisis  and the 25-percent decline in industrial production in the  country. At the very least, every Russian citizen uses the  train 14 times a year on average. Given the size of our country  and the astronomical prices of air tickets, this is the only  reliable means of transportation that people can afford. The  "iron horse" fully meets the needs of the national economy -- it  carries three-fourths of all freight and almost one-half of all  passengers. If there were to be holdups owing to strikes say,  there would be chaos. During the first quarter of the year we  carried 267 million tonnes of freight and 470 million  passengers. That is less than in the past. But nevertheless  losses incurred from shipments in the first three months of the  year totaled 200 billion rubles [R] and overall losses totaled  R37 billion [figures as published]. In this period our  enterprises were owed R1.87 trillion. Owing to nonpayments by  customers the railroads are unable to pay for electricity, fuel,  semimanufactures, and rolling stock.    [Rybakov] What is the solution?    [Fadeyev] At the moment the Ministry of Railways is finding  barter to be the solution. During the first quarter we received  coal, timber, cotton, food, and so on, worth R1 trillion to  cover freight costs. This is tackled by a specially created  financial-industrial group. But in principle I deem it  necessary to revive a normal system of systematic, advance  payment for freight shipment.    In civilized countries coal is not shipped more than 600 km  from the place of extraction because it is not profitable. In  our country the distance covered can be 10 times that. The  Kuzbass and Vorkuta are particularly sensitive to this. It looks  as though it is cheaper for the Far East to buy coal from  Australia than to extract coal in the Kharanor pit near Chita.  The government must sort out this matter (we have made our  proposals). All the regions cannot be treated alike. And it  does not pay us to carry 10 tonnes of freight 1 km for R160.    Today many existing and newly formulated statutory acts do  not take into consideration the special features of our work.  As federally owned enterprises, the railroads do not have the  right to autonomously manage their property in order to enhance  their effectiveness. The State Committee for the Management of  State Property, which has been assigned these rights, does not  bear responsibility for the sector's work and does not guarantee  compensation for damage incurred as a result of the measures it  takes. For instance, a section of the line of the Chusovoye  Branch of the Sverdlovsk Railroad was confiscated without  coordination with the Ministry of Railways. There are also  cases of the State Committee for the Management of State  Property leasing our nonhousing premises.    [Rybakov] What are your relations with the CIS countries?    [Fadeyev] Our payments with the CIS are sometimes described  as something of a one-way traffic. Nearby foreign countries owe  us around R600 billion for shipments. We are once again taking  payment via barter. But as chairman of the CIS States' Council  for Railroad Transport I can say that they are all guided by  Russia in terms of the price of passenger freight. There is  some trouble with Ukraine, particularly at maritime ports. But  I think that we will eliminate that.    [Rybakov] There are a great number of complaints that  freight is not kept safe.    [Fadeyev] We did indeed lose freight worth R5.5 billion  during the first quarter, R3 billion of which is accounted for  by Chechnya and Dagestan. Incredible things happen. Motorized  cranes go up to the train and remove literally everything --  timber, coal.... One conductor was taken hostage and returned  four days later, but she was unrecognizable, she was almost  mute. Now trains carrying our crews do not go through Chechnya  and valuable freight is not carried at night. I do not see any  solution with regard to Chechnya. Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia,  and Russia need to pool their efforts to combat looting.    [Rybakov] It is being said today that railroad workers are  stifling people with their prices.    [Fadeyev] I do not want to have to justify myself, but let  us look at the figures. Carrying 10 passengers 1 km costs  R104.2 -- that is the price of three cups of tea in any canteen.  But we do not only have to keep the locomotives, cars, and  tracks in good repair, but also to maintain housing, the health  service, and kindergartens.    Where is the money to come from? Some of the problems have  been shifted on to customers -- 30 percent of the expenditure on  freight shipment is "covered" by ticket prices because the state  does not allocate the requisite funds. But that cannot go on,  no railroad in the world survives without state subsidies, the  sector's problems cannot be resolved by raising charges. And  the Ministry of Railways has repeatedly told the government that.    Nonpayments are also taking their toll. We are owed a total  of R3.5 trillion and we owe miners, power generation workers,  and others R2.6 trillion, We are in effect providing our  customers with credit to the tune of R1 trillion and delivering  freight free of charge.    [Rybakov] The summer season is drawing near. For what  should passengers be prepared?    [Fadeyev] The rise in the cost of output used by the sector  is making it necessary to index charges in order to preserve the  efficiency of railroad transport. But the Ministry of Railways  has no intention of raising prices of long-distance passenger  travel before the end of the summer season or of suburban travel  before the end of the year. We now have 460 long-distance  trains running every day, during the summer there will be 660,  and 12,500 suburban electric trains compared with the 10,000 we  have today. We have increased the number of conductors to two  per car.    In order to improve the service the Ministry of Railways is  outlining a new railroad schedule. The arrival and departure  times of 24 trains at terminuses have been altered to suit  passengers, while the normal traveling speed of 30 trains has  been increased, seven trains have become fast trains by  canceling stops at underutilized stations, and the number of  trains has been increased by 15.5 pairs [na 15.5 pary].    In order to reduce expenditure, the network of deluxe trains  [firmennyye poyezda] (now 53) is to be expanded and flexible  transportation schedules are being developed taking into  consideration the change in demand on different days of the week.    We asked the government to exempt us from some taxes in  order  to reduce the amount by which charges are indexed, but this  matter has not so far been resolved. Despite the five-fold  increase in passenger charges in 1994, transportation is still  extremely unprofitable. According to preliminary estimates,  losses will rise to R1.5 trillion in the first half-year. Steps  need to be taken.    [Rybakov] What are the sector's prospects?    [Fadeyev] Moving on to streamlining railroad transport I  would like to point out that the regions have a large part to  play here. For instance, the Moscow Government has allocated  R22 billion for the procurement of electric suburban trains, and  St. Petersburg will not lag behind. But other regions are not  particularly getting moving at the moment.    Following the breakup of the USSR, Russia lost capacities  for  the production of passenger cars, electric trains, freight  diesel locomotives, and tankers. The temporary drop in  production is making it possible to redevelop Russia's transport  machine building base. The Ministry of Railways, in conjunction  with involved ministries and departments, has drafted federal  programs entitled "Developing Freightcar Building in Russia" and  "Developing Russia's Enterprises To Increase Production of  Locomotive Passenger Cars," which are at present with the  Ministry of the Economy and are to be adopted by the Russian  Federation Government once they have been examined.    The implementation of these programs, along with the  "Developing Locomotive Building in Russia in 1994-1995" Program,  will make it possible to supply railroad transport with Russian  equipment, stop foreign procurement, and work reliably to meet  the country's transportation needs. The first step was for the  Demikhovskiy Plant to assimilate production of Russian electric  trains in just a few months in 1993. It is planned to produce  at least 25 suburban electric trains by the end of the year.</p>

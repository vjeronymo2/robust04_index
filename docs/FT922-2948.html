			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Inflation stands still at 4.3% THE rate of inflation was unchanged last month although the underlying trends remained downward. Fears that the headline inflation figure would be pushed up as last year's mortgage-rate cuts dropped out of the retail prices index proved unfounded. Instead, a 0.4 per cent rise in the RPI last month left the rate of increase in the 12 months to May at 4.3 per cent, the same figure as in April. Figures from the Central Statistical Office also show that the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - often taken as a measure of underlying retail price inflation - fell to 5.3 per cent in the year to May, the lowest figure since December 1988. This measure of retail-price inflation has fallen steadily from 5.8 per cent in December. The Treasury said the figures were 'excellent news', and forecast underlying inflation would continue to fall in the coming months as weak producer-price inflation fed through to the wider inflation index. Last month producer-price inflation - the prices of manufactured goods  - fell to 3.6 per cent, the lowest annual rate of increase since 1987. The RPI fell to 4 per cent in March but jumped to 4.3 per cent in April after the Budget increases in excise duties. Economists expect the RPI to resume its downward path later this year. Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank in London, said: 'Provided the squeeze continues and service-sector inflation gets hit, the outlook on inflation should be better by the second half of this year.' A breakdown of the components of the index shows that prices in the service sector continued to rise faster than in the traded-goods sectors. Prices of leisure services, for example, rose by 8.4 per cent in the year to May, while fares and other travel costs rose by 5.9 per cent. This compares with an annual increase of 3 per cent for household goods and 2.5 per cent for leisure goods. The CSO said the rise in the index from 138.8 to 139.3 between April and May mainly reflected higher motoring costs and some increases in food prices, along with the remaining Budget increases in excise duties. Overall food prices rose by 0.5 per cent on the month but seasonal food prices dropped 1.2 per cent on the month. This reflected the plentiful supplies of home-grown vegetables and, in particular, lower prices for tomatoes, cucumbers and cauliflowers. Apples, grapes and strawberries were cheaper and the price of home-killed lamb, which usually rises in May, fell. Seasonal food was the only sector of the index to fall last month but prices for household services and clothing and footwear were static. Although prices for men's clothing were higher, the CSO said there were reductions on most items of women's clothes. Compared with a year ago, clothing and footwear prices were only 0.2 per cent higher. The monthly rise in housing costs of 0.2 per cent reflected the continuing increase in the average size of outstanding mortgage debts, said the CSO. Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'In the depths of recession, (May's inflation) figure must be regarded as very disappointing, especially as it is many months since the prime minister said that he had inflation 'licked'.'

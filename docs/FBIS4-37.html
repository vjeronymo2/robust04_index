(Jerusalem AL-NAHAR 7 Mar 94)      Real Estate Investments in Gaza on Hold      Gazan real estate investors are reportedly refraining from  undertaking projects in the Gaza Strip due to the climate of  instability and uncertainty there.  Usamah al-Khudayri, the head of  Al-Khudayri Engineering and Contracting Company in Gaza, expressed  his fears about investing in real estate construction in Gaza at  this time, and said that he has decided to forego employing many  workers at his company because he has had to stop some projects as a  result of current conditions.  Investor Mahmud Saf iyah backed out  of a project to construct 20 housing units because Gazans declined  to put deposits on the apartments, hoping for better prices and  payment terms from the new Palestinian authority.  In the recent  past, the Israeli Government put up at least $100,000 in capital for  each housing project that investors undertook in Gaza.  A study  prepared by Jamil Hararah, head of the Center for Investment in  Gaza,  concludes that future investment in Gaza should focus on  industry, real estate, tourism, agriculture, and services.

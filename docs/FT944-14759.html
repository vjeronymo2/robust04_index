			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television Channel 4 has turned Friday into 'Make Fun Of The Froggies' evening. In Paris Alexei Sayle plays an artist in the 1920s who likes to paint chocolate box pictures. He drops his breakfast and a lot of paint on the floor and the resulting mess brings him fame and the adoration of the avant garde. Not what you'd call subtle, but Sayle never needed subtlety to make us laugh. Today he chaperones the sons of a famous art critic so that Valerie can indulge in the craze for suicide (9.30). Eurotrash is the magazine programme presented by Antoine de Caunes and Jean-Paul Gaultier which hunts down the sleazy, the vulgar and the batty, not only in France, but across the entire Disunited States Of Europe. Today we are told we shall meet Andro, an ex puppeteer from Berlin who has become an expert in 'tantric sex' and now hosts his own nude chat show and Spanish film director Bigas Luna talking about his latest venture (11.10). In Favourite Films (9.30) Scorsese names his desert island movies, including the 1946 Western Duel In The Sun which is screened at 12.15 (both BBC2).</p>

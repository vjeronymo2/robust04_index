			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Big Mac cure for eastern Europe: John Willman dreams of creating a charity which spreads capitalism IF CAPITALISM is such a great system, why can't it do more to help those who want to sign up for it? I ask the question because we fat cats in the West seem unable to offer any constructive advice to the peoples of the former Soviet Union on how they can board the gravy train. Most western economists sound like Mr Punch's Irishman who, when asked the way to Dublin, said that he would not start from here. Capitalism may have defeated communism in the battle of ideas. But for the ordinary Muscovite in the bread queue, capitalism = price reforms = hyperinflation plus civil disorder. Liberal democracy is unlikely to be victorious in the circumstances. If darker forces prevail, they will have access to the Soviet nuclear arsenal - so we all share a vested interest in encouraging wealth and happiness east of the Vistula. Now I am well aware that international capitalism is not a multi-national corporation which can expand into new markets like IBM or Unilever. But some sort of consortium needs to be assembled with extraordinary powers to direct resources towards easing the suffering of the Soviet peoples. Its mission statement would be to sponsor projects which improve the lives of ordinary men and women, encourage virtuous economic behaviour and spread understanding about the mysteries of capitalism. For example, McDonalds might be commissioned to open a hamburger restaurant in every city in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The demonstration effect would be considerable for millions of Russians whose only experience of eating out is the works canteen or Restaurant No 41. I would expect useful spin-off from McDonalds licking the local suppliers into shape. And the normal staff turnover in hamburger restaurants would swiftly create a cadre of young people skilled in keeping customers happy. Action is also needed in the energy sector to keep the oil flowing and the lights burning. There are plenty of western oil contractors with experience of managing oilfields and refineries in worse circumstances than yet obtain in the former Soviet Union. I would send them in, offering incentive payments for keeping supplies flowing and modernising installations. Some imaginative thought is also needed to modernise internal transport systems - especially the railways, which are the main way of moving freight. Indian railway managers should be appointed to run the Soviet rail system. As my colleague Quentin Peel has pointed out, they are better qualified to run an ageing railway under adverse conditions than, say, SNCF or DBB. Then there is the challenge of beating swords into ploughshares - switching productive resources from the bloated arms industry to producing consumer goods. The 70,000 General Motors staff about to be made redundant in the US should be offered lucrative short-term contracts to convert Soviet tank factories into making lorries, vans and other useful vehicles. And to encourage the Soviet armed forces to stay out of politics, International Capitalism PLC should pay their wages for the next six months. For a modest outlay (at current exchange rates), this would give the new governments of the independent states breathing space to establish their own structures of law, administration and taxation. Naturally, the offer should be conditional on all nuclear warheads being handed over to the UN by next Wednesday. Finally, the recession has left western computer manufacturers with stockpiles of unsold PCs which are rapidly losing their appeal in home markets as technology moves forward. I would snap them up at cost and give them away free - with accounting software and spreadsheets - to schools, research institutions and every enterprise which claims one. The sooner every would-be entrepreneur in the CIS is playing Lounge-suit Larry on an Amstrad, the better. Expensive? Not in comparison with what has been spent on military containment since 1945 - or on the likely cost if increasing misery leads to anarchy and civil war. I would have thought that about a tenth of the NATO budget would be enough to fund these pump-priming exercises. The fact that some of these ideas will also produce work for western companies is an added attraction. How better to dig ourselves out of a recession than by spreading the capitalist message?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dinos Menelaou] </F>   [Excerpts] [Menelaou] The Cyprus issue is at a crossroads  and President Glavkos Kliridhis, in a statement at Larnaca  Airport this afternoon, determined the next steps that the Greek  Cypriot side will take. He was welcomed by Alexis Galanos,  acting president and House of Representatives president; Foreign  Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis; and Deputy Minister to the  President Pandlis Kouros. [passage omitted]    The president rejected the view that the British and the  Americans are mocking the Cypriot people with their continuous  interventions to delay the UN Secretary General's report from  being submitted and explained the reason why.    [Kliridhis] It is a fact that both the United States and  Britain believed that there was still a possibility that Mr.  Rauf Denktas would accept the Secretary General's document on  the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Their  policy was that we should not hurry, since there were some  indications -- not from Mr. Denktas, but from Mrs. Tansu Ciller  -- that there was still room to negotiate. Therefore, let us  not talk about mockery; this was the situation as they saw it.  The question was clarified during the Vienna meeting.    [Menelaou] President Kliridhis also referred to the role  that Russia can play in the Cyprus issue.    [Kliridhis] It can play a serious role. It appears that  there are new developments in Russian foreign policy. While for  some time Russia was prepared merely to follow the policy of  others, it has returned to the forefront and wants to show that  it has its own policy. This is a new development that we are  very interested in seeing.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Argentine president shies from re-election PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina has begun distancing himself from a campaign to amend the constitution and win him the right to run for re-election, vowing instead to deepen his free-market reforms. On Monday Mr Menem said in a speech that he wanted to 'open this new stage (of government) with grandeur, without thinking of future ambitions, without hegemonic temptations, without delirious dreams of perpetuation.' The president, who earlier this month reached the mid-point of his six-year term in office, had hoped to remove a constitutional ban on successive presidential terms by calling a national plebiscite later this year. The plan ran into strong resistance from the opposition Radical party, from members of his own Peronist party and from business. With his speech Mr Menem has stated that he recognises a constitutional amendment is impossible to secure at the moment, and has promised to dedicate the second half of his term to broadening reforms. Mr Menem's decision represents a victory for Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, and a defeat for some of the president's close allies and a faction of the Peronist party which had urged him to dilute his reforms to buy political backing for re-election. Monday's speech outlined some of the policies Mr Menem plans to concentrate on in the coming three years. These include strengthening the state's regulatory role, bolstering the tax collection system, enforcing competition, and improving social policies. His pledge coincides with the public's growing disenchantment with reform as the economy slows down and real incomes decline. Meanwhile, disgust over widespread government corruption remains as strong as ever.</p>

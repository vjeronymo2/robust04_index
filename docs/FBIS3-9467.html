The accident occurred when a risky experiment was in  progress  in the No. 6 Unit, namely reducing the loading of turbogenerator  No. 10 down from 100 percent to zero. At the very start of the  experiment, a short circuit occurred that shut down the standby  electrical supply to Units Nos. 5 and 6. Only by switching on  standby diesel generators was it possible to prevent the reactor  from becoming a bomb. Important control and monitoring  apparatus remained without any electric power supply, so that  between 1415 and 1600, no information or recordings were  available on the actions carried out. The Soviet specialists in  charge of the experiment refuse to provide any explanation.    The experts established that no program existed for the  experiment or for dealing with any possible incidents that might  occur. The Central Control Department has no documentation  either because the tape recorder that serves as a "black box" in  the event of accidents is started manually, and on the day in  question, no one thought of switching it on.    The failure in the No. 6 Unit put the radiation safety  monitoring panel out of action. The workers connected all the  instruments to the standby diesel generators. However, no one  noted this either in the report compiled by the Kozloduy Nuclear  Power Plant, nor in the one made by the National Electricity  Company commission, nor in the report of the Committee for  Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy because it contravened the  nuclear safety regulations and considerably increased the risk  arising from the fault. The chiefs of the nuclear plant decided  to disconnect the preventative systems of the No. 5 Unit and  reconnect it to its normal power supply because the standby  power supply system, fed from diesel generators, was unreliable.  However, on the very next day, "someone" countermanded this  order. A further short circuit occurred, which, according to  the experts, lasted for more than a minute. A fire broke out  that burned for over two hours. As a result of all this, until  12 December 1992, we had to import from Ukraine additional  electric power costing about 600 million leva.</p>

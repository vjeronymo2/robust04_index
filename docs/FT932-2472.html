			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Booker meets Postel concern on pay-offs BOOKER, the food and agricultural group, has hired Mr Charles Bowen as its new chief executive on terms designed to meet the concerns of some institutional investors. It is the first appointment by a large UK company since Mr Alistair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, Britain's largest pension fund, wrote to leading companies expressing concern about rolling contracts. These can give executives large pay-offs if they are sacked. Mr Jonathan Taylor, who is moving from chief executive to chairman of Booker on the retirement of Sir Michael Caine, said: 'We are abiding by the wishes of Postel.' Mr Ralph Quartano, a former head of Postel, is a non-executive director of Booker. Mr Bowen will have an initial three-year fixed-term contract. After that another fixed contract will be agreed or a rolling contract within Postel's guidelines will be set. Mr Taylor declined to comment on the size of Mr Bowen's salary. Mr Bowen, who was headhunted from Maple Leaf Foods, the Canadian subsidiary of Hillsdown Holdings, said 'nothing in the remuneration package enables me to do well if the company does badly'. He said the move to Booker was 'a challenge, but not too daunting a one'. Booker's shares rose 13p to 381p. Observer, Page 15; People, Page 12</p>

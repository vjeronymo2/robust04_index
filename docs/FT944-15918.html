			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Travel: So very Kiwi - clean and green - John Westbrooke revisits his homeland The skies over New Zealand are broad, blue and bitingly clear. It has something to do with lack of pollution, and with sea breezes - and, alas, with the ozone layer. It seems very unfair. Fridges and aerosol cans spew out CFCs north of the equator, but the southern hemisphere bears the brunt: a fluctuating hole over Antarctica and a distinct thinning over New Zealand, Australia and Chile. You can still tan, but with care and high-factor sun cream. It is particularly unfair because New Zealand is one of the greenest of countries, and Kiwis the greenest of people. They are devoted to the environment, and they have a lot of it - imagine a land the size of Britain filled with a population of only 3.5m. New Zealand outdoorsmen invented jogging, jet-boating and bungee jumping (and, they claim on fairly persuasive grounds, aeroplanes). Rugby remains the big spectator sport, but most people's pastimes are wide-open-spaces stuff: yachting, running, tramping (the local term for hiking). We went tramping for a few hours along the Marlborough Sounds at the top of the South Island, New Zealand's sunniest region. A fast boat, with dolphins surfing in its wake, took us from Picton to Resolution Bay and the road-free home of John Teutscher, our guide. He generates his own power and grows his own food, and what he cannot provide himself comes on the same boats as we did: meals-on-keels, they call themselves. His wife, he said, was the expert on trees; his speciality was birds. So it proved, as he charmed fantails and bellbirds out of the bushes with what sounded like faultless imitations of their calls. The sun filtered down between branches high above, and through green gaps we caught glimpses of blue water and blue hills along Queen Charlotte Sound. As we reached the halfway ridge, the trees around us were not all natives: early farmers had cleared the land, planted imports and then given up, and it was reverting to such overgrowth as black beeches with honeydew sap - which draw wasps by the dozen. Over the ridge was real evergreen New Zealand bush: silver ferns, nikau palms and big rimu trees, 140ft high and 800 years old. (For the even bigger and older kauri, you have to go to the far north of the country.) At sea level we reached Ship Cove, named by Captain Cook who visited it five times on his three voyages in the 1770s; and we relaxed on the beach, recovered our breath and waited for the boat to pick us up. The isolation is real, and I sympathised with the farm children we met around the sounds, studying by correspondence and going fishing by way of entertainment. Some families bring in paying guests for 'homestays', typically involving transport by boat or float-plane, excellent home cooking, a warm spa pool under the stars. Here you can wake up, watch the morning mist rising over the water, and know you will need binoculars to see the neighbours. We stayed with the Perrets in Bay of Many Coves, lunched with the Robbs in Kenepuru Sound, and visited the Brakenridges' sheep station on Pohuenui Island, all of them miles from one another and delighted to offer hospitality to strangers. From the farm's highest point, we looked around 360 degrees, at more islets and inlets than we could count, alternating fingers of blue and green stretching into the distance. There are only a couple of towns in the area: Picton, the ferry port through which most people drive without noticing, and Havelock, on the next sound. Havelock is little more than a village but two noted scientists began their schooling there: William Pickering, who worked on the US space programme, and Ernest Rutherford, who split the atom - an irony in a country so passionately anti-nuclear. New Zealanders' utopian ideals are encouraged by their remoteness from their neighbours: a 1,500-mile circle round Picton will contain no one else but penguins and Australians. Most native animals are unique, including birds such as the kiwi which have forgotten how to fly as they have nowhere to go. Politicians are free to experiment: the country pioneered the welfare state and votes for women, and is now struggling with an extreme market economy. And the people are as New Age as any Californian. One women's magazine features not only the usual agony aunt, astrological and medical pages but columns by a vet, a palmist, a clairvoyant and a feng shui geomancer, a product of growing immigration from south-east Asia, who answers such psycho-domestic problems as 'My son has painted his room purple and it's giving off bad vibes. . .' One of the elements keeping the country in touch with the world is the wine industry, big and growing. On the plains to the south of the Marlborough Sounds, the sun has proved perfect for ripening grapes. Though not hot enough for reliable reds, the long, bright summers have produced world-beating whites in only a decade. The best known brand is Cloudy Bay but there are 21 vineyards in the region. Most call themselves boutique wineries, and some have restaurants on site where you can sit in the sun, eat, drink and count your blessings. The best known variety is Sauvignon Blanc, but if you feel that drinking it is like being pelted with ripe fruit, there are plenty of elegant Chardonnays and Rieslings as well. The region is rich in food, too: crayfish, apricots, olive oil, strawberries, merino meat and more. It exports pumpkin seeds to America and wasabe - a very hot Japanese mustard - to Japan. There are salmon farms along the sounds, and 350 green-shell mussel farms. Down the east coast is the town of Kaikoura, which was once a centre for the early whalers. Now you can go whale-watching with an operation run by local Maoris who take you offshore to look for seals, dolphins and young, male sperm whales. They sail year-round and claim a 95 per cent success rate, but the best time is early in the morning before the winds spring up. When the boat draws alongside a 50-ton whale lifting its tail in the air before quietly diving, the sight is breath-taking. Very green, very New Zealand. John Westbrooke was a guest of Air New Zealand and the New Zealand Tourism Board. Return fares to Auckland start at around Pounds 900, cheaper at bucket shops. The people are friendly, the roads empty, and motels ubiquitous; but the sun can be fierce: summer is December to March. The Mobil Travel Guides to the country (published by Reed, sometimes available in Britain) are among the world's most exhaustive. The NZ Bed and Board Book (Moonshine Press, New Zealand) is a good guide to homestays.</p>

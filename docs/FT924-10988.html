			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Jobs: What a difference three months makes - Study of world living costs by European Commission shows effects of the plunge in sterling WHICH kind of British export has risen in price as a result of the United Kingdom's devalu . . . (sorry) withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism? The answer, of course, is the two-legged variety - expatriate British workers, especially when of executive status. And today the Jobs column can give an idea of how much the cost of same has shot up, at least to employers who don't require the far-flung Brits themselves to bear the brunt of exchange-rate changes. A touch ironically, the cost indicators which are set out in the accompanying table originate with the European Commission. Having staff of its own scattered about the globe, the EC compiles data on world-wide living costs through the Eurostat directorate at its Brussels headquarters. Hitherto the results have been kept for official use. But, perhaps feeling the budgetary pinch, the commission has now decided to put its data on the market. It is doing so in the UK through the International Employer branch of the Sedgwick Consulting Group, and anyone wanting details of the service should contact Richard Hume-Rothery at Winterton House, Nixey Close, Slough, Berks SL1 1NG; telephone 0753 516151, fax 0753 516190. Whereas the full survey covers 117 cities, my extracts are limited to 22 (not counting London which, although missing from the list, is present in spirit because the living-cost indices are based on London prices at 100.) For each city, the table starts with the exchange rates prevailing first in July then at the close of markets last Friday, and goes on to show the indices at each date and the change between them in terms of percentage points. Another limitation is that, as is usual in such surveys, no account is taken of housing costs which are very hard to measure in an internationally consistent way. Nevertheless - as might be expected, given that the EC has been called 'the bureaucrat's bureaucracy' - even the limited information here supplied is more detailed than the normal type of living-cost indicators. Those I've printed previously consist of a single index figure, representing the local price of a 'basket' of goods and services bought by a typical executive family sent to work there. By contrast, the EC prices three different baskets for each place. The first, the 'home country pattern' denotes the buying habits of pukka expatriates who insist on preserving the same style of life they led before going abroad. The next, the 'host country pattern', represents the typical style of executives who're natives of the place concerned. The third is the 'intermediate pattern' of the expatriates who change to the local style in some ways while maintaining their homeland habits in others. Which of the three patterns is adopted can make an appreciable difference to an employer sending people to work abroad. Take for example a British executive on a gross salary of Pounds 50,000 in the UK who is being transferred along with spouse and two children to a job in Geneva. With the local index for the home country pattern now 175.8, I'm told the extra pay needed to preserve their UK style of life would be Pounds 15,960 a year. While that could be cut to an additional Pounds 9,660 by forcing the family to go totally native on an index of 145.8, the EC feels it would be fairer to compromise on the 160.1 figure and an extra Pounds 12,600. But quite apart from such individual instances, the cost changes brought about by the plunge of sterling surely make arresting reading in their own right. Measured by the index-point differences since July in the intermediate pattern - on which the table is ranked - Buenos Aires, Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Dublin have all become dearer than London, whose place in the two-tier Europe seems no longer to be in any doubt. Indeed, of the EC capitals listed, Athens is nowadays the only one cheaper.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN STEPS TO KEEP TEAM FREE OF INFECTION  </P> <P> So Hubie Brooks is upset by the trade sending him from 1991's top contending  team back to the New York Mess. His warning to the Dodgers that they have 1%  that could ruin a very good team comes from a player unable to remember how  many outs there were, allowing Brett Butler to score the winning run in a game  at Candlestick Park last season crucial to the Dodgers' comeback hopes. Come  on, Hubie, leave with the dignity everyone expects from such a nice guy.  </P> <P> ALAN AMITIN  </P> <P> Montrose  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bangalore -- Indian Space Research Organisation  (ISRO) Chairman UR Rao admitted on Thursday that the Russians  had gone back on the cryogenic rocket deal, but said talks  between Glavkosmos, the Russian space agency, and the ISRO on  the issue were still not over.    "The Russians have expressed their inability to extend the  transfer of technology. That is a fact. We are now  re-negotiating and seeing what can be done on that," he said.  Rao was speaking to the Press following the inauguration of the  Karnataka Hybrid Micro Devices Limited (KHMD), an enterprise set  up under he ISRO entrepreneur development programme.    Asked to verify Moscow-based reports that the Russians were  willing to supply an increased number of cryogenic engines in  lieu of the technology transfer, Rao said in diplomacy several  methods are used by negotiators, one of which includes the  issuing of all kinds of statements. "Some people will express  their perceptions of the situation, however, we will announce  something only if we are satisfied."    Asked whether the US embargo on ISRO will be lifted in view  of the jettisoned cryogenic deal, Rao said now the Americans  ought to lift the embargo as the facts of the deal falling  through had received wide publicity. However, ISRO would not  approach the Americans and ask them to lift the embargo. "I  don't care what they (the Americans) do. They are the ones who  imposed the embargo. It is up to them to lift it," he said.    Rao agreed that embargoes were a nuisance but pointed out  that ISRO had enough past experience with them. Many dual-use  technologies were not available to ISRO and even mundane items  such as the wheels for the mobile rocket-launching tower were  not given to ISRO in the past. "We had to make it ourselves," he  said. "Fundamentally a sovereign country like India has to  develop its own capability in high technology. We cannot become  a global competitor if we cannot stand on its own two feet."    Pointing out that any country with any high technology held  on to it, preventing other countries from acquiring it, he said:  "We must develop our own technologies because the market is  right here. We must take advantage of it." Rao related the  apocryphal story of an aspirin manufacturer who said that if  every Indian and every Chinese took one aspirin a day, then he  would not have to worry about the rest of the world.    Rao reiterated that India's own cryogenic engine would be  ready in four years. "Nothing will stop us from making it by  1998. I say this with the biggest confidence because of the kind  of people we have working in the Space Department." Rao said  ISRO already had its fuel manufacturing facilities at  Mahendragiri and testing facilities are being developed  speedily. ISRO had built a one-tonne cryogenic engine which had  been tested extensively. "Most of the problems in building a  bigger engine we will be able to tackle. We do not foresee any  major technical-problems," he said.    Rao pointed out that the Russian contract had been entered  into after ISRO had decided to go into indigenous manufacture of  cryogenic engines. "We did not go to anybody for the engines.  They came to us," he said. First it was General Dynamics of the  US, then Ariane of France and finally Glavkosmos. Rao said,  while ISRO had refused the earlier offers, it had accepted the  Russian offer as it was cheap and it was felt it would cut down  the time needed to develop an indigenous engine.    However, now that renegotiations are on, Rao said whatever  was agreed to, ISRO would not accept an increase in price. The  original contract stated a price of Rs [rupees] 235 crore in  Indian rupees. "We will not pay more than this," he said.</p>

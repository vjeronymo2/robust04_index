			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] President Jiang Zemin is in Shenzhen to canvass  support for Beijing's next major programme for economic reform  which will be a mixture of liberalisation and centralisation  measures.    Sources in Shenzhen said the municipal leadership yesterday  lobbied Mr Jiang to allow the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to  continue its role as a ground for experimenting with market  reforms.    Mr Jiang arrived in the zone on Sunday and will leave today  or tomorrow.    A team appointed by Mr Jiang and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongli is  in the final process of drafting a document on the "next stage"  of economic reform, which will be endorsed by the Fourth Plenum  of the Central Committee scheduled for the autumn. Sources  familiar with the drafting process said the document would spell  out the desired kinds of "macro-level adjustments and controls"  under a socialist market economy.    While the document recommends that most of the market  reforms  outlined at the Third Plenum last November be continued, it will  also introduce means in which the Government can ensure that  they can be accomplished without disruptive effects such as  inflation and unemployment.    The sources said since the spring, Mr Jiang had made trips  to  different parts of the country to solicit support for the  programme.    They pointed out Mr Jiang, who is also party General  Secretary, took the opportunity to warn regional cadres they  must put the "overall situation of the country" ahead of local  interests.    Recommendations that are expected to be passed by the Fourth  Plenum include ways to control excessive fixed-assets investment  by localities and to ensure that sufficient land be devoted to  farming, especially grain production. Mr Jiang's team is also  working out strategies to restructure government-owned  enterprises without leading to unemployment or the loss of state  assets.    Sources in Shenzhen said municipal leaders presented Mr  Jiang  with a blueprint for economic reform through to the mid-1990s.    "While assuring that Shenzhen would abide by national  priorities, SEZ cadres indicated they hoped the zone would be  allowed to go on experimenting with market reforms," a source  said.    "These reforms will set the pace for the entire country, and  also facilitate the economic integration between Shenzhen and  Hong Kong."    For example, one reform being carried out in the SEZ is to  promote the separation of Government and business by ensuring  even state-owned companies no longer need remain the subordinate  units of government departments.    It is understood Mr Jiang gave a general support for  Shenzhen's reforms, which also enjoy the backing of the State  Commission for the Reform of the Economic Structure.    Last week, Mr Jiang spread the message of liberalisation,  coupled with restraint, to leaders of other Guangdong cities of  Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai.</p>

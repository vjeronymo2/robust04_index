			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Steep rise in China pay Foreign companies operating in China are facing steep rises in local labour costs, according to a survey, writes Alexander Nicoll, Asia Editor. The Wyatt Company, a US-based consulting firm, says salaries of Chinese nationals working for foreign ventures have risen 22 per cent this year, faster than the 15 per cent increase in 1992. Foreign managers in Beijing have reported it is increasingly difficult to keep good Chinese staff because newly established enterprises lure them away with high salaries. Inflation is also a factor. But salary levels are still low by western standards. A manager working for a foreign representative office earns about Dollars 7,800 a year including allowances, while a manager in a joint venture earns Dollars 3,000.</p>

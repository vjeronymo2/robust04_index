			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A battle with the taxman - Casebook THE INLAND Revenue, which is spending Pounds 2m on an advertising campaign to encourage 10m people to reclaim Pounds 800m in overpaid tax, says the main reason for the lack of claims is apathy. However, a Weekend FT reader has a different explanation. 'It is not that people do not bother to reclaim tax overpaid, but unless my own tax office is an exception to the norm, most people give up in despair,' says Robert Anderson, of Sheriff Hutton, in Yorkshire. Anderson was 65 years old in 1991. As his total income was below Pounds 13,500, he was entitled to the maximum age allowance. He could therefore claim for a refund of tax for the year ending April 1992, and for a smaller refund for 1991. He completed a tax return and details of the amount he thought he had overpaid for 1990-91 in January 1992. 'From then until the end of July, I had continually to telephone and write to get some action,' he says. 'During this time, I dealt with no fewer than eight different people in the same section, each one of whom totally ignored any previous correspondence and started again from scratch, and it was only when I finally demanded to speak to the section head that I obtained any sense.' He was told that his case could not be handled by one person because of holidays, part-time workers and sickness absences. 'During all this time I must say I was treated with courtesy, and each letter came with a profuse apology, for the last mistake on their part; however it soon became obvious to me that the ordinary tax officer in most cases didn't even know which form I should complete,' says Anderson. This year, Anderson has worked out that he is due for a rebate of about Pounds 150 but, 'I had decided that it was not worth the stress trying to obtain it.' However, he has just received a coding notice for 1993-94, which allocated only the basic allowance to him, ignoring his married status and age allowance. 'I am resolved to do battle again,' he says. 'The point I am trying to make is, that the Pounds 2m the government is to spend on advertising would be better spent in trying to educate the tax officers and improve the system.'</p>

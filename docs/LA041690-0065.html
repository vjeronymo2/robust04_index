			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> UAL UNIONS NEEDN'T SWEAT IT: LOOPHOLE'S ON THEIR SIDE  </P> <P> What's the difference between buying a candy bar for 50 cents and the offer by  three labor unions to buy United Airlines' parent company for $4.4 billion?  </P> <P> Answer: If you buy a candy bar, you have to spend 50 cents of your own money.  Which is exactly 50 cents more than the unions are offering to put up toward  the purchase of UAL Corp., the second-largest airline company in the United  States.  </P> <P> This deal is being presented as an example of workplace democracy. What this  deal will really be -- if it goes through, which doesn't seem likely -- is an  example of how Big Labor can be more clever in getting tax subsidies for  corporate takeovers than even Big Capital has been.  </P> <P> What's more, if the unions can raise the money to do this deal, it will  probably happen not because of the deal's economics, but because of a loophole  in a law that Congress passed last year to make it harder for leveraged buyouts  to suck cash out of the U.S. Treasury.  </P> <P> Before we get into all of that, a bit of background. The union offer has  emerged largely to mollify Coniston Partners, UAL's biggest shareholder.  Coniston, which made a ton of dough putting UAL in play back when UAL was  called Allegis Corp., went to the well once too often and is stuck with a 12%  holding in UAL that it is desperate to unload.  </P> <P> Keeping Coniston quiet is the only conceivable reason that UAL's board has  agreed to pay $20 million in fees even if no deal ever comes about.  </P> <P> That helps explain why this transaction is being treated seriously. To give you  the short version, the unions want to form an Employee Stock-Ownership Plan  (known as an ESOP) that would buy UAL entirely with Other People's Money. Most  of the money, about $3.4 billion, would come from banks. That would pay the  $155 of cash per share that the unions are offering UAL holders, plus assorted  fees. The ESOP would give UAL shareholders another $35 a share (around $800  million) of junk bonds and $11 a share (around $200 million) of stock in a  computerized reservations system in which UAL has a 50% interest.  </P> <P> Add it all up, and you come to $201 a UAL share, or about $4.4 billion.  </P> <P> Wonderful. The only thing missing from this pretty picture is any contribution  to the cause by the unions who will end up owning 100% of UAL in the unlikely  event that this deal goes through in its current form.  </P> <P> You would think that in today's world -- a world in which the streets are  littered with dead and dying leveraged buyouts and regulators are leaning on  banks to limit loans to Highly Leveraged Transactions -- this offer is a total  non-starter. Look: The first lesson they teach you in Loan Officer School is  that you don't lend to a borrower who isn't putting any of his own cash in the  deal. The reason is obvious. If the borrower doesn't have his own money at  risk, there's nothing to stop him from taking a walk if the loan goes bad.  </P> <P> The unions argue that they're putting up "sweat equity," in the form of wage  cuts amounting to $2 billion over five years. But that's hard to get your arms  around -- and impossible to foreclose on. How does a bank turn "sweat equity"  into money if the UAL loan goes sour? By getting machinists to fix the bank's  heating system cheap? By getting stewards to hand out packages of nuts at the  bank's stockholders meeting?  </P> <P> The only reason this deal has any chance of getting past the banks is an  obscure tax loophole that will be activated only if the ESOP-owned UAL starts  losing money. That might give the banks some assurance that if the deal  craters, they stand a fair chance of getting their money back.  </P> <P> The key to understanding this is to remember that the buyer of UAL isn't a  regular corporation; it's an ESOP. Because of a loophole in loophole-closing  legislation that Congress passed last year, ESOPs can do something that other  firms can't: offset losses in an LBO'd outfit by getting refunds of taxes  previously paid to the U.S. Treasury.  </P> <P> This used to be one of the great games in the LBO biz, until Congress passed a  law putting a damper on it last year. The game was that you took a company that  paid a lot of taxes, you mortgaged it to the eyeballs and you used the losses  caused by the heavy interest payments to get refunds of taxes paid in earlier  years. This is what's known in the tax trade as a carryback.  </P> <P> Corporations can usually carry losses back and use them to get refunds of  previously paid taxes. Individual taxpayers, like you and me, can only carry  losses forward, using today's losses to shield tomorrow's income. But we can't  use today's losses to get a refund of yesterday's tax payments.  </P> <P> When RJR Nabisco, reporting huge losses because of its $25-billion LBO, showed  up at the Treasury trough last year and got a nine-digit refund, Congress  changed the law to stop the LBO crowd from using this particular game. But the  law doesn't forbid a company owned by an ESOP from playing the game. Thus, an  ESOP can use losses incurred by an LBO to get refunds of taxes paid in previous  years.  </P> <P> So if the ESOP buys UAL and New UAL begins to run losses, the ESOP can get  refunds on some or all of the $575 million of federal income taxes that UAL  paid in 1987, 1988 and 1989. That's a nice, comforting fact for lenders.  Congress will undoubtedly close this loophole some day, but for now, the  airline unions can use this loophole to try to persuade banks to lend money on  "sweat equity."  </P> <P> Isn't the tax code wonderful?  </P></p>

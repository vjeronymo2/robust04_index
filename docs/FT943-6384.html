			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Malaysia acts against sect The Malaysian government has made further moves against an Islamic sect it accuses of trying to destabilise the country. According to government edicts published at the weekend, anyone actively involved with Al Arqam, a sect which claims 100,000 followers in Malaysia and many more in surrounding countries, is liable to arrest, flogging and imprisonment. Earlier this month, Malaysia's national Fatwa council, the body that rules on Islamic orthodoxy, said Al Arqam teachings were deviationist. More than 30 of the sect's followers were arrested over the weekend. Malaysian non-government organisations and the country's bar council have expressed concern that the government's moves violate human rights. Brokers said that a drop of more than 2 per cent on the Kuala Lumpur stock market on Friday was due to general nervousness about the government's actions against Al Arqam. The market was stable yesterday in lacklustre trading.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris down as Eurostocks diverge There was good news and bad news from Paribas Capital Markets yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. 'Our relative valuation indicators suggest that European equities can rise another 10-20 per cent before reaching excessive valuations,' said the broker, 'but risks are increasing. We don't expect a crash or the start of a bear market, but a 5-10 per cent correction is far from excluded.' PARIS itself ran out of steam, the CAC-40 closing 10.3 lower at 2,268.22, a little under 1 per cent up on the week. The market's Eurostocks moved apart again. Eurotunnel rose FFr0.90 to FFr52.50, nearly doubled since the middle of October. Euro Disney, however, ended FFr2.60, or 7.9 per cent lower at FFr30.40. In an interview published yesterday the chairman of Euro Disney's parent, Walt Disney, did not rule out the possibility that its theme park outside Paris might be closed if parent and creditor banks did not agree on a restructuring plan. Accor, the hotel group, rose FFr9 to FFr590 on the company's plans to help the Chinese government renovate some 100 state-run hotels. MILAN saw further demand for Montedison in an otherwise becalmed market and the Comit index added 5.98 to 619.47, for a 0.8 per cent rise on the week. Montedison climbed L34.70 or 3.8 per cent to L947.60 in heavy volume of 35.4m shares, on further consideration of its agreement with Shell to merge part of their chemicals business. The rights in its capital call were also well traded. Olivetti added L38 to L2,149 in continued response to news that it was negotiating the sale of its German Triumph-Adler subsidiary. Telecommunications issues found some demand with Stet, the holding company, rising L51 to L4,403 but Sip, the national telephone operator, dipping L7 to L3,596. MADRID featured large block trades attributed to institutional window-dressing, which appeared to have the desired effect as the general index recovered another 3.58 to 322.77, fractionally down on its high for the year and slightly better on the week. Turnover was Pta26.4bn for the shortened session. Banks continued their recovery following the drop on Banesto's bad news this week, but the gains here were more modest than they were on Thursday. There was more life in utilities, following a fall of 0.2 per cent in the industrial electricity tariff,and a rise of 3.5 per cent on domestic prices announced for 1994. But the Madrid broker, FG, commented that the average increase of 2.06 per cent was already known, and that it would want to see a detailed breakdown of the tariff before commenting on its implications for the sector. ATHENS put on 1.4 per cent as institutional investors restructured their year-end portfolios, the general index rising 13.50 to 945.16 in turnover of Dr5.1bn. The market showed a rise of 4.5 per cent over the last week. ISTANBUL finished at a second consecutive record high, the composite index posing a 507.49 rise to 20,682.89 for a weekly rise of 4.5 per cent and a 417 per cent advance since the start of the year.

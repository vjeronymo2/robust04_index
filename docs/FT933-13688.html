			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / EC banks unite to keep krone in ERM DENMARK'S European Com-munity partners yesterday joined forces to defend the embattled krone with concerted intervention as Danish authorities again raised interest rates to hold the currency in the European exchange rate mechanism. ERM central banks launched several waves of buying for the krone. But after intervention, estimated by some market participants at between DM3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) and DM4bn, the krone closed the week near its lower intervention points in the ERM. The Danish National Bank announced yesterday it would raise its key deposit and discount rates from 7.25 per cent to 9.25 per cent from Monday. The Dutch central bank cut its special deposit rate to 6.6 per cent from 6.7 per cent in an effort to ease tensions between the krone and guilder in the ERM. Yesterday's speculation against the krone caused the EC to postpone yet again a meeting of its monetary committee, scheduled for Monday in Brussels, for fear that it might become a focus of speculation. The committee had been due to meet on July 14 but that meeting was delayed because of speculation against the French franc. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Danish central bank governor, declared the krone would 'be defended no matter what happens'. Ms Marianne Jelved, the Danish economy minister, said her government fully supported the interest rate increases. She said Denmark was determined to take every possible step to protect the krone within the ERM. With Danish prices having risen by only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, she said the latest speculation was 'without any basis in economic reality'. Currencies, Page 13 World stocks, Page 21</p>

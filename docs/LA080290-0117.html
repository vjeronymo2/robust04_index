			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONVICTION IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING  </P> <P> A Santa Ana gang member was convicted of second-degree murder Wednesday for the  drive-by shooting death of an 18-year-old man in February.  </P> <P> Steven Joseph Salazar, 23, who had been released from prison just six days  before the shooting, was found guilty of killing Salvador Arias as he fired  into a crowd of people the night of Feb. 24.  </P> <P> Salazar is a cousin of Robert P. Figueroa, one of the defendants on trial in  Newport Beach in connection with another fatal drive-by shooting, according to  Deputy Dist. Atty. James Marion.  </P> <P> Although Salazar was a member of the 5th Street gang, there was no evidence  that the victim had any gang affiliation, said Marion.  </P> <P> Salazar could receive a maximum of 23 years to life in prison when he is  sentenced Sept. 14 by Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan, the same judge who  convicted him after a two-day trial. Ryan also convicted him of using a gun  during the crime.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred about 8 p.m. when a red pickup truck slowly drove by a  home on the 5000 block of West 5th Street. Witnesses said a man positioned in  the bed of the truck began firing a revolver into a group of about six people  standing in front of the home and sped away, said Marion.  </P> <P> Arias, a laborer, was fatally shot once in the back of the head and once in the  leg.  </P> <P> Initially, witnesses were reluctant to come forward and identify the shooter,  said Marion. But during the trial, an 18-year-old Santa Ana man present during  the incident testified and identified Salazar as the man who fired the gun.  </P> <P> The prosecution also presented evidence that indicated Salazar had a friend who  owned a red pickup truck and had access to it.  </P> <P> Salazar, however, testified in his own defense and denied shooting Arias. He  claimed he wasn't even present and that he was home watching television during  the shooting.  </P> <P> The defendant's mother also testified that she was with her son that night but  admitted she had left the house for a short period. Marion argued that Salazar  had time to commit the crime.  </P> <P> However, defense attorney Kevin Gallagher argued that Salazar was a victim of  mistaken identity. He contended that it was too dark for anyone to have been  able to identify the gunman.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> IT CONTINUES TO BE DANDY SPRING FOR BICHETTE  </P> <P> Dante (Beef) Bichette slammed a 430-foot three-run homer last Thursday and he  hit another three-run shot last Sunday, but the most encouraging thing that has  happened to the 25-year-old outfielder this spring occurred Tuesday when the  Angels posted the list of players who will report to Palm Springs Friday.  </P> <P> It wasn't so much who was on the list as who wasn't. Mike Ramsey, a 10-year  veteran of the minor leagues, and Marcus Lawton, picked up in the Rule V draft  this winter from the New York Mets, will stay behind and train at Mesa, Ariz.  </P> <P> That leaves starters Chili Davis, Devon White and Claudell Washington with Tony  Armas and Bichette vying for the No. 4 outfield spot. Armas is hitting .150  this spring.  </P> <P> There's little doubt that Bichette has earned a chance in the big leagues. He's  hitting .394 with a .697 slugging percentage and eight runs batted in this  spring. And he had a pair of monstrous doubles off the left-center and  right-center field walls in spacious Tempe Diablo Stadium -- it's 420 feet to  dead center -- during the Seattle Mariners' 6-5 victory over the Angels  Tuesday.  </P> <P> It's just a matter of whether the Angels figure he would be better off playing  every day in the minors or sitting on the bench and pinch-hitting in the  majors.  </P> <P> "We haven't even gotten to that bridge, much less had to cross it," General  Manager Mike Port said. "In a perfect-plan sense, we've got Davis, White and  Washington, but who knows what might happen?  </P> <P> "Certainly, every player aspires to be on the club on opening day. But even if  he's not, he might be there the next day and stay the rest of the year. In any  case, we're obviously delighted in the improvement Dante's shown."  </P> <P> Bichette said: "I really haven't thought too much about my chances of making  the club," he said. "I'm just excited about doing so well."  </P> <P> Bichette gives much of the credit to hitting instructor Deron Johnson, who,  like Bichette, was a brawny power hitter.  </P> <P> "I feel like Deron has really turned my career around," Bichette said. "He's  taught me to just go up there hacking. Each week, he adds something new. Like  now, we're working on staying back and using the whole field. He's been a great  help to me."  </P> <P> Johnson admits that he has a special rapport with Bichette, but he won't take  any credit for his protege's power surge.  </P> <P> "The kid's got a lot of ability and he's a really hard worker," Johnson said.  "All I do is tell him all the ways I (messed) up when I was playing."  </P> <P> Bichette got a bit of a break in the way of extra playing time because both  Washington and Davis have missed some games, Washington with the flu and Davis  with a hamstring problem.  </P> <P> "Things always need to break in your favor, but he's earned his at-bats,"  Manager Doug Rader said. "I was really impressed when he hit that curveball for  a homer (Sunday)."  </P> <P> So, could the Angels have filled the void in their outfield without parting  with $2.625 million to get free agent Washington?  </P> <P> And another question is sure to be posed by the fans if any of the Angel  outfielders struggle this season:  </P> <P> Where's the Beef?  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Triple plays are rare enough, but the Angels turned one Tuesday after the  Mariners loaded the bases on two errors and a hit batsman. Seattle's Steve  Balboni hit a line drive at third baseman Jack Howell, who snagged the ball off  his shoe tops, stepped on third to double up Alvin Davis and threw to Wally  Joyner at first to triple up Jim Presley. Joyner wasn't sure if Howell caught  the ball on the fly, so he stepped on the bag and also tagged Presley, who was  sliding back into first. "It was a triple play either way," Howell said.  </P> <P> Manager Doug Rader may not be as intimidating as he was when he managed the  Texas Rangers, but he hasn't lost the playful approach that characterized his  career as a player. Former Angel Manager John McNamara, who was Rader's manager  at San Diego in the mid-1970s, stopped by Gene Autry Park to visit Tuesday.  McNamara and Rader were watching the B game against the Padres when Rader asked  to try on McNamara's straw hat. All of sudden, Rader produced a bottle of  flammable liquid and McNamara's hat was on the ground in flames. "I knew he was  crazy when he played for me, but then he respected me because I was the  manager," McNamara said. "I'll catch up with him in Palm Springs, and it'll  cost him more than a new hat."  </P> <P> The Angels announced the 34 players who will train in Palm Springs, starting  Friday. Staying behind at Mesa will be pitchers Gary Buckels, Vinicio Cedeno,  Colin Charland, Terry Clark, Mike Fetters, Jack Lazorko and Urbano Lugo;  infielders Jeff Manto, Jim McCollom and Lee Stevens; outfielders Marcus Lawton  and Mike Ramsey, and catchers Doug Davis and John Orton. Lazorko, who was 0-1  with a 3.35 earned-run average with the Angels last season, has been pounded  for 10 earned runs in five innings this spring. Clark, 6-6 with a 5.07 ERA last  year, has a rotator cuff injury.  </P></p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / The Week Ahead: Figures may confirm US recovery but cast doubt on German growth A FLURRY of statistics from the US and Germany this week should point to further recovery in the US economy but may cast some doubt over how strongly Germany is growing. The closely watched National Association of Purchasing Managers' index, which is released later today, is expected to indicate further gains in US business optimism last month while labour market statistics on Friday should reveal further growth in non-farm payrolls. Economic data from Germany is likely to be mixed. Thursday's gross national product figures are expected to show robust growth in the first quarter, partly because good weather in the period encouraged construction. Figures for industrial production and orders in April and unemployment in western Germany in May are likely to point to weak economic activity. In Britain, the Halifax house price index for May will be studied closely for any sign of recovery in the depressed housing market following the Conservative government's election victory. ahead, with the median of forecasts in brackets from MMS International, the financial information company, include: Today: US, May National Association of Purchasing Managers' index (53.5 per cent), April personal income (up 0.2 per cent), personal consumption expenditure (up 0.4 per cent), construction spending (up 0.3 per cent), first-quarter balance of payments.

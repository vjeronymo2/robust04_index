			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Education Is the Root of Poverty in </F> Ethnic Areas"]    [Text] The under-developed educational system in minority  nationality regions is the main bottleneck holding up economic  progress in those areas, according to Wang Xiumei, Vice Chairman  of the People's Congress of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.    A vicious cycle is at play because the regions are so poor,  qualified educators cannot be enticed to stay and improve the  schools. Then the students who attend -- or more likely, drop  out of -- the substandard schools do not acquire the skills and  knowledge needed to bring about progressive economic growth.    Adding to the problem, native students who have been sent to  study in other areas of the country quite often refuse to come  back after graduation.    The shortage of talented teachers endangers the very  existence of some of the schools in minority regions. Low  salaries and bad working and living conditions for the teachers  are to blame, according to Hu Shiqiang, a professor at Yunnan  Normal University.    Yet even if a good teacher stays, the poor facilities of the  schools make it difficult to carry out many educational  programmes.    Of course, having good teachers and facilities is pointless  unless the school has students. But in the minority areas,  economic pressures keep many students out of school.    In the rural areas of Inner Mongolia, the annual expenses of  a primary school or high-school student in a peasant's family is  about 100 yuan ($11), Wang said. But many minority families  have more than one child and very low incomes, and they can't  pay for all of their children to go to school at the same time.  As a result, many peasants stop their children's schooling  after primary school.    Similar problems plague Yunnan, according to Hu. For  example, a student of the Lisu nationality who was admitted into  a university had to refuse the offer even though he would  receive a 30-yuan ($3) monthly allowance and transportation  expenses between his home and the university.    "I am grateful to the goodwill of the departments concerned,  but this can only solve my own problem, and not that of my  family, who depend on me to make both ends meet," said the  student.    And now, schooling costs are getting even steeper. The  traditional educational system that enabled students to receive  college education largely at governmental expense is changing,  due to the establishment of the market economy. Most students  now have to pay some of the tuition themselves.    Hu offered several suggestions to overcome the roadblocks to  educational progress.    First, the government should allocate special funds to the  regions to improve the school facilities and the teachers'  living and working conditions. Teachers working in such areas  should be offered higher salaries than their counterparts in  other regions.    Secondly, scholarships and allowances should be provided to  a  certain proportion of students from poor minority areas.    Thirdly, the central government should establish an  educational fund encouraging teachers who devote themselves to  ethnic education in the remote and under-developed regions.    In addition, Hu suggested that the educational  administrations should make it clear that college graduates from  other areas can return to their home towns for work after five  to eight years of teaching in minority nationality areas.</p>

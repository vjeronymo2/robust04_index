			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Safety and Security Sydney </F> Mufamadi by Leslie Mashokwe in the SABC's Cape Town studio, on  the "Newsline" program -- live]    [Text] [Mashokwe] Mr. Mufamadi, good evening and welcome.    [Mufamadi] Good evening, Leslie.    [Mashokwe] From being harassed, jailed, and being detained  by  the police -- to chief of the police -- how is that  transformation?    [Mufamadi] Leslie, I am not chief of the police; I'm  Minister  of Safety and Security?    [Mashokwe] Political master of the police force?    [Mufamadi] Okay, well, what you are referring to are things  that happened in the past. It was in a context where the police  were enforcing the law. The law happened to have been  unpopular. We now have a government of national unity whose  existence reflects the will of the masses of our people in the  country and therefore is going to bring about popular laws which  will need to be enforced.    [Mashokwe] That transformation, how does it touch your  heart?  Does it mean anything to you? Is it just a transformation?    [Mufamadi] Well, it's not a question of heart. It's a  question of us having agreed that we need to resolve all the  problems which we had in this country, through peaceful means,  and I think we have reached a stage now where we all have to  confirm our commitment to a new South Africa, a South Africa  which is going to be at peace with itself, and there is a role  for the police in the shaping up of that South Africa.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Minister, what we have witnessed here is a  change of political masters. The police force then enforced the  laws of the day, the National Party laws that you say were  unpopular. Are they still going to continue to be servants of  the political masters?    [Mufamadi] Well, the constitution lays down standards  according to which policing is going to take place. Policemen  and women are expected to be professional in their outlook.  They are expected to be inspired and motivated by the ethic of  serving the nation, of serving the community. They are expected  to be professional. Now, all this will be done as part of  upholding the constitution of the land, and it means, therefore,  because these standards, these provisions, are laid down in the  Constitution, policemen and women are no longer going to be  abused by political parties.    [Mashokwe] How do you demarcate the boundaries? When are  they going to be professional, or are they going... [brief break  in transmission]    [Mufamadi] Well, I think what we have established is a  commitment to change, a commitment to be part of the process of  change and ensuring that they as policemen and women are not  going to be victims of this process of change, which means that  from the beginning, processes of consultation are going to be  put into motion. That will include what the Constitution refers  to as police community forums, and this professionalization that  we are talking about, in essence it means being responsive to  the needs and requirements that are articulated by the  community. The community should be able to set policing  priorities. The community, through its elected representatives  who would be serving in those forums, should be able to say: We  are the consumers of this service, and therefore this is the  sort of quality of service we are demanding.    [Mashokwe] What about the scourge of the ISD [Internal  Stability Division]? What the ANC then said was that they were  bad policemen. What is going to happen to them? And add to  that the fact that we want to know whether we are still going to  have security forces, intelligence people like the FBI's and  CIA's?    [Mufamadi] Well I think we need to put it this way -- that  the Internal Stability Division was charged with the  responsibility of public order policing. The new government of  national unity thinks that there was a lot wrong in the way they  were trained -- there was this militaristic culture which  obtained within the ISU [Internal Stability Unit] -- which lent  itself to excessive use of force, which needs to be changed.  That does not take away the need for public order policing, but  it means that they need to be trained differently. They have to  continue to maintain law and order, to do public order policing,  but in a manner which conforms to the standards that I have  referred to earlier -- impartiality, service orientated and,  therefore, user friendly.    [Mashokwe] Intelligence?    [Mufamadi] Well it depends on what you mean by intelligence  -- I guess a good detective?    [Mashokwe] No, no, the type of thing we had in the past, Mr.  Mufamadi, where people would be woken up at night, the telephone  being tapped and....    [Mufamadi, interrupting] Well, waking people at night is not  called intelligence, but basically intelligence means if I'm  investigating a case I must be able to gather all the relevant  information which will lead to me making sure that justice takes  its course. It means that I must be able to say this is a  suspect, he or she must be tried in a open court of law, and the  court will make its own finding.    [Mashokwe] Okay, let's talk about demilitarization and  professionalization of the SAPS [South African Police Service]:  Changing name ranks from lieutenant to some new name does not  change anything in actual fact. Why concentrate on name  changing?    [Mufamadi] Now I'm saying -- you see this ranking system  that  exists now --- it's a military ranking system -- general so and  so, colonel so and so, and brigadier so and so, and so on. It  is necessary for us to look for appropriate ranking systems for  the police, and it's not as if they don't exist. They are  there, but leaving aside the question of ranking, when we talk  about demilitarization we are saying essentially that there is a  need for consultation and accountability, both within the South  African Police Service as well as between the South African  Police Service and the community at large. Now this  militaristic culture we are referring to was a top-bottom  approach, an approach which says: Because you are my  subordinate, we think the police force...[pauses] Within the  police service you cannot come up with creative ideas which are  going to be taken on board in order to enrich policing in the  country. We think that must go. We don't want unquestioning  loyalty. We want loyalty which is based on people feeling that  they are part of the system because there are channels of  communication which allowed them to make a constructive input.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Mufamadi, thanks for your time and for  talking  to us.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Aggressive terms for Nestle in Canadian dollar debut THE international bond market saw a revival in new issuance yesterday as several high-quality borrowers made offerings in a variety of currencies. Nestle, the Swiss food group, tapped the Canadian dollar sector for the first time, raising CDollars 300m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds. The proceeds were thought to have been swapped into US dollars. Its popularity with retail investors enabled Nestle to achieve an aggressive spread of five basis points over the 6 1/2 per cent Canadian Treasury due 1998. Syndicate managers were in no doubt the bonds would soon yield less than the underlying government bond. The Province of Alberta also tapped the Canadian dollar sector after an 18-month absence, raising Dollars 500m through an offering of 12-year Eurobonds. The bonds were priced to yield 40 basis points over the 7 1/2 per cent Canadian Treasury due 2003, in line with the spread on British Columbia's recent 12-year offering and well below the spread of 51 basis points on Ontario's 12-year. Lead manager ScotiaMcLeod said that, in spite of its slightly inferior rating, Alberta could command the same spread as British Columbia because it was not a frequent borrower in the Euromarket. The spread on both Canadian dollar offerings remained intact in the afternoon, although the bonds eased slightly, in line with weakness in the underlying Canadian government bond market. Syndicate managers said Canada's general election on October 25 was likely to cause some short-term jitters about the currency but the long-term outlook remained favourable. Rabobank is thought to be looking to raise Canadian dollars at a spread of about 12 basis points over the underlying government bonds. Elsewhere, GECC launched a Dollars 100m offering of three-year floating-rate notes under its series B global MTN programme. The issue is linked to the Mexican peso and is designed to hedge GECC's investments in Mexico. Lead manager Kidder Peabody said GECC was the first foreign corporate borrower to launch such an issue. The notes, which will be priced on or before October 15, have an indicative price of par and a coupon which is equal to the 91-day Mexican Cetes money-market rate. Arbitrage opportunities prompted Johnson &amp; Johnson, the babycare company rarely seen in the Eurobond market, to raise L150bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. Several borrowers have used this structure to tap the Eurolira sector recently and some syndicate managers say that investor appetite for this type of paper is limited. Lead manager BNL said the bonds appealed to retail investors in Italy and in northern Europe. The bonds traded at 100.05 bid, within fees, in the afternoon.</p>

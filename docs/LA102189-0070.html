			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DINKINS TELLS WHY HE CUT VALUE OF STOCK BEFORE SELLING IT TO SON  </P> <P> Democratic mayoral candidate David N. Dinkins, conceding that his campaign had  become "an accounting morass," sought Friday to explain why he had valued  shares of stock differently on forms he filed with New York City and New York  state.  </P> <P> In 1983, Dinkins listed the value of the stock he held in the Inner City  Broadcasting Co. at more than $1 million in a state background questionnaire he  filed because he was a candidate for a seat on the board of the New York State  Urban Development Corp.  </P> <P> But, in the same year, he valued the stock at $20,000 to $60,000 in a public  financial disclosure form he filed with the city. In January, 1986, he  transferred the stock to his son for a $58,000 promissory note due by 1991,  with interest.  </P> <P> With an accountant at his side, the Manhattan borough president told a packed  news conference that he had placed the $1-million-plus figure on the stock  after consulting with Percy E. Sutton, Inner City Broadcasting's chairman, who  is a longtime friend and political mentor. The company is not publicly traded.  </P> <P> He said that the price he charged his son for the stock was consistent with the  price that Inner City had offered to redeem the securities for -- $94 a share  -- during the same period.  </P> <P> "There is nothing I value more than my integrity," Dinkins said. " . . . I'm  here to answer every question and to make as full a disclosure as I possibly  can."  </P> <P> Dinkins said he had viewed Sutton's valuation of the company with a touch of  skepticism because it was applying for cable television franchises in four or  five cities, and, "if those deals fell apart . . . it might have been less."  </P> <P> But, over the years, Inner City has prospered. Some financial analysts have  placed the value of the company's radio stations at as much as $200 million.  </P> <P> "I did not sell it (the stock) to my son at a below-market price," the  candidate said. "I'm selling it to my son. I'm not out to make a profit. I just  wanted to make a reasonable transfer."  </P> <P> When stock sales are reported, capital gains taxes are paid on the difference  between the purchase price of shares and the market value when the securities  are sold. This computation is relatively simple with publicly traded companies.  But, when a company is not traded in the securities markets, valuations become  more complex. Accountants study such items as earnings and the balance sheet to  fix a sales price.  </P> <P> Dinkins will not have to pay capital gains taxes until his son pays him for the  stock.  </P> <P> Even though he has a substantial lead in the polls over former U.S. Atty.  Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican who is also running as the Liberal Party  candidate in the Nov. 7 election, the question of Dinkins' finances is  sensitive to his campaign.  </P> <P> Two decades ago, Dinkins did not pay his income taxes for four years in a row  -- a fact Giuliani has stressed in commercials. Because of his tax problem,  Dinkins had to step down as the choice of then-Mayor Abraham D. Beame to become  a deputy mayor. Dinkins later paid the taxes, including penalties, and has  repeatedly apologized for his actions.  </P></p>

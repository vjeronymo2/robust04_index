			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (23): Rich pickings for criminals - Kidnapping has become increasingly common in the past year ON A Saturday in June Eduardo Creel, a successful Mexican banker, was opening the gate to his country house, when two young men seized him, took him to a nearby forest, chained him to a tree, and left him without food and water. Mr Creel was eventually released six days after his capture. What was perhaps most unusual about the kidnapping was the small amount of the ransom  -about Dollars 300,000, according to press reports. The kidnappers apparently did not know that Mr Creel, who has just formed a new bank Grupo Financiero del Sureste, could have afforded much more. Kidnappings such as Mr Creel's have become increasingly common in Mexico in the past year, as criminals have found it perhaps the easiest and quickest way to make money fast. Epoca magazine cites an official report which estimates at least 88 other Mexicans were kidnapped in the first seven months this year for a total ransom of about Dollars 90m. This is almost nine times more than the amount stolen in bank robberies last year. In September alone, El Norte newspaper reported that Daniel Wong, a businessmen from Tijuana, paid Dollars 700,000 for his release; Vicente Robles Villa, a fruit farmer from Chihuahua, paid Dollars 400,000; Rodolfo Gamboa, son of a prominent businessmen in Duranago, paid Dollars 600,000. It is unclear whether two other businessmen kidnapped in September, Jorge Morales from Cuernavaca, and Andres Castana have been freed. The spate of kidnappings has started to worry Mexico's rich, who are among the least security-conscious of Latin America's wealthy people. Now, however, increasing numbers are beginning to hire bodyguards or take other preventive measures. Even foreign businessmen, who up to now appear to have been safe, are taking precautionary steps, according to Grupo Fairfax de Mexico, the leading international security firm in Mexico. 'This year more than ever before people are starting to wake up,' says Michael Hershman, president of Fairfax de Mexico. 'At the beginning, the Mexican attitude was very macho. While it has not completely changed, we have noticed people feeling vulnerable.' Fairfax says its personal security business in Mexico has more than doubled in the past 18 months. The problem is at its worse in rural states away from Mexico City, where lawlessness and disparities in wealth have long made kidnapping a highly attractive business. A long report in the El Norte newspaper cited some 183 kidnappings in the rural state of Michoacan alone last year, of which some could have been drug or politically related. Kidnapping has proven so lucrative mainly because of the low risk of being caught, a result of police inefficiency and corruption. 'Once the criminals are aware that you pay and that there is no follow-up organisation, then the kidnappers are going to have a field day,' says Mr Hershman. Under Mexican law, families do not have to inform the police of the intention to pay a ransom, and such is the low esteem in which the Mexican police is held, many do not tell. The effect is that unlike in say the US, when the FBI is called in automatically in the event of a kidnapping, in Mexico there is often little police follow-up, or investigation. Police or former policemen are also believed to have been involved in many kidnappings, according to a government official. The government attributes this in part to its anti-corruption drive, that has led to hundreds of senior policemen being fired. The rejected police have apparently used their contacts, access to arms and intelligence, to protect or lead groups of kidnappers. Occasionally policemen have been arrested for kidnapping. Four policemen have been detained for kidnapping Juan Cuevas Calderon, a car dealer, on February 2. The policemen are alleged to have arrested the car dealer on trumped up charges, but to have promised to release him if he paid about Dollars 200,000. The car dealer reportedly finally gave them about Dollars 8,000, a car and a van. When free the car dealer reported them to higher authorities, who then pressed charges. Recently, there has been speculation that Mexican kidnappers have joined forces with international groups, such as Central American guerrillas or Basque terrorists. Two months ago a list of 150 rich Mexicans thought worthy of kidnapping was found in Nicaragua beside an arms stash, believed to have been left by a faction of the FMLN guerrilla group of El Salvador. The list, published by the Nicaraguan newspaper Barricada, included several Mexican billionaires such as Mr Emilio Azcarraga, the owner of Televisa, and Mr Carlos Slim, the head of Telefonos de Mexico. The Mexican government took it seriously and sent an official to Nicaragua to discuss it with the interior ministry, according to Epoca. There have been further rumours that the Basque terrorist organisation ETA was behind the kidnapping of some rich Mexicans. While a government official says there is no evidence of this, the international reach of some Mexican kidnappers is impressive. Two years ago Juan Gutierrez Cortina, the son of the owner of the private construction company Gutsa, was kidnapped, and his brothers were sent to Spain to receive instructions from the kidnappers, and then to Brazil to make the Dollars 15m payment. Luckily for the family finances, Mr Guttierez Cortina escaped just before the ransom was paid.</p>

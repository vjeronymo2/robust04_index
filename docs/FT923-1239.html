			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Anatomy of the UK defeat The outcome of the battle for the French franc will shed light on the humiliating British departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. It will, for instance, suggest whether the main fault lines were in the mechanism or in the people operating it. If the franc is upheld at its previously established parity against the D-Mark, it will be a sign that the 'hard ERM' has some durability. If the ERM continues to exist, but with a lower parity for the franc, it will show that the hopes of a hard ERM were premature and that the mechanism is best operated as a system of fixed but adjustable bands. Suppose on the other hand that France, Germany and their smaller neighbours react as Karl Otto Pohl has advocated, by establishing a currency union 'not in 1997 or 1999 but in the near future'. Then the moral is that the ERM has been a highly useful transitional system, but no more. Only if the ERM collapses with nothing in its place will the Euro-sceptics be able to say that it was the system rather than the people operating it that had been flawed. Even then it was of great help in reducing British inflation. As far as the UK is concerned, I had always told my friends that I would be left arguing for the ERM policy after the government had abandoned it - as with every other policy I had ever supported. Then I made the fatal error on July 24 of writing, on the basis of speeches such as the one cited here, that the ERM policy would not be changed while John Major and Norman Lamont remained at their present posts. I do not doubt the chancellor's sincerity in delivering this and similar speeches. After all these years I did not allow sufficiently for politicians using words differently from the way other people use them. What did subsequently enrage me was Norman Lamont's treatment of defeat as if it were a victory and the new spring in his step as he beat a tin patriotic drum announcing a 'British policy in British interests'. How did we get here? By Wednesday, September 16, it was clear to the inner cabinet that the 2 point increase in base rates to 12 per cent, belatedly introduced in mid-morning, had not stemmed the torrent of speculation against sterling. The 15 per cent rate later in the day was just a panic reflex and caused not a flicker of market interest. The inner cabinet that morning was presented with three options: A huge increase in overnight rates on the Swedish model (but not alas of Swedish dimensions) to deter speculators before the French referendum the following Sunday. A temporary suspension of ERM membership until after the French referendum. This was the course followed by Italy which still talks of the earliest possible return. Indefinite withdrawal from the ERM. The third course was chosen after a sum equivalent to more than half the UK's Pounds 20bn of reserves had been vainly expended. Not altogether with hindsight, I would have preferred a combination of the first two, much earlier on. Why was the first course not taken? Partly because the Bank of England could not guarantee that it would succeed. And partly because the increase would have spilled over for a time into shock horror base rates and mortgage rates. The reasons for rejecting the second course are not so convincing. A re-entry would have had to be at a lower parity; but at least the UK would still have been in the ERM. It took France eight years after joining as a founder-member in 1979 before it could set its face against parity changes. The vital background was the official view that UK interest rates were too high on domestic grounds - 'we were overachieving in the battle against inflation' was the unfortunate phrase used by the British in Washington. There was, therefore, no stomach for rejoining at a new parity with perhaps weakened credibility and interest rates still related to the German ones. But how had events come to such a pass? The official explanation is that the force of the speculative gale was totally unexpected and unprecedented. I have always heard this said and never fail to be astonished. Whenever I have been asked about the likely size of the next sterling crisis, under many different currency regimes, I have always said: 'Think of the worst number you can and multiply by 100.' Another excuse was that this was the first time that speculators were presented with a single day well in advance - that of the French referendum  -on which to expect parity changes. This cuts both ways. Previous sterling crises have blown up unexpectedly after events such as a Middle Eastern war or a British strike. This time, the government had months in which to prepare. A further explanation is that the pound might have been held had not the Bundesbank president, Helmut Schlesinger, given the Handelsblatt an interview on September 15 calling for a wider realignment than just the lira. In fact, the Bundesbank was pushing for an ERM realignment well before Britain joined in October 1990. After that, everyone from the president down to the humblest staff economist made it clear he thought that the UK had entered at the wrong time and at the wrong parity rate. While Bundesbank pressure for a franc realignment gradually waned, disbelief in sterling's parity increased. I am told that these sentiments were not expressed face to face to the chancellor or the governors of the Bank of England. But that is no excuse for their not taking on board what was common knowledge. I could not take a holiday anywhere in central Europe without hearing the sterling parity being attacked by the time we came to the coffee and schnapps. I did not pretend to agree. But the Bundesbank economists have straightforward, unreconstructed mainstream views. They judge the sterling parity by the British trade figures and the fact that even in recession Britain's headline inflation is still slightly higher than Germany's. There was little chance of the Bundesbank's view being overthrown when it was shared by the vast majority of British commentators, from professors of econometrics to teenage dealers. It cannot be said that the one or two anti-devaluation studies that the Treasury did us a favour in publishing and at which the Bank merely darkly hinted, were of the same calibre as the better pro-devaluation analyses. Of course it was not statistics or articles which undermined the market's belief in sterling, but the view - perfectly justified in the event - that ministers were bluffing and would not be prepared to do whatever necessary to defend sterling in the face of a severe and prolonged recession. I should have noticed the fatal signs when base rates were not raised in July when the ERM divergence indicator for sterling passed minus 75 per cent, pointing to a presumption in favour of a base rate increase, as well as of pro-sterling intervention by others. The case for a system with the D-Mark as an anchor was immensely strong throughout the 1980s up to German reunification - which is just when Lady Thatcher was able to veto British membership. I realised that something would have to give last December when the Bundesbank raised interest rates, while outside the Community they were being cut to counter recession. But I did not think aloud because it was overwhelmingly important for Britain to remain in the ERM at the entry parity as long as possible if there was to be a chance of breaking inflationary psychology, and improving economic prospects in the 1990s. My hope was that if only we could get past the French referendum, eventually German interest rates would start to fall, as recessionary forces in Germany gathered momentum. I had other ideas in reserve. These are now pipe dreams. But so are the ideas of the motley coalition of right-wing Tory backbenchers and left-wing commentators who believe that there is something called 'going for growth' which the government can achieve by the old American slogan of 'Cheap money and plenty of it'. In one way or another - I hope not too painfully - the exchange rate will regain its place at the centre of macroeconomic policy.</p>

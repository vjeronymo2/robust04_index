			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Cod quota cuts hit Iceland Iceland is facing another difficult year in 1994 due to sharp cuts in cod quotas and can expect only a modest recovery next year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. An OECD report says the economy will decline by 1.2 per cent this year, after growing by a better-than-expected 0.8 per cent last year. The report says Iceland's fishing industry, which accounts for 75 per cent of exports, is going through a difficult phase because of past overfishing and unfavourable environmental conditions. The total allowable cod catch has been cut by 20 per cent in the year to September 1994. The organisation says fisheries management is Iceland's key policy challenge but believes further reform of agriculture is also required. Payments to the sector should be gradually reduced.</p>

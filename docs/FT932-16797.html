			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Marlboro's smoke alarm The battle for the US cigarette market launched by Philip Morris yesterday promises to leave all contenders gasping. Since the US company is prepared to sacrifice 40 per cent of its operating profit from US tobacco, there is little doubt that it means business. It will have few resources left for large acquisitions in the European food industry. But Cadbury Schweppes' relief is BAT Industries' distress. Unlike Rothmans, the other tobacco company in the FT-SE, BAT has a large US cigarette business. BAT generated some Pounds 360m in operating profit from the domestic US tobacco market last year. A drop in the same proportion as that anticipated by Philip Morris would knock Pounds 145m or 8 per cent off group operating income. The shock is unlikely to be as bad as that. By cutting the price of Marlboro, Philip Morris is sacrificing a high margin brand. BAT's premium brands like Kool, which account for about 40 per cent of its sales but a considerably higher proportion of its profits, should escape relatively lightly. Still, the heat will burn a significant hole in BAT's earnings: enough to change the arithmetic on its enhanced scrip dividend even if there is no short-term threat to dividend growth. After yesterday's 7 per cent fall in its price, BAT will have to issue more shares - on which it will be making a smaller return - to cover the scrip payment. Happily, BAT only needs a 9.5 per cent return to prevent the exercise being dilutive over the medium term, and it has been making over 20 per cent recently. The exercise still offers value which marginal cases such as Ladbroke cannot hope to match.</p>

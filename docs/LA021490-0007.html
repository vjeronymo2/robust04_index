			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY IS ASKED TO CHIP IN ON PARAMEDICS' WAGES  </P> <P> City officials will review the labor contract negotiated by Hartson Medical  Services and the paramedics' union before deciding on any subsidy for the  company to meet employee wage demands contained in the proposal, said Deputy  City Manager Maureen Stapleton.  </P> <P> The final agreement was reached Tuesday by Hartson and the Service Employees  International Union, Local 102, which represents about 160 San Diego  paramedics. Both sides declined to disclose the size of the rate increase  negotiated for paramedics, and Stapleton said the city still does not know how  much Hartson will ask for in extra money.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Glen Roberts, Hartson's chief executive officer, briefed City  Manager John Lockwood on the contract but "did not indicate what the amount  will be," said Stapleton.  </P> <P> "Hartson will provide specifics to the city by the end of the week. At this  point, we're obligated to analyze the proposed wage increase and its potential  impact and present the matter to the City Council," said Stapleton.  </P> <P> Eliseo Medina, president of Local 102, said the new contract "goes a long way  to establishing parity" for Hartson paramedics. During the drawn-out  negotiations, which began in April, the union said that Hartson paramedics earn  24% less than other county paramedics. Hartson paramedics earn $6.50 to $9.55  an hour.  </P> <P> Emergency medical technicians at Hartson start at $5 an hour, and Medina said  the new contract will make them the highest-paid in the county. Paramedics and  EMTs are expected to vote on the contract next week, Medina said.  </P> <P> However, Medina said a settlement is "contingent on receiving the pay increases  we agreed on." If the City Council balks at paying for the increases, the union  will have to decide on its next move, he added.  </P> <P> The union is already putting pressure on the city to approve and fund the pay  raises by announcing that some paramedics may go to work for other local  agencies if the City Council does not move on the increases by the end of the  month. Medina said the other agencies will begin hiring paramedics in March.  </P> <P> Roberts said he is aware that other agencies will begin hiring paramedics next  month and hopes that the city will move quickly on the contract.  </P> <P> Stapleton promised quick action by the city once Hartson indicates how much  money the company needs.  </P> <P> "The city is committed, as soon as we receive details of the proposal, to move  as quickly as possible and get it through the council," Stapleton said.  </P> <P> Roberts said the additional revenue could come from a straight subsidy from the  city or by the city allowing the company to increase its rates. Hartson has a  $6.8-million contract with the city that expires in June, 1991. Under terms of  the contract, the city allows the company to charge a patient no more than $281  a call.  </P> <P> "We'll try to pass the expense of doing business to the people to whom we  provide the service. . . . It'll have to be either some increase in fees or  increase in subsidy. We know that subsidies are very hard to come by these  days. We always go back to the cities we work for and ask to increase our  rates," Roberts said.  </P></p>

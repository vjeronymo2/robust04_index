			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Lloyd's 1989 losses may reach Pounds 1.65bn LOSSES at the Lloyd's of London insurance market for 1989 could reach almost Pounds 1.65bn according to figures circulated yesterday by the Association of Lloyd's Members. The association represents more than 9,000 Names, the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Financial Intelligence &amp; Research, a consultant to the association, has offered best and worst-case scenarios for 1989 results based on provisional estimates supplied by Lloyd's agents. The best-case scenario would be a loss of Pounds 1.06bn. But the association warned in a newsletter that the figures may not include estimates for asbestosis and pollution reserves. Other factors including US tax charges may make a significant difference to the 1989 result, which Lloyd's will report in June. Meanwhile, Names on Gooda Walker syndicates, which face losses of more than Pounds 200m for 1989, have warned of new legal action if negotiations designed to prevent payment of cash calls are unsuccessful. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said his committee had been involved in 'intense discussion' over the past 10 days with GW Run Off, which has managed the Gooda Walker syndicates since the agency went into liquidation last year. He said GW Run Off had also been in contact with Lloyd's over the same issue. The Names will seek injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down deposits held with their agents, irrespective of the result of a separate legal action by more than 820 Names which was postponed yesterday until Monday in the Commercial Court. Insurance companies are to be offered rent reductions to continue support for the London Underwriting Centre, an insurance company exchange. Its opening was delayed by a fire last August. Market Building, a joint venture backed by 24 leading European and US insurers, hopes that the exchange can eventually rival Lloyd's in size and sophistication. But August's fire was a big setback to Market Building, which owns a 25-year lease on the property at Minster Court in the City of London. Damage of Pounds 125m was insured, but the fire has delayed opening of the centre until October next year and has freed more than 70 would-be tenants from their earlier commitments.</p>

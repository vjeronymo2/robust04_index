			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Carlton sets sights on the continent Carlton Communications, the television and television services company which yesterday announced full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 190m, is planning to increase its presence in continental Europe. Mr Michael Green, the Carlton chairman and chief executive, is intent on pushing into Europe, which accounts for Pounds 119m turnover of a Pounds 1.4bn total. Carlton's operating profit in Europe fell year-on-year from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 3.8m largely because of the losses of the French division of Pickwick, Carlton's video publisher and distributor. The French business has now been sold. Carlton's 51 per cent increase in pre-tax profit for the 12 months to September was lifted by an eight-month contribution from Central, the Midlands ITV company acquired at the turn of the year. Central contributed Pounds 219m to turnover and Pounds 47m to pre-interest operating profits. Excluding Central, pre-tax growth was 22 per cent with all four Carlton divisions, broadcast television, video &amp; audio production and distribution, film &amp; television services and video &amp; sound products increasing sales and profits. Earnings per share rose by 28 per cent to 54p. The final net dividend was 12.5p, bringing the total for the year to 20.65p an increase of 10 per cent. Exports from the UK rose from Pounds 161m in 1993 to Pounds 187m this year. Mr Green yesterday renewed his appeal for the replacement of existing cross-media ownership restrictions, 'with the normal machinery of competition law'. The integrated Carlton and Central Television companies cover 35 per cent of the UK population and account for more than 30 per cent of ITV's advertising revenue. Shares in Carlton, which is expected to produce at least Pounds 240m in pre-tax profit in the current year, rose 16p yesterday to close at 868p. Mr Green promised to build on Carlton's export performance, 'by using our programme libraries and our substantial investment in original productions to increase our sales of television programmes into overseas markets'.

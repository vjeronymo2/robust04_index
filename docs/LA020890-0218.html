			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TACO BELL CUTS 3 DIVISIONS IN REORGANIZATION  </P> <P> Taco Bell has eliminated three divisional posts as part of a restructuring at  the Mexican-style fast-food chain.  </P> <P> The three vice presidents who headed Taco Bell's western, eastern and southern  divisions have been reassigned within the chain's Irvine headquarters or within  Pepsico Inc., which is Taco Bell's parent, said company spokesman Elliot Bloom.  </P> <P> As part of the reorganization, Taco Bell eliminated the three divisions and,  instead, has 12 zones reporting directly to corporate headquarters.  </P> <P> The restructuring will result in "less than 25 layoffs," Bloom said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Taco Bell reported the restructuring this week along with fourth-quarter  earnings.  </P> <P> The chain's operating income rose 12%, to $28.6 million, despite a $5.5-million  one-time charge for costs related to the reorganization. Without the one-time  charge, Taco Bell's operating income in the fourth quarter climbed 33%.  </P> <P> Taco Bell's fourth-quarter sales climbed 18%, to $483.2 million. MARY ANN  GALANTE  </P></p>

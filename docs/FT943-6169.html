			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Late payment Are late payments such a problem for European companies as to threaten the economic recovery now under way? The European Commission thinks so. It has just produced draft recommendations to EU governments that companies which pay bills late should suffer statutory penalties. The practice, it says, jeopardises cross-border trade and the single market. According to the Commission, the average time between delivery of goods or services and payment has steadily lengthened to an EU average of 66 days last year. The Commission blames recession for encouraging the practice, but says that companies are not relinquishing the habit during recovery. Its main proposal is that companies should have a statutory right to interest at commercial rates on the overdue payment. It also wants court procedures for seeking redress to be simplified. The recommendations are not legally binding and do not require members' approval, but may be followed by a directive if the next two years bring no results. The plans have provoked opposition, notably from the UK, which has one of the worst records on late payment, but have also been welcomed by small businesses which suffer particularly from unexpected shortfalls in cashflow. But it is not clear that the proposals will achieve the desired effect. Many EU member countries already give companies a statutory right to interest on late payments. Although these countries have better payment records than the UK, delays are still considerable, and appear to have lengthened recently. Moreover, companies in these countries typically agree longer credit periods, and the Commission plan could encourage that to become widespread. Nor is it clear that action at EU level is warranted: the Commission has not convincingly established its starting point that the practice threatens cross-border trade. What is needed instead is a range of less drastic measures by member countries and by companies themselves. Clearer contracts, better ways of checking the creditworthiness of customers, and easier access to annual accounts of foreign companies would all help companies reduce credit risk. Europe-wide legislation, however, is not the answer.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Doubts over EC steel aid proposal EUROPEAN steelmakers yesterday gave a cautious welcome to Commission plans to support restructuring of the industry. However, Commission and national officials voiced doubts about the sums of EC money available to help steel producers, which are suffering from the economic downturn, competition from cheap non-EC imports and over-capacity. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, said on Wednesday that up to Ecu900m (Pounds 731m) could be available to the industry over three years, half from Community funds and half from member states. But Commission officials pointed out yesterday that only Ecu240m of the Brussels plan was new money, and it was unclear whether EC members would agree to match that funding. 'If the finance ministers are not ready to do anything our contribution will obviously go down too,' said one Commission official. Eurofer, the European steel industry federation, called on the governments of member states 'to respect their responsibilities ..by making available at least the same amount' as the Commission. Under coal and steel treaty rules, funding by the Commission for national industries depends on equal or greater funding from the member state concerned. EC industry ministers will discuss the plan on Tuesday, but they will not be required to take a formal decision. Other elements of the plan include strengthening protection against cheap non-EC imports and examining where capacity cuts have to be made. British Steel said the Brussels plan was a step in the right direction. It would be discussing with the UK government and the Commission how to ensure that the plan achieved the necessary restructuring and was adequate to deal with East European imports. A major continental steel company said it was clear that the Commission was now 'more conscious' of the steel industry's problems, and recognised that the influence of eastern European imports could damage the market. But steel producers are still anxiously awaiting the result of Tuesday's EC industry ministers meeting, which will discuss a controversial plan by Spain's state steel industry to rebuild a steel mill at Sestoa in northern Spain.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 13 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is closely watching  moves within the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] concerning the  selection of a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa. This is because LDP President Yohei Kono has declared  his candidacy for the premiership while some LDP members are  prepared to leave the party.    Junior LDP members who advocate reform of the electoral  system are "expected to leave the LDP." According to a senior  official of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], they  are divided into two groups--"one backing Shinseito and the  other supporting Sakigake [Harbinger]." Shinseito feels that if  it can lure them into the ruling coalition, this will serve as a  restraining influence against Sakigake, which has hinted leaving  the cabinet. Shinseito is also gradually leaning to the idea  that it is necessary for the ruling parties to select the new  prime minister while keeping the current ruling coalition  framework in tact. However, because it is thought the LDP may  split into three groups--one supporting Kono, one backing former  LDP Vice President and Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, and the  other advocating reform of the electoral system--Shinseito is  carefully watching moves within the LDP.    Appearing on a Fuji TV program on 12 April, Shinseito Acting  Chief Secretary Kozo Watanabe said: "The ruling parties worked  together to compile the budget. While maintaining a cooperative  framework, we should choose an appropriate person." He added:  "We will not refuse to accept those who wish to join us."  Thus, Watanabe expressed the hope that the ruling coalition  would maintain the current framework and invite LDP members to  join the coalition.    As its basic strategy, Shinseito aims for the splintering of  the LDP. Thus, it will be desirable for the party if the LDP is  thrown into confusion as a result of strife between Kono and  Watanabe over the candidacy for the premiership, as well as the  breakaway of a pro-electoral reform group. Senior Shinseito  officials have continuously hinted the party may form an  alliance with the LDP's Watanabe. Behind this move lies  Shinseito's expectation that the alliance will work as an  effective "trump card" to oust leftwing members of the SDPJ from  the ruling coalition. SDPJ left-wingers are feared as a  stumbling block to future political operations.    According to a senior Shinseito official, many Shinseito  members still believe that even if Watanabe leaves the LDP,  "only 30 or so LDP members will follow him, and this is not  enough." A Shinseito Diet member who works as liaison between  Watanabe and Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa said on 12  April that it was unlikely Watanabe would leave the LDP to form  a large political party which can replace the SDPJ in the ruling  coalition.    Nevertheless, if conditions are created under which it is  possible to change the framework of the ruling coalition, this  will make it easier for SDPJ members to agree to maintain the  current framework. If the ruling coalition decides to choose  the new prime minister under the current framework, Shinseito  co-leader Tsutomu Hata (deputy prime minister and foreign  minister) will be the most likely candidate because of his  career. It seems Shinseito has intentionally hinted at forming  an alliance with Watanabe to prepare for full-scale negotiations  within the ruling coalition over the selection of a candidate.</p>

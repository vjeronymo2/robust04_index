			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Georges Timmerman: "Turkey: `Limited Amounts?'"] </F>   [Text] Brussels 29 Dec -- A year ago, in December 1992, VU  [People's Union] MP [Member of Parliament] Paul Van Grembergen  asked Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain [PS: French-speaking  wing of Socialist Party] to immediately stop all arms deliveries  to Turkey. An Amnesty International report had once again shown  that human rights were still not being respected in Turkey. The  report spoke of mass executions, torture, and attacks on the  Kurdish population.    "Turkey is not a traditional purchaser of arms from  Belgium,"  Urbain answered soothingly. "In so far as licences were still  granted for the delivery of arms, ammunition, and military  equipment to Turkey, it concerns very limited amounts." Since  Turkey was not on the embargo list, and no EC country was  prepared to announce an embargo, at that time Urbain regarded it  as "not opportune to suspend or withdraw the current export  licences, which as mentioned are very modest." Strictly  speaking, Urbain's reasoning is correct. Earlier that year the  EC had decided to not announce an arms embargo against Turkey.  In exchange the Turkish government promised to henceforth  respect human rights.    The documents now in the possession of DE MORGEN prove that  minister Urbain may have been right regarding the number of new  arms export licences. But in 1991 and 1992 Turkey was a big  customer of the Belgian arms manufacturers. The quantities  supplied at that time can scarcely be described as "limited" and  "modest." On 20 May 1991 five army transport planes left  Zaventem airport for Turkey carrying a consignment of military  vehicles and arms of Belgian origin. In total they weighed 97  tonnes. Two days later five army transport planes again left  with a similar destination and a load weighing 118 tonnes.  Another two days later saw the departure of five army planes  carrying a total of 115 tonnes of military vehicles and arms; on  28 May five of the same aircraft again departed with a total of  115 tonnes.    (On 20 May 1991, on the very first day of this series of  deliveries, Foreign Affairs Ministers Claes was minimizing arms  exports to Turkey: "This year only one export licence was  granted for a batch of ammunition worth 12 million Belgian  francs [BFr]," Claes said. "As for the future, I want to point  out that companies do not always inform my department about  projects which are still under negotiation, so that I cannot  give any accurate information about possible orders which are  still in the pipeline.")    This overview does not take into account smaller shipments  which were transported by Sabena or Turkish Airlines: 238 kg of  pistols (on 9 February 1991), 154 kg of arms (1 May 1991), 17 kg  of pistols (3 July 1991), 335 kg of arms (14 December 1991), 501  kg of arms (12 February 1992), 266 kg of pistols (14 March  1992), 2,733 kg of ammunition (25 April 1992), 246 kg of arms (1  August 1992), 207 kg of arms (19 September 1992), 120 kg of arms  (3 October 1992), 154 kg of arms (21 October 1992), 982 kg of  arms (24 October 1992) and 907 kg of machine guns (11 November  1992).    In addition there was a load of 265 cases of rifle grenades  (around 6 tonnes) produced by Mecar [subsidiary of Allied  Research Associates] which left Antwerp by ship for Turkey on 29  January 1991. Finally a ship left Zeebrugge for Turkey on 16  February 1991 loaded with 322 tonnes of Belgian-made  projectiles. This means that in 1991-92 Turkey bought nearly  800 tonnes of arms in our country.</p>

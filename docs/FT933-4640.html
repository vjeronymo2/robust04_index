			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / People: Likierman to advise Treasury on accountancy Andrew Likierman has been appointed as chief accountancy adviser to the Treasury and head of the government accountancy service. Likierman, 49, professor of accounting and financial control at the London Business School, will be seconded initially for three years, taking up his post on December 1. His predecessor, Sir Alan Hardcastle, retires at the end of this month. The job, which was advertised at Pounds 90,000-Pounds 120,000 a year, involves advising the government on accounting policy, liaising with professional bodies, overseeing financial management initiatives and covers responsibility for co-ordinating accountants employed by the Civil Service. The appointment comes at a time when there is considerable change in accounting and auditing standards, regulation of auditors, restructuring of accounting in the public sector and contracting out of services to private enterprise. Likierman is a member of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance and of the Financial Reporting Council. He was president of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants in 1991-92. His research has emphasised the link between economics, accounting and financial management in public expenditure. He has examined performance measurement, spoken in favour of cautious moves towards private-sector style accounting within the public sector and on the need to raise the profile and influence of accountants within government. After graduating in PPE from Balliol College, Oxford, Likierman trained as a management accountant with Tootal in Manchester. He served as a member of the Cabinet Office Central Policy Review Staff, was adviser to several House of Commons select committees, a council member of two Next Steps agencies, and a member of the Audit Commission. He has served on several government inquiries including one on auditors' liability.</p>

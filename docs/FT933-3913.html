			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / German banker rejects state banks privatisation GERMANY'S leading public sector banker has condemned suggestions that public sector banks should be privatised as part of the German government's attempts to reduce the role of the state in German economic life. Speaking in Frankfurt on Wednesday night, Mr Friedel Neuber, chief executive of the Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB), the biggest of the Landesbanken which act as house banks to Germany's regional governments, said that any privatisation would endanger the stability and competitiveness of the German banking industry. He added that suggestions that privatisation of the banking sector could raise DM100bn (Dollars 61.7bn) for central and regional government were incomprehensible: the figure would be considerably lower, and in any case the one-off benefit to the state from the proceeds would be offset by the long-term damage to the fabric of society and the economy. The German banking system is divided into three segments - privately-owned commercial banks, state sector banks and co-operative banks. Mr Otto Lambsdorff, economics spokesman for the Free Democrats party, has been prominent among those calling for state sector banks to be sold off as part of the government's commitment to privatisation, outlined last week in a paper produced by the Economics Ministry. Although the Landesbanken fulfil duties on behalf of the state governments which own them, they are free to enter into mainstream commercial lending business as well. A bank such as WestLB, house bank to the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, has accumulated extensive industrial holdings and has played an aggressive role in big business. It played a key part in Krupp's takeover of rival steelmaker Hoesch last year and it has also built up a large business in the travel sector, most recently acquiring the Thomas Cook travel group. WestLB's activities have drawn sharp criticism from the private banking sector which complains that the bank is unfairly subsidised by its state sector owners. They also complain that the bank's activities fit oddly with the its status as house bank to the Social Democrat-ruled state of North-Rhine Westphalia. One result of the three-tier system is that Germany is served by well in excess of 4,000 credit institutions, which has led to suggestions that the country is 'over-banked' and that it is likely to be the 'steel industry of the 1990s' as the banks face the need for drastic restructuring. However the banking sector is prospering despite the severity of the recession.</p>

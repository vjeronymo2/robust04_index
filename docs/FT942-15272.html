			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (7): Hotel owners feel the pinch - Patrick Blum reports on the tourist industry One in every 20 foreign trips taken anywhere in the world leads to Austria, according to official tourism statistics. But while this testifies to the strength of Austria's tourism industry, the past two years have not been good years for hotel owners and tour operators. The recession in Germany, devaluations in Britain and Italy, and a decline in the number of travellers from the US, combined to depress foreign currency revenues to Sch156.2bn last year, down from the record Sch161.2bn in 1991. Arrivals and overnight stays were down in every province except Styria, in spite of considerable investment and marketing efforts. Officials hope that with Europe now gradually pulling out of recession, this year will bring better results, thereby helping improve declining profit margins. Any improvement would also help accelerate recovery for the national economy, which in turn would encourage more Austrians to spend time away from home and boost domestic tourism. A few statistics give an indication of the industry's economic and social importance. Revenues from tourism account for about 8 per cent of gross domestic product, rising to 15 per cent of GDP if the leisure industries are included. About 164,000 workers are employed directly in restaurants and hotels; another 100,000 are self-employed and, if workers in related activities including in boutiques, travel agencies, and leisure facilities, are included, the number of people employed directly and indirectly in the industry swells to about 400,000 - representing about 13 per cent of the total workforce. The net Sch61bn foreign revenue income from tourism - after deduction from what Austrians spend abroad - covers almost 62 per cent of the country's deficit in traded goods. Official policy is to encourage moves up-market by offering better accommodation and service, and catering for special interests or 'hobby tourism'. This includes special programmes for tennis, water sports or golf and for those interested in fishing, riding, or who want to improve their health and looks. There is an 'Allegro Austria' programme dedicated to music lovers, and there are special programmes for families with small children. 'These programmes have been very successful,' says Mr Michael Raffling, head of the hotels and restaurants section in the Austrian Economic Chamber. To take advantage of Austria's plans to join the European Union next year, the government recently announced that it would invest Sch3m-Sch4m in a special campaign throughout Europe on the theme of 'Come and see the new member'. Meanwhile, the number of high standard hotels of five and four stars has risen steadily since the early 1980s from just over 100,000 in 1981 to 163,664 last year. The number of two stars and single-star hotels has declined by about 100,000 to 278,916 in the same period. The number of middle range, three-star hotels has risen by about 50,000 to 240,146. Most tourists come from western Europe with visitors from Germany accounting for 67 per cent of overnight stays, followed by visitors from the Netherlands with about 8.7 per cent; Britain with 3.8 per cent; Switzerland, the Benelux countries, and Italy whose share of overnight stays is down by more than 22 per cent. There has been a steady flow of visitors from the former communist states of central and eastern Europe, raising the occupancy rates for cheaper accommodation. Spending by east Europeans has grown since the early days immediately following the collapse of communism when many visitors came on one-day coach trips to look at the city and spend practically nothing. The opening up of eastern Europe has brought some competition for Vienna from Prague and Budapest, but generally it has had positive effects, as more people have wanted to travel in the region. Many visitors want to combine a trip to the three cities. Agents are increasingly offering 'magic triangle' programmes, especially to visitors from the US. Outside the main cities, competition from the former Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other east European countries is limited by the range and quality of what they can offer, and while Austria is more expensive, it offers better service and infrastructure and a wider choice of activities in a cleaner environment. Decades of investment and training were needed to make Austria's tourism industry one of the world's most successful, but it still faces a number of problems. Efforts to stagger domestic holidays have had little success so there is still overcrowding at popular spots, particularly in the winter. The costs of environmental protection for a wide range of activities - from waste disposal to ski runs - are rising rapidly. Community services and labour costs are also rising fast. 'The introduction of the five-day week in 1992 has noticeably increased costs,' Mr Raffling says. Environmental concerns can also make promotion more difficult. One idea was to have summer festivals in all the provinces, but it has met strong opposition from environment groups. However, Mr Raffling says there is also a positive side which can be developed to Austria's advantage. 'On one hand it creates a lot of problems, but guests are also becoming more and more environment conscious, and we are well placed to meet that demand.'</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Fighting erupts at Luanda airport FIGHTING erupted yesterday between government forces and former Unita rebels near Luanda's international airport leaving more than a dozen dead, including three Portuguese nationals, AP reports from Luanda. The state news agency, Angop, said rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns were used in the hour-long clash between Unita soldiers and the police garrison at the airport. Angop reported at least 13 dead. Meanwhile heavy civilian and military casualties were reported in the central city of Huambo, although a senior government army officer later said fighting had halted in the city and the two sides had opened negotiations mediated by United Nations monitors. The latest clashes have intensified fears of a new outbreak of Angola's 16-year civil war that ended with peace accords last year between Unita and the once-Marxist government. Tension has mounted since Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, rejected the results of the country's first multi-party elections held on September 29-30. As results showed Unita losing to the governing MPLA party, Mr Savimbi threatened to lead his men back into battle. 'The war in Angola has practically already started,' Mr Aldemiro Conceicao, government spokesman, told Portugal's TSF radio on Thursday night. 'It's all on a razor's edge.' The fighting in Huambo appears to have been the worst since the May 1991 peace accords. In the voting for parliament, the MPLA won 53.74 per cent to Unita's 34.1 per cent. But President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos fell less than a point short of the 50 per cent needed for a first-round victory in the presidential race. Mr Savimbi has refused to say whether he will agree to contest a second round.</p>

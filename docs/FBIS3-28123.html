The previous record was  248.39 billion yen in 1980, the officials at the Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said.    Under the mutual aid system, farmers pay premiums to a  governmental agricultural insurance body and in case of disaster  receive insurance money depending on the extent of the damage  suffered.    In 1993, Japan's rice crops were the poorest in the postwar  period, with the rice crop index remaining at 74, meaning  extremely poor. The unseasonably cool, wet summer damaged the  growth of rice plants across the nation.    The officials said the ministry has so far paid the money to  1,366,000 farmers, about half the contracted farmers. Per  capita payments averaged 321,600 yen, they said.    Damage was most severe in Hokkaido, Miyagi and Aomori  Prefectures, they added.    For the payments, the ministry used part of revenue it  gained  from sales of imported rice, the officials said. The government  made a profit by selling imported rice, which is far cheaper  than the sum the government pays domestic producers, at the  government sale price for domestic rice to protect Japanese  farmers.</p>

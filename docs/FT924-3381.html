			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Packer to join Westpac WESTPAC Banking announced yesterday that Mr Kerry Packer and Mr Al Dunlap are to join the Westpac board, Reuter reports from Sydney. Mr Packer and Mr Dunlap are respectively chairman and managing director of Consolidated Press, which recently acquired 8.3 per cent of the capital of troubled Westpac for ADollars 434m (USDollars 301m). Westpac announced last week that it planned to appoint Mr Peter Richie, the chairman of McDonald's Australia, to the board. Mr John Uhrig, Westpac chairman, said: 'These new appointments mean Westpac will have a very strong board as it follows through with its announced recovery programmes.' Westpac said Mr Packer and Mr Dunlap would be formally appointed after completion of the sale of Westpac's Network Ten television subsidiary to CanWest Global Communications of Canada, scheduled for later this month. The appointment of Mr Packer and Mr Dunlap would take the number of board directors to 12 after recent resignations. Former Westpac chairman Sir Eric Neal and four other directors resigned in October, while another director, Westpac Americas general manager Mr Tony Walton, resigned after discovery of a USDollars 115m unexpected tax liability.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (AE) -- Argentina will suggest to the  OAS the creation of an Inter-American Defense Board to provide  military advice to the OAS. Today, Argentine Ambassador to the  OAS Hernan Patino said the board is not meant to be an armed  branch of the OAS, but an advisory body that would be subject to  the political decisions of the OAS. He denied that this  proposal is connected with possible military intervention in  Haiti. "Argentina has always been against any military  intervention that is decided on a unilateral basis," he said.    Patino said the creation of an Inter-American Defense Board  could avoid political embarrassments. He pointed out that the  military interventions that have taken place in Latin America,  like that in Nicaragua to guarantee peace during the elections,  have had no legal basis. The board would serve exclusively for  the discussion of military subjects and never as an intervention  force. For example, one of its functions could be to sweep for  mines placed in countries in conflict.    Tomorrow, the Chilean Government will present to the OAS a  proposal to create a work group to analyze government corruption  and to suggest a code of laws to combat corruption. Chilean  Ambassador to Brazil Heraldo Munoz said the economic development  of the countries of the region is what is mainly responsible for  the expansion of corruption in the continent. "Corruption must  be faced as a phenomenon that goes beyond national borders," he  said.    This work group should analyze the laws against corruption  of  the OAS member countries and should include some of them in a  code of laws that would be approved by the OAS. Argentine  Ambassador to the OAS Hernan Patino said that corruption does  not take place in Latin America only, mentioning recent cases in  Japan, Italy, and Spain.    Tomorrow, Brazil will present a resolution ratifying  Argentina's rights over the Malvinas Islands (or the Falklands,  to the British). Brazil presents the same resolution in favor of  Argentina at all OAS assemblies. "Argentina will always claim,  in a peaceful manner at all international forums, its  sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands," Patino said.</p>

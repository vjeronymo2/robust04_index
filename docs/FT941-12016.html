			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): BMW in the lead as automotive stocks climb A good day for several car stocks took in the Rover/BMW deal, bullishness in France after weekend measures to boost consumption, specific hopes for Fiat in 1994 and a new high in Volvo, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT, excited by interest rate hopes and the BMW/Rover deal, saw the Dax index rise 43.98 to 2,177.45 on the session and threaten 2,200 in the post bourse, closing another 15.15 higher at 2,192.60. In financials, Allianz rose DM72 to DM2,829 on talk of US buying and, in a generally lucrative banking sector, Bavernverein emerged from its rights issue complications with a rise of DM23.50, or 4.5 per cent to DM546. These gains were dwarfed by BMW's DM56.50, or 8.3 per cent rise to DM739.50, with a further climb to DM748 after hours. Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that BMW had paid a relatively keen price for a deal which nearly doubles its car production capacity. Aluminium production cuts led to above-average markups in Degussa, DM16.80 higher at DM488.80, and Thyssen, DM7.40 better at DM261.90. Mr Greven said that the implications of the news had not been thought through and that Viag, with big production capacity in the metal, looked the prime beneficiary; Viag shares rose DM10.50 to DM485.50. PARIS swept through its previous record close as the market took heart from the government's announcement at the weekend of measures to boost the economy. The CAC-40 index closed 21.19 ahead at 2,334.36 as turnover hit FFr6.5bn. Turnover in the market has been consistently high over January - averaging about FFr5bn a day - driven largely by inflows of foreign money. The car sector outperformed the market, helped by proposals outlined by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on Sunday to assist new car sales. Peugeot, up FFr19 or 2 per cent to FFr874, also said that it would issue ADR's in the US. MILAN continued to power ahead, in the lull after recent political storms. The Comit index rose 20.28 or 3.2 per cent to a third consecutive high of 662.11. Turnover swelled to a record L1,420bn: at one stage, screen based trading was halted when the system became overloaded. Fiat surged L242 or 5.3 per cent to L4,843 as the market awaited the annual letter to shareholders from the chairman, Mr Giovanni Agnelli. UBS, an aggressive buyer, forecast that the group's competitive position was set to improve strongly, following the lira devaluation and the introduction of new models. Sip, a recent underperformer, added L362 or 9.1 per cent to L4,353, helped by a government ruling that the winner of the country's second cellular telephone licence would have to use Sip's ground-based network. AMSTERDAM's AEX index closed 8.93 or 2 per cent higher at 438.71. A notable exception to the positive trend was Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, which slipped 80 cents to Fl 23.90 following the resignation of the chairman. While the news was something of a surprise to the market, some analysts commented that in the long term it could benefit the troubled group as it wrestles with a rationalisation programme. Among financials, ING added Fl 2.50 to Fl 90.30 as the insurer improved after a recent period of underperformance. Some of the day's biggest gains were recorded by Elsevier, up Fl 5.80 at Fl 193.80 and Nedlloyd, Fl 4.50 higher at Fl 72.60. Polygram added Fl 2.50 to Fl 81.70 as it announced a new joint venture in the US. ZURICH finished at a fifth consecutive all time high, amid strong demand for Nestle and the banking sector which is expected to report sparkling results in the coming month. The SMI index added 37.7 or 1.2 per cent to 3,178.4. Nestle added SFr21 to SFr1,426 while among the banks, CS Holding rose SFr13 to SFr754. Roche began quietly but the certificates later put on SFr40 to SFr7,140 after news that the US Food and Drug Administration had authorised third phase clinical trials of a new anti-Aids treatment. MADRID hit another new high, the general index putting on 15.97 to 358.31 as it waited for Banesto to resume trading today. STOCKHOLM's domestic and foreign supporters took the Affarsvarlden General index 29.3 or 1.9 per cent higher to a new peak of 1,603.9. Volvo B shares rose SKr13 to SKr695 amid expectations of strong US sales in January. ISTANBUL rose by more than 8 per cent as investors were encouraged by reports that the capital markets board was to allow mutual funds, which keep at least 25 per cent of their portfolio in stocks, to trade on the stock exchange. The composite index closed up 1,542.86 at 20,104.84 while turnover dipped to TL1,640bn after Friday's TL2,150bn.

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE EDGE WITH HUMBERTO LUNA  </P> <P> Humberto Luna stands grinning beneath a billboard bearing his likeness at the  spot where, according to Hollywood lore, dreams come true -- Hollywood and  Vine.  </P> <P> The symbolism is not missed. Luna has seen his fondest dream come true -- and  then some.  </P> <P> "I never thought it would be like this," Luna said. "I wanted to live well and  do something on radio. I still don't believe that because of radio I'm doing so  much and so many people know me. I still feel it's a dream."  </P> <P> If so, it's an awfully sweet one.  </P> <P> The 41-year-old morning deejay is the highest-rated Spanish-language radio  personality in Southern California, a superstar of Spanish-language media and,  accordingly, its highest-paid performer. Luna recently negotiated a $1-million  annual salary and a five-year contract for his goofy morning-drive antics on  KTNQ-AM "Super 10-Q" (1020).  </P> <P> "This makes him clearly the highest-paid Spanish radio personality in the  country and puts him right up there with the top-flight English-language disc  jockeys," said Jim Blancarte, the lawyer who helped negotiate Luna's lucrative  deal. "I thought he was worth twice as much. He continues to be on the cutting  edge of Spanish-language radio."  </P> <P> The cutting edge of Spanish-language radio sounds a lot like English-language  radio.  </P> <P> Luna spends each morning from 6 to 11 bantering with his collection of  "character" callers (whom he dubs his "Luna-tics"), employing sound effects  such as toilets flushing or eggs frying, discussing news events, introducing  popular Latin musical selections and generally being his charming and affable  self.  </P> <P> Luna says he still can't quite believe he is so well remunerated for having a  good time.  </P> <P> "I thank God that I have fun and that they pay me for it," he said. "They are  paying me for doing something I enjoy. I prepare something the day before, but  most is improvisation. It's the facility that God has given me to think  quickly."  </P> <P> Luna's morning show is broadcast via satellite and heard in San Francisco,  Chicago, New York, Miami and parts of Latin America. This week he was  broadcasting live from Mexico in honor of Mexican Independence Day (which is  Saturday). Luna often broadcasts shows from remote locations, including Rio de  Janeiro, Buenos Aires and Rome.  </P> <P> And Luna's stardom extends beyond radio. He has had roles in 24 films made in  Mexico and also hosts "Hablemos de Cine" ("Let's Talk Movies"), a weekly  Spanish-language version of Siskel and Ebert's film-review TV show, syndicated  by the Univision network and reaching an estimated 6.5 million viewers in the  United States. Locally, "Hablemos de Cine" is aired on KMEX Channel 34.  </P> <P> Luna is no overnight success. He has been on the air at KTNQ for 19 years and  started in radio when he was 20.  </P> <P> Actually, Luna marks the start of his broadcasting career much earlier -- at a  shoe store in Tlaltenago, the small town in which he was born in the state of  Zacatecas, Mexico.  </P> <P> "I began as an emcee at 11," Luna said. "I worked at a shoe store announcing  the specials."  </P> <P> The shoe store was across the street from the town center and a kiosk where  Luna would "broadcast" information via loudspeaker about the latest shoe sales.  </P> <P> "I put two speakers outside and I was broadcasting," he said. "Inside the shoe  store, I took the microphone and played music and did announcements,  commercials. The store had very good sales. I would say things like: 'We have  very nice shoes for you and your family. Come inside.' "  </P> <P> A few years after his early success as a barker, he decided to go to Mexico  City to attend radio announcers school. After studying two years, he received  his certificate in 1968 and left for Los Angeles, where his father was living.  </P> <P> Luna had hoped to learn English and eventually work in radio. Instead, he found  there was an immediate need for Spanish-language broadcasters. He began working  for XEGM-AM ((950), a station based in Tijuana but heard as far north as Los  Angeles. At the time, the company that owned XEGM also operated KTNQ, and Luna  moved to the Los Angeles-based station in 1970.  </P> <P> He began accumulating a stable of regular callers with whom he would stage  on-air routines and developed segments like a "Swap Meet of the Air," a "Dating  Game" spoof; a gossip hour, and "Rate-the-Record," where listeners call in and  decide whether a record should be played or broken.  </P> <P> Luna is convinced that other deejays who have hit the airwaves after him have  borrowed from his style and material.  </P> <P> "I listen to all the other stations to see what they're doing," Luna explained.  "All of them have stolen a little from me -- my informality, my jokes, my  collaborators. . . . They do a lot of what I started. I established informal,  crazy radio in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> His current boss, Heftel Broadcasting president and KTNQ general manager Ken  Wolt, regards Luna as the station's crown jewel.  </P> <P> Wolt said KTNQ and its sister FM station KLVE are the highest-billing  Spanish-language radio stations in the country, with advertising revenues of  more than $20 million in 1988 and $23 million projected for 1989. KTNQ was  rated No. 15 among all 80 Los Angeles radio stations in the most recent  Birch-Scarborough Ratings survey. Luna ranked eighth among morning shows,  according to station manager Jeff Lieberman.  </P> <P> "No one deejay (at KTNQ) has the audience that Humberto has," Wolt said. "It  was through him that we catapulted. . . . That's why we were so anxious to sign  him on long-term. We made it so lucrative that he's not going to go away."  </P> <P> The usually outspoken Luna is uncharacteristically reticent when asked about  his handsome salary.  </P> <P> "I'm well paid but it makes me uncomfortable for my people, because I'm  identified with the people, the average person, the average Mexican," Luna  said. "I don't want to seem presumptuous, but I appreciate that they're  recognizing my work after 20 years on the air."  </P></p>

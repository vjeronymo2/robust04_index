			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> EUPHORIC NOTION IN EUROPE: ALMOST ANYTHING POSSIBLE  </P> <P> Thursday's decision by a desperate East German government to throw open its  long-locked borders constitutes the latest and most dramatic of a dizzying  series of events that in a few months has transformed the political landscape  of Europe.  </P> <P> For the continent as a whole, it effectively neutralizes the most horrific  symbol of its 40-year division -- the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> Demands to tear down the wall that began with President John F. Kennedy  suddenly no longer apply.  </P> <P> East Germans now can walk through it or around it.  </P> <P> Events in East Germany also raise more urgent questions about the prospects of  German reunification, the pace of West European unity and the future of the two  military alliances that preserved a status quo since 1949 and is now crumbling.  </P> <P> Just as the wall evolved as a powerful symbol of division, so does its demise  carry an equally strong message to all Europeans that -- suddenly -- almost  anything is possible.  </P> <P> Those who dream of a continent undivided felt their goal a giant step closer to  reality Thursday as they watched another major chunk of the Iron Curtain fall  away.  </P> <P> The long-held belief that Moscow would never permit East Germany, the  westernmost cornerstone of its empire, to spin out of its orbit seems as dated  as the wall itself.  </P> <P> As millions of East Germans paraded through the streets demanding an end to  Communist rule, the 350,000 Soviet troops stationed in the country were  conspicuous only by their absence from sight.  </P> <P> Few European political analysts believe Czechoslovakia can resist pressures for  similar change much longer.  </P> <P> For East German leader Egon Krenz and the Communist leadership that clings to  power in East Berlin, the provisional ruling to open the borders is more an act  of despair than statesmanship.  </P> <P> It is a gamble that effectively gives East Germans their first free election.  Theoretically at least, all 17 million are now free to vote with their feet as  have thousands before them under far riskier circumstances.  </P> <P> In a very real way, the volume of those departing in the coming days will  determine both the fate of Krenz and the viability of the country he leads.  </P> <P> Even before the hemorrhage of refugees began eight weeks ago, East Germany was  a nation critically short of skilled manpower, saddled with an aging population  and the world's lowest birthrate.  </P> <P> The 200,000 or so who have left up to this point may be only 1% of the  population, but they are the young, the healthy, and the skilled who are  critical to the country's future.  </P> <P> East Germany has long been the only country in the Soviet Bloc that could boast  of some economic success.  </P> <P> If large numbers of its citizens fail to heed pleas from both East and West  German leaders to stay and help build a new society, this limited success would  be seriously jeopardized.  </P> <P> Such a development would undoubtedly ripple through other hard-pressed East  European economies.  </P> <P> For West Germany, as for other members of the Atlantic Alliance, events are  moving at an unnerving, yet exhilarating pace. The Alliance's long-term  planners suddenly stare at a set of conditions they believed only a short time  ago would take at least another decade to arise.  </P> <P> In West Germany, a mixture of elation and disbelief swept the country Thursday  evening as news broke of the new open border policy.  </P> <P> The euphoria that an era of family divisions seemed at an end was tempered by  fears that the action would trigger a new wave of refugees.  </P> <P> Before the recent flood of East Germans began, West Germany had absorbed nearly  half a million settlers of German extraction from Eastern Europe as a result of  relaxed emigration requirements.  </P> <P> While West Germany is the richest nation in the region, it has always been  plagued with self-doubt about the fragility of its democracy and its ability to  withstand political instability.  </P> <P> "It is in our interest that they stay," West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl  commented.  </P> <P> Thomas Kielinger, editor of the respected newspaper Rheinische Merkur, seemed  to speak for many West Germans who see Thursday's decision as a potential  watershed.  </P> <P> "We're hoping that this is the turning point that will give East Germans the  incentive to stay and build their country," he said.  </P> <P> For those in Western Europe, Thursday's announcement, coupled with Krenz's call  for free elections, raises other concerns.  </P> <P> It has brought the prospect of a new and closer relationship between the two  German states one giant step closer to reality.  </P> <P> Kohl's words to the West German Parliament on Wednesday that "we have less  reason than ever to be resigned to the long-term division of Germany" seemed  far truer 24 hours later.  </P> <P> For if the borders remain open and free elections result in a non-Communist  government, the very existence of two separate German states comes into  question.  </P> <P> Despite Kohl's protestation that no one need fear a united, democratic Germany,  Europeans are unsettled about the possibility of such a powerful entity.  </P> <P> While French President Francois Mitterrand bravely reaffirmed his support for  the German right to reunification, many other Europeans privately applaud the  words of an earlier Frenchman who said he loved Germany so much that he was  happy there were two of them.  </P> <P> Those nurturing the European Community's dream of economic and political unity  worry about West Germany either becoming distracted by events in the east or  placing a higher priority on its relations with East Germany than with the  community.  </P> <P> Under a French lead, the European Community is already considering accelerating  the pace of integration among its 12 member states in order to fill the  political vacuum it sees developing in Central Europe.  </P> <P> How a closer relationship between the two German states might affect the EC's  drive toward unity remains unclear.  </P> <P> But in a week that has seen the mass resignation of the East German Communist  Party's Central Committee and its Politburo, the West German chancellor hint at  German reunification in a speech before his Parliament, Krenz throw open the  country's borders and call for free elections, all followed by a nod of  approval from Moscow, political analysts have little idea what might come next.  </P></p>

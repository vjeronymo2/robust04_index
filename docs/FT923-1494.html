			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Summit is fixed for October 16 DOWNING Street confirmed last night the European Community summit called by Prime Minister John Major had been fixed for October 16, writes Ivo Dawnay, Political Correspondent. The agenda is intended to allow leaders to 'take stock' of issues arising from the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty and turmoil in the exchange markets. Officials said the meeting in London would include talks on widespread disenchantment with the European Commission's interference in national issues and workings of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. There are hopes Denmark will be ready by the summit to indicate how it will proceed towards ratification of the treaty, after its No vote in a June referendum. Mr Major is due to visit President Francois Mitterrand in Paris, possibly next week, and is expected to meet Mr Poul Schluter the Danish premier, in London before the summit.</p>

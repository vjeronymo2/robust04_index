			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: GM to reduce its holding in National Car Rental Systems GENERAL Motors, which is looking to sell off non-core assets, wants to rid itself of a 'significant part' of its majority per cent stake in National Car Rental Systems, the large US car rental company. It also revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it might take a fourth quarter charge of some Dollars 300m over National, though it did not spell out why But GM added that the charge would be offset by gains from the sales of its Allison Transmission division and of a 50 per cent holding in Korea's Daewoo Motor. Both deals were announced earlier. Allison is being sold to ZF Friedrichshafen of Germany. GM, which wants both to conserve cash and concentrate on restoring the profitability of its core North American vehicle operations, is mulling over the sale of both non-automotive business and some parts operations. The disposal of National Car Rental Systems represents a significant change of course since, in the late 1980s, the Big Three Detroit manufacturers bought up significant stakes in car rental companies in an attempt to bolster market share. However, the policy of cut-price deals with both captive and independent rental companies meant that the Big Three tended to lose money on these sales, and also saw sales of new cars suffer as the second-hand market was flooded with lightly-used rental vehicles. GM bought 45 per cent of National in 1988 and lifted the stake by another 36 per cent at the start of this year.</p>

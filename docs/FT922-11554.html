			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Tribal people demand forest lands in Ecuador THOUSANDS of tribal people from the the Amazonian jungle in eastern Ecuador, many wearing colourful feathered headdresses, marched into Quito, the country's capital, yesterday to demand control of their rainforest lands, AP reports from Quito. Singing and carrying banners protesting at what they see as government neglect, an estimated 2,500 members of indigenous tribes gathered, after a 12-day trek up to the mountain city, in a central square. Some wore war paint and carried bows and arrows, but the gathering was peaceful. Later, President Rodrgio Borja met a delegation of about 100 tribespeople to hear their complaints. The meeting was open to the media and the tribal leaders spoke for more than two hours. Afterwards, Mr Borja said he would order the agriculture ministry to give them property titles to the lands they use. The trekkers also demanded that the constitution be reformed to give their communities autonomy over a vast section of the Amazon jungle. The president said such a demand was beyond his authority, but he would relay their demand to Congress. Mr Manuel Salgado, Congress president, said later he would convene a special session to discuss the tribal people's demands.</p>

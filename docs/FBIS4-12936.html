			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 14 Apr (MENA)-- Tunisian newspaper AL-SABAH  cites European diplomatic sources as saying that the PLO and  Israel have agreed on the entrance of a Palestinian police  battalion to Gaza and Jericho at a time yet to be determined and  on its deployment within a period not exceeding 10 days.    According to the sources, this will be followed by the entry  of the Palestine Liberation Army [PLA], which is made up of  7,000 soldiers and officers, as a Palestinian police that will  take charge of public security and prepare for the entry of the  PLO apparatuses within five or six months.    The sources assert that the Palestinian side emphasized a  number of points during their talks with Israelis in Cairo,  primarily the commitment to a specific timetable ratified by the  Israeli side that links the entry of the vanguards of the  Palestinian police to that of the basic force into the self-rule  areas in Gaza and Jericho.    The Palestinian demands involved the size and armaments of  the Palestinian police and emphasized that these troops should  enter with their weapons and equipment and dressed in an  official uniform.    The European sources said that the Palestinian side insists  on the entry of the police force according to a timetable that  coincides with the redeployment of the occupation troops not  later than the end of April.    The sources add that the Israeli side is trying to delay the  entry of the Palestinian police to the period 15 May-1 July.  The PLO warned against the effect such a measure may have,  noting that it might create a security vacuum with moral and  military repercussions, particularly since Israel is encouraging  the possession of personal weapons in Gaza. The sector is  witnessing a state of chaos deliberately encouraged by the  Israelis with the goal of creating more problems for the  Palestinian leadership before control is turned over to it.    According to the sources, the Palestinian side insists on  the  entry of the Palestinian police with their official uniform,  weapons, and equipment to create a reassuring atmosphere of  dignity. Meanwhile, the Israeli side wants these troops to enter  in civilian cars or buses with sealed windows, like prisoners of  war or infiltrators instead of a police force returning to the  homeland.    The European diplomatic sources said that the Palestinian  side is emphasizing the psychological side by insisting on the  entry of the police force in the official uniform behind their  flags in an official ceremony to win additional support for the  Declaration of Principles.    The sources add that the most prominent personalities that  will lead the vanguards of the police force are Major General  Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police force; Major  General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Majaydah, deputy chief of staff of the  PLA, who will be commander of the Gaza police; Major General  Mahmud Yusuf, head of the PLO military department, who will be  commander of Jericho police; and Brigadier General Mamduh  Nawfal, who will be in charge of criminal security.    According to the sources, the commanders of Palestinian  troops in Yemen, Sudan, Libya, Algeria, Iraq, and Jordan have  prepared lists of their personnel to prepare for leaving for  Jordan and Egypt. Moreover, the sources add, the Saudi  Government has undertaken to transport the Palestinian military  units on its planes.</p>

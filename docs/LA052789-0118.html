			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 3-A;  </P> <P> KENNEDY PROVES ITSELF TO NO. 1 LAGUNA HILLS  </P> <P> Kennedy High School, the patsy of the Empire League just three years ago, is  getting plenty of respect these days. Friday, the Fighting Irish scored a 7-2  victory over Laguna Hills in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 3-A  division in La Palma.  </P> <P> The victory over the county's top-ranked team moved Kennedy (23-5) into the  semifinals on Tuesday against Tustin (21-8) at a site to be determined today.  Laguna Hills, which had won 21 of its past 22 games, ended the season at 24-5.  </P> <P> Few could appreciate Kennedy's turnaround more than winning pitcher Greg  Hansell, who allowed only four hits and struck out 10 to improve his record to  12-1. Hansell also hit his second home run of the season and scored twice.  </P> <P> Hansell has been a varsity member since he was a freshman and has grown with a  program that struggled to win a total of nine games in 1986 and 1987. By  qualifying for the semifinals, Kennedy has advanced farther than any other team  in the school's 25-year history.  </P> <P> "When we were freshmen, we knew someday we would get our chance," Hansell said.  "It was really nice to get this win against Laguna Hills since they eliminated  us last year. This team is like a train that's picking up speed."  </P> <P> Hansell helped Kennedy get off to its third quick start in three playoff games  by hitting a homer over the left-field fence in the second inning as Kennedy  took a 2-0 lead. It marked the third consecutive playoff game in which Kennedy  has opened with a two-run lead.  </P> <P> Catcher Scott Wood's two-run double staked Kennedy to a 4-0 lead in the third  inning, and that was more than enough for Hansell, who dominated one of the  county's best-hitting teams. Hansell benefited from double plays in the first  two innings, then got stronger as the game progressed, striking out seven of  the last nine batters he retired.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills avoided its second shutout when it scored two unearned runs in the  sixth inning. The Hawks' three top hitters -- center fielder Chris Sheff, first  baseman Rob Milo and catcher Mike Helm -- struggled against Hansell. Helm  managed the only hit between the three, an infield single in the sixth.  </P> <P> "To shut down Sheff, Milo and Helm is quite an accomplishment," said Chris  Pascal, Kennedy's coach. "They got a little frustrated and then started looking  at a lot of strikes."  </P> <P> Laguna Hills hitters were caught looking at a third strike six times, a feat  that Jack Hodges, Laguna Hills coach, credited to Hansell's mastery.  </P> <P> "He's the best pitcher we've faced this year," Hodges said. "The 10 strikeouts  was the highest total against us this year. As a hitter, you can't adjust when  a guy's on like he was today. You just try to be as aggressive as possible and  hope to make contact."  </P> <P> Hodges led Laguna Hills to the 2-A division title in 1984 and compared Kennedy  to his championship team.  </P> <P> "They're very capable of winning the whole thing," Hodges said. "They've got  good pitching and two or three guys in the lineup who can hurt you."  </P></p>

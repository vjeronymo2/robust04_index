			<p>BFN     [Text] The Gabonese Government has taken tough measures  against Omar Bongo Univeristy students, who have been on strike  since 26 May. On 14 June, this strike degenerated into acts of  violence, during which the students molested the rector as well  as his deputy, and ransacked the rector's office. Reacting to  this situation, the government, through Higher Education  Minister Rene Ndemezo'Obiang, announced various measures. It  closed down the university as of this morning, expelled four  students, and ordered all students to vacate the campus. The  striking students, who belong to the Front of Radical University  Students and Gabonese University Students Union, are considered  the organizers of the recent acts of violence. The government  has also decided to prosecute student leaders and revise the  university franchise laws. These measures were taken to avoid  the recurrence of such acts of aggression on the campus in the  future.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in  Bulgarian from 0805 to 0949 GMT carried a live relay,  interrupted by the midday newscast from 0900 to 0920, of a  debate in the National Assembly in Sofia on a draft resolution  submitted by the Council of Ministers to grant a request  submitted by the United Nations for the one-time passage of a  road convoy with UN property and equipment needed by the UN  Protection Forces in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,  FYROM, for preventative operations. The different parliamentary  groups expressed varying stances on the issue.    At 0940 GMT National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov,  who chaired the debates, declared the debate closed and asked  the deputies to take an open vote on the resolution. At 0946  GMT Yordanov announced the result of the ballot as follows: "A  total of 215 National Assembly deputies took part in the ballot.  Of these, 117 voted in favor of the resolution, 92 against, and  six deputies abstained. Accordingly, the resolution is adopted  and becomes a resolution of the National Assembly."    Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev then rose to express  "warm gratitude to the National Assembly for officially  supporting the proposal submitted by the government today on an  exceptionally important problem." His statement was greeted  with a mixture of applause and shouting.</p>

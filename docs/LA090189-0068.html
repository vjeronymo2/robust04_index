			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RECORD NUMBER OF EXOTIC INSECTS FOUND  </P> <P> Record numbers of exotic insect pests are showing up in Los Angeles County and  posing an unprecedented threat to California's $16-billion farm economy.  </P> <P> "We are being literally swamped," said Rosser W. Garrison, a county  entomologist. "The variety of insects is increasing, and the sheer number is  increasing."  </P> <P> As of July, Garrison has counted 1,185 potentially harmful insect pests foreign  to California, ranging from scores of fruit flies to devastating gypsy moths,  fire ants, Russian wheat aphids, Japanese beetles and a variety of mealy bugs  and scales.  </P> <P> "The number of quarantine reports that I have to do are higher than ever  before," Garrison said.  </P> <P> One of the new pests, the ash whitefly, already has reached epidemic  proportions in Southern California and is racing for the state's agricultural  heartland.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has become a magnet for imported insects for a number of reasons,  not least of which is the mild climate and the ease of international travel,  officials said.  </P></p>

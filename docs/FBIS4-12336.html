			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Apr (MENA)--Marwan Kanafani, Palestinian  president Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, has expressed his surprise  over Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' statements, in  which he asks the Palestinian president to personally condemn  the 'Affula incident.    In a statement he made this evening, Kanafani said in answer  to Peres' statements that it is very strange to hear such a  request from the Israeli foreign minister--neither he nor  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin expressed any kind of  regret or condemnation when the Israeli army and intelligence  deliberately killed six prominent youths from Fatah recently in  Jabalyah in the Gaza Strip.    The Palestinian official added that the contrary was true  since the Israeli housing minister expressed his and the Israeli  Government's appreciation for such terrorist acts when he  emerged from the Israeli cabinet's weekly session to declare the  cabinet's stance on the incident.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRACK STAR IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER HAMMER HITS HER IN FACE  </P> <P> A 20-year-old track and field star was critically injured when she was hit in  the face by a 16-pound hammer thrown by another student during track practice  at Sacramento City College.  </P> <P> After 14 hours of surgery Monday, Samira Taylor remained in critical condition  at University Medical Center.  </P> <P> Her family said she suffered a skull fracture and numerous broken bones in her  face, eyes and nose.  </P> <P> Susie Williams, director of community and media relations for the Los Rios  Community College District, said initial reports indicated that Taylor had been  practicing the discus throw, completed her toss and "for some reason she came  back into the (track) area" where the other student was making his throw.  </P> <P> Taylor was a star athlete at Grant and Rio Linda High schools. In 1988, she was  honored by the Sacramento Bee as one of the city's best prep track and field  athletes. That year she began the season with the city's longest girls' discus  throw of 129 feet, 9 1/2 inches. She also had the second-longest shot put throw  of 40.2 feet.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, track team member Dave Reneau, 22, who saw the accident, said he  remained shaken by what he saw.  </P> <P> "I feel guilty and wish I could accept some of that pain. Tragedy seems to  always happens to the good people. And she is such a very, very nice girl. She  was a standout athlete -- disciplined -- and track was her ticket out."  </P></p>

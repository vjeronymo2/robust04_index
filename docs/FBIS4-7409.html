			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang is  ready to allow additional inspections by the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] considering the latest change in the  situation on an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys after  examining the future attitudes of the United States and the  IAEA, North Korean Ambassador to the United Nations Pak Kil-yon  said in a press conference here Thursday [28 April].    Pak seemed to be attaching a condition to the offer but his  remark attracted attention since permitting further checks of  its nuclear facilities would be considered a breakthrough in the  lengthy impasse related to the North Korean nuclear issue.    South Korea recently withdrew the inter-Korean exchange of  special envoys as a condition for a third round of high-level  U.S.- North Korea talks.    North Korea previously maintained that any further  inspections should be discussed at a third round of high-level  talks with the United States.    Pak reiterated Pyongyang's position that the 1953 Armistice  Agreement should be replaced by a peace accord between North  Korea and the United States.</p>

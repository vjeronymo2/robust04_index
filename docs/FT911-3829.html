			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Polymark prospects justify 1p dividend POLYMARK International, the industrial laundry equipment and technographics group, is returning to the dividend list after an absence of 10 years as 'medium-term prospects are sufficiently encouraging'. Fully diluted earnings per share benefited from a low tax charge and moved ahead to 5.07p in 1990, against 4.49p. The proposed dividend is 1p. Pre-tax profit, however, fell from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 1.51m in the year. That reflected a substantial reduction in operating income from discontinued activities of Pounds 421,000 (Pounds 2.51m), which was offset somewhat by an improvement in continuing operations from Pounds 237,000 to Pounds 594,000 and interest credit of Pounds 442,000 (charge of Pounds 785,000). Mr Len Weaver, chairman, said the laundry division held its profit at Pounds 352,000 after reorganisation costs of Pounds 42,000. In technographics, a programme to improve productivity and enhance margins led to a turnround from a loss of Pounds 114,000 to a profit of Pounds 242,000. He said much was done to create a more stable and profitable basis for the continuing operations. Below the line there was an extraordinary profit of Pounds 2.92m, being the final dividend from Polymark France and surplus on the sale of the French division.</p>

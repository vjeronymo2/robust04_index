			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK fears Nato split over Bosnia The UK government fears the deepening rift between Europe and the US over the war in Bosnia risks provoking the most damaging breach in Anglo-American relations since the Suez crisis nearly 40 years ago. British concern over the diplomatic rift came amid reports that Serb aircraft yesterday bombarded Bihac, the UN-designated safe area in northwestern Bosnia, ignoring warnings of Nato retaliation. Last night, the UN Security Council condemned the attack 'in the strongest possible terms'. It is expected today to give Nato fighters clearance to chase offending Serb aircraft and bomb them, if necessary, at their base in the Krajina region of Croatia. Mr Willy Claes, the secretary-general of Nato, said he believed the Serbs had used napalm and cluster bombs in the attack on Bihac, and said the time had come 'to act and give clear signals to the Serbs that this has to be stopped'. In spite of public reassurances that the dispute, provoked by the US decision to withdraw from enforcing the arms embargo on the former Yugoslav republic, is containable, British ministers are concerned it presages a deep split in the western alliance. Unless the disagreement is patched up at a meeting early next month of the five-nation contact group on Bosnia, the UK government believes it could do irreparable damage to Nato. US officials reacted strongly to the criticism, accusing the Europeans, and especially the French, of playing electoral politics by talking of a transatlantic rift. 'If that's the way they genuinely feel about it, then it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,' a senior official said. At a Franco-British defence summit in Chartres yesterday, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the US embargo decision 'should not be over-dramatised'. However, Britain and France were concerned that the US move might encourage a gradual unravelling of the embargo. Washington's unilateral action is already seen as a damaging precedent, undercutting the solidarity of Nato at a critical moment for the alliance. France believes the 'unreliability' shown by the US over the embargo has greatly strengthened its case for independent European defence arrangements. Further overt US support for Bosnia's Moslem government could force Britain and France to withdraw their troops from the UN peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslav province. Clinton administration officials countered that their allies had known for months the US would have to pull out of enforcement of the embargo as a consequence of a law passed by Congress requiring the administration to press for an end to the order.

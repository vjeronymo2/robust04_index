			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Black South African activist Winnie Mandela, the wife of jailed African  National Congress leader Nelson R. Mandela, joined in beating some boys  allegedly abducted by her unofficial bodyguards, a major Johannesburg newspaper  reported. It was the first published report asserting that Mandela herself  participated in the alleged beating. The Sunday Star, a newspaper that opposes  apartheid, said she whipped four boys brought to her house in Soweto last month  by young men loyal to her who call themselves the Mandela United soccer club.  One of the boys, 14-year-old Stompie Mokhetsi, is missing and feared dead. The  report deepened the controversy surrounding Mandela, who has denied any  wrongdoing.  </P></p>

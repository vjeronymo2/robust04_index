Also during the meeting, Karimov handed Hata an album which  included pictures of graves of Japanese soldiers detained in  uzbekistan after World War II, the officials said.    Before their meeting, Hata and Karimov signed a joint  statement outlining the framework for future bilateral relations.    The statement says Japan and Uzbekistan agreed that  "expansion of political dialogue is a beneficial and effective  way to promote bilateral relations and affirmed the importance  of exchanging opinions on matters of mutual interest, including  international and regional problems."

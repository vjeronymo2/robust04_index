			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAILING;  </P> <P> ARBY'S WILL CHALLENGE THE HAMBURGER GIANTS WITH A MAJOR EXPANSION HERE  </P> <P> Watch out, McDonald's and Carl's Jr. Arby's Inc. is betting that hungry Orange  County diners will be willing to swap their burgers for roast beef.  </P> <P> And to put its money where its mouth is, Arby's has announced plans to develop  at least 20 Arby's restaurants in Orange County over the next 3 years -- an  expansion that will more than double its presence here.  </P> <P> The roast beef sandwich chain has signed an agreement with Kyotaru Co. Ltd., a  Tokyo-based restaurant company, to build 20 franchise restaurants. Construction  of the first should start within a few months.  </P> <P> Arby's also has commitments from other franchisees to build an additional 50  restaurants in Southern California over the next 3 years.  </P> <P> Leonard Roberts, Arby's president and chief executive, said the company plans  to open 400 additional restaurants in California within the next 5 years. "Our  goal is to have 500 total by 1993," he said in a telephone interview Wednesday.  </P> <P> Why is Arby's so bullish on California?  </P> <P> "We like what we see in terms of demographics," Roberts said. He cited the  state's dense population and highly competitive environment for fast-food  dollars as factors that make the state attractive.  </P> <P> "We do the strongest when you put us next to a McDonald's, a Burger King or a  Wendy's, where the traffic pattern is established," he said. When a market is  saturated with competitors, Roberts explained, customers are more likely to  choose an alternative like roast beef sandwiches.  </P> <P> Not that Arby's sells only roast beef these days. The chain's menu includes a  breakfast menu with croissants, sausage and biscuits, and chicken items such as  chicken cordon bleu and a roasted chicken club sandwich.  </P> <P> The chain operates 2,100 Arby's worldwide, including 105 in California and 13  in Orange County. Arby's is a subsidiary of DWG Corp., a holding company with  interests that include textiles, propane gas and soft drinks.  </P></p>

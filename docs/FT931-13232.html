			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Not many managers have to abseil down 100ft cliffs or swing across mountain streams in their battle to get the British economy moving. But the imagination and initiative they reveal in dealing with the rigours of nature raw in tooth and nail should have a spin-off in real life. That at least is the justification for such enterprises as John Ridgway's survival course based at Ardmore in north Scotland. And enough companies believe in it to send middle managers outward bound. Cutting Edge (Channel 4 at 9.00) follows a party of 24 executives of a multinational business as they discover themselves and each other in these testing conditions. This is followed aptly by Northern Exposure, the cult US comedy sitcom set in Alaska. 'Maggie faces the possibility that the late Rick has been reincarnated as a dog.' Nuff said. Radio 4's adaptation of Eveyln Waugh's Decline and Fall at 11.00 is a great disappointment, exhibiting a pronounced lack of 1920s style - one of the great humorous classics of the century is played without laughs.</p>

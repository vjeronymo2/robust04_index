			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Electricity chiefs reap high profit from share options The managing director of Midlands Electricity, who resigned in a top-level management shake-up last year, left with a pay-off and other benefits worth over Pounds 1.2m, according to the company's accounts. The publication of electricity industry annual reports yesterday also disclosed that electricity company directors have made several million pounds of paper profits on executive share option schemes set up at the time of privatisation. Mr Richard Young, who left Midlands in April 1993 when he was 50, was paid Pounds 393,000 in compensation for loss of office plus Pounds 262,000 in pension contributions. He also held options to buy 145,000 shares at a price which gave him a paper profit of at least Pounds 4 each, or Pounds 580,000. Mr Young, a lifelong electricity industry man, joined Midlands Electricity in 1982. He was entitled to special pension payments under the electricity industry pension scheme and received the share options along with other Midlands executives under the company scheme. All the privatised electricity companies set up option schemes in January 1991 to provide incentives for senior executives. For tax reasons these could not be exercised until the beginning of this year. But since then, dozens of executives have taken advantage of the boom in electricity shares to cash in the options, which give the holder the right to buy shares at prices well below those in the market. Apart from Mr Young, five Midlands Electricity directors bought nearly 600,000 of shares at 258p at a time when the company's shares were trading between 634p and 732p, implying a collective profit on paper of around Pounds 2.5m. Directors at the neighbouring East Midlands Electricity took 770,000 options at prices which will have yielded them a paper profit of at least Pounds 2m. Earlier this year, the company's chairman, Mr John Harris, stepped down and the new management took a Pounds 130m write-off on new business ventures which did not succeed. Yesterday also brought details of options deals at Swalec, the South Wales utility, where Mr Wynford Evans, the chairman, exercised options on 111,510 shares, netting a paper profit of just under Pounds 500,000. Altogether, Swalec directors' paper profits amounted to Pounds 1.1m. A spokesman for Swalec, whose electricity prices are among the country's highest, said the company's good performance had helped boost the share price. But he also stressed that Swalec customers had benefited through price freezes and rebates of Pounds 25 each a year. At Southern Electricity, three directors including Mr Henry Casley, the chief executive, exercised options on 240,000 shares which gave them a paper profit of just over Pounds 1m. Directors usually acquire their share options by taking out a bank loan and selling enough shares to repay the loan.</p>

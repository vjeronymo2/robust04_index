			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Speaker of House of Representatives Shaykh </F> 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, by Fawzi al-Jundi via telephone from Cairo;  date not given--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ introduction]    [Text] Despite the difficulty of getting through to the  Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and despite the increasing noise of  bullets and absence of the sound of dialogue between Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, AL-SHARQ succeeded in conducting a very brief telephone  interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni  House of Representatives and grand shaykh of the Yemeni tribes.  The interview lasted just minutes when the telephone line went  dead.    [Al-Jundi] The current situation in Yemen--who exactly is  responsible for this military conflict?    [Al-Ahmar] The situation in Yemen is terrible. The  leadership  of the Socialist Party is responsible. They created the  political crisis and started the military confrontation.    [Al-Jundi] Are you, as the leader of the Yemeni Reform  Grouping, able to carry out mediation now between the Yemeni  president and vice president?    [Al-Ahmar] At the start of the crisis we tried very hard to  play this role, and did play it, but the Socialist Party is  being difficult, and created the crisis from the beginning. It  had two demands: constitutional amendments and the election of a  new presidential council. When these were granted, the party  went on to make new demands, and we acceded out of our desire  for unity, and all Yemeni forces tried to meet the demands that  were made. All the demands included the pledge and agreement  document, and we agreed to them in order to end the crisis and  preserve the union. But after all the Yemeni forces, the  coalition parties, and our legitimate institutions agreed to the  document that had been signed, which granted all their demands,  they revolted again and escalated the military situation, and  attacked, in order to get what they really wanted: secession.    [Al-Jundi] It is clear that you blame the Socialist Party  for  what is happening now.    [Al-Ahmar] Yes. Yes, we blame them for what has happened.  First, we blame them for creating the political crisis, and now  we blame them for starting the military confrontation. We, the  House of Representatives, have tried and are still trying to  solve the crisis.    We postponed some of the constitutional measures we had the  right to take in order to spare the country and please these  "mutinous" elements revolting against the legitimate government,  and heading for military conflict and the escalation of the  situation. Thus they bear the responsibility, and the entire  people holds them responsible.    [Al-Jundi] Is it possible to say that the dialogue committee  has been playing its role in this current phase?    [Al-Ahmar] The dialogue committee has carried out its duty  to  formulate the document and the coalition's agreement upon it.  Everyone agrees that the crisis ended with the signature of the  document, but the Socialist Party revolted as it had revolted at  the outset against democracy--only now it was revolting against  the document.    [Al-Jundi] Al-Bid lays the blame on President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and his speech on 27 April.    [Al-Ahmar] The practical facts disprove that. President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih agreed to the document, signed it, and committed  himself to it, and so did the others, the [General People's]  Congress and Reform [parties]. The Socialist Party did not,  especially Presidential Council Member 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Salim  Salih Muhammad, the Prime Minister, and the Socialist ministers.  It has been two and one-half months since it was signed, and  everyone is in agreement.    The Socialist Party started the military confrontation to  get  what it wanted--secession. That is why we hold them responsible.    [Al-Jundi] Are you able to play a role at present?    [Al-Ahmar] There are no solutions beyond what is there in  the  document. If there is any role I can play as leader of the  Yemeni Grouping, I will not hesitate.    It was at this point that the phone went dead.</p>

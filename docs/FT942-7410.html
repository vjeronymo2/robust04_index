			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (7): Discordant dial tone - The telecommunications and energy sectors The dial tone for Telecom Eireann (TE) has been somewhat discordant over the past six months. National unease over raised calling charges gave way to dismay at a proposed alliance with a giant outsider, Cable &amp; Wireless. The new chief executive of TE, Mr Alfie Kane, has big problems to solve, such as about IPounds 900m in debt (with an enormous debt/equity ratio of about 250 to 1) and thousands more employees than critics say are necessary. Comparison with Aer Lingus, the national airline - which has faced waves of union hostility as it tried to correct its overstaffing - is one calculated to ring unpleasant bells with the management of the semi-state operation. The big shadow on TE's horizon is January 1, 1998, when the European telecoms market will be opened up completely (although Ireland, like some of the smaller EU states, will get special consideration in domestic services). The level of competition across Europe is something TE could scarcely survive in its present form. But TE is having considerable success in its campaign - run jointly with the Industrial Development Authority's overseas arm - to attract telemarketing companies. With international charges for business among the lowest in Europe, Ireland has recently been chosen by Dell computers, Best Western Hotels, ICT Group and others as a site for operations that will create hundreds of jobs. Last year's charging changes aroused opposition, especially from small businesses, as local or internal national calls bore the brunt of big cuts for international use. The 'rebalancing', as TE prefers to call it, has led to an average reduction of 7 per cent in business telephone bills. Further cuts are on the horizon. Mr Brendan Hynes, chairman of TE until an abrupt and seemingly acrimonious departure two years ago, wrote his own analysis of Irish semi-state bodies (Telecom Eireann, Aer Lingus) earlier this year. Mr Hynes did not mince his words. 'Telecom Eireann is very inefficient,' he declared. From his research, he gave figures that reflected badly on the management of the country's telephone operator. Irish customers paid an average of IPounds 704 annually for each telephone line, compared with IPounds 550 in Britain and IPounds 534 elsewhere in Europe, he said. European telephone companies average one worker for 172 lines, whereas TE has one employee for every 85 (although this has come down from a figure nearer 40 just a few years ago). Population dispersal cannot justify this, Mr Hynes says; New Zealand, which has a similar population but a much greater area, has a line ratio much closer to the European norm than that of Ireland. The last National Development Plan turned a deaf ear to TE's calls for funds for investment, allocating only IPounds 27m from EU structural funds where IPounds 200m had been sought. This heightened existing suspicions that the government would prefer TE to link up with a bigger, richer outsider. However, union opposition and national defensiveness sprang to life when the government started to talk euphemistically about 'strategic alliances' late last year. In March, TE received a full proposal from Cable &amp; Wireless to form a joint venture, with about IPounds 400m on the table. The minister, Mr Brian Cowen, has instructed the TE board to study the C&amp;W proposal and report back within six months on its feasibility - and any other options. He is also considering the establishment of an independent Irish telecoms authority equipped with enforcement powers, which could be essential if the scene changes from one serene operator to a cast of dozens scrabbling for market share. Mr Cowen's portfolio also includes energy. This is not as contentious an area as telecoms, but the future could hold some headaches for whoever is in charge. Unlike TE, there are no plans to place the energy utilities in public hands, the minister told the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation recently. However, the industry should not be complacent - the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) is currently being 'reviewed'. ESB, which was founded in 1927, is under the scrutiny of a cost and competitiveness review announced in February. This, the department says, will not only help the government decide on ESB applications to have price rises sanctioned, but also provide the minister 'with a solid regulation for future reviews of the electricity industry'. A review of the mining industry and concomitant policy was also announced late last year (Ireland has 20 per cent of western Europe's supplies of zinc). The new gas interconnector linking south-western Scotland with Ireland, at a site north of Dublin, is now on-line. At a cost of IPounds 290m, IPounds 90m of which came from the EU, the 290-km pipeline is the Republic's most significant energy project. The project involved four construction efforts, including construction of a gas compressor station in Scotland. Bord Gais, the national gas supplier, has a security gas agreement with National Power and a gas purchase agreement with British Gas. Should Ireland find fresh reserves of natural gas in current exploration, there is provision for surplus supplies to be exported back to Britain through the same pipeline. Tax incentives to promote exploration in offshore oilfields have also been in force for several years. In March Mr Noel Treacy, the Irish energy minister, awarded five exploration licences to five consortia, covering 28 blocks in the Slyne and Erris troughs. Last October's National Plan published by the Irish government made a commitment to promote alternative energy sources. The Electricity Supply Board (ESB) has been asked to bring 75 megawatts of capacity on line from such sources as combined heat and power (CHP), small hydro or wind power. This scheme is now being developed. Peat-fired power stations are also an option, although the environmental debate over further inroads into Ireland's famous peat bogs is likely to gain impetus.</p>

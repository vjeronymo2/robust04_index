			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA DRAFT LOTTERY;  </P> <P> INSTEAD OF STERN, THIS DEAL CALLS FOR MONTY HALL  </P> <P> Striving for parity among its franchises, the NBA will bring its have-nots and  one other lucky team to the Equitable Center, where it will stage the sixth  annual draft lottery Sunday -- the key word being stage.  </P> <P> By the time CBS' television cameras switch from Auburn Hills, Mich., at  halftime of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, to New York, the picking  order for the first 11 spots of the June 27 draft will already have been  determined. But Commissioner David Stern and the team representatives,  including General Manager Elgin Baylor of the Clippers, will not know the  outcome.  </P> <P> This is done strictly for television purposes. That it has to be played out  twice, once behind closed doors with another official from each team on hand,  is indicative of how the constantly changing process has become so complicated.  </P> <P> Now it will look more like a game show than ever, which is saying something.  Under the new weighted system developed so that the poorest teams have a better  chance of getting the earliest picks, New Jersey, with the worst record, will  have 11 balls placed into a cylinder. The second-worst team will have 10, and  so on.  </P> <P> The team with the first ball out will have the first choice, the team with the  second non-duplicate ball the second, and the team with the third non-duplicate  ball the third.  </P> <P> From there, the eight remaining teams will be placed in reverse order of  finish, so the Nets can pick no lower than fourth. Finally, cards with team  logos will be sealed in envelopes and brought onstage for TV's reaction shots.  </P> <P> The Clippers, with the seventh-worst record at 30-52, can do no worse than  10th.  </P> <P> The other non-playoff teams involved are Atlanta, Charlotte, Golden State,  Miami, Minnesota, New Jersey, Orlando, Sacramento and Seattle. The 11th  participant is Dallas, which went 47-35 but in 1986 traded Jay Vincent to  Washington for a first-round pick in 1990. The Bullets didn't make the  playoffs, so the Mavericks make the lottery.  </P> <P> The Clippers' other first-round selection, by virtue of the Ron Harper deal  with Cleveland this season, will also be determined today when a drawing is  held to split the tie between the Cavaliers and Indiana. Both finished 42-40,  and the winner picks 13th, the other 14th. It's actually the Clippers against  Dallas, since the Mavericks hold the Pacers' spot from another trade.  </P> <P> By virtue of having the best regular-season mark, the Lakers will choose 27th.  </P> <P> Clipper history here is good -- a first, second, third, fourth and sixth. But  there is no Danny Manning or David Robinson this year, so, depending on team  needs, the exact position might not be of critical importance.  </P> <P> The likely lottery picks include Derrick Coleman of Syracuse, Dennis Scott of  Georgia Tech, Lionel Simmons of La Salle, Gary Payton of Oregon State, Kendall  Gill of Illinois and Rumeal Robinson of Michigan.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Mike Fratello and Mike Schuler remain the main candidates to become the next  Clipper coach. K.C. Jones, who eventually moved up in Seattle, and Jimmy  Rodgers declined interview requests, and the Clippers did not get permission  from Cleveland to meet with Cavalier Coach Lenny Wilkens. . . . When Winston  Garland underwent surgery last week to repair some loose cartilage, he became  the fourth Clipper to be operated on since mid-January and the third to have  his knee worked on, joining Ron Harper and Jay Edwards. Gary Grant's surgery  was on his ankle. . . .Benoit Benjamin earned approximately $500,000 in  incentives during 1989-90 to go with his base salary of $1 million.  </P> <P> Contract talks with Harper, a restricted free agent as of July 1, are in the  early stages. The Clippers, who plan to match offers from other teams, will go  for a deal that contains incentive clauses based on how much Harper plays after  coming back from his knee surgery.  </P></p>

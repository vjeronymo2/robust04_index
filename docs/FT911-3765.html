			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Kuwaiti terminal reopened to all Shuaiba, Kuwait's largest container terminal, was cleared for general traffic by the emirate's authorities yesterday, Paul Abrahams writes from Kuwait City. The port's opening should help reduce shortages of essential supplies in the country. Although Shuaiba was re-opened last month, only government-chartered ships were allowed to use its facilities. Otherwise, imports were flown in by military aircraft or trucked along heavily damaged roads from Saudi Arabia. Routes from Iraq, from where most of Kuwait's pre-war supplies came, are closed.</p>

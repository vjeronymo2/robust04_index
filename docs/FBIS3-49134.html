			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- Premier Vaclav Klaus today  announced a 1993 state budget surplus of about half a billion  crowns attributed in part to the fact that the state received  about three billion crowns more than anticipated.    Klaus considers the high state revenue of about 357 billion  crowns "an extraordinary success," especially since 1993 was the  country's first year of existence, and during the year radical  tax reforms were instituted.    He cautioned that the data are not yet definitive because  until January 15 the state can receive bills for 1993, but only  for relatively small sums. He added that the gross national  product (GNP) growth for 1993 was about zero percent.    Klaus stated that the funds from the budget surplus would  not  be used for advances on reparations for Czech victims of the  Nazis, as proposed by Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. That  proposal has not yet been submitted for "serious" discussion,  Klaus said.</p>

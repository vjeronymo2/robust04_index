			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> MEDFLY FEARS EXPAND;  </P> <P> 2ND FOUND IN ORANGE COUNTY TRAP  </P> <P> A fertile Mediterranean fruit fly has been discovered in Westminster, a find  that could signal a drastic expansion of the crop-destroying pest's path of  infestation, Orange County agricultural officials said today.  </P> <P> The non-pregnant fly was found in a trap late Thursday afternoon just south of  the Garden Grove Freeway on Edwards Avenue, 10 miles south of the spot where  the county's only other Medfly was found.  </P> <P> County officials immediately began to blanket the region around Westminster  with more than 1,000 Medfly traps in an effort to determine the severity of the  infestation.  </P> <P> They were still waiting this morning to learn whether the state will order  malathion pesticide spraying for the Westminster region. State officials on  Thursday, conceding that the problem is worse than once projected, revised  their plans and ordered repeated sprayings -- as many as 16 -- for some  infested areas in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> "We're waiting to hear how this will be treated," county entomologist Nick  Nisson said. "It's a very bad sign. This is an area removed from the other  (detections), and that makes the problem appear much more serious and  widespread."  </P> <P> Entomologists dissected the Medfly this morning at the regional Medfly Project  in El Monte and determined that the insect was not pregnant but that it was  fertile and capable of reproducing.  </P> <P> "It's the next worst thing (to a pregnant Medfly); it's a wild fly, and we  certainly didn't want to see that," Nisson said.  </P> <P> How to respond to the detection of fertile but non-pregnant Medflies is a gray  area in state protocol, officials say.  </P> <P> "Because (the Westminster fly) is an unmated female, the decision might be made  just to trap and see if there are more out there," said William Edwards, a Los  Angeles agricultural commissioner who is active in the region-wide Medfly  Project.  </P> <P> "Or we could go out and treat the area (with malathion) immediately. It could  go either way," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, state agricultural officials said this morning that they will  respray a 10-square-mile area of La Habra, Brea and Fullerton next Tuesday  night, along with previously announced spraying that night of a new infestation  area around La Habra Heights.  </P> <P> The 10-square-mile region -- the first ever targeted in Orange County -- was  sprayed with more than 500 gallons of a malathion and insect bait mixture last  week, alarming some residents who worried about health effects.  </P> <P> State officials maintain that the Medfly pesticide mix poses no risk to humans  in the doses used in spraying, although its use is under review by the federal  government.  </P> <P> Since the Medfly reappeared in Southern California in August, state officials  have sprayed roughly 250 square miles from the San Fernando Valley to northern  Orange County, affecting about a million residents.  </P> <P> State officials are trying -- unsuccessfully, they concede -- to stop the  further spread of the crop-attacking pest and prevent a repeat of the 1981  infestation that ravaged the state's agricultural economy.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek: "The Self-Preservation </F> Instinct, or the Mobilization of the Nomenklatura"]    [Text] Ukrainians know by sight many of those who  were registered on 15 February as candidates for people's deputy  of Ukraine. Among the claimants to the deputy pie are about 300  presidential representatives in the localities and 250 chairmen  of local councils; there are six officials of the special  services, Defense Minister Radetskyy, and 28 former and current  members of the Ukrainian Government. For the first time, there  has truly emerged the paradoxical situation of competition among  the nomenklatura. In many regions of the state, especially in  its central part, the following pattern of intranomenklatura  "apportionment" may be observed: Competing against each other  are the local presidential representative, the local council  chairman, envoys of the Kiev teams of Plyushch and Kravchuk, a  local kolkhoz chairman and the director of a small plant....    The fact that the nomenklatura has not been able to share  the  positions among "its own" is in itself cause for surprise, but  no less interesting is the fact that there is now practically no  one to head the Ukrainian Government. The following persons have  suspended the performance of their official duties for the  duration of the election campaign: Acting Prime Minister  Zvyahilskyy; Deputy Prime Ministers Yevtukhov, Landik, and  Zhulynskyy; Ministers Shpek, Pyatachenko, Kaskevych, Dotsenko,  Karasyk, and Golubchenko; State Television and Radio Company  Chairman Okhmakevych, who, in the confusion of the elections  even organized his own micro-party; and Arbitration Court  Chairman Prytik. The state is being run by deputies.    From circles close to the president's, this information has  come: Despite the fact that in his public statements, Kravchuk  demonstrates full confidence in the victory of "his people," the  real situation there is close to panic. One may consider as  indirect confirmation of this the fact that at least five  presidential advisers are registered as candidates for people's  deputy of Ukraine. One could also evaluate this as an attempt by  the president to gain the support of at least a modest circle of  deputies in the new parliament; however, the facts testify that  no aspirants to the vacant adviser's positions are to be found  among the nomenklatura members.    It seems as if the current elections are a matter of life  and  death to the nomenklatura. "What is happening now in Kiev around  the national-democratic forces," says Les Tanyuk, member of the  Rukh leadership, "reminds one of a return to 1989." The  mysterious disappearance of Mikhail Boychishyn, who seriously  impeded Rukh's operational activity, became the beginning of a  total examination of this organization by various interested  institutions. It is well known that the accounts of Rukh's  Ukrainian sponsors have been frozen, and incidents have  multiplied of persecution of Rukh figures on the part of  criminal circles and of unlawful searches of the apartments of  Rukh leaders, especially outside Kiev, where the nomenklatura  still comports itself like a bull in a china shop. Although  there is no information that would make it possible to draw  fairly well-founded conclusions about the beginning of a  single-minded campaign against Rukh, which its leaders insist is  the case, the fact remains that a year ago Rukh did not feel  such forcible pressure.    It seems that Ukraine is gradually turning into a big  Crimea,  with its political terrorism and game-playing during the  election preparations. The nomenklatura really did their  homework and invented a mass of simple and painfully  understandable "double plays," which allowed them to win the  elections before the elections.    If naive Western observers come to the polling stations  after  20 March, then they, aside from the hospitable nomenklatura  receptions, with the obligatory champagne and caviar, will  receive every opportunity to become convinced of how fairly and  in what complete conformity with the law the elections were  being held. The nomenklatura is winning the elections now, not  burdening itself with the invention of subtle and hardly  perceptible mechanisms.    The professional nomenklatura members in Krivoy Rog set up  debates among the candidates without any warning to the voters.  Tuesday, 25 January, an absolutely normal workday, is memorable  to industrial Dneprodzerzhinsk for a rally that was held by the  director of the Azot joint-stock company, Aleksandr Leonidovich  Levchenko, who was running in the 83d Electoral District.  Probably in order to stir up the interest of the future voters,  he conveyed the workers to imeni Garanina Square in four buses,  at the expense of their home enterprise. The free "hooky day"  made everybody very happy.    In Nemirov's Electoral District No. 58, there are five  nomenklatura members competing against one another  simultaneously. One of them is Comrade Kotsyuba, famous  throughout all Ukraine. It is not such a big deal that Oleksandr  Pavlovych has not managed to be president, even--he is a busy  man, these things happen. It is not such a big deal that the  documents for his registration were gathered by people with a  high profile in Nemirov--workers of the local court and bar.  Kotsyuba turned out to be enough of a "heavy hitter" for the  people in Vinnitsa that he was already registered after 26  January, and the presentation of Rukh's local branch to the  court was left with no answer of any kind.    There are enough violations in the capital, as well. In one  of Kiev's electoral districts, the local communist organization  produced an excerpt from its party conference, which "nominated"  candidates for people's deputy. An independent examination of  the home addresses of people who were allegedly present at the  conference established the participation of "dead souls." It  turns out that Communist Party pensioners were making use of the  old discount cards of former CPSU members who had long ago left  Kiev or who had recently died. The popular verbal flourish "a  Communist remains a Communist, even after death" has at last  found its own practical application.    The battle of the nomenklatura clans of the village, rayon,  oblast, and "Kievan" levels is steeped in mutually exclusive  interests. Many members of the nomenklatura, not wishing to  experience happiness in cities of millions, have dashed off to  the modest towns and villages and have been surprised to see  there not only their former colleagues from the parliament, but  also the fact that the local nomenklatura has in fairly serious  fashion been working with the voters through the delivery of  mineral fertilizers and the construction of kindergartens. The  phenomenon where, as in Nemirov, several nomenklatura candidates  are nominated to compete among themselves is a sign not only of  the fact that the local regions enjoy a "promising" reputation  among members of the nomenklatura (remember that among the "sons  of Lieutenant Schmidt," educated Moscow and polar Minusinsk did  not enjoy popularity, while all of the "sons" were ready to  travel to Bobruisk and Vitebsk at once), but also of a more  important circumstance--among the nomenklatura there exists no  single "leading and guiding center." It is not inconceivable,  however, that in a situation of mutual removal of candidacies in  favor of a more successful nomenklatura member and of repeat  elections, such a center, spontaneously or not, would still  emerge. Now it is possible to observe several such  centers--Kravchuk's, Plyushch's, and those of the defense and  agrarian sectors, among whom mutual understanding is not  achievable.    True, the internal conflicts of the nomenklatura are  balanced  out by discord among the democratic candidates.    Meanwhile, the experience of the latest presidential  elections demonstrates that it is impossible to convince the  democrats to cede their single club to a competitor, whereas the  nomenklatura is saved by its instinct for self-preservation.</p>

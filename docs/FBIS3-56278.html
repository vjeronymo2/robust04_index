She  gave an interview following talks between Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, who had met while their presidents conferred  elsewhere in the Kremlin.    According to Sidorova, Kozyrev and Christopher had finalized  four documents for signing "at ministerial level," in particular  agreements on air traffic, on cooperation in health care an  biomedical research, on cooperation in research in radiation  impact on human health and environment and a memorandum of  intent on cooperation in expert control.    She noted that Kozyrev and Christopher would also make a  joint statement on the Middle East.    According to Sidorova, Kozyrev and Christopher also  discussed  the January 14 meeting of the Russian, U.S. and Ukrainian  presidents. "We are confident that this meeting will culminate  in signing documents on the nuclear weapons stationed in  Ukraine. Kozyrev observed, however, that making sure that the  documents are implemented was even more important," Sidorova  said.    She also told Interfax that Kozyrev and Christopher had a  thorough talk on the results of the Brussels NATO summit. "The  Russian foreign minister emphasized that Moscow regarded the  Partnership for Peace program as an invitation for partnership  and tangible cooperation with that organization rather than  staying in its ante-room," Sidorova said.    In her words, the most important item in that program for  Russia was actual cooperation in military exercises and  adjustment of military doctrines. "It would be premature to say  now where this will lead to, whether Russia and other East  European countries will join NATO or NATO and all of us will  become a broader European security organization," the foreign  minister's adviser said.</p>

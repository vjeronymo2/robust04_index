A motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider a decision of the Board pertaining to a matter initially adjudicated by an officer of the Service shall be filed with the officer of the Service having administrative control over the record of proceeding; provided, however, that when a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider is made by the Commissioner or any other duly authorized officer of the Service in proceedings in which the Service has administrative control over the record of proceedings, the record of proceedings in the case and the motion shall be filed directly with the Board. In all cases, the motion shall include proof of service on the opposing party and all attachments. The moving party may only file a brief if it is included with the motion. The opposing party shall have ten days from the date of service of the motion to submit a brief in opposition to the motion, which shall be filed with the Office where the motion was filed, along with proof of service of a copy of the brief on the opposing party. The Board, in its discretion, may extend the time within which such brief is to be submitted. A motion shall be deemed unopposed unless a timely response is made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oral argument. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A request for oral argument, if desired, shall be incorporated in the motion to reopen or reconsider. The Board in its discretion may grant or deny requests for oral argument. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ruling on motion. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Rulings upon motions to reopen or motions to reconsider shall be by written order. If the order directs a reopening and further proceedings are necessary, the record shall be returned to the Office of the Immigration Judge or the officer of the Service having administrative control over the place where the reopened proceedings are to be conducted. If the motion to reconsider is granted, the decision upon such reconsideration shall affirm, modify, or reverse the original decision made in the case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Section 3.3 is revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;3.3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A party affected by a decision who is entitled under this chapter to appeal to the Board shall be given notice of his or her right to appeal. An appeal of a decision of an Immigration Judge shall be taken by filing a Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration Judge (Form EOIR&hyph;26) with the Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding, within the time specified in the governing sections of this chapter. An appeal of a decision of a Service Officer shall be taken by filing a Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of District Director (Form EOIR&hyph;29) with the office of the Service having administrative control over the record of proceeding, within the time specified in the governing sections of this chapter. A notice of appeal of a decision of an Immigration Judge is not considered to be filed until the Form EOIR&hyph;26 is actually received in the appropriate Office of the Immigration Judge and the fee provisions of &sect;3.8 of this part are satisfied. A notice of appeal of a decision of a district director is not considered to be filed until the Form EOIR&hyph;29 is actually received in the appropriate office of the Service and the fee provisions of &sect;3.8 of this part are satisfied. The certification of a case as provided in this part shall not relieve the party affected from compliance with the provisions of this section in the event that he or she is entitled, and desires, to appeal from an initial decision, nor shall it serve to extend the time specified in the applicable parts of this chapter for the taking of an appeal. Departure from the United States of a person in deportation proceedings prior to the taking of an appeal from a decision in his or her case shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Items to be included in the Notice of Appeal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The party taking the appeal must meaningfully identify the reasons for the appeal in the notice of appeal in order to avoid summary dismissal pursuant to &sect;3.1(d)(1&hyph;a)(i) of this part. The statement on the notice of appeal must specifically identify the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, or both, that are being challenged. If a question of law is presented, supporting authority must be cited. If the dispute is over the findings of fact, the specific facts contested must be identified. Where the appeal concerns discretionary relief, the appellant must state whether the alleged error relates to statutory grounds of eligibility or to the exercise of discretion and must identify the specific factual and legal finding or findings that are being challenged. In addition, the statement of the reasons for appeal must be set forth with sufficient clarity and specificity that the Board may address the appeal without first reviewing the record and constructing the arguments. The appellant must also indicate in the notice of appeal whether he or she desires oral argument before the Board and whether he or she will be filing a separate written brief or statement in support of the appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

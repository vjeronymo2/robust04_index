			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 If fiction is passion, non-fiction is more like obsession. A sufferer of the latter sort, I found total release in Eric Hobsbawm's Age of Extremes (Michael Joseph, Pounds 20), a brilliant history of our own century by one of its foremost Marxist intellects. One can disagree with Hobsbawm's judgment that the 75-year struggle between communism and capitalism will be seen as less important than the worldwide technological revolution. One can reject his pessimism. But one cannot escape the shudders of recognition as Hobsbawm describes us, as if he were looking back at us from 200 years away. A millennial milestone. For description more heady than any novel, I choose Under My Skin (HarperCollins, Pounds 20), the first volume of Doris Lessing's autobiography. Her account of childhood - in other hands so often tedious - is objective, subjective and magic. It is as if the child herself were writing with the old woman's pen. A quite different sort of pleasure was Martin Gilbert's In Search of Churchill (HarperCollins, Pounds 20), where the world record-holding biographer takes a day off, as it were, shows us round the factory giving us a colourful sketch of Sir Winston and a quick peep at himself.</p>

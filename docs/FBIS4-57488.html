			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by provisional President Emile </F> Jonassaint by Rothchild Francois, Jr. at the National Palace in  Port-au-Prince on 19 May; simultaneous translation of English  into French and French into English -- recorded]    [Text] [Francois] Attorney Emile Jonassaint, the  provisional president of the Republic, agreed to answer  questions by Haitian and foreign journalists at the National  Palace. Answering a question about the nonexistence of a prime  minister within his government, Mr. Jonassaint, the provisional  president, officially declared that the Constitution has yet [as  heard] been revoked. He pointed out that his cabinet is  responsible to parliament.    Concerning rumors of a invasion as a resolution of the  Haitian crisis, Attorney Emile Jonassaint pointed out that Haiti  cannot struggle against the United States and that a U.S.  military intervention to resolve the crisis would be a crime.    Concerning the embargo, attorney Jonassaint announced that  his government is going to take important measures to manage the  international embargo, which will become a total embargo as of  this weekend. Let us listen to an excerpt of statements by Emile  Jonassaint, who immediately pointed out that there is no  friction between the Army and his government. Answering a  question regarding General Cedras, he pointed out that Gen.  Cedras is commander in chief for three years.    [Begin recording] [Jonassaint] Gen. Cedras was appointed for  three years.    [Francois] Mr. President, resigning Prime Minister Robert  Malval has called on taxpayers to boycott -- if you would -- the  fiscal system. This is a call for fiscal disobedience. How do  you interpret such a statement? Will your government let itself  be pushed around in case the taxpayers refuse to pay taxes?    [Jonassaint] Mr. Malval has already asked all employees to  resist, did he not, but nothing has been done so far. Besides,  did he, himself not say on 7 February when the parliament  convened that as resigning prime minister, he had nothing  further to do with the business of Haiti. If Mr. Malval makes  some mistake or commits some infraction of the law, he will fall  under the provisions of the law.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, do you intend to rule  by decrees? A number of people say you [words indistinct] the  Constitution. How do you intend to rule?    [Jonassaint] The Constitution has not yet been revoked.    [Reporter] Mr. President, your government does not have a  prime minister. Is that constitutional?    [Jonassaint] The prime minister... [pauses] all the  ministers  have the right to go into parliament to defend the projects of  the government even if there is interpellation. The prime  minister is not the only one.    [Reporter] Mr. Malval said that your government is not legal  and that you are not the president.    [Jonassaint] That is his opinion.    [Reporter] It is also the opinion of the international  community. Do you not have a sense of being alone against the  world?    [Jonassaint] Haiti has always been alone, ever since it  became independent. Even those whom Haiti helped to become  independent took sides against Haiti. This is a fact that  everybody knows.    [Reporter] Mr. President, are you concerned that the U.S.  might invade Haiti [words indistinct]?    [Jonassaint] Haiti does not have atomic bombs.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] what would you do and what  will  you do to prevent that?    [Jonassaint] To avoid it? If the United States invaded  Haiti,  it would simply be a crime. [end recording]    That was an excerpt from the news conference held by the  provisional president, Emile Jonassaint. You will receive more  details during the upcoming newscasts.</p>

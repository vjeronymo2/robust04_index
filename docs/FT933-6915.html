			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Ex-Swans workers in mass claim NEARLY 500 former employees of Swan Hunter have lodged claims of unfair dismissal as part of a union campaign to highlight the position of workers made redundant by receivers. The claims have been flooding into the Newcastle industrial tribunal centre since union leaders at the Tyneside shipbuilder wrote last week to more than 700 ex-employees made redundant since the company went into receivership in mid-May. Should the employees' claims succeed they would be unlikely, as unsecured creditors, to receive any additional compensatory pay-offs: a creditors' meeting earlier this month was told by receivers Price Waterhouse that Swan Hunter had total liabilities of Pounds 51m, and realisable assets estimated at Pounds 6.29m. But Swans union leaders hope their move, which follows a similar initiative by Leyland Daf union officials, will raise concern at how receivership can harm employees' redundancy entitlements. Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said: 'Receivership shouldn't put on ice the rights of the individual; they should be sacrosanct.' Swan Hunter's now defunct company severance scheme paid up to Pounds 13,000; employees made redundant by the receivers must apply to the Department of Employment under the state redundancy fund, which pays a maximum of Pounds 6,150. Newcastle industrial tribunals centre said staff had been working extra hours to process the sudden Swan Hunter workload. More Swans claims, under the 1985 Employment Protection Act, are expected. The unions claim the dismissals were unfair because of lack of consultation, lack of right of appeal and lack of information on selection criteria. Price Waterhouse declined to comment.</p>

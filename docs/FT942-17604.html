			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Calor boosted to Pounds 51.5m Calor Group, the dominant supplier of bottled gas in the UK, is increasing its dividends for the first time since it demerged its oil interests in 1988. A final dividend of 6.5p increases the total for 1993 to 12.5p (12p) out of earnings per share which recovered to 19.5p (12p). Pre-tax profits rose by Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 51.5m last year largely because of the absence of Pounds 14.8m of exceptional costs, incurred in 1992, relating mainly to the restructuring of the core gas business, the directors stated. Mr Howard Robinson, chief executive, said the dividend increase reflected the company's strong balance sheet and cash flow. 'We also wanted to restore income for shareholders after the advance corporation tax changes last year.' However, he added that it should not be taken as a signal that dividends would rise 'ever onwards'. The company has cut its costs by more than Pounds 15m a year, reducing its staff by 1,000 to 2,000, in an attempt to stem the long-term decline in its market share. 'In 1993 we used the cost savings to offer better value for money to our customers which reinforced our position as market leader,' said Mr Robinson. Calor cut its prices which stimulated higher sales volumes with little help from the weather or the economy. Group turnover fell nearly 5 per cent to Pounds 295.9m and Calor's own cost of gas rose but, thanks to the restructuring, operating profits from the core gas business were little changed at Pounds 54.4m.</p>

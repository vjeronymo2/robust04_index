			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Developer Speyhawk in deal on debts after Pounds 217m loss SPEYHAWK, the property developer, yesterday underlined the severity of the UK's worst commercial property decline for more than 50 years by announcing a Pounds 216.8m annual loss and the restructuring of more than Pounds 300m in debts. After announcements of refinancing talks by Olympia &amp; York and Heron International, Speyhawk's plight provides a further illustration of a slump which has wiped more than a quarter of the value off commercial property since the market's peak in 1989. Speyhawk, which has debts of Pounds 303m, is technically insolvent as its liabilities exceed its assets by some Pounds 70m. However, its 46 banks, led by Barclays and Citibank, have agreed to restructure its debts and provide it with working capital over four years. Speyhawk's shares fell from 11p to 2 1/2 p, even though City analysts had long expected very heavy losses from the company, which had been talking to its banks since last August. Speyhawk has been particularly severely hit by the property crash since it does not have rental income to cushion it from its interest costs. It relies on selling the properties it builds but has been stymied by the shortage of demand. It has a high exposure to the City of London, which is the worst-hit market in the country, as a result of over-building and the recession in financial services. More than half of the Pounds 205m provisions Speyhawk made against its properties are due to two City buildings, Cannon Bridge and Exchequer Court. Development sites also suffered heavy write-downs to as little as 20 per cent of former values. The problems of companies like Speyhawk stem from the coincidence of recession and an unprecedented amount of new building. The surge resulted from a relaxation of planning controls, demand for technically improved buildings and a large increase in bank lending for commercial property, which rose to a record Pounds 40bn last year. Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman of Speyhawk and president of the British Property Federation, said the experience had been 'chastening'. But he thought there would be no need for further write-downs and the company's properties would increase in value over the next four years. Shareholders will receive information on a planned restructuring of share capital when a final agreement is reached with the banks. 'Shareholders should not expect to receive dividends for some time,' Mr Osborne said. The company said it had 'drastically' reduced its overheads, by cutting its staff from 350 people to 47 people. Turnover fell by 71 per cent from Pounds 262.6m to Pounds 76.4m in the year to September 30 1991. The loss per share was 829.7p, after a loss of 27.8p last year.

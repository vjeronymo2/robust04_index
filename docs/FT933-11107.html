			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Off-licence talks Confirmation that Allied- Lyons is negotiating with Bass to buy its off-licence chain helped both sets of shares to move smartly forward, Allied by 12 to 570p and Bass by 9 to 482p. The move would allow Allied, which owns the 960-outlet Victoria Wine, to merge with Bass's Augustus Barnett chain of 583 shops. Together they would have a turnover of around Pounds 120m, according to analysts. Discussions between the two companies have been continuing for several months, with Bass said to have put Augustus Barnett on the market some 18 months ago. Industry analysts said the asking price had been around Pounds 60m, but many believe the company would settle for nearer Pounds 45m. Whatever the price, such a purchase would create a business to rival Whitbread's Thresher chain, which has more than 1,600 outlets. Augustus Barnett is thought to break even, while Victoria Wine is said to be only marginally profitable. Both have been under growing pressure from the expansion of the take-home trade at supermarkets.</p>

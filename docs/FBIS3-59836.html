He added in an  interview with AL-HAYAH that OPEC could restore Iraq's prewar  quota, which was distributed among other countries, without a  price collapse.    The Omani minister, whose country usually undertakes the  role  of coordinator between OPEC producers and other producers,  criticized countries in the petroleum exporting organization for  blaming the current petroleum price declines on nonmember  countries, describing this as unfair, especially given the  tendency of OPEC's production to rise, and the production of  nonmember countries to decline.    Al-Shanfari, who this week accepted the OPEC  secretary-general's invitation to intervene with countries  outside the organization to support petroleum prices, showed no  eagerness to reduce the production of his country, or that of  other producers outside the organization. He emphasized that  OPEC itself needed "cohesion" and that OPEC itself was capable  of fixing prices.    The Omani minister confirmed the increase in his country's  production this year, to record levels: 800,000 barrels.    The text of the interview follows:    ['Abd-al-Ghani] This month, in which Oman's national day  falls, and in the light of the drop in petroleum prices, it has  been noted that the Sultanate's production and reserves have  risen. What is the volume of the increase? How can it be  reconciled with Oman's pessimistic expectations in the early  1970's?    [Al-Shanfari] I am pleased to give you a complete picture of  our petroleum production, especially since 1974. It was in that  year that the picture of the future of petroleum and gas was  very bleak. At that time, Omani and international experts  expected that Oman would have petroleum in the years to  come--the years we are now living in.    At the time, we had a petroleum reserve of about 1.5 billion  barrels; our daily production was less than 300,000 barrels.  Today, praise God, and with the guidance and support of His  Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id in the petroleum sector, we have  achieved these excellent results. Our production is now 800,000  barrels per day [bpd], of which 80,000 bpd are for local  consumption. We export the rest (720,000 bpd).    Oman's petroleum reserves have more than tripled, nearing 5  billion barrels. We hope soon to add half a billion more barrels  to the reserve, and I may say that the outlook is now bright. We  are still at the beginning of the road, and I believe that we  have great petroleum possibilities.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] More than one OPEC official has said that  the  petroleum market is now experiencing a new price war, and that  the non-OPEC member countries of the region--among them  Oman--are responsible for this deterioration. Do you agree with  this assessment? Or is it your view that the failure of OPEC  states themselves to adhere to the quotas is behind the rise in  supply, and by extension the price collapse?    [Al-Shanfari] There is much to be said about this, but I do  not want to get into blaming anyone in particular. The fact is  that the global economy is in an unstable state. When  development is slow in this economy, it is difficult to expect  the consumption of large quantities of petroleum. Consumption  grows slowly in the Western world--i.e., the industrialized  countries--at a rate of less than 1 percent. Comparing that with  the countries of Asia, we find that there is a large increase in  consumption, and a greater absorptive capacity; average  petroleum consumption rises 10 percent per year, reaching 14  percent in the case of China.    Thus there are many factors involved in the collapse of  petroleum prices, which taken all together do not encourage the  growth of demand for petroleum. It is also true that some  countries boosted their production capacity, such as the North  Sea countries, Norway and Britain, but honestly, I cannot lay  blame on the countries outside OPEC, because the majority are  countries with small production (with the exception of Russia  and the North Sea countries) that do not affect the global  petroleum markets. Going back to the production of producing  countries outside OPEC will fortify this view; we find that  their petroleum production is decreasing. In 1989, their  production was 43 million bpd, and this year it dropped to about  40 million bpd.    In 1988, the OPEC countries' production was 21.8 million  bpd,  and it rose this year to about 26.9 million bpd.    So--there is a reduction in the petroleum production of the  non-OPEC states, and an increase in the petroleum production of  the organization's member states. Thus it would be wrong and  unfair for us to blame the drop in prices on the non-OPEC states.    Here in Oman, as a coordinating state between the OPEC  member  producers and non-OPEC producers, we do not want to lay blame on  specific parties, and we hope that our brothers in OPEC will not  lay blame on the non-OPEC countries. I can give an example in  this context that some members in the exporting organization  directly boosted their production higher than it had been before  the last Gulf war by nearly 40 or 50 percent. Some countries  that had a daily production of 1.5 million barrels before the  crisis have increased it to nearly two million bpd or more.    Another thing. All indications are that many non-OPEC  producers are decreasing production. China, for example, will  this year become an importing country, and India, too, will  bcome an petroleum importer within months or a year at the most.    Among some OPEC member states there is a lack of agreement  or  consensus, but if there were to be cooperation and some good  will among us, then the price situation would improve. Time is  on OPEC's side; this is what I think and understand from my  experience with petroleum-producing countries inside and outside  the organization. I also say that we must not lay blame on one  another. Let us coordinate with one another, because our dispute  is not in the best interests of producing countries. I want  there to be cooperation and mutual understanding among all  producers.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] There are calls to hold a meeting of OPEC  states and nonmember countries to reach an agreement to support  prices based on the OPEC member states' request for a 5 percent  or more drop in production, as has happened before. Would you  agree, at this time, when we are seeing a retreat in petroleum  prices and revenues, to another drop in your production, or will  you price as you did before to convince Russia and other  producers to lower their production?    [Al-Shanfari] We have no problem going along with these  calls, on condition prices are raised. But we believe that  lowering production without prices being raised would be hard  for a country like Russia, which is facing economic hardship, or  China, whose exports do not exceed 100,000 bpd. That leaves  Oman, Mexico, or Egypt. Is it possible to ask Egypt, which has  enormous economic challenges, or us in Oman, whose petroleum  revenues are insufficient to achieve the government's ambitions,  especially as we want to follow in the footsteps of our brothers  in the Gulf, who produce large quantities of petroleum.    We in Oman need petroleum revenues for the basic necessities  of development. How can our brothers, who produce millions of  barrels, ask Oman to reduce its production by 20,000 or 30,000  barrels?    Even so, we have no objection, and are constantly declaring  our readiness to cooperate. But how can we ask a country like  Egypt, in its circumstances, with a population growth of nearly  a million people every year?    This is why we hope the members of OPEC will do their utmost  to cooperate among themselves. If that happens, they might be  able to solve the current petroleum price problem.    Everyone knows that Norway is not prepared to lower its  production. While they might cooperate with us, it is only  verbally. They are always attending the coordination meetings  that OPEC members and nonmembers hold, just to listen to our  points of view. Britain is the same, except that it does not  consent to attend our meetings, because they have their own  circumsatcnes and policy. I reiterate, in spite of that, our  willingness to cooperate, as non-OPEC producers, but it is up to  OPEC to define or fix prices, so there must be greater cohesion  within the organization. Our belief is that even if we did lower  our production, it would not be much of a help to the current  price situation. All the power lies within the organization.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Would you agree with the view that the  chance  of Iraq returning to the petroleum market is one of the major  reasons for the current drop in global petroleum prices?    [Al-Shanfari] Everyone knows that Iraq is a  petroleum-producing country, and Iraq's quota of OPEC production  before the war is known. Iraq's return to the "petroleum  producers' and exporters' club" is something to be taken into  consideration. We in the Sultanate of Oman hope that Iraq will  go back to producing its petroleum. The Iraqi people have  suffered enough. Iraq's quota is known to all, just as Kuwait's  was. Kuwait came back and resumed producing its quota, even  increased it. The Emirates' quota was known, and its current  production is known. Iraq should resume producing, and Iraq's  resumption of production will not mean chaos or disorder in the  global petroleum market. I believe the OPEC countries will allow  Iraq to resume its quota. As to when Iraq will return and what  effect that will have, these matters are hard to predict fully  right now, though our hope is that sanctions will be lifted from  Iraq and it will be able to resume exporting petroleum.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] But what will happen to the market and  prices  in the event OPEC is preventing from granting Iraq its old quota  as soon as the international sanctions are lifted?    [Al-Shanfari] The question of the price collapse might  happen, I believe, if OPEC does not consent to give Iraq its  former quota. Prices would plunge, possibly reaching $10 per  barrel. This would hurt producers. If Iraq is given the quota  that was taken from it, or distributed among some other  countries, I don't think we'll see a collapse of petroleum  prices.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Recently there has been a noticeable  slowdown  in the giant joint ventures Oman had contracted for, for  instance, the construction of an petroleum pipeline from the  Caspian Sea to the Black Sea, or the gas pipeline to India, as  well as the liquid gas project--whose estimated total price tag  is nearly $18 or $19 billion.    [Al-Shanfari] Discussing these projects brings us to the  Sultanate's efforts to diversify its revenue sources at the  local level, into the areas of agriculture, industry, fisheries,  and minerals. We have also begun to diversify these sources  abroad; we have begun to seek out economic projects abroad. We  have actually signed agrements with Russia and Kazakhstan to  build a Black Sea pipeline through Russia. The project is now  ready for implementation. An economic study is now being  prepared, along with the route of the pipeline. We hope that the  study will be adequate, and we will receive it soon. Naturally  we have entered the stage of obtaining of the petroleum  exploration concession in Kazakhstan, and we hope that work will  get under way soon in developing this concession. We have signed  an agreement with the Indian Government to supply the Indian  subcontinent with natural gas from Oman. As the world's second  most populous country, after China, India likewise has a rising  demand for energy, and the same holds true for the other rapidly  developing countries of Asia, such as Vietnam, Taiwan, and  others. The agreement includes the building of a pipeline, and a  study is now being prepared. We hope it will be completed for us  to consider by March/April 1994. The study will definitively  establish the route of the pipeline and its actual cost. We are  negotiating with the Indian Government over the pricing of the  gas, and are working on having the project implemented at the  earliest possible opportunity. We have the strong support of His  Majesty the Sultan in building this pipeline, which will be the  first of its kind in the world--it will be built at a depth of  3,000 meters under the sea.    Economically, it will be a first-class pipeline. It will  allow the planning of other pipelines between the Indian  subcontinent and the Arabian peninsula. We in Oman welcome the  participation and cooperation of our brothers in the region,  should they have the intention. We could work on petroleum  pipelines, because as we have begun with gas we can take on the  building of other pipelines for petroleum.    According to what I have understood from Petroleum Ministry  experts, the main obstacle to this project is technical, in  terms of the means of putting a pipeline 3,000 feet down, but  even this obstacle can be overcome. When the studies are  completed, there will be an international tender for the  construction of the pipeline. There is another project, the  liquified gas complex we are also interested in, which may cost  as much as to $9 billion.    People may wonder how these huge, expensive projects are  funded. So far we have knocked on the doors of international  financiers, because we are still in the study stage, but what I  would like to make clear is that building these projects will  not affect the development process at home. No portion of our  current global investments will be withdrawn; these projects  will be funded through international institutions. I do not  believe Oman will have any difficulty in handling this funding,  because these projects are vital and profitable, and the  Sultanate's economic reputation abroad is excellent, because of  our political stability. Contacts have been made in this regard.  We in the Petroleum Ministry, as well as our brothers in the  Omani Finance Ministry, have received proposals from  international banks and investors, all of whom want to take part  in these projects.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] After your recent visits to China and India,  you announced Omani investments in those two countries'  petroleum industries. What is the nature and scale of the  investments? Will they be in the field of exploration and  extraction, or in petroleum refining?    [Al-Shanfari] On my visit to India, we noticed vast  possibilities in all aspects of work and investment in China. We  are now discussing projects such as obtaining Chinese petroleum  concession regions, building petroleum refineries, and  participating in pipeline construction. We are still at the  negotiation and discussion stage, so right now it is difficult  to say what will be agreed upon. I think we willl be able to get  certain project agreements within about four months.    Turning to foreign investments, we have a project to build  two petroleum refineries in India, and we have also taken a  share in an petroleum refinery in Thailand with Caltex, Inc. We  are thus trying to diversify our income sources, especially  since most of these projects will produce revenues in 10 or 15  years, and at that point will constitute another support for the  Omani economy, which will prevent our continued dependence  solely on petroleum revenues.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do you think that India's recent agreement  with Iran for a natural gas pipeline from Iran to India will  affect the Indian government's commitment to their agreement  with you?    [Al-Shanfari] So far, our agreement is in force, and we are  moving ahead with it. The Indian Government feels that we are  serious about implementing it, and I do not think the Indians  will change their minds. I met with Indian Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao, who asserted his support for the project. Just  last week there were talks with the Indians on the course of the  work. We are now at the stage of implementing what we agreed  upon. We are not speaking of an imaginary project. We hope that  two years from now the Indian subcontnent will have natural gas  from the Arabian peninsula.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Has the Sultanate's petrochemical project,  which will depend on more natural gas energy and discoveries in  the Sultanate, reached the stage of signing an agreement, or is  it still at the preliminary study stage?    [Al-Shanfari] The extent of the natural gas present under  the  Sultanate has begun to become clear. At present we have reached  gas reserves of 20 trillion cubic feet. We have an ambitious  exploration program, and I think there are great possibilities.  I believe continued exploration for gas will make the picture  even clearer. We are able--according to our own experts'  estimates--to double our present gas reserves. We use natural  gas in Oman to provide energy for electric stations. Another  large electrical station will soon be added, in Manah, in the  interior of Oman.    As to the petrochemical complex and other projects, we are  continue to study them, especially as our available gas reserves  are sufficient for the Sultanate's local consumption for more  than 30 years, in addition to covering the liquid gas project's  needs and those of the natural gas pipeline to India.    We believe that within a few months we will add new  quantities of gas. This gas is associated with petroleum  (petroleum liquids) that will be added to our petroleum reserves.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Mou Leng (4188 0397): "Scholar Forecasts </F> Development of Situation in China in 1994, Noting That Slackened  Political Reform Will Drag Out Economic Reform"]    [Text] Lu Jianhua, a doctor of sociology at the Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that the principal  reform factor that affects this year's social situation is  whether political structural reform is suited to the economic  structural reform. If political structural reform still remains  at the level of administrative structure in a general sense,  then it will entail two evil consequences--few results will be  scored in reform (the problem of overstaffing in organs, for  example), and economic structural reform will be held back again.    When interviewed by this reporter, Lu Jianhua pointed out:  Although many factors that affect the trend of the social  situation in 1994 are full of contingencies and uncertainties,  yet the five major factors comprising reform, economic  construction, the political situation, public will and opinion,  and the authority of the central government are the most crucial  ones, which can be forecast and well grasped.    Lu Jianhua, author of the book entitled "The 'Leftist  Scourge' in China" under the pen name of Wen Yu (2429 5124), is  the person who did the actual writing of the blue book "Analysis  and Forecast of China's Social Situation" (1994), and his  article "The Five Major Factors That Affect China's Social  Situation in 1994" has caused strong repercussions among the  personalities in Beijing who are concerned about the current  political situation. People said that this was the "first  article" written by a Chinese academic in recent years which  "made a most pertinent and unique assessment on the situation."  Lu Jianhua further elaborated on the five major factors that  affected China's society this year as follows:    Regarding the political situation, he said: "In 1994, the  transference of central power (i.e., from the second generation  of the leading collective to the third generation of the leading  collective) will enter a crucial period. History proves that in  the variable of the political pattern in contemporary China, the  issue of unity during the period of transference of power is the  most difficult to tackle. Once an obstacle to unity arises, it  will elicit massive personnel changes or even policy reversals,  thus leading to turbulence in the social situation. During this  year, a number of vital social interest relations are urgently  awaiting solution. Without a united and rational central  government, it is impossible to fulfill the above mission, and  inappropriateness of the course of transference of power will  lead to disastrous consequences.  <H5>  Stability Will Be Affected by Commodity Prices </H5>   In this connection, Dr. Lu Jianhua said that at the present  stage, the establishment of checks and balances as well as  compromise mechanisms of power within the central government is  the only choice to maintain unity and rationality and, if the  first step is made in the area of transference of power during  the crucial period, many costs can be avoided. Lu Jianhua  asserted that so far as 1994 is concerned, it is an historic  opportunity to make decisions.    Regarding public will and opinion, they will be another  major  factor affecting the social situation in 1994. Lu Jianhua said:  If reform and economic construction exert excessively heavy  pressure-- on commodity prices in particular--on people's daily  lives in 1994, then the awareness of interest losses caused to  some strata will be sharpened. Last year, peasant income grew  slowly, the income of staff and workers was insecured, and the  declining living standard of retired people was not improved.  All this has added weight to the pressures of living of  considerable numbers of people, which has increased the  possibility of their unexpected response to certain particular  economic policies. He pointed out: In rural areas, the  relationship between cadres and masses has been somewhat tense,  and in urban enterprises there have been contradictions  centering around such issues as income, democratic management,  and others things between managers and staff and workers. A  host of facts indicate that the work style of grass-roots  officials is at the core of the tension between cadres and  masses, and that its adverse impact on the people's will and  opinion is certainly no less than that of the corruption issue.    Regarding the authority of the central government, he  maintained that there will be little possibility this year of  social unrest directly affected by factors of corruption.  However, various kinds of frictions and conflicts triggered by  the declining authority of the central government will be a  hidden peril that will affect social stability. Besides, the  revenue-sharing system will be practiced this year even though  technical conditions have not yet entirely matured. Hence, the  central government should make adequate forecasts of various  possible consequences (including the intensification of local  interests).    Regarding economic construction, although the rapid growth  that has continued for two years has brought vigor and vitality  to the entire society, yet it has been followed by a certain  degree of confusion, disorder, and shortage of supplies, and  various social, economic, and political mechanisms that led to  the overheated economy have not been removed. This means that  the social causes of economic fluctuations will not be  completely eliminated this year, either.    Regarding reform, the institution of a modern enterprise  system and structural reforms in prices, finance, taxation,  investment, and so on, will be the focal points this year and,  at the beginning of carrying out these reforms, a series of  social and economic consequences will emerge, with some of them  on the negative side, toward which a calm attitude is necessary.</p>

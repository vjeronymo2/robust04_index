JANA's local affairs editor has, however, commented on this  matter saying: First of all, Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi is  not a head of state or a prime minister who can take such a  decision; the power in Libya is, in accordance with the Jamahiri  system, in the hands of the people, who exercise legislative,  management, and executive powers through people's congresses and  people's committees.    Second, as far as the reorganization of the General  Federation of Trade and Vocational Unions of the Great  Jamahiriyah is concerned, this was done within the framework of  the restructuring of the General Congress of Trade Unions in a  bid to give fresh momentum and to consolidate trade union  traditions within the framework of the restructuring of the  people's congresses, in order to allow workers, as well as their  own trade union bodies, to evaluate their affairs as well as the  Great Jamahiriyah's foreign and local policies.    Third, the General Federation of Trade and Vocational Unions  has been playing its role at Arab and international levels; it  took part in the meetings of the central council of the  International Federation of Arab Trade Unions in Damascus last  month, and it is currently taking part in the proceedings of the  International Federation of Arab Workers in Tunis.    Fourth, workers in the Great Jamahiriyah, who have been  freed  from wage slavery and the nightmare fear of the employer -- be  it an individual or a state -- as a result of the revolution of  producers of 1979, have become partners in management and  production. Thus, they have achieved more than anybody else,  who might not be able to achieve the same thing for years to  come. [sentence as received]</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Broking unit pushes Salomon into the red Salomon yesterday announced a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 104m, or Dollars 1.13 a share, following another poor performance from its Wall Street securities broking unit, Salomon Brothers. In the same quarter a year ago, the group earned a profit of Dollars 20m, or Dollars 0.01. Salomon warned two weeks ago it would report a big quarterly loss. For the second consecutive quarter, the damage was inflicted by Salomon Brothers, which incurred a pre-tax loss of Dollars 176m. This compared with a modest profit of Dollars 19m in the same quarter a year ago, and took total losses for the first nine months of 1994 to Dollars 547m. The rest of the US securities industry has seen earnings decline this year after the sharp deterioration in trading and underwriting conditions on Wall Street. But Salomon Brothers has suffered more than most, mainly because a large part of its business involves risking its capital in the global financial markets. In the last quarter, the firm is believed to have been hit by losses on its mortgage-backed securities positions, which it has now shrunk to minimise the potential for more trouble.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sheriff shares rise on doubled profits Shares in Sheriff Holdings, the USM-quoted plant hire group, rose 10p to 68p following the announcement of more than doubled pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 and the raising of Pounds 2.85m net by subscription and open offer. Mr Richard Dunn, chairman, said that the result, up from a depressed Pounds 312,000 to Pounds 686,000, was achieved with strong contributions from the core business and acquisitions made during the year. Cash generation reduced gearing from 85 per cent following the acquisition of Abelson in December last year to 48 per cent at the end of the year. To assist further acquisitions, The Causeway Smaller Quoted Companies Fund has subscribed for almost 4m shares at 75p. There is an open offer to shareholders on a 8-for-13 basis. Causeway could have a maximum holding of 38 per cent but the requirement to make a full offer has been waived by the Takeover Panel. Turnover improved 15 per cent to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 9.15m). The pre-tax figure was struck after interest charges of Pounds 312,000 (Pounds 212,000). Earnings per share were 6.7p (3.4p) and a final dividend of 1p is recommended for a total of 2p (1.5p).</p>

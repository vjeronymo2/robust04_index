			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / BBC role and funding reinforced by review The BBC yesterday emerged virtually unscathed from three years of intense government scrutiny. Its structure and its financing by universal licence fee were left intact and its public-service purpose underpinned. The white paper that will form the heart of a new royal charter to run for 10 years from the beginning of 1997 is entitled The Future of the BBC - Serving the Nation, Competing Worldwide. The title sets out explicitly a dual future for the BBC. It is the role the corporation was asking to be allowed to play - as the UK's main public-service broadcaster developing commercial services in the UK and overseas. Although the government believes that the corporation's primary role should remain as a public-service broadcaster to the UK, it equally clearly hopes it will be able 'to evolve into an international multimedia enterprise'. The BBC will retain all its radio and television services although the government wants to see clear objectives set for what those services should be. The corporation can then be assessed on how successfully the objectives have been met. The white paper says: 'The government agrees that the BBC should continue to broadcast a wide range of television and radio programmes which will appeal to all tastes and interests and to people of different ages and backgrounds and living in all parts of the country.' While programmes aimed at minorities were an important part of the BBC's role, the public wanted it to continue producing popular programmes capable of attracting audiences of 10m to 20m and a wide range of radio programmes including popular music. The government would like to see more programmes featuring science and engineering, more programmes reflecting life in the regions of the UK and greater sensitivity in terms of what audiences find acceptable in matters of taste and decency. Until the end of next year - when the current charter runs out - the BBC will be funded by a licence fee linked to the retail prices index. The licence fee will continue at least until the year 2001, when it will be reviewed in the light of changing technology and other developments. To set the licence fee from 1997 to 2001 the government will consider a link with the retail prices index. The government even suggested yesterday that the licence fee could rise in real terms if the BBC could demonstrate that costs over which it had little control - such as sports rights and talent - were rising particularly rapidly. The main barb for the BBC in the white paper was over its transmitters. The government is clearly linking the BBC's hopes of entering the world of digital television - which could greatly increase the number of television channels using terrestrial transmitters - with introducing an element of private finance. The white paper says: 'The government is exploring with the BBC options for the future of its transmission services, taking account of the development of its plans for digital broadcasting.' A study is due to be completed this year and privatisation of the whole or part of the BBC transmitter services will be options. The most remarkable part of the white paper is the high degree of encouragement the government is giving to the BBC to develop commercial television and radio services around the world, using its expertise in World Service Radio and the developing Worldwide Television services. As long as there is no cross-subsidy from the licence fee or the grant that funds the World Service, and as long as there is transparent accounting and fair pricing, the BBC has been liberated to compete in broadcasting markets around the world and in the UK. The new commercial activities should, however, be underpinned by the BBC's longer-term objectives and its values as a public-service broadcaster. To help the process the government plans to repeal legislation preventing the Independent Television Commission and the Radio Authority from 'licensing commercial services which are owned or partly owned by the BBC'. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, said the measure was an enabling one and declined to say whether the BBC would be able to be involved in applying for commercial broadcasting licences in the UK. At the very least the policy should mean that the BBC will be able to aim satellite services at the UK as well as the international market. Because the next 10 years will almost certainly see a period of significant change in demand for media services, the government wants the BBC to keep its options open for further development by building up its commercial activities and expertise, and widening its sources of income. The white paper says: 'It can do this by increasing its international activities, maintaining its capacity for programme-making and contributing to improving the UK's competitiveness in the audio-visual sector in the years ahead.' The white paper also wants a clearer separation of the role of the BBC governors and management. 'The governor's role is to look after the public's interest in the BBC not to manage it,' it says. The government said yesterday that it planned to merge the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the Broadcasting Standards Council, but rejected calls for one authority for all British broadcasting. With the exception of the section on transmitters and some complaints about the BBC's lack of responsiveness to its audience, the degree of consensus is so great that the BBC could almost have written the document itself.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How to serve the nation and compete worldwide  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  - BBC should split public service and commercial activities and evolve into a multimedia enterprise, using opportunites created by new technologies.  - Programmes sales should be expanded, and international services developed in co-operation with private sector  - Public services should remain distinct, financed by the licence fee  - Clear objectives for each service should be published and audience consulted on changes  - Broadcasting Complaints Commission and Broadcasting Standards Council should merge  - Privatisation to be considered among options for injecting private finance into transmission services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Defamation action settled LORD STEVENS, chairman of United Newspapers, yesterday settled a libel action against The Guardian. He accepted a statement from the newspaper that it did not intend to suggest he had concrete evidence about Robert Maxwell's theft of Pounds 300m from the Mirror Group pension fund and had failed to disclose it to regulatory bodies. Mr Geoffrey Shaw QC said in the High Court that Lord Stevens considered that an article in December gave the impression he had contributed to the huge losses suffered by Mirror Group's pensioners. He said the article had stated that regulators would want to question individuals who appeared to have known of Maxwell's misappropriation of funds. It commented that Lord Stevens would be among them. Miss Jane Colston, The Guardian's solicitor, said the article was published in good faith. The newspaper did not intend to suggest that Lord Stevens had failed to disclose concrete evidence about Maxwell's misdeeds.</p>

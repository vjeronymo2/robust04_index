			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian sales were resumed on July 28 and the market indicator moved up just 3 cents to 548 cents a kg., compared with the close at the end of June. Views about probable movements varied as usual, but there were quite a number of traders expecting some sort of increase, perhaps larger than actually occurred. Japan appears to have shown limited interest, with Europe relatively active. Subsequently prices have been firm or barely steady, according to category. With four million bales in the Australian stockpile, disposal rates at present are very low.</p>

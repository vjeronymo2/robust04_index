Under the new rule, both Secretaries cause a document to be published. The provision in the former rule for forwarding a document from one Secretary to the other has been removed because it is part of the Secretary's administrative practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 56, formerly rule 12, provides for the storage, wrapping, handling and access to documents filed with the Secretary, which contain personal, privileged or proprietary information.

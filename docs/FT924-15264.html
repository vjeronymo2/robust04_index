			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Gentle protests at Kuwait election KUWAIT'S first general election since 1985 looked set to draw a turnout of well over 80 per cent yesterday as voters thronged to polling stations in a carnival-like atmosphere marked only by two small and gentle demonstrations by Kuwait's new suffragettes. A heavy police presence, including helicopter patrols, proved unduly cautious as hundreds of Kuwait men lined up outside school halls to cast their votes for the 50-seat National Assembly which will convene at the end of this month. The sole demonstrations, led by two groups of women, each no more than 100-strong, were a largely impromptu affair organised by a small coterie of liberal and well-heeled Kuwaiti women seeking to press further their campaign to win the vote by the next elections in 1996. Sheikh Ahmed Hamoud al-Sabah, the interior minister, commented: 'They were very nice protests, actually.' Full results should be known by noon today and Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister, will tomorrow accept the formal resignation of the present cabinet. Under the 1962 constitution, he must name a new cabinet - which has been seen as an interim body since its appointment in April 1991 - within two weeks of yesterday's poll. Sheikh Hamoud al-Sabah, who was touring the polling stations, said in an interview: 'There will be changes in the cabinet. Under the constitution there must be at least one member from the new National Assembly.' Opposition groups hope the prime minister will include more assembly members in the next 16-member cabinet than hitherto and will be watching the prime minister's appointments as the next true test of the government's democratic resolve. 'The 15 days after the election will be more important than the 15 days before,' said Mr Hamad al Jouan, an independent candidate and one of the government's most active critics in the last parliament.</p>

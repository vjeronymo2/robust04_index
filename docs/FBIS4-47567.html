			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.G. Zhukovskiy, K.S. Lyashenko and A.V. </F> Rakevich, Republic Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology, Ministry  of Health, Belarus; UDC 613.62-084]    [Abstract] There is reason to doubt the accuracy of data on  occupational diseases in Belarus because of the rather random  and irregular screening programs. Available data have shown that  years of exposure to a given factor may be required before frank  pathology can be discerned, and then only if a system of  regularl examinations are scheduled. The screening system in  Belarus has to be improved to discern premorbid states well in  advance of disease onset, which means implementing regular  medical examinations. Once regular screenings have been  implemented, the time of appearance of a premorbid condition may  be regarded as a temporal exposure limit for a given risk  factor. References 15 (Russian).</p>

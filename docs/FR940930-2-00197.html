NPF&hyph;39 and NPF&hyph;85 issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee) for operation of the Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment would extend the snubber functional testing interval from 18-months (+/^ 25%) to 24 months (+/^ 25%), and to increase the sample plan size from 10% to 13.3%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS changes do not require any modifications to plant systems, snubbers, or other plant equipment. The snubber will continue to function as designed to mitigate the effects of earthquakes and other dynamic transients (e.g., main turbine trip). Extending the snubber functional testing interval from 18 months to 24 months ([greater than or equal to] 25%) and increasing the initial sample size from 10% to 13.3%, as proposed, will continue to maintain the same test scope ratio as that which currently exists (i.e. 1.5 yr./interval [at] 10% snubbers/interval and 2 yr./interval [at] 13.3% snubbers/interval results in approximately 100% of all snubbers of a given type being tested within 15 years). The proposed TS change will only affect the interval between functional tests and the initial sample size population. As previously stated, LGS currently uses the 10% plan for compensating struts only, and since there are less than 10 struts per Unit, this proposed change will have a negligible impact on the number of struts in the initial sample size to be tested during a particular interval (i.e., each refueling outage). All systems and equipment important to safety that rely on snubbers will continue to function as designed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS changes do not involve any physical changes to plant systems or equipment. The snubbers will continue to function as designed to mitigate the effects of earthquakes and other dynamic transients (e.g., main turbine trip). Snubbers are not accident initiators, and function to mitigate the effects of an accident. The snubbers will continue to protect piping and equipment during dynamic events. Extending the snubber functional testing interval from 18 months to 24 months ([greater than or equal to] 25%) and increasing the initial sample size from 10% to 13.3%, as proposed, will continue to maintain the same test scope ratio as that which currently exists in the TS. The proposed TS changes will continue to ensure that approximately 100% of the snubbers of a given type are tested within a 15-year period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

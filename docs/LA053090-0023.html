			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELTSIN IS ELECTED RUSSIA PRESIDENT;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: GORBACHEV'S MAVERICK RIVAL HEADS THE NATION'S LARGEST REPUBLIC.  BUT HE PROMISES TO MEET WITH ALL SIDES BEFORE PICKING A GOVERNMENT.  </P> <P> Bolstered by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's opposition, Communist  radical Boris N. Yeltsin finally got what he wanted Tuesday, the presidency of  Russia, by promising the republic's Congress he would consult with all  political points of view before forming a government.  </P> <P> Outside the Kremlin's brick walls, Yeltsin backers cheered and wept with joy at  news of the silver-haired maverick's victory which reportedly came despite a  final appeal from Gorbachev. Their 59-year-old hero, the best-known critic of  Gorbachev's reforms on the political left, beat out the Soviet leader's favored  candidate, Alexander V. Vlasov, the huge republic's prime minister.  </P> <P> It was a clear loss of face for Gorbachev, who had flown out of Moscow earlier  in the day to Ottawa and a two-day visit before going on to his Washington  summit with President Bush. Last week, in a stop-Yeltsin maneuver, Gorbachev  took the floor at the republic's Congress to accuse him of advocating the  breakup of the Soviet Union, but many deputies said the Soviet leader's  criticism only boosted Yeltsin's chances.  </P> <P> Asked on arrival in Ottawa about Yeltsin's victory, Gorbachev said the radical  firebrand had moved closer to mainstream party positions and credited his  election to that shift.  </P> <P> "This is not just a political game he plays," Gorbachev said. "He has had to  adjust his policy very seriously over the past few days, and he has adjusted it  to the better. If he is playing political games, then maybe we are in for  difficult times. We will have to see."  </P> <P> Yeltsin's triumph gives the once-disgraced populist a high-profile post he can  exploit to press his demands for faster, more radical change, and it makes him  the No. 1 government official in the vast expanse of the Russian Federation, by  far the Soviet Union's biggest, richest and most populous republic.  </P> <P> The son of Ural Mountain peasants assumes the presidency -- formally called the  chairmanship of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, or legislature -- as  popular disgruntlement with the meager fruits of Gorbachev's social and  economic reforms reaches a peak and something akin to panic is in the air over  the Kremlin's plan to create a "managed market economy."  </P> <P> In Yeltsin, millions of Soviet citizens will see a savior. But whether the  former construction engineer who has made his political fortune by criticizing  privileges of the powerful and Kremlin policy from the outside can deliver in  his new office remains to be seen.  </P> <P> "I pledge not to spare anything -- health or time -- to do everything to get  out of this crisis and lead Russia to better times," he said from the dais of  the Grand Kremlin Palace after his election was announced.  </P> <P> His booming baritone filling the hall, Yeltsin called his election by the  Congress "the beginning of the road to Russia's social, economic, and spiritual  rebirth, the way out of the crisis and toward the blossoming of Russia."  </P> <P> The broad-shouldered Siberian had been the top vote-getter in two previous  rounds of voting in the Congress, but he had failed to garner the 531 votes, or  one more than half the membership of the 1,060-seat body that were needed for  victory.  </P> <P> On Monday, he was nominated again to face Vlasov and Valentin Tsoi, an ethnic  Korean and a businessman from the city of Khabarovsk in the Soviet Far East. In  the balloting, Yeltsin got 535 votes, or only four more than needed. Vlasov,  who is also a non-voting member of the Politburo, received 467, and Tsoi 11.  </P> <P> In a last-minute tactic that failed, the Communist Party had reinstated Vlasov  as its candidate on Monday, three days after dropping him in favor of a  hard-liner, Ivan K. Polozkov, the party chief from Krasnodar, in southern  Russia.  </P> <P> Yeltsin offered conservatives a share in a future coalition government on  Monday, saying he would hold negotiations with all factions in the Congress on  nominees for prime minister and other key posts. That proposal made the  apparent difference from the previous two rounds of voting.  </P> <P> A "conciliation commission" representing the Parliament's more than 20  organized factions was to meet at 10 a.m. today in the Kremlin's St. George  Hall to begin talks immediately about the formation of the Russian Republic's  new government.  </P> <P> Speaking in Ottawa, Gorbachev noted how divided the Russian Congress became in  its "epic struggle" for a new leader and said that in the face of Russia's  pressing problems, "the most important challenge is to consolidate the efforts  of everyone."  </P> <P> Gorbachev said that the situation caused "concern" among the people because  "Russia is facing very difficult challenges. There is a need for cooperation,  for working together. Instead, there was a confrontation."  </P> <P> Yeltsin was mobbed as he left the Kremlin by several hundred joyful and  misty-eyed well-wishers shouting "Victory! Victory!" He told state-run  television that for Russia he wanted "sovereignty from the bottom to the top .  . . such independence under which Russian laws and the constitution have a  priority over those of the (Soviet) Union."  </P> <P> But the extent of the Russian Federation's powers, like those of Yeltsin  himself, have yet to be precisely defined in the shifting realities of Soviet  politics and Gorbachev's quest to maintain a strong national government while  devolving more powers to local officials. At any rate, the outgoing Russian  president, Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, was an almost invisible figure. No one expects  Yeltsin to follow his example.  </P> <P> With Yeltsin's victory, the sort of relations he will have with Gorbachev, his  former mentor, immediately became a topic of speculation. According to the  independent Interfax news service, Gorbachev renewed his criticisms of Yeltsin  at a meeting attended by secretaries of the party Central Committee and  legislators Monday night, but obviously to little avail.  </P> <P> For his part, Yeltsin vowed to put aside "everything that's personal" in his  relations with Gorbachev, who in 1987 engineered his ouster from the post of  Moscow party boss, to which he had named him two years earlier. The break  between the two men was over Yeltsin's criticisms that the perestroika reforms  designed by Gorbachev were proceeding too slowly.  </P> <P> Whatever his intentions, however, Yeltsin is on record in his autobiography,  "Against the Grain," as calling Gorbachev "my perpetual opponent."  </P> <P> Despite such opposition, Yeltsin staged a stunning political comeback without  parallel in Soviet politics by scoring a landslide victory in elections to the  national Parliament last year, and he easily won a seat in the Russian Congress  of People's Deputies this spring.  </P> <P> Faced with Yeltsin's latest victory, considered a long shot last week when the  nominating process in the Congress began, Soviet officials worked hard to put  the best possible spin on things. Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.  Gerasimov said it could be a boost for Gorbachev's drive for change.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union is a democracy, so we accept what the Russian Parliament has  decided," Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in New York. "It may  be a blessing in disguise. President Gorbachev has his critics from both the  left and the right, and possibly it is better to have the election of a critic  from the left."  </P> <P> And Vitaly Churkin, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's principal  adviser on foreign affairs, said in an interview with NBC television that the  election could strengthen Gorbachev's campaign for economic reforms.  </P> <P> "I think . . . the election of Mr. Yeltsin . . . might actually help Gorbachev  because Gorbachev is for radical reform, and he needs more popular support for  that," Churkin said in Washington, where he is helping to prepare the summit.  "And Mr. Yeltsin has assured people that if elected he is going to cooperate  with Mr. Gorbachev. That might generate more popular support for more radical  economic reform, which President Gorbachev has been advocating."  </P> <P> A Communist Party official, Igor Malashenko, added that Yeltsin, seen by many  Soviet citizens as the solution to the country's woes, would now be viewed as  part of the problem.  </P> <P> "Today, many people blame Gorbachev for problems, and now they have another  person to blame," he said.  </P> <P> In other developments, the Soviet Union's national legislature, which is  heatedly debating the government's proposals for economic reforms, voted down a  request by radical lawmakers to submit Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to a  vote of no-confidence.  </P> <P> Radicals say Ryzhkov's proposals don't go far enough to end the centralized,  bureaucratic restraints on economic activity that have been part of the Soviet  system since the days of Stalin.  </P> <P> Appearing before the Supreme Soviet, Ryzhkov vigorously defended the program,  which will lead to an average doubling in the prices of foodstuffs, now  subsidized by government expenditures of tens of billions of rubles yearly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE QUOTABLE YELTSIN  </P> <P> ON THE NATION -- "(The Soviet Union) now is crumbling under growing  dissatisfaction of the people."  </P> <P> "Although 48 million Soviet citizens are living below the lowest standard of  living, the leaders are indulging in the most unnecessary luxuries."  </P> <P> ON GORBACHEV -- "(He) has lost control of himself and lost political control of  the country."  </P> <P> "While Thatcher rides in a car with two other people, Gorbachev uses a  procession of four luxury cars plus an escort."  </P> <P> ON GOVERNMENT -- "I am not for socialism for socialism's sake. I am for a  government the people respect and for a government that respects the people."  </P> <P> ON RUSSIA -- "It's time the central government stopped biting pieces off  Russia."  </P> <P> ON COMMUNISTS -- "There must be no monopoly of power. Down with the  Communists!"  </P> <P> "The transition to a multi-party system is just a question of time."  </P> <P> ON ETHNIC UNREST -- "It is a mistake to dispatch troops and suppress ethnic  problems by armed force."  </P> <P> ON REFORM -- "Perestroika at present is going round and getting nowhere."  </P></p>

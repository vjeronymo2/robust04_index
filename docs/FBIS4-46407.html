			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Excerpts] Members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committee headed by Knesset member [MK] Ori Or yesterday  toured the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Northern Command and  south Lebanon. [passage omitted]    Senior military sources said despite the fact that no  katyushas have been fired by Hizballah since Friday they are  continuing their activity in the security zone.    The sources say that the terrorists are trying to plant  explosive charges, to attack outposts, and to kidnap soldiers.  The terrorists are also trying to smuggle suicide squads into  the security zone for attacks against IDF and SLA [South  Lebanese Army] forces.    "We are convinced that Hizballah will try to carry out a  spectacular attack in retaliation for the Air Force attack,"  said a senior Northern Command source.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Strike threat heightens turmoil in pulp market Unions at three British Columbian pulp and paper mills owned by Fletcher Challenge Canada have threatened to strike from tomorrow after withdrawing from mediation on a new labour contract. The spectre of a strike is one of several developments that have thrown world pulp and paper markets into a near-frenzy. Further price increases for pulp and various grades of paper appear to be in the offing. Some North American newsprint producers are rumoured to be considering another price increase in addition to the 9 per cent rise scheduled for March. Prices for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp are due to rise by USDollars 50 to Dollars 750 a tonne on January 1. Another increase early in the New Year would come as no surprise. Mr Rodney Young, president of Resource Information Systems, a US consultancy, predicted yesterday that the first half of 1995 would see 'a very, very strong market for pulp and paper in general'. However, analysts expect that markets will cool later in the year, as US economic growth slows and new pulp and paper capacity comes on stream, especially in Indonesia and North America. Factors pushing up demand include strong consumption in south-east Asia, and moves by European and North American paper users to build up stocks. Besides the strike threat in BC, markets have also been unsettled by protracted labour negotiations in the Finnish forestry industry. Finnish employers and unions are scheduled to meet again tomorrow to try to settle their differences. Views differ on whether either the BC or Finnish labour disputes will result in a sustained disruption of supplies. Fletcher Challenge said yesterday that progress had been made in its talks but the two sides remained divided on some key issues, including employer demands for more flexible work practices and contracting-out of work to non-union labour. The pattern set by Fletcher Challenge is likely to be followed by other BC pulp and paper producers.</p>

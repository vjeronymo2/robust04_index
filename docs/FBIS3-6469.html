			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Son Song-pil, ambassador of our country to Russia,  on 14 March held a news conference in connection with the  ongoing North-South working-level contact for the exchange of  top-level envoys.    Present at the news conference were reporters of the Russian  papers PATRIOT and (WETCHERAN,) and the Russian radio  broadcasting network.    The ambassador spoke at the conference. The ambassador  pointed out that thanks to our side's sincere effort, the  North-South working-level contact for the exchange of top-level  special envoys, which was suspended in October last year, was  resumed and that our side proposed last year the exchange of  North-South top-level special envoys and made every possible  effort to realize the exchange at an early date.    He said: During the current contact, our side put forward  four-point proposals that the large-scale nuclear war exercises  be suspended; the so-called the international cooperative  system, which is intended to harm fellow countrymen on a pretext  of so-called the nuclear issue, be discarded; the introduction  of Patriot missiles into South Korean be suspended; and the  remarks by the person in authority in South Korea that he cannot  shake hands with a dialogue partner should be canceled. This  proceeded from a sincere position to create an atmosphere of  trust between the North and the South and to smoothly resolve  the issue of exchanging the special envoys.    Nevertheless, the South side, from the outset, evaded  expression of its attitude toward the principled demands put  forward by our side. The South side repeated its previous claims  that our just demands are issues and preconditions not related  to talks in an attempt to justify its erroneous position on  dialogue, thus laying a barrier to the working-level contact.    This illustrates that the South side has no intention to  exchange top-level special envoys with us. The South Korean  authorities even made presumptuous remarks that although the  working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys began,  they cannot take an optimistic view on North-South relations,  the United States will not hold a third round of DPRK-U.S. talks  before special envoys are exchanged, and so forth.    By doing this, they revealed their vicious intention to put  the brake on DPRK-U.S. talks, to block a solution to the nuclear  problem on the Korean peninsula, and to harm fellow countrymen  together with outside forces while continually pursuing  North-South confrontation.    The four-point simultaneous action steps for a package  solution of the nuclear problem, which was agreed upon during  DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, have not assumed any  precondition. However, the South Korean authorities made unjust  assertions that the suspension of the Team Spirit joint military  exercise and holding of a third round of DPRK-U.S. talks assume  the exchange of North-South special envoys and inspection by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] as preconditions. The  purpose of their unjust demand is to rupture [patan] the  DPRK-U.S. talks by taking part in discussion of the nuclear  problem on the Korean peninsula.    As has been known to the entire world, the nuclear problem  on  the Korean peninsula is the question that should be resolved  between us and the United States.    The South Korean authorities have neither authority nor  qualification to participate in this. They have nothing to do  with the issue.    The third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, when they are held, will  be an important occasion for a solution to the nuclear problem  on the Korean peninsula, and the pending issues between the  North and the South will be resolved easily.    Therefore, the most important issue is to sincerely fulfill  the agreement made in DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, and to  realize DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date.    If the South Korean authorities are interested in resolving  the pending issues between the North and the South in a manner  of dialogue and negotiation by realizing the exchange of special  envoys, they should discard the attitude of confrontation  denying dialogue, instead of laying barrier to dialogue by  raising unjust conditions, and should come to contact for the  exchange of North- South special envoys with sincere attitude  without any precondition.    Success in dialogue totally depends on the position and  attitude of the South side.    Following this, the ambassador answered reporters'  questions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Abu-Sirhan: "The Gap"] </F>   [Text] Two events attracted the attention of the Iraqis  over the past two weeks. The people expressed pride in these  two events and talked about them in their private discussions.  The first of these events is the leader president's meeting  with the Armed Forces command members and his explanation of  events in the Mother of Battles, and the second is his  excellency's speech on the third anniversary of the great  confrontation.    After the speech was carried on the TV screen the evening of  16 January, the dollar prices rose to 160 dinars [D]. The  dollar prices continued to rise against the dinar over the past  two days, reaching D169 at 1400 on 19 January, and up to D171 by  the end of that day.    This shows that our enemy, which has not been able to wrench  anything from us and failed to realize a clear military victory  or a historical triumph, as the leader president said, has made  some gains in the arena of the economic battle. Therefore, we  have retreated a step. This shows that there is always a gap  between the leader and his way of thinking on the one hand and  the implementing tools on the other. The following facts  explain this:    When the new cabinet took office and made a number of  decisions, the dollar price jumped from D68 to D80. Later, the  dollar jumped to D150, dropped to D130, and continued to range  between D130 and D135. Now it stands at D171. The real danger  is that while in the past decisions reflected various aspects,  they now reflect only the political aspect in isolation from  other aspects because our departments commit mistakes in dealing  with the blockade and the continuous pressure from abroad.  Political decisions now are associated with economic facts that  are not in harmony with them. They do not go hand in hand to  realize their target. This prompts us to deal with this issue  seriously, with extreme precision, and with an academic  intelligence [dhaka' akadimi] coupled with the actual  conditions. Why?    The UN Security Council statements say: "Two months have  elapsed since the Security Council issued its resolution on  long-term monitoring of Iraq. Twelve months must pass in order  to ascertain Iraq's goodwill and be able to discuss or lift the  embargo."    The statements of the French have become so ugly, exactly  like their treatment of strangers in their land. Their  statements are like their behavior and the behavior of their  president, Mitterrand the supercilious, who is completely  connected with the morals and behavior of those who ruled the  Fourth Republic.    Let us consider the following: In the past, when the dollar  was exchanged for D30, we made our observations in a newspaper  column. When it reached D60, we held a discussion, which did  not last more than 15 minutes, to express observations and point  out the negative aspects of the rising dollar prices. When the  dollar price exceeded D100, we held a one and a half hour  discussion to make some observations. If we want to discuss the  current conditions, we will have to spend no less than two or  three hours in order to propose solutions. This means that those  who are responsible for implementing decisions do not benefit  from these observations. Their work is confused. This is proved  by the fact that after every meeting of the ministerial  committee charged with the economic conditions, the dinar slumps  further and further.    Therefore, we suggest that each ministerial portfolio be  dealt with in accordance with its achievements. And this is  directly connected with the dinar and dollar prices, because  this issue is casting a dark shadow and is affecting the daily  life of the citizen. Therefore, the following yardstick should  be the slogan: A rise in the dollar price means failure and a  drop means success.    The proof that there is a difference between the source of  the decisions, which is the comrade leader, and the mode of  thinking of the implementers is that his treatment of the rise  in the dollar was quick and had a clear effect on the life of  the citizen; namely, increasing the citizens provisions. This  method is much better than economic measures that could have  been taken and whose results would only appear in the long run  without the citizen feeling them because of the rise in the  dollar exchange rate.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Nigeria opens the door for S Africa WHEN ONE Nigerian newspaper recently hailed South Africa's world cup cricketers as 'Champions for Africa', it became clear that decades of hostility between two of the continent's regional powers had come to an end. Tomorrow South African President F W de Klerk will begin a two-day official visit to Nigeria, the first ever paid by a South African leader to the country which has proved apartheid's staunchest opponent in Africa. At the United Nations and within the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), Nigeria long pushed for the total isolation of the Pretoria government. But Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida, the current chairman of the OAU, was among the first African leaders to recognise - privately - the immense changes taking place in South Africa. For months, he is understood to have been keen to invite Mr de Klerk for a visit. Last month's referendum in South Africa, in which whites finally rejected apartheid, gave him the excuse he needed to set a date. Loud protestations from the African National Congress, which insists sanctions be maintained against Pretoria until a multiracial interim government is set up, did not deter him. The visit marks South Africa's final reconciliation with the rest of Africa, from which it has been so long estranged. No African door can remain closed to Mr de Klerk, now that Nigeria has welcomed him back. And South African officials are hoping that the visit will pave the way for membership of the OAU and the African Development Bank (though not before an interim government is set up in South Africa). It seems likely that Pretoria will soon establish a trade mission in Nigeria, though full diplomatic relations may take longer to achieve. Much will depend on the success of the visit, during which Gen Babangida will host a state banquet for Mr de Klerk at Abuja, the new Nigerian capital. Yesterday Nigeria's neighbour, the Ivory Coast, which maintained contact with Pretoria throughout the sanctions period, agreed to establish full diplomatic ties at ambassadorial level. But Pretoria's keenness to establish good relations with the countries of Africa - especially with Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation - stems more from economic need than political will. Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister, has a vision of the continent's four regional powers - Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya  - dragging Africa out of the economic mire by working together. And bilaterally, Pretoria is obviously looking to Nigeria as an export market. The heads of South Africa's three largest business organisations, the South African Foreign Trade Organisation, the South African Chamber of Business and the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, will accompany him on his visit. Trade officials are focusing on South African exports to Nigeria, especially steel, industrial chemicals and transport equipment, with South African companies also likely to be involved in projects to improve Nigeria's road and rail infrastructure (possibly with the help of multilateral aid funds), and mineral exploration.</p>

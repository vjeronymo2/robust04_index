			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / EC ministers focus on growth prospects EC FINANCE ministers last night opened a two-day informal meeting expected to focus on prospects for growth to tackle Europe's unemployment problem and tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism. The Danish presidency of the EC is hoping the tax cuts unveiled after this week's successful referendum on Maastricht will galvanise other member states to follow suit. The aim is to create momentum for an EC growth package ahead of next month's summit in Copenhagen. Ministers will also discuss a report on last September's ERM crisis which led to the withdrawal of the British pound and the Italian lira. But the report, by the EC's monetary committee of senior treasury officials and central bankers, does not recommend substantial changes. The UK declared this week it would not rejoin the ERM in the near future and stuck to its argument that there are fundamental 'fault-lines' in the system which act to the detriment of weaker currencies. Yet EC and British officials say the UK has not put forward proposals to change operation of the ERM, mainly because it does not wish to offend France and Germany. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, is likely to be questioned about his call for revision of 'convergence criteria' for monetary union if recession continues.</p>

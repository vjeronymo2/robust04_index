			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 Kyodo -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  pledged Friday [17 June] to take the leading role in drawing up  full-scale, trade-related, deregulatory measures in line with  the recent proposal by a government panel, an official at the  Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said.    A set of market-opening measures recommended by the Office  of  Trade and Investmeent Ombudsman (OTO), an organ of the EPA, will  form a major pillar of the government's comprehensive  deregulation package to be released at the end of June, Hata was  quoted as saying.    Hata expressed his resolve for deregulation during a meeting  with members of the Market Access Ombudsman Council, a unit of  the OTO, the EPA official told a press conference.    On May 13, the OTO presented a set of recommendations to  Hata  calling for the relaxing of excessive government control in 21  areas.    Yoshio Okawara, Foreign Ministry adviser, who chairs the  ombudsman council, said the OTO is designed to detect potential  trade complaints and cope with them in a manner that would not  cause friction with other countries, according to the EPA  official.    By fully carrying out the recommended measures, Japan can  demonstrate to the rest of the world that the country is serious  about promoting deregulation, Okawara was quoted as saying.    The 21 irksome rules cited by the OTO range from extremely  difficult driving license tests for large motorcycles and  complex auto inspection and safety standards to strict labeling  rules for textile products, excessive control on dairy, health  and medical products, and rules on wheelchairs.    The OTO will shortly hold a meeting so that steps to address  these complaints will be worked out by the end of this month,  Hata said.    Okawara asked the government to reinforce the function of  the  OTO to help it cope with various complaints more effectively,  including expanded manpower at its secretariat, the EPA official  said.    The OTO was upgraded to a ministerial level under the  previous government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which  made deregulation a major policy goal.</p>

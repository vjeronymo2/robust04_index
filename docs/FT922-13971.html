			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock stresses reconstruction MR NEIL KINNOCK, Labour leader, last night made an eve-of-poll appeal to the electorate to reject a 'Tory future of insecurity, rundown and division' and to allow a Labour government to build a Britain capable of becoming a 'pacemaker in Europe'. With hours to go before polling started, Mr Kinnock told a rally in Barry, South Wales, that Britain wanted a government that pulled the country together and pushed it to greater achievements. He said the election would not be won as a result of three weeks' campaigning but because of the government's long record of 'failure and fracture'. The Tories could not escape a past of complacency about the state of the economy and 'contempt for the very idea of society'. The Labour leader said: 'The Tories cannot escape their own record. Tomorrow they will not escape the verdict of the people. People want to be rid of them.' Mr Kinnock said his government would immediately begin the task of getting Britain out of recession. The need for action to reconstruct its industries, sciences and skills was urgent, with only eight months to go before the nation was forced to compete in the world's biggest single market. He highlighted Labour's programme for increased investment in education and in the National Health Service, and said a priority for Labour would be the building and repairing of homes so that families did not have to suffer 'the misery and insecurity of bad housing, overcrowding and homelessness'. Mr Kinnock accused the government of concentrating power in its hands and of becoming 'frenzied with deregulation in standards of safety and probity'. They had been hyperactive in cutting top tax rates and slicing bottom-rate benefits. Their failure to build up the economy and invest in the nation's future had been a matter of conviction and doctrine, a belief in leaving the future to chance. Mr Kinnock said that Labour pledged to 'make the break' with the Tory years and to build industrial success and civilised standards. The task could not be accomplished overnight, and he was not promising miracles. By the end of this century he wanted Britain to celebrate the millennium with something better than a big New Year's Eve party. He wanted to put Britain 'back in the lead where it belonged'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ORVR controls have been under consideration by EPA since the CAAAs of 1977. The public process, which first began in 1978, has proceeded through various stages over the past 15 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the provisions of section 202(a)(6) of the 1977 CAAAs, EPA initiated a public process in 1978 to receive comments on the feasibility and desirability of implementing ORVR controls. In 1980, EPA published a technical report which tentatively concluded that ORVR controls were feasible for LDVs. However, no action was taken at the time due to concerns over economic difficulties in the auto industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA reinstituted its assessment of ORVR controls in 1983 as part of a broad assessment of the strategies available to control emissions in the gasoline marketing industry. As part of this study, in August 1984, EPA published an extensive analysis of the options available to control refueling emissions including ORVR controls. Supporting documentation for this analysis are in public docket A&hyph;84&hyph;07, along with the public comments received on the ``Gasoline Marketing Study''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After receiving comments on the study, EPA prepared an in-depth analysis of the comments, developed further work on several key issues related to ORVR controls, and conducted enhanced assessments of the options under consideration. This resulted in a draft Regulatory Impact Analysis, Response to Public Comments, and related analysis and documentation related to ORVR controls. This information is also in public docket A&hyph;84&hyph;07. A public meeting regarding the ORVR test procedure was also held during this time frame.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of EPA's study of emission control options for the gasoline marketing industry culminated in an August 1987 proposal to require ORVR controls on gasoline-powered LDVs, LDTs, and HDVs. A public hearing was held in October 1987 and the comment period closed in February 1988. Information supporting the NPRM and comments on the proposal are in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11. However, due initially to safety concerns raised by some commenters and later to pending revisions to the CAA, EPA deferred action on finalizing the ORVR rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 CAAAs contained provisions requiring an integrated program of LDV ORVR and Stage II controls. In response to the ORVR provisions, on September 3, 1991 (56 FR 43682), EPA published a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice seeking further comment on the NPRM and the safety issues related to ORVR controls including a safety assessment prepared by the DoT. A public hearing was held to receive comment on these issues on September 26, 27, 1991. The comment period closed in late October 1991. These comments and related materials are in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11. On April 15, 1992, EPA published a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (57 FR 13220) announcing its decision not to proceed with implementing ORVR controls at that time, based on safety concerns raised by DoT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequently, a panel of the DC Circuit overturned EPA's 1992 action. EPA then published another  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (May 27, 1993, 58 FR 30731) raising issues for public comment and allowing approximately 90 days for comment. Another public hearing seeking comment on the NPRM and other changed circumstances was also held. This hearing was held on July 22, 1993 and comments closed 30 days later. These comments are in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11 as are EPA materials in support of the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the years in which ORVR has been under consideration, there have been at least five formal opportunities for oral and/or written public comment. In addition, numerous other public interactions have occurred on this matter and have been documented and placed in the docket for public review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the fifteen years of the ORVR public process, EPA has received hundreds of written comments regarding this requirement. However, many of the past comments have essentially been addressed by changed circumstances or other developments. Major issues such as fuel volatility and improved vehicle evaporative emission controls have now been decided by regulation, and the control of refueling emissions using Stage II equipment was addressed by the 1990 CAAAs. Also, many previous comments in areas such as ORVR costs and test procedures were factored into subsequent analyses and notices, making only the most recent set of comments applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public docket contains a Summary and Analysis of Comments document which addresses still-relevant issues raised by the commenters. It generally does not address past comments on issues which have been resolved by related statutory or regulatory action or through subsequent published analyses or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices. Also, it does not address comments which were received at one point but later negated by subsequent comments due to further developments and changed circumstances. The Summary and Analysis of Comments focuses primarily on comments received in response to the June 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice and unresolved comments from both the August 1987 NPRM and September 1991  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

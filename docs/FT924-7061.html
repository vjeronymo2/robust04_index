			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Tabacalera drops 16% to Pta16.23bn TABACALERA, the Spanish tobacco monopoly 52 per cent controlled by the state, yesterday announced a 16 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the first nine months of this year to Pta16.23bn (Dollars 142.7m). The profits setback is an embarrassment to the government as its sets out legislation in preparation for the privatisation of Tabacalera, scheduled for next year. The nine-month figures, which Tabacalera blamed on a large dividend paid last year by a joint venture it operates with Philip Morris, the US tobacco company, makes it unlikely the group will finish the year with the 15 per cent profit increase forecast by the company. While nine-month profits at Tabacalera grew just 0.39 per cent, sales advanced by 6.2 per cent to Pta492.2bn. Last Friday, the Spanish finance ministry proposed changing the law that obliges the state to own more than 50 per cent of Tabacalera. The eventual flotation is likely to form part of a string of partial privatisations next year as Madrid tries to cut its budget deficits. The government has still not decided how much of Tabacalera to offer through the stock market.</p>

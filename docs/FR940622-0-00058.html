The HCFA regional office will determine whether there is an advantage to conducting an unscheduled survey. We note, however, that when continued monitoring is appropriate to assure that corrective action has been taken, we will inform the provider of the period for which monitoring will continue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believes that all violations, whether or not ``knowing and willful, or negligent'', should be subject to penalty. Another thought termination should only apply to knowing violations, as with civil monetary penalties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As we previously indicated, section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90 deleted section 1867(d)(1) of the Act, which provided for termination or suspension of a hospital's Medicare provider agreement for ``knowingly and willfully, or negligently'' failing to meet these statutory requirements. However, section 1866(a)(1)(I)(i) of the Act was also amended to require hospitals to meet the provisions of section 1867 in order to participate in the Medicare program. We have, therefore, revised &sect;489.24(f) of this regulation to delete the requirement that a hospital must knowingly and willfully, or negligently, fail to meet the regulation's requirements to be subject to termination. It should also be noted that because of the deletion of section 1867(d)(1) of the Act, hospitals are no longer subject to suspension of their provider agreement based upon violation of these provisions. By requiring that all hospitals comply with the provisions of section 1867 of the Act, Congress indicated that section 1867 violations by hospitals could result in termination of a hospital's Medicare provider agreement and civil monetary penalties. In addition, as discussed below, civil monetary penalties may now be imposed for a negligent, rather than a knowing, violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters suggested that the term ``knowingly'' be defined to include ``should have known'' to prevent physicians from escaping liability because the physician did not know of the law or the physician failed to inquire thoroughly about the patient's condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The language of the statute does not permit us to adopt the commenter's suggestion. ``Knowingly'' is a legal term with a well-developed history. The accepted meaning of the term does not include ``should have known.'' Indeed, the latter term denotes a lack of knowledge and is used in those contexts where a person is held liable for not knowing what he or she would have known had he or she exercised due care. A person need not know the terms of the statute in order to commit a knowing violation of the statute. A knowing violation of the statute requires only that the person do a proscribed act, knowing the character of the proscribed act. In this context, for example, a physician would knowingly violate the statute if he or she certified that the transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition that had not been stabilized was in the best interests of the patient if the physician knew that the patient had an emergency condition that had not been stabilized and that the risks of transfer outweighed the benefits the physician could reasonably expect by the delivery of appropriate care in the receiving hospital. The physician would not need to know that section 1867 of the Act prohibited such transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the term ``knowingly'' does not encompass ``should have known,'' it does embrace the concepts of ``reckless disregard'' and ``deliberate ignorance.'' That is, it includes a form of constructive knowledge in which an individual is deemed to have actual knowledge of the facts and circumstances about which he or she would have had knowledge if the individual had not deliberately or recklessly disregarded facts that were readily available. We are amending &sect;1003.102(c) to make it clear that the term ``knowingly'' encompasses these two concepts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

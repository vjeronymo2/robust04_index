In such a case, an applicant's performance on both types of contracts will be reviewed to determine whether the firm has an overall successful performance record. If, however, the applicant has performed only government contracts or only private sector contracts, the applicant's performance on those contracts alone will be reviewed to determine whether the applicant possesses a record of successful performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7.

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Denmark sees surge in Maastricht support DENMARK appears likely to back the Maastricht treaty on European union by a comfortable majority when it votes tomorrow in the country's binding referendum on the subject. All the opinion polls published at the weekend suggest there has been a surge in support of voting Yes to Maastricht. What had looked in the middle of last week to be a tight result appears to be turning into an easy victory for the pro-union forces. A Gallup poll yesterday showed 44 per cent in favour, 35 against and 13 per cent not knowing. However, among those who had decided to vote, 56 per cent said they were in favour of the Maastricht treaty and 44 per cent against. A survey by the Sonar organisation showed 49 per cent for and 40 per cent against. Mr Poul Schluter, Denmark's prime minister, said he was confident that up to 60 per cent would back the treaty after a very large voter turn-out. If the opinion polls prove accurate, the rest of the European Community will be relieved that the Danish referendum did not lead to a constitutional crisis for the EC. Observers believe the main cause of the rapid rise in the Yes vote stems from the sustained effort (after a late start) by the Danish labour movement in campaigning for the Maastricht treaty. Both the opposition Social Democrats and the trade unions have warned their supporters not to vote No because that would threaten up to 150,000 jobs, jeopardise Denmark's Dkr40bn (Pounds 3.5bn) exports to the EC and undermine the economy. Against this bombardment the anti-Maastricht coalition - made up of environmentalists, women's groups, far-left parties and ultra-nationalists - has found it difficult to respond effectively. Many Danish women remain fearful, however, that a more integrated Europe will become less socially responsive. For all the doubts and worries, though, most Danes seem to recognise that their prosperity is closely dependent on their country's integration to the EC's single market. With large balance of payments and trade surpluses, low inflation and the highest per capita industrial production in the EC, Denmark already fulfils all the stringent conditions laid down for the transition to the final stage of European monetary union. However, the Danes remain awkward Europeans and Mr Schluter was keen to play down yesterday any suggestion that a Yes vote tomorrow would mean a Danish endorsement for a federal EC. 'There will never be a united states of Europe,' he asserted. 'The federalists have lost the battle.' The prime minister added that, while Denmark would certainly give up some of its 'formal' sovereignty, it would gain 'real' sovereignty by being one of the EC decision-makers, with the larger European states.

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Personal View: Struggle to fly solo Dan-Air's search for a partner is further evidence of the difficulty faced by medium-sized airlines attempting to survive as independent entities in a deregulated European scheduled market. There are now only four truly independent scheduled operators of jet aircraft remaining in western Europe, aside from those in Scandinavia; Meridiana, Portugalia, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic. Of these, Ryanair almost certainly owes its continuing existence to intervention by the Irish government to prevent Aer Lingus from directly competing on a number of its main routes. The belief that liberalisation would present charter carriers with an opportunity to access scheduled markets previously denied them has proved overly optimistic. The problems faced by Dan-Air in building a European network of scheduled routes from Gatwick in the wake of Air Europe's demise provides another illustration of this. Preventing competitors acquiring medium-sized scheduled airlines based in one's home territory is a vital part of the defensive strategy of several top European flag carriers. Access to airports with limited 'slots' has been a particular focus of attention in this regard. For instance, British Caledonian Airlines' threat to British Airways was not great while BCal was independent; but had BCal's valuable assets been acquired by a powerful rival, then the new entity would certainly have posed a problem to BA. The 'tying in' of locally-based small and medium-sized scheduled airlines has been a tactic employed by many western European flag carriers. Air France, for example, has contracted smaller carriers to operate services on its behalf. Brit Air and TAT, two French regional airlines, have been two beneficiaries of this policy over the past decade. More recently, there has been an increasing trend for a carrier to become a part-owner of a smaller airline, in some instances even acquiring total ownership. In any event, the European Commission's insistence that Air France divest itself of several international and domestic routes and its shareholding in TAT in order for it to gain EC approval to acquire UTA, has hardly resulted in a rapid upsurge in competition. In such circumstances 'biting the hand that feeds you' would hardly seem a sensible course of action. Directly challenging the flag carrier may not appear a particularly attractive proposition, especially if a complementary role is on offer. The deregulation of the US domestic airline market in the 1980s led to a more competitive industry. Substantial gains in efficiency followed with competition forcing the former trunk carriers to reorganise and reduce their operating costs. Average fares fell in real terms and demand for airline services doubled over a decade. Today, these competitive pressures have not abated, being artificially sustained by bankruptcy legislation that has enabled several financially troubled carriers to survive. While consumers have benefited from lower fares, the outcome for carriers in what has been a protracted economic downturn has been massive financial losses. If global consolidation is allowed to continue then it is conceivable that the industry will ultimately be controlled by a dozen consortia. In such circumstances competition is likely to be more controlled than during the hysteria of recent years. While much of the competitive pressure experienced by the US airline industry has largely been the result of the entry of new carriers the real innovators have been the larger existing carriers. These companies - transformed into lean and efficient marketing-led giants - have demonstrated considerable skill and imagination in attracting more customers and boosting revenue. Despite this transformation, the industry has yet to achieve the rates of return on invested capital that are typical of other industrial and service sectors, though shareholders and management expect this gap to narrow. In the longer term competition from a comparatively small number of global players will be sufficient to keep the airline industry lean and efficient. While this seems a reasonable assertion, it is expectations about the extent and nature of the competition that are of more crucial concern. An important benchmark will be provided by the financial returns in other sectors. As a consequence, airline shareholders are likely to gain a greater share of the benefits of the improved efficiency that results from deregulation; further cuts in average real fares would appear unlikely. Old-style cartels are unlikely to return, but in certain respects the degree of control that surviving consortia will be able to exert will give such an impression. Choice will exist, but governments may need to tackle regulation on a global scale if consumer interests are accorded too low a priority by a more mature airline industry.

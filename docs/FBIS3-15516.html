"Ruslan Khasbulatov is a figure who has some real weight in  the Russian political scene, and it is hardly possible that he  will join any of the criminal elements," Dudayev told Interfax.    The president said there was today no opposition in  Chechnya.  There are only "ordinary groups of bandits, who seek to take  control of the situation under the pretense of carrying on a  political struggle," he said. The republic's State Department  has listed 30 opposition leaders to be arrested.    Dudayev said his government knew nothing about any attempts  of the opposition to draw Khasbulatov, who is at present living  with his mother in the village of Tolstoy-Yurt, into their ranks.    Asked about the possibility of cooperation between  Chechnya's  leadership and Khasbulatov, who was arrested last October as one  of the organizers of the hardline revolt in Moscow, the  president said: "We are not in a position to say anything about  that, because it is Khasbulatov's private matter."</p>

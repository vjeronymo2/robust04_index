			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / MPs plot committee coup The row over Commons business was threatening to intensify last night, with Conservative MPs on an influential select committee vowing to proceed with a coup against the body's Labour chairman. Tory members of the Commons trade and industry committee met to decide how to proceed when the committee gathers this morning. One of them, Mr Keith Hampson, MP for Leeds North West, said yesterday: 'We have every intention of proceeding with a motion of no confidence (against Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's chairman) until such time as the Labour whips agree it is essential to the proper functioning of select committees that we should pair.' Last night's meeting came as Sir Terence Higgins, the senior Tory backbencher who chairs the Commons liaison committee, pressed on with his efforts to defuse the argument after the inconclusive outcome of his meeting with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, on Monday night. The immediate cause of the dispute is the Labour leadership's refusal to allow its MPs on the trade and industry committee to go on a planned trip to South Africa.</p>

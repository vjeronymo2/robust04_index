			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): PLA setback in dismissals appeal THE Port of London Authority has lost part of its appeal against an order to reinstate 12 shop stewards who were found to have been unfairly dismissed during the 1989 dock strike. The decision continues the legal victory of the TGWU general union, which has spent about Pounds 1.5m on the record 190-day industrial tribunal. The PLA, however, is appealing on two other grounds. The union's lawyers are submitting a substantial costs claim to the PLA. Costs are not usually awarded against the losing side in a tribunal but the union hopes it may recoup some of its costs. The PLA is highly unlikely to reinstate the workers but will have to pay compensation of between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 80,000 each.</p>

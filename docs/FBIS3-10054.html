			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Diaz from Sucre] </F>   [Text] The strong party structure of the Movement of the  Revolutionary Left, MIR, and of the Nationalist Democratic  Action, ADN, is silently crumbling as a result of the withdrawal  of several of their members. The crisis became more acute  following the dissemination of charges about alleged links  between high- ranking MIR leaders -- including [former Bolivian  President] Jaime Paz Zamora -- with drug traffickers. MIR and  ADN congressmen have been observed to maintain a discreet  silence over the issue, thus causing the two parties  middle-ranking leaders' to leave the parties files.    ADN leader Gaston Encina, who was previously one of the main  MIR defenders, does not want to comment on the issue and is  withdrawing from the political scenario. The public, however,  would like to hear his opinion because it is known that he also  participated in the meetings with drug traffickers, as the  charges state.    The crisis is affecting not only former President Jaime Paz  Zamora's party; it has also stained Mr. Hugo Banzer Suarez'  party. In the last few hours, the withdrawal of several ADN  members and middle-ranking leaders has been reported. Among the  withdrawing ADN members is Jorge Landivar Rua, a former  Chuquisaca Department ADN governor. He said: We have been  fighting corruption and are now indignant that trafficking may  have permeated the national structure of our political parties.  I bluntly repudiate the situation because these links,  particularly MIR links, with drug trafficking are twofold  corrupt, Landivar said.    The MIR and ADN crisis is becoming more acute.</p>

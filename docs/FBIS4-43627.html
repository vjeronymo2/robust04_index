			<p>BFN     [Text] France is doing its best to convince the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF] of its good intentions. We asked French  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who was in Cote d'Ivoire and  Senegal to raise the issue of African support for this  intervention, to comment on the issue:    [Begin Juppe recording] We have good arguments to convince  the RPF. What are we planning to do in this operation? For  example -- and I would say that this is the main aim of the  operation -- we plan to go in to protect Tutsi civilians who are  under threat of extermination in areas held by Rwandan  [government] forces and militias. How can the RPF be hostile to  such an operation, which aims to protect civilians? We have to  explain what we plan to do. Perhaps there have been  misunderstandings, perhaps what we planned was poorly  understood. I am convinced that we can explain things and  understand each other better. [end recording]</p>

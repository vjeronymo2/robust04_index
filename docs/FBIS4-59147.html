			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party National </F> Command on 8 May; place not given]    [Text] Sons of our glorious Arab nation; sons of unified,  struggling, ancient Yemen: Four years ago, in May 1990, our  Arab nation received the declaration of the unity of the two  parts of Yemen -- a serious, sound step -- with overwhelming joy  and optimism that the unity of Yemen would support the pan-Arab  struggle and be another addition to its major achievements: the  struggling intifadah in Palestine and the principles of the  Mother of Battles following the great confrontation.    The nation pinned high hopes on this unionist step because  it  rested on genuine popular and national support. The nation also  took pride in the struggle of the sons of this time-honored part  of the greater homeland in order to regain the unity of their  homeland and bring about a new, happy birth to Yemen that would  rid Yemen of the traces of the divisions that distorted its  national and pan-Arab character. The nation also viewed with  high appreciation the readiness demonstrated at the time to rise  to the level of historic action that, alone, is enough to  guarantee the soundness and success of any unionist step.    The climate was favorable for this unity to proceed amid  national and pan-Arab challenges, equipped with popular will and  determination to overcome difficulties that could obstruct its  march to build a unified, prosperous Yemen that serves pan-Arab  interests. This step came in response to objective needs and  aspirations cherished by everybody to transcend long decades of  loss and foreign colonialism and influence. These aspirations  were supported by popular will and determination to rebuild the  political, social, economic, and cultural life in a manner that  ensured promoting unity, overcoming backwardness, and making use  of the lessons of previous unity attempts. This was meant to  immunize the new step against the dangers of the return of  personal whims and interests that represented fragmentation and  backwardness and were the main cause for fragmentation on the  level of the Arab nation.    Great and intensive intellectual and practical efforts were  exerted to enhance the foundations of Yemeni unity so that it  would derive motivation from the national and pan-Arab spirit of  the people of Yemen to develop, succeed, and express the  readiness of the sons of this people to defend it with all that  is precious to them.    However, the remnants of the mentality of fragmentation and  its interests, as well as the external forces of intervention,  have played a role in obstructing well-meaning efforts and in  sowing the seeds of discord and premeditated intentions to  derail the unionist step. It is not easy for the nation to  watch this bloody scene that jeopardizes the unity and the hopes  pinned on it. The Yemeni unity revived the nation's hopes and  inspired optimism on the part of the Yemeni people. However,  the bloody incidents now threaten all of this and threaten the  shared national destiny of the people of Yemen.    Sons of Arabism in Yemen: Unity has a permanent rule,  namely, the need for everybody to rise above their personal  whims and interests and narrow calculations. Unity cannot be  achieved and will not last as a factor of strength unless it  takes inspiration from the spirit of the people and determines  to contribute to the unity of the nation. Thus, unity cannot  achieve its objectives unless it daily discovers formulas to  embody popular will in building a prosperous homeland that  achieves its national objectives through integration with the  nation's objectives.    The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party has always viewed itself as  the party of unity and has always worked to develop the idea of  unity. The party, whose political, organizational, and militant  course is based on the interest of the nation as a whole, finds  itself--vis-a-vis what is taking place in Yemen--dutybound to  caution against the serious peril that endangers the Arab  destiny.    The contemporary pan-Arab and unionist struggle march  records  that the Ba'th Party has offered generous sacrifices and martyrs  for unity and that it gives priority to unity and the unionist  feeling. From this premise, the Ba'th Party announces to the  nation and the Yemeni people that it supports unity and that  unity is the most important and most cherished objective. The  Arab Socialist Ba'th Party announces its solidarity with the  struggler Yemeni people for the sake of safeguarding their  unity, and rejects every reason, act, or justfication that  encroaches on the entity of unity.    The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party appeals to all the national  forces operating in the Yemeni arena, and the Arab forces  throughout the Arab homeland, to stand with Yemen's unity and  with the Yemeni people, and against all foreign attempts to  interfere in the affairs of Yemeni unity.    O Yemenis who are genuinely patriotic and pan-Arab: We  support you in confronting this danger which threatens the  Yemeni national destiny. We appeal to you to abide by unity as  a sacred slogan to confront this tribulation and end the  sedition and the conspiracy against unity. Let abidance by  unity now be a yardstick to which all of you will resort to  judge the behavior of individuals and groups and to judge their  stands and whether these stands are close or remote from you,  and from the unionist objectives and aspirations you have for  your country. Only with a national spirit and pan-Arab  awareness can the sons of Yemen bury the conspiracy against  their national unity and tackle the bloody incidents with a  determination to transform the blood that is being shed into  lessons for the assimilation of Yemeni unity and a price for  moving out of these tragic events into a state of affairs that  will consolidate the pillars of the unionist experiment and that  will enable it to better express its national and pan-Arab  essence. That's why we call on all the active and good forces  and the masses of our Yemeni people who are famous for their  national and pan-Arab stands to confront all that threatens  unity.    Noble Yemeni people, let all the windows be closed in the  face of the ill-winds of the conspiracy against Yemen's unity  and in the face of the foreign forces which tamper with Yemen's  national fate and the foreign schemes which threaten the future  of Yemen and the nation. Let the will of the strugglers unite on  this basis to check this bleeding and to establish a nationalist  unionist spirit that will protect Yemen and its unity, and that  will embody the people's determination to enhance the entity of  unity that was forged by sacrifices, martyrs, and positive  efforts, and the noble aspirations encompassing national and  pan-Arab objectives.    Greetings to the noble and united Yemeni people. Greetings  to the martyrs of the Yemeni unity and the Arab nation.</p>

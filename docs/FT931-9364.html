			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Airline may return leased Airbuses AMERICAN AIRLINES said yesterday it was considering the possibility of returning some of the 34 Airbus passenger jet aircraft it now has on lease as one of the options that will form its soon-to-be-unveiled package of cost cutting measures, Alan Friedman reports from New York. The airline said there would be no announcement this week, but that the cancellation of Airbus leases was an option, as was the possible grounding of some DC-10 aircraft. The airline has a total of 672 different aircraft in its fleet. 'We are looking at a number of options and have lots of alternatives for reducing costs. One of them is to return some of our Airbuses, but no decision has been taken,' an American Airlines spokesman explained yesterday.</p>

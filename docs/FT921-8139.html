			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: AECI limits fall in earnings to 21% AN improved performance in the second half allowed AECI, South Africa's largest non-fuel chemicals group, to limit the fall in earnings to 21 per cent in 1991. This followed a disastrous first half when earnings dropped by 56 per cent. Although trading conditions remained difficult, the group managed to double the level of trading income achieved in the first half. Mr Mike Sander, managing director, said higher production rates, tight control of fixed costs and enhanced productivity had improved margins, while speciality businesses had performed better. Turnover rose by 5 per cent to R5.28bn (Dollars 1.44bn), but net trading income was 19 per cent down at R402m. Attributable income was 21.4 per cent lower at R187m. Earnings per ordinary share dropped by a similar amount to 121 cents, but this was a considerable improvement over the predictions of some analysts who thought earnings would drop under 100 cents per share. The total dividend for the year was cut by 33 per cent to 58 cents per share. Mr Sander said that although the normal seasonal improvement in sales had been evident in some areas, market demand had declined further in the automotive and building sectors. He said low world economic growth had caused prices for products such as PVC and polyethylene to remain weak. Export volumes had increased significantly with revenues up by 27 per cent over 1990. Although AECI appears to have turned the corner, the market is still taking a cautious view of the company. Its current share price of R9.30 is a long way off the R22.50 which it scaled in the late 1980s, and its p/e ratio of 8.2 is below the sectoral average. Mr Sander said prospects for a recovery were dependent largely on the timing and extent of a recovery in the domestic economy. He said that provided this was not impeded by factors such as the continuing world recession, adverse political developments, or the serious drought gripping South Africa, a moderate improvement in earnings could be expected.</p>

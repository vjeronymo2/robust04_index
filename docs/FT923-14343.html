			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Thames group bids Pounds 1,000 for TV channel AN ARMY of 2,000 TV service engineers may be created to visit all the homes in London to retune video recorders and so clear the way for the launch of Britain's fifth national television channel, which last night attracted only one bid - of Pounds 1,000. The strategy of the consortium making the bid involves launching CityTV stations in various parts of the UK, starting in London next July and followed by Manchester in 1994. The retuning operation, necessary because of interference, would cost Pounds 75m if extended across the country. Birmingham CityTV could follow in the year 2000 with Glasgow or Edinburgh in 2001. Up to 49 per cent of the companies would be offered to local investors. The plan was unveiled yesterday as the consortium, led by Thames Television, submitted the only bid for the Channel 5 licence to the Independent Television Commission. Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames Television and chairman of the consortium Channel Five Holdings, said that up to 50 per cent of video recorders could suffer interference from the Channel 5 signal and would have to be retuned. Rather than wait for complaints, teams contracted by Thorn EMI and Granada Rentals would visit homes and carry out 85 per cent of the retuning before the launch. Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of the innovative Citytv station in Toronto and consultant executive producer to the consortium, said yesterday: 'We believe, crack the retuning problem and it's the key to the door.' The 'door' is access to about 74 per cent of the UK population although many will need a new aerial to receive the channel. The company plans to distribute vouchers for free aerials but each installation will cost about Pounds 25. The programme schedule, like Citytv in Toronto, will concentrate on news, films and music. Thames plans to take no more than 15 per cent of the holding company and the consortium has no other significant financial backing at the moment. The task is first to convince the ITC that the video recorder problem can be solved and then that the project can be financed. The peak cash requirement, including a contingency fund, would be Pounds 150m by 1995, Mr Dunn said, implying that the channel would start to make profit at the operational level in its fourth year. The ITC is unlikely to announce for some months whether the bid has succeeded.</p>

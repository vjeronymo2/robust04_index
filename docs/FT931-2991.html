			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Confusion over changes to BES THE abolition of Business Expansion Schemes involving loans threw the tax shelter market into confusion. Loan-backed schemes were introduced for the first time last September, and since then have raised Pounds 568m, according to the BES Association. However, they came in for strong criticism because their structure allowed hefty profits for top-rate taxpayers without allowing basic rate taxpayers to make any return at all. As one accountant put it, they allowed top-rate taxpayers to convert themselves into basic rate payers. Demand for the schemes was exceptional - Mr Charles Fry, chairman of Johnson Fry, the largest BES sponsor, claims to have received Pounds 84m for the schemes since last Friday. Around Pounds 850m has been raised by all BES companies so far this tax year, according to the Allenbridge Group, a BES intermediary, compared to Pounds 407m in 1991-92. The Building Societies Association said that schemes without loans 'may still have a contribution to make', although removing loans makes the schemes less attractive for lenders.</p>

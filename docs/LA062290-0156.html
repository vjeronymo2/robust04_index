			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> KEEP IT UNDER SURVEILLANCE  </P> <P> Seal Beach has one of the smaller police departments in Orange County, but the  department of 42 sworn officers has had a large share of publicity in recent  years about morale problems and internal strife. Now comes a report by the  Orange County Grand Jury that confirms the need for attention from the City  Council.  </P> <P> The grand jury rarely ventures into the corridors of police departments in the  county, and is known for issuing measured findings. But after an 11-month  investigation prompted by citizens' complaints, the jury concluded that there  was low morale and unfair job treatment in the department, resulting from  favoritism and nepotism. Among other things, the grand jury found that Police  Chief Bill Stearns had hired his wife to be the department's court liaison  officer without following procedures.  </P> <P> The grand jury report amounted to a wake-up call for the city fathers, who seem  to have been insufficiently moved in the past by complaints such as those  considered by the jury.  </P> <P> For example, the city Charter has a clause that prohibits nepotism, but City  Manager Robert Nelson told jurors that the hiring of the chief's wife did not  violate city or civil-service regulations because it was a job  "reclassification,"' whatever that means. And the fact that Mayor Edna Wilson,  when asked publicly about the report's conclusions, expressed some surprise  about the whole thing was itself surprising.  </P> <P> A far more hopeful sign was the mayor's declaration that the City Council "will  do anything that we need to do" to comply with the panel's recommendations.  Among them were sound suggestions that the council investigate any departmental  conflicts of interest and institute training to reduce stress and foster team  management.  </P> <P> Small police departments have different problems from large ones. But Seal  Beach has learned one thing they all have in common: the need for municipal  oversight.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "So That Others May Respect Us!"] </F>   [Text] It seems that no one in this world pays attention  to us, as a nation, anymore. This is because we are always  subjected to humiliation and annihilation and to looting and  killing whenever others wish to express their grudge and hatred  against us. The Ramadan massacre [in Hebron] was retained in  memory no longer than 10 days. The West, led by the United  States, believed that this massacre did not deserve to be  remembered longer. Hence, this is an opportunity to examine  international legitimacy. Others disregard this legitimacy  while asking us to honor it. Others despise this legitimacy  while asking us to appreciate it. They then hide their faces,  so we cannot see their sarcastic laughter at the peoples and  nations which still pin hopes on international legitimacy.    The slaughter of more than 50 Palestinians in one of the  holiest Muslim mosques is an example of what has become daily  acts committed by the West or Israeli racism. We are only left  with appealing to the world to protect us and send us--and  perhaps at our expense-- witnesses to our humiliating death.  This is so because we do not want to reconsider our position  even on a single occasion which would express our courage and  prove that we can do something. Those who have expressed much  grief over the Palestinian people must reconsider their  position. The Palestinian people need our support not our  support for others against them. Now that grief has been  expressed out of pan-Arab considerations, we would like to  recall the fact, though seldom beneficial, that the Iraqi people  are an Arab people, that hundreds of Iraqi children are starving  to death, and that hundreds of ailing Iraqis pass away everyday  because we, and not others, are the ones who are besieging Iraq  by the false international legitimacy which is slaughtering the  Iraqis and protecting both the occupation troops and settlers in  Palestine.    While we recall this catastrophe, the U.S. Administration  reiterates its known tone that Iraq still violates international  legitimacy and has not yet complied fully with its resolutions.  This tone seeks to prevent the Security Council from lifting the  embargo on Iraq's oil exports. These exports would enable Iraq  to purchase milk for its children, medicines for its patients,  pencils for its students, water colors for its painters, and  some serenity and reassurance for its old people who have faced  much U.S. intimidation since August 1990.    For us to stand alongside the Palestinian people against the  settler murderers, and to support the Ibrahimi Mosque and stand  against all the Zionist, U.S., and Western arsenals, and also to  back the brother against the enemy, the path is clear; namely,  Arabs should end the blockade they are imposing against the  Iraqi people. Only by doing this will we confirm that we are  still Arabs who can have make their own decisions and who  freely, independently, and courageously pursue their policies,  so others would be compelled to respect us and honor the  international legitimacy in whose name and under whose banner we  are being slaughtered and humiliated!</p>

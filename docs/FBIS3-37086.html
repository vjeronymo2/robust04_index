			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Annual report presented by President Algirdas Brazauskas at </F> a Seimas plenary session in Vilnius -- live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Social and legal security is,  to my mind, the most important concern of the state. We must  all, together, create such a system of a democratic society and  social order which in itself is favorably disposed toward man.  Lithuania will then be a secure, flourishing, democratic  country where concord and honesty will be dominant. [passage  omitted]    The nature of the political system of our democratic state  became much stronger in 1993. It was very important that all  the most important institutions provided for by the republic's  Constitution, which did not exist in 1992, came into being.  They are the president of the Republic of Lithuania and, for  the first time in the history of the Lithuanian state, the  Constitutional Court. [passage omitted]    Visiting various towns and districts in Lithuania, I noticed  that there has been no positive progress in local government.  The reform of local government is overdue; corresponding draft  laws have been drawn up. It is most important that reform does  not take place for the sake of reform, but serves the solution  of everyday problems of every person, not destroying what has  been proved to be useful in practice. We now have our  independent state, but we have failed to reorganize our state  apparatus in such a way that it qualitatively differs from the  previous one. This is bad. The implementation of the general  state policy depends on the work of state officials and on their  competence. Of course, the formation of a civilized state  apparatus is a long-term process. Therefore it is important to  adopt at present a law which establishes the rights and duties  of state officials, their responsibilities and social  guarantees. This would be followed by more radical decisions.    I am a realist; therefore I do not deny that not all the  residents of Lithuania have a favorable attitude to the present  government and its policy. But, I think, nobody will dispute  the fact that the political atmosphere in our country became  calmer last year after we stopped looking for internal enemies  and fighting against them. [passage omitted]    On 1 January 1993 the republic's nationality was 19.4  percent  non-Lithuanian. Eighteen of Lithuania's national minorities and  ethnic groups have more than 100 public organizations. The  Lithuanian legislation and practical policy regulating national  relations is being positively assessed both in the country and  on the international scale. A careful, consistent and at the  same time a principled policy enabled the Republic of Lithuania  to avoid the troubles and difficulties experienced by some other  countries. This is capital which must not be thoughtlessly  squandered. [passage omitted]    I wish to note on this occasion that the adoption of a law  on  preventive detention, which has been the object of many  disputes, has become an objective and unavoidable reaction to  the organized crimes and enabled the law enforcement bodies to  take the initiative. But the combat against organized crime  with political and legal means can be successful only up to a  certain extent. Economic and social causes of crime must be  eliminated. [passage omitted]    The national defense system is being reorganized according  to  the Western model. I must say that the rapprochement with the  NATO structures is taking place, above all, by reorganizing the  structure of our Ministry of National Defense according to  Western standards. In solving these problems, we expect serious  assistance from Western military experts. Nonstatutory  relations and other negative phenomena in our army are among the  most pressing problems. There cannot be concessions or  compromises in this sphere. Nonstatutory relations in our army  must be uprooted by mercilessly punishing the culprits. This,  for me, as the supreme commander of the armed forces, is a  strict and clear demand to the leadership of the Ministry of  National Defense, the army commander and to all military  commanders. [passage omitted]    The decline of production slowed in the second half of 1993,  and the signs of stability and even growth could be noticed in  some branches of the economy. Some enterprises adapt themselves  to new conditions of the manufacture and sale of products, and  find themselves partners. Inflation was a very heavy burden  last year. Joint efforts by the government and the Bank of  Lithuania stopped it in the middle of the year. This was an  essential condition for the introduction of the litas. After  the introduction of the litas the rate of inflation declined  even more, and constituted in the second half of the year  [figure indistinct] percent. Since the prices of raw materials  and energy resources have reached the world level I think there  will be no great increase in prices this year. [passage omitted]    The government program provides for concluding the stage of  primary privatization in the first half of this year. But  almost half of all investment checks remain unused. It is  becoming obvious that it is not expedient to convert them into  state bonds. In order to use all checks in the first stage it  is essential to inform the residents as soon as possible about  what will be privatized and to define the final date of the  validity of the investment checks. [passage omitted]    The government must effectively guide the process of  privatization. I consider the work of the Central Privatization  Commission to be unsatisfactory. Foreign investments in  Lithuania's economy are not increasing as we expected. At  present no foreign investors compete among themselves in  striving to dominate Lithuania's market, but, on the contrary,  the states are competing among themselves for foreign  investments, including the Baltic states. In order to win this  competition, it is esential to pay more attention to  advertising, propagate our investment projects, supply  information and all other services to foreign investors, and  simplify the order of the use of foreign credits. [passage  omitted]    Many problems have accumulated in agriculture. In carrying  out the agricultural reform the seed of the current confusion  was sown, which almost halted the reform. As a result of a  limited understanding of the problem of social justice the  principles of rational farming were ignored. [passage omitted]  Yet contrary to what our opponents and sometimes even  misinformed foreign experts maintained, the agricultural reform  was not impeded. [passage omitted]    According to the latest figures, every third farmer has been  given all the documents proving his rights to land and property.  About 30 percent of land suitable for farming is currently used  by the Lithuanian farmers. In 1993, privatization of the  property owned by the agricultural enterprises was virtually  completed. The remaining property of agricultural enterprises  due to be privatized comprises only one percent of the value of  that which is to be privatized. However, the general situation  in agriculture and the financial state of agricultural subjects  so far is not satisfactory. The slump in production which  started three years ago continued last year. The volume of  production in comparison with 1992 has decreased by eight  percent.    Farmers and agricultural enterprises encounter great  financial difficulties, the reasons for which are: A decrease  in the solvent demand by the population resulting in contraction  of the internal market; limited export possibilities; and an  ever-increasing flow of imported food products. The  possibilities of the state to support the farmers in one way or  another are also limited. However, most probably the main reason  for the current situation are the debts to the agricultural  suppliers by the food processing enterprises. [passage omitted]    Although not long ago the farmers demanded freedom for  economic activity, now they are attacking the government,  demanding rather strict state control. Without going into fine  detail I would like to say this: In a nutshell, the support  must correspond to the financial possibilities of the state  budget, it must help to coordinate the interests of producers  and consumers, it must lower social tensions in rural areas and  not increase them in the cities. It must not contradict the  essential concepts of the agreement concluded with the World  Bank and the IMF. [passage omitted]    The Partnership for Peace program signed in Brussels on 27  January is a real step in ensuring the security of the state.  It is becoming obvious that membership in the European  Community and NATO is only a means of striving for further aims.  I think that there is no need to discuss Lithuania's  (?position). From the point of view of culture and of the  geopolitical situation, it is a Central European country. But  there is no need to artificially thrust ourselves into some  single region and thus limit our opportunities. We are both in  Central Europe and in the region of the Baltic Sea. The  Ministry of Foreign Affairs should define Lithuania's strategy  both toward the states of the Baltic Sea and of Central Europe,  the Visegrad group, and other states.    Many changes have taken place in the relations between the  Baltic states. Cooperation between Lithuania, Estonia and  Latvia, which has often been declaratory and which almost ceased  in the autumn of 1991, acquired new features last year. Several  meetings of the presidents, parliaments and heads of governments  took place. The tripartite free trade agreement was signed and  ratified, the memorandum on consular relations and the joint  visa area of the Baltic states was signed. A Baltic Council is  to be formed from the existing interparliamentary Baltic  Assembly and the future Baltic [words indistinct].    A formula of three-plus-five is being consolidated in  Lithuanian foreign policy. This is the prospect of cooperation  between the three Baltic states and five Nordic states. But  there are problems here, too. In relations with the Nordic  states we are as yet unable to make use of the proposed aid. We  not always display initiative.    Our foreign policy contains the striving to establish and  develop bilateral relations with Western states. I would like  to mention relations with Germany as an example. They are  intensive and can serve as an example of good relations with a  powerful Western state, if only we can make better use of the  opportunities of economic cooperation. The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, making use of this example, could develop in a more  inventive way our state relations with Great Britain, France,  Italy, and the United States. It would be advantageous to  Lithuania to establish closer relations with the Balkan states  and those in the Near East, and also with such countries as  Austria, Switzerland, Turkey, Israel and Canada.    The relations between Lithuania and Poland have so far not  been regulated by a joint political treaty. We must more boldly  take the necessary step and sign such a treaty. The delay is  very detrimental to Lithuania's interests.    We must make better use of all opportunities in working in  international organizations. This is a good opportunity to  develop bilateral relations, especially bearing in mind our  limited material and technical resources and shortage of  experienced specialists. Relations with Russia and the CIS  countries are important to us. Relations with Russia rather  improved in 1993. This is testified by my meeting with the  Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, and a packet of bilateral  agreements signed during the visit of the Russian prime  minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, in Vilnius. This provides good  grounds for the development of Lithuanian-Russian economic  cooperation. So far I do not see any need to revise our policy  toward Russia, although, in time, corrections might be  necessary. If an imperial stand becomes stronger in the foreign  policy of that country, Lithuania's policy will change toward  Russia, too.    The most important thing for us is to remain realists.  Lithuania's relations with other countries will continue to be  based on bilateral agreements, and various issues, both with  Russia and with other CIS countries will be solved by Lithuania  by way of negotiations. The visits to Kazakhstan and China  demonstrated what huge and untapped possibilities exist in the  Asian region. This is an immense market, the source of  inexhaustible raw materials, the fastest developing economy, new  technologies, financial and credit resources.    I would like to mention that Lithuanian Government  structures  have not always smoothly coordinated their foreign policy. By  my decree, the Council for the Coordination of Foreign Policy  was formed. We should expect basic changes, although this  council has no constitutional power to make decisions, but the  authorizations of the heads and representatives of the state  institutions make it possible to strive by way of coordination  for the optimal decisions for our country.    It is very important to form a positive image of Lithuania  in  the world. Disputes, dialogues and sharp criticism on the  domestic issues of Lithuania should not become an object of  international investigation or even derision, unless attempts  are being made to discredit the state of Lithuania and frighten  away our potential partners.

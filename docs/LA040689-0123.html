			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESSES NEED PATRONAGE  </P> <P> We at Katie McGuire's Pie &amp; Bake Shoppe in Hacienda Heights were one of the  many small businesses that are taken for granted until we no longer exist.  </P> <P> We tried for almost two years to make a success of Katie McGuire's. The support  and patronage we received will be a lasting memory.  </P> <P> For customers who came by occasionally or when the nearby Vons grocery store  was out of something, we only hope our closing serves as a reminder of how  important it is to support local merchants. It is always easy to visit the big  department stores, the malls or the discount wholesale clubs. But supporting  local merchants benefits us all, since such businesses help make the community  what it is.  </P> <P> Such merchants are not outsiders. They are your neighbors, your friends. Give  yourself a warm feeling from helping support the "little guy."  </P> <P> Goodby for now.  </P> <P> OLGA and STEVE FELD and the  </P> <P> employees of Katie McGuire's  </P> <P> Hacienda Heights  </P></p>

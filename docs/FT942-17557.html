			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / The Long View: Some hard facts of life Good advice is the most valuable commodity in investment. But the life assurance industry has insisted that it should cost nothing. That, fundamentally, is why the life offices have got themselves into the most dreadful public relations mess. This week, one of the biggest and most highly-regarded mutuals, Norwich Union, was forced to suspend its 800-strong sales force pending retraining to levels thought satisfactory by Lautro, the life assurance marketing regulator. But it is only the latest in a string of top companies, including Legal &amp; General and Scottish Widows, to face disciplinary action. The industry is in the dock over the mis-selling of personal pension plans to people who would have been better advised to stay in occupational pension schemes or the state scheme, Serps. Unfortunately, it is often true that exceptional growth in any industry leads to over-expansion and a collapse in standards. Success breeds complacency and, ultimately, arrogance. By any reckoning the life assurance industry has been remarkably successful at collecting savings. At the end of last year life companies held assets of more than Pounds 400bn, up fourfold compared with 10 years earlier. They are selling 8m new policies a year in the UK and collecting Pounds 35bn in premiums from individuals. Meanwhile they are paying out Pounds 30bn annually in benefits. Historically the life industry received two main political favours for encouraging thrifty habits among the population. There was a tax incentive of about half the standard rate of income tax, called life assurance premium relief, and there was exemption from the investor protection laws introduced in the 1930s. Life company representatives could continue to sell door-to-door and they were not required to disclose policy costs and charges. Nigel Lawson abolished LAPR almost exactly 10 years ago but life business surged on regardless, only partly because new tax reliefs were extended to personal pensions. The ability to conceal commissions and other selling costs was probably more important than the tax breaks and, since the mid-1980s, the industry has resisted efforts to introduce so-called 'hard' disclosure. Various forms of soft disclosure have been conceded. But this month the regulators will unveil a formula for disclosure in cash terms at the point of sale, to be introduced at the beginning of 1995. The ability of life companies to secure regular savings contracts has been crucial. They aim to persuade customers to sign up for periods, usually, of between 10 and 25 years. This is good business for the companies, ensuring their commercial stability and enabling them to implement long-term investment strategies. Such contracts are also arguably good for the customers, not just because the discipline of a monthly instalment will cause them to save more than they might otherwise do, but also because regular savings will effectively smooth out the investment risks. Small investors tend to do badly out of non-contractual savings because they move out of building society deposits into stock market-related vehicles at the wrong time of the cycle - producing, for instance, huge peaks in unit trust purchases in years such as 1987 and 1993, but low figures in years such as 1990 when shares were cheap. However, people do not readily sign 25-year contracts. They have to be persuaded, usually by salesmen on a one-to-one basis, during visits to homes and offices. This is extraordinarily expensive (think of how much a plumber, say, charges to make a call) especially if the salesman is an expert in financial planning, which sadly few are - not at Norwich Union, certainly. A typical salesman only sells one or two contracts a week, and looks for a commission of hundreds of pounds on each. At one time commissions were restrained by an industry cartel but this was abolished and payments in the past few years have jumped. It has therefore become even more important to disguise the selling costs. Advice, Mr Prospect is told, is 'free'. However, the expenses are deducted from his instalments over the first year or two, in what is called front-end loading. These marketing techniques have been very successful in generating business for the life companies. But they are now boomeranging. This is because the intermediaries have a huge incentive to sell contracts regardless of whether they benefit the customer. Life companies are now agonising over how to overcome the effects of hard disclosure. It is likely that they will attempt to obscure the costs of commissions by spreading them over long periods. But that will not go down at all well with salesmen. A probable consequence will be a further sharp decline in the proportion of long-term regular savings contracts being sold. Already there has been a big swing towards single premium products. The life companies will argue that the total savings ratio will suffer from these changes, but it will also be true that savers will be less vulnerable to the crippling costs of terminating contracts which they should never have signed. A structural shift in the UK's investment markets can be expected however. Already flows into occupational pension schemes have tumbled because those schemes are becoming more mature. Now the business of the life offices is becoming more short-term in nature, and they may lose customers to other kinds of institution such as unit trusts. The securities markets could therefore tend to become rather more volatile as the stabilising influence of the very long-term funds becomes less apparent. Of course, if private investors are given good advice they may avoid the pitfalls of panic buying and panic selling. But they will not receive that advice free.</p>

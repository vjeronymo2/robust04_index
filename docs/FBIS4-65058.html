			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bert Cornelis report: "Belgium Is Still Selling Arms"] </F>   [Excerpt] Belgium is still a major center for the  international arms trade despite a new law which is supposed to  impose strict controls on arms sales.    This is the view of VU [People's Union] Senator Willy  Kuijpers, who yesterday disclosed to the senate the content of  the Foreign Affairs Committee's report on the arms trade.    Kuijpers calculated that Belgium exported no less than 24  billion Belgian francs [BFr] in arms last year. Divided between  the three regions, that means that exports were BFr16.1 billion;  BFr2.7 billion for Flanders and Flemish-Brussels and BFr13.4  billion for Wallonia and French-speaking Brussels. The new 1991  arms law applies to the first eight months of 1993 only, due to  the delays in implementation decisions, but Kuijpers still  calculated in 1993 Belgium exported no less than BFr24 billion  in arms.    That is half as much again compared with the previous year.  Belgian weapons go mainly to the North and Middle East (BFr9.5  billion) and Asia (BFr1.5 billion). In Europe, BFr3.4 billion  were exported to the former Yugoslavia, compared with BFr2.4  billion in 1992. Kuijpers has strong suspicions that part of  this comes from Belgium. [passage omitted]</p>

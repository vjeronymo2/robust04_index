			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: USAir losses deepen after charges USAIR, the sixth-largest US carrier in which British Airways has invested Dollars 300m for a proposed 19.9 per cent voting interest, yesterday released fourth-quarter and full-year figures showing modest improvement in operating performance, but significantly larger after-tax losses thanks to one-off charges. The heavily-indebted carrier also announced agreement on a revised aircraft delivery schedule with Boeing which, USAir said, would cut its capital expenditure requirements by Dollars 835m between 1993 and 1996. USAir's figures showed a pre-tax loss of Dollars 254.1m in the fourth quarter of 1992. This compared with a tiny Dollars 2.9m profit in the same period of 1991 and was scored on a 2 per cent decline in revenues, at Dollars 1.63bn. The fourth-quarter deficit meant that USAir lost Dollars 600.8m pre-tax last year, compared with Dollars 414.8m in 1991, on revenues of Dollars 6.69bn (up from Dollars 6.51bn). The after-tax loss of Dollars 1.22bn, compared with a Dollars 305.3m deficit for 1991, reflected a one-off, non-cash charge of Dollars 745.7m, to cover the new US accounting standard on non-pension retirement benefits, partly offset by a Dollars 117.6m tax credit. Even at the pre-tax level, USAir's results were riddled by one-off items, and Mr Seth Schofield, chairman, was quick to focus on an improvement in the underlying operating results. USAir's operating loss for the 12 months, before any exceptional or extraordinary items, narrowed from Dollars 219.4m to Dollars 166.4m, although in the final three months it widened again from Dollars 14.4m to Dollars 31.7m. 'While we are concerned about the continuing propensity of the industry to offer too much capacity in the face of weak demand, we are seeing positive trends at USAir in unit revenues and unit costs,' claimed Mr Schofield. Within the 1992 pre-tax figure, USAir incurred Dollars 170.1m of extraordinary charges. The annual non-operating expense - mainly interest charges on the group's large debt - totalled Dollars 264.3m, compared with Dollars 241.3m in 1991. Mr Warren Buffett, the US investor and chairman of the Berkshire Hathaway group, and Mr Charles Munger, vice-chairman at Berkshire Hathaway, have joined the USAir board. Berkshire Hathaway has held a tranche of USAir convertible preferred shares for some years.</p>

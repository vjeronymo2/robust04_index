			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Morris Ashby advances 25% and calls for Pounds 4.5m MORRIS ASHBY, the specialised diecasting and machining group, yesterday announced a Pounds 4.53m cash call, a 25 per cent surge in pre-tax profits, and a 15 per cent increase in its dividend. The funding involves the placing and offer of 3.5m shares at 135p each; in the market they rose 14p to 156p. Some 55 per cent of the new shares have been placed firm; shareholders can apply for the underwritten balance of 1.53m shares on the basis of 3-for-7. Mr Norman Gardner, chairman, said the move would facilitate the capital expenditure policy in the current five-year plan of continuing investment to enhance the group's position in the diecasting industry. For the year ended March 31 1993 pre-tax profit was Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.2m) from turnover ahead 24 per cent at Pounds 19m. Sales rises were achieved in nine of the 10 industry sectors the group served. Mr Gardner said the current year had started well and the order book was strong. Earnings per share worked through at 13.5p (10.7p). The recommended final dividend is 3.7p, to make 5.4p (4.7p).</p>

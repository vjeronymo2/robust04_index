			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / College of nursing membership boost THE ROYAL College of Nursing will announce shortly that its total membership has reached a record level. However, its claim that membership is increasing at the expense of Unison, the new public service union formed by the amalgamation of Cohse, Nupe and Nalgo, has been disputed by Unison. There are about 641,749 qualified individuals registered with the Central Council for Nursing Midwifery and Health Visiting, of which 384,000 are working in the National Health Service. The total nursing workforce in the NHS is about 543,000, a figure which includes 159,000 nursing auxiliaries and nursing assistants. The college admits only qualified nurses while Unison includes nursing auxiliaries and assistants in its 235,000 nursing membership. In the year to last December the college's membership grew from 292,180 to 297,719 and next month it is expected to be a record at more than 300,000.</p>

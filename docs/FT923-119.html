			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Arts: Crisis and confusion beneath the surface - Prix Italia Broadcasting Festival If the Prix Italia broadcasting festival is anything to go by, and experience suggests it is, radio and television are in a greater state of change and confusion in all parts of the world today than ever in the history of these two relatively young mass media. When this festival began as a radio event in Capri in 1948 television was little more than a technical trick used by a few broadcasters to provide illustrations for radio programmes. Today television is so inextricably bound up with cultural identity and political power that its fortunes lie at the very heart of the apocalyptic changes occurring in eastern Europe, and the shift in western Europe from public service broadcasting to market driven systems is causing deep anxiety, at least among programme makers. Not that a newcomer to broadcasting would have divined this from the programmes on offer in the viewing and listening rooms of the shabbily splendid Palazzo di Colorno, just outside Parma. Not immediately, anyway. The autumn sunlight across the valley of the Po caught the occasional flake of paint, drifting down from the wall paintings commissioned by Napoleon's wife, Marie-Louise, past television screens showing programmes which, to old Italia hands, looked remarkably familiar. True, old age has suddenly emerged as a dominant subject in documentaries throughout the industrialised world. True, the suffering and saintliness of women occupies more time than ever in drama from Croatia (Sestre, about the love between two sisters) to Japan (Shinenai Tori, about a woman's search for dignity) and the UK (Prime Suspect, about a woman who chooses to do a more-than-full-time job in the police force and the shopping as well and then exercises her female prerogative and complains that she has no time). True, programmes in the music and arts category, so often over-long in the past, seem abnormally - and, at a festival of this sort, mercifully - short this year. But such changes scarcely seem to support the belief, shared by so many of the 900 people here to serve on juries, join in debates, or simply observe (well, yes, and to enjoy the Parma ham and the Verdi concerts) that broadcasting is about to plunge into a new age of ratings obsessed vulgarity. Most newcomers spending 10 days assiduously watching programmes for eight or nine hours a day, either in the viewing rooms or in the even more heavily used 'On Demand' cubicles, such a feature of television festivals since the appearance of the video recorder, would probably have come away heartened. Of course the Prix Italia is an event which studiously excludes the material forming the bulk of most television schedules: there are no game shows, sitcoms, chat shows, sport or news programmes here. However, even in the three prize categories - drama, documentaries and arts - you might expect to find evidence of popularisation and trivialisation if the descent into the commercial maw is really as swift and precipitous as many in Parma were asserting. On the surface there seems little sign. The winner of the television arts prize, Anton Webern, from La Sept in France, is a relentlessly superior visual tone poem (in monochrome, naturally) which airily ignores the benefits of speech, providing no presenter, voice-over, or commentary of any sort. It can be properly comprehended only by those already well up on Webern - Prix Italia jurors for instance. Here is the face of old fashioned broadcasting at its most supercilious. Television is a mass medium? So what? ITV's entry in this category, the 'South Bank Show' on The Making Of Sgt Pepper was considered unremarkable; the sort of programme, said the jury, which a good broadcasting organisation ought to be making every week. Only the Russian juror wanted to give it a prize, on the grounds that, if screened in Russia, it would get the highest ratings ever. The drama prize went to another French entry, La Controverse de Valladolid, a deeply worthy 16th century ecclesiastical courtroom drama about a post-Columbus debate among Catholics as to whether black people were men with souls or merely clever animals. In television terms it was less than remarkable but no one could deny its political correctness. The BBC won the documentary prize with a programme from the 'Video Diaries' series, War, Lives and Videotape in which Nick Danziger recorded his own efforts to find a home for orphans in Kabul, and incidentally dwelled lengthily on wounded children screaming in hospital. Apart from the topicality of Danziger's piece, none of the prize winners would have looked out of place at any Prix Italia in the last 20 years. So why the neurosis? Where is the crisis? So far it may be concealed but it is no fantasy. Even at this old, deeply civilised festival, the evidence is there, albeit under the surface. Speak to the producers and you find that the arts entries are shorter this year because everywhere arts budgets are under attack. Arts programmes (apart from 'unremarkable' productions such as the 'South Bank Show') don't win ratings. Think carefully about the dramas and you realise that a category dominated not so long ago by single plays, usually on serious social or political themes, now features a remarkable array of detectives and a growing number of episodes from serials or mini-series. Look at the very organisation of the festival itself and you discover that one of the chief reasons for coming here year after year - the integrity of the prize system, achieved by allowing a company to enter either a programme or a juror in a given category but never both - has been torpedoed this year. Why? Because co-production is said to be so widespread that it was becoming impossible to enforce the old rule, in television if not radio. Thus the Prix Italia itself is falling victim to the globalisation of television. Even if people did not actually give prizes to their own programmes, there was a significant tendency this year for programmes from the jurors' own companies to reach the shortlist. How could one juror vote another's off the shortlist? Above all the evidence comes from the knowledge of the broadcasters and journalists gathered in Parma. The eastern Europeans tell you that the ex-communist societies do not want to switch to public service broadcasting with its collectivist, even statist overtones; too much like a chip off the old block. They want to go straight to the commercial marketplace. Even a buffer state such as Finland is shifting on January 1 1993 from its present system of running some commercial content on the public service channels to a mixed system with an entire channel for commercial broadcasting and the old public service people left to fill far more time with no more money. The French are gloomy about changes which have already occurred in France and more pessimistic still about non-commercial broadcasting in the future. During the course of the Prix Italia Padulla, the president of RAI, Italy's equivalent of the BBC, labelled television banal, repetitive, and in retreat. And of course it was impossible to find a British broadcaster in Parma who was not filled with foreboding about the changes beginning in the UK next January. The virtual unanimity of the belief that the new market-driven ITV, red in tooth and claw, will drive down British programme standards is unique in my experience of reporting on the industry over the past 25 years. That reporting has included coverage of previous Prix Italia festivals where public service broadcasters have felt under threat. This occasion, the 44th, is the first where there has been serious talk of the Prix Italia itself coming to an end because the broadcasting world in which it existed now seems to have the glow of sunset upon it. How ironic if the Prix Italia were to end as it began: as a select festival for high quality radio programmes.</p>

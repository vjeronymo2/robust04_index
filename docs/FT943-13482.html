			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Cabinet row hits lira The fallout from the cabinet squabble in Italy dominated foreign exchanges yesterday as the lira fell to a 1994 low, writes Philip Gawith. The first serious schism within the two-month-old government drove the Italian currency to a low of L1,003.60 against the D-Mark before recovering slightly to finish in London at L1,002, from L993.8 on Friday. Traders were concerned whether what appeared to be Mr Berlusconi's first serious policy error might not spill over into problems in management of the economy. Elsewhere, the dollar had a quiet day. Dealers said the US currency was in a consolidation phase after its recent sharp fall. It was firmer against the yen, closing in London at Y98.3550 from Y97.9050, but lost ground against the D-Mark to finish at DM1.5428 from DM1.5558. In New York the dollar ended at Y98.41 and DM1.5470. The D-Mark was stronger on the back of political uncertainty in both Italy and France, where the communications minister resigned over the weekend in connection with corruption charges. Sterling had an uneventful day, with the market ignoring the June public sector borrowing figures, which were below expectations. Consistent with the recent pattern, it was firmer against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5644, from Dollars 1.5586 on Friday, but weaker against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.4135 from DM2.4248. Analysts are currently playing down 'apocalyptic' scenarios for the lira, but none rule out the currency testing the historic low of L1,010 per D-Mark, touched in December 1993. The next important development will be the parliamentary hearings into the constitutionality of the contested decree. Mr Giorgio Radaelli, senior economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said the dispute between Mr Berlusconi and his coalition allies was the first open rift since they entered government. He said he doubted, however, whether there was a 'great risk' in the next few weeks of a break-up of the government. But if this perception changes, it is likely to be accompanied by heavy selling of Italian assets by foreigners, which would depress the lira. At the moment, investors seem to be standing back from selling the lira. Mr Radaelli said this might be explained by parliament going into recess on August 4. The parliamentary recess is normally a good time for Italian financial markets. There is also hope that when parliament reconvenes, it will be to pass a budget which gets to grips with the Italian deficit problem. Mr Radaelli said the market was reluctant to push the currency far beyond the important psychological level of L1,000, for fear of unleashing 'massive' intervention from the Bank of Italy. He predicted, however, that so long as the currency did not fall too quickly, the Bank would stand back until it reached a level of L1,025-L1,030 before intervening. Mr Radaelli said there was currently little risk of imported inflation. The bearish mood in Italian markets was evident in the Eurolira three-month interest rate future contracts. After losing 16 basis points on Friday, when the crisis first emerged, the September contract fell a further 35 basis points to finish at 91.11. Volume was also heavy, the September contract trading 12,418 lots. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, noted that Italian financial markets were used to political uncertainty, adding that lira weakness 'tends to be quite short-lived'. He said the lira was also suffering from the current environment of general D-Mark strength. The main influence on the dollar was the comments of Mr Fred Bergsten, the Washington economist with close ties to the Clinton administration. A long time dollar bear, Mr Bergsten told the Wall Street Journal that 'the yen is close to its peak and is probably going to turn around'. He said it could go to Y90 against the dollar, but would not stay there long if it did. Mr MacKinnon said the markets saw Mr Bergsten, 'rightly or wrongly, as the mouthpiece of the US Treasury'. Mr Bergsten said the markets would soon realise that Japan's trade surplus was going to shrink, and this would allow the dollar to stabilise at Y100-Y110. The market is now looking ahead to the Humphrey Hawkins testimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, tomorrow. But Mr MacKinnon said any references to the dollar were likely to be too bland to be useful. Overnight money traded between 4 and 6 per cent in the UK as the Bank of England provided Pounds 792m assistance to the money market after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 900m. In Germany, call money rates firmed slightly to 4.90 per cent from 4.80/4.85 per cent. Analysts said they still anticipate a further decline in the repo rate this week. Volumes were low and price movements small in the interest rate futures market. The December Eurosterling contract ended at 93.99 and the Euromark contract at 95.13.</p>

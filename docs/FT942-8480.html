			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Output of cars shows 2.2% rise UK car production rose 2.2 per cent in April to 115,753 from 113,301 in the corresponding month a year ago, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Output in the first four months of the year was virtually unchanged at 478,289, an increase of only 0.1 per cent from the 477,822 cars produced in the corresponding period last year. Production by Nissan at its Sunderland plant was sharply lower and production by Vauxhall and Ford also fell. These declines were compensated by a strong rise in production by Rover and the build-up of production from the new Toyota and Honda plants. Jaguar and IBC Vehicles, the General Motors/Isuzu joint venture which produces the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera, also increased output. Production of commercial vehicles strengthened in April with a year-on-year increase of 15 per cent to 17,535, while output in the first four months rose 5 per cent to 77,892, albeit from a very low level.</p>

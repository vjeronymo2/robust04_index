			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [No dateline as received] DPRK Foreign Minister  Kim Yong-nam accused the West of applying "double standards" in  its approach to nuclear problems. "When there is a question of  countries which Washington regards as docile, it turns a blind  eye to everything. If, however, insubordinate and defiant  countries are involved, the United States spreads false rumors  and disinformation, claiming they have seen and discovered  things even when they have not seen anything at all," he told  newsmen in Kiev.    The North Korean minister made this statement in the context  of international pressure on the DPRK because of its nuclear  program.    Pyongyang contends that it is only at talks with the United  States that a comprehensive solution can be found to problems of  the Korean peninsula. Only dialogue with Washington can help  the DPRK rejoin the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, the DPRK  says.    Kim Yong-nam said his government is looking into Russia's  proposal to hold an international conference on security and on  the nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula. [passage  omitted]</p>

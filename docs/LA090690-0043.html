			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WELLS FARGO MAY RESCIND FREE ATM USE;  </P> <P> BANKS: SERVICE FEE OF $1 COULD BE LEVIED FOR WITHDRAWING MONEY FROM ANOTHER  BANK OR SAVINGS-AND-LOAN MACHINE.  </P> <P> For the last two years, Wells Fargo has not charged customers its standard $1  service fee when they withdraw money from other banks' automated teller  machines in San Diego County.  </P> <P> But Wells Fargo may be changing that policy soon, reflecting financial  institutions' need for new ways to produce non-interest-generated revenue,  industry observers say.  </P> <P> Tom Byrne, Wells Fargo's vice president for marketing in Southern California,  says his bank's service-free policy for ATM use in San Diego may be terminated  later this year, after the San Francisco-based institution makes final its  acquisition of Great American Bank's California branches, including 64 in San  Diego County.  </P> <P> "That has been discussed. . . . No specific decision has been reached," but  free use of competitors' ATMs is not going to continue forever, Byrne said.  </P> <P> The profit squeeze being felt by many banks has changed their attitude toward  some of the free services offered up to now, said Gerry Findley, a Brea-based  banking consultant and editor of the Findley Report. "Their bottom lines are  under pressure (so) they're all looking at the charges for services they  provide in all areas."  </P> <P> Most banks in California already charge service fees of 75 cents to $1 when  their bank card customers use a competitor's ATM. They make the charges mainly  because the service is not free to the bank. "It's actually a very expensive  process going through other banks," said Chris Chenoweth, general counsel for  the California Bankers Assn. in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo, for example, belongs to the San Diego-based STAR System network of  ATMs, which charges the bank a fee when its customers use another bank's ATM  for a transaction. A certain part of the fee then goes to the bank whose ATM  was used.  </P> <P> "There's a cost to Wells Fargo (and waiving service fees) could wind up being  very expensive to the bank," Chenoweth said.  </P> <P> But acquiring the Great American branches will eliminate Wells Fargo's primary  motive for the San Diego ATM policy, which was to compensate for the lack of  "locational convenience" the bank offered its San Diego customers.  </P> <P> Before the acquisition, Wells Fargo had so few branches that "we elected to  provide this (service), at least on a temporary basis. . . . We just didn't  offer the same convenience" in terms of branches or ATMs as other banks in the  county, Byrne said.  </P> <P> After the Great American branch acquisition is complete, "you probably won't be  able to drive six blocks without finding a Wells Fargo Bank in San Diego," he  added. There will be at least two or three Wells Fargo ATMs at every bank  location in the county, including the branches acquired from Great American.  </P> <P> "It was a temporary kind of thing, (and) we did it for a very specific reason,"  Byrne said. "It probably would make some sense to make some modifications to it  now."  </P> <P> Wells Fargo operated 18 branches in San Diego County two years ago, when it  introduced the service-free transaction program. Now the bank has 24 branches  in the county with an estimated $1.6 billion in deposits.  </P> <P> The addition of customers from the 64 Great American branches, whose local  deposits amount to an estimated $5.5 billion, will give Wells Fargo a combined  deposit base of $7.1 billion, more than any other financial institution in the  county.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo officials would not disclose how many individual accounts or  depositors the bank has at its San Diego County branches, nor how many it is  gaining through the Great American deal. Historically, the  savings-and-loan-dominated San Diego market has been a tough one for banks like  Wells Fargo.  </P> <P> One bank that does impose service fees for transactions done on non-proprietary  machines is Security Pacific.  </P> <P> "There's a hard dollar cost to the institution," said Michael Occhino, a first  vice president who manages Security Pacific's Electronic Delivery Division.  "Customers don't have a problem with reasonable prices for services."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, some banks have been willing to provide service-free transactions  as a way to attract customers.  </P> <P> Banks "love to be able to use (free ATM use) for marketing," Findley said.  </P> <P> Byrne emphasized that Wells Fargo's policy in the county was aimed strictly at  satisfying existing customers.  </P> <P> "We never advertised it," Byrne said. "We didn't use it as an offensive tool.  And the reason we didn't was that we didn't intend for it to last forever and  ever and ever."  </P> <P> Some banks have been willing to absorb the expenses because it would cost too  much for them to purchase and maintain enough ATMs to satisfy their customers,  said STAR Systems president Ronald Congemi. "It's a strategic pricing  decision."  </P> <P> But Congemi said he thinks many of the West Coast banks that have not charged  service fees will soon be following the practice of most U.S. banks, which is  to charge fees for such transactions.  </P> <P> "The trend was actually quite late in hitting the West Coast," he said,  attributing the delay to the sluggish development of local and regional ATM  networks in the West.  </P> <P> Even if banks that have not charged transaction fees do reconsider their  policies, as Wells Fargo has in San Diego, some customers may continue to have  access to conditional service-free ATM use.  </P> <P> For example, Great American does not charge its customers to use other banks'  ATMs if the customers maintain a balance of more than $20,000 in their combined  personal accounts. Great American has also waived fees for customers who live  in areas where their local branches do not have Great American ATMs.  </P> <P> However, these policies may change after Great American's California branches  are acquired by Wells Fargo, Great American spokesman Brian Luscomb said.  </P> <P> "That's a Great American policy. . . . The branches will be Wells Fargo  branches and subject to their practices and procedures" after the acquisition,  Luscomb said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] The fate of the Russian-U.S. joint command and staff  exercises on the Totskoye test range near Orenburg remains  unclear. There is a fairly broad range of opinions being voiced  on this issue. At times it is even acquiring a fashionable  political nuance. Here, however, is the opinion of Army General  Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister:    [Begin Grachev recording] What a rumpus has now been raised  about these exercises! We signed the agreement a year ago, and  everyone remained silent. Now certain people have suddenly  remembered them and there has been a hullabaloo in the State  Duma, and there has been a stir at government level, and even in  the [Russian Federation] Security Council. Advice is being  extended to the president. Boris Nikolayevich and I have also  discussed this issue and what approach to take to it.    If we really want mutually to get the enemy image out of our  heads and really move step-by-step toward partnership, the  exercises are, of course, necessary. Let the young American set  his eyes on the young Russian. Let them have contact with one  another. Let them tell each other about their lives. What, in  the final analysis, is wrong in that? Moreover, they are not  war exercises in the pure sense, but peacekeeping command and  staff exercises, peacekeeping exercises, and, if we really  respect one another and respect those people for whose sake we  are engaging in peacekeeping activities, then even at the moral  level these exercises should be held.

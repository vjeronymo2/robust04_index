Earlier Wednesday, Song Yong-tae, chief South Korean  delegate  to the inter-Korean working-level contact, sent a telephone  message to his North Korean counterpart, Pak Yong-su, accepting  a North Korean counterproposal to hold the meeting Thursday.    With the meeting, Seoul plans to announce the suspension of  the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise "Team Spirit," on  condition that an International Atomic Energy Agency team starts  inspecting North Korean nuclear facilities and a special envoy  exchange between the Koreas takes place.    The South Korean side is also expected to convey President  Kim Yong-sam's desire to hold a summit with President Kim  Il-song as soon as possible and Seoul's willingness to send its  special envoy to Pyongyang first, the sources said.    Song will be accompanied by Chang Chae-yong, director  general  of the American Affairs Bureau at the Foreign Ministry, and Kim  Il-mu, a councilor at the prime minister's office, as members of  the Southern delegation to Thursday's contact, the sources said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ) wishes to take part in the next government as  a strong party, so as to be able to enforce its own programme,  SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto told a Budapest rally tonight. The  Free Democrats are not prepared to play "second fiddle" in the  government. They hope that the new government to be formed  after the May parliamentary elections will rely more on  expertise, Peto said.    In his view, the governing coalition can be dismissed not  only by the Socialist Party but also by the liberal bloc  composed of the SZDSZ, the Federation of Young Democrats, the  Entrepreneurs' Party, and the Agrarian Association.    Campaign manager Balint Magyar said that the election  campaign is harsher now than it was four years ago. This  harshness is reflected mainly by certain programmes aired by the  state radio and television. In reply to a question, Peto said  that, should the Free Democrats come to power, they would not  intervene in the internal affairs of the two media. The deputy  presidents of the state radio and television would be dismissed,  not for political reasons, but because they have proved  themselves unfit for managing the public service media in an  unbiased way.</p>

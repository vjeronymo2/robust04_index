			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Japan and EC start trade talks THE EC Commission and Japan will hold their first meeting of trade experts in Tokyo this month, in an attempt to ease friction over Japan's growing trade surplus with the EC. The February 23 meeting will look at why Japan's trade surplus with the EC is widening. After a second meeting, the results will be reported to Japan-EC sub-cabinet level talks scheduled for April. The decision to hold the talks comes amid growing EC concern over its deteriorating trade balance with Japan. At a meeting of European businessmen on Tuesday, Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, made clear his concern. He urged Japan to make more effort to remove structural barriers to trade and create an environment in which European companies could compete on equal terms with their Japanese competitors. Japan's trade surplus with Europe increased 14 per cent to a record Dollars 31.18bn (Pounds 20.6bn), according to Japanese government estimates last month. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Japan was increasing efforts to stimulate imports from the EC and expected to see a gradual improvement.</p>

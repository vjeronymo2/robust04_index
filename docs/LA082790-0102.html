Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> FIGHTER PLANE TAKES FIRST FLIGHT  </P> <P> The battle among aerospace firms to build the Air Force's advanced tactical  fighter became an air war today as a Northrop-McDonnell Douglas team got its  version off the ground first.  </P> <P> The twin-engine YF-23 took off from Edwards Air Force Base at 7:16 a.m. and  joined two chase planes on a flight that lasted about 50 minutes.  </P> <P> Test pilot Paul Metz, 44, took the jet to 25,000 feet and 333 m.p.h., but  didn't push its capabilities.  </P> <P> The ATF will cost about $51 million per plane, almost twice as much as the F-15  Eagle, the Air Force's current top fighter.  </P></p>

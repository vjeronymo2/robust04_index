			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Director General of  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Hans Blix arrived  here today for talks with senior Iranian officials on the issue  of nuclear power plants in the country.    During the two-day visit, Blix is expected to discuss  cooperation between the IAEA and Iran's Atomic Energy  Organization.    While in Tehran, the IAEA head will hold talks with First  Vice- President Hasan Habibi and other senior Iranian officials.    According to earlier official reports, Iran has started the  construction of the nuclear power plant in the southern province  of Bushehr with the assistance of Russian experts.    Iran also said that the construction of another nuclear  power  plant with the help of Chinese experts had also started in  southwestern Iran.    However, both China and Russia denied the reports. A Chinese  official said that the contract has not yet come into effect  because of Iran's economic problem.    A Russian diplomat said that cooperation between Russia and  Iran in building the nuclear power plant is still on the stage  of negotiations.    But, an Iranian source said that an agreement was reached  with Russia months ago on the construction of the first phase of  the nuclear power plant with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.</p>

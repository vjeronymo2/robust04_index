			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Belarus bans foreign currency The Belarus government, which until recently was pressing for monetary union with the Russian rouble, has banned its use, along with other foreign currency in all cash and domestic transactions. The Belarus rouble will be the sole means of payment in retail trade by the end of the year and enterprises have to comply with the order within a week. Russia approved a similar move earlier this year, outlawing the common practice of many shops to quote prices in dollars or other convertible currencies. Belarus's first post-Soviet government lobbied for monetary union with the Russian rouble but central banks in both countries dismissed the arrangement as unworkable and President Alexander Lukashenko has dropped the proposal since his election in July. The 'anti-crisis' programme approved by the Belarus parliament earlier this month plans to cut monthly inflation to 7-8 per cent by next June and reduce the budget deficit. Inflation last month stood at 25 per cent, down from 53 per cent in August.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Japan warns US chip makers over imports pressure JAPAN'S electronics industry might reduce its purchases of US semiconductors if the US applies 'too much' pressure for increased imports, Japanese government officials warned yesterday. The warning follows Washington's decision to review the US-Japan chip pact and examine ways of improving exporters' access to the Japanese market, where the foreign share has hovered at 14 per cent for the past year. Tokyo fears chips will be targeted by Washington during the US presidential election campaign, in an attempt to show the Bush administration has been tough on trade with Japan. The two countries disagree over interpreting the pact, signed last year and replacing a 1986 agreement. Japan says the wording provides no market share guarantees; the US chip industry argues the pact needs at least 20 per cent foreign share by the end of this year. At the end of last year, the foreign share was 14.4 per cent, with little chance the 20 per cent figure will be reached. A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said: 'If this review doesn't just look at market share and creates a better understanding about the long-term relationship between the two industries, we think it may have a good effect.' If Washington applied unnecessary pressure, the official said, Japanese companies would be 'discouraged' and might cut their purchases of foreign chips. He blamed the stalled market share on the slowing of the domestic economy and inability of medium-sized US makers to penetrate the Japanese market. The Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ), which is due to meet US chip industry representatives in Tokyo next week, said some US companies had sold their chips in Japan, but others have failed to meet customer specifications. 'A Japanese customer was looking for small and thin chips, but found US semiconductor companies could not make it. We are collecting stories like that,' the EIAJ said.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Economics: The search for confidence boosting measures in Lamont's Budget IN BRITAIN the week will be dominated by the Budget. Tomorrow, at around 3.30pm Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will rise to deliver a speech that, in all probability, will launch the campaign for the general election, expected now on April 9. Tax cuts totalling Pounds 2-4bn have been widely tipped with speculation focusing on a 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax. Despite the government's need to break ahead in the opinion polls, a tax cutting package of more than Pounds 4bn would upset the financial markets. But with scant evidence to suggest an upturn in the economy, analysts will be looking for confidence boosting measures in the Budget to spur ever cautious consumers. Tomorrow is also Super Tuesday - a big day for US politics with several presidential primaries on the same day. A bad result for Mr Bush will indicate the depth of the electorate's dissatisfaction over the administration's handling of the economy. However, retail sales figures for February are expected to increase marginally, with the growth probably coming from a pick up in auto sales as well as household fixtures and building products in line with January's surge in home sales. Furthermore, the week's producer price data for February should reflect a favourable outlook on inflation. In January the producer prices index fell by 0.6 per cent on the year, to its lowest rate since January 1987. There is also news on retail sales in Germany this week with January's figure expected to show a slight decline on the same month of 1991. According to research by Midland Montagu the squeeze on real disposable incomes from the mid-year 7.5 per cent tax surcharge, rising inflation and high interest rates have begun to dampen consumer demand after last year's very buoyant sales. Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of city forecasts in brackets from MMS international, a financial information company, include: Today: UK, January credit business (net repayment of Pounds 75m): Canada, January motor vehicle sales, January housing starts, December wages and salaries.

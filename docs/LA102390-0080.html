			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> BIDDING REOPENED ON SCHOOL PROJECT  </P> <P> Because of an administrative error, the Santa Paula Union High School board  decided Monday to reopen bidding for a $2-million renovation of several older  buildings.  </P> <P> When school district officials asked for bids earlier this fall, they did not  know of a change in California law requiring contractors to be licensed when  they submit a bid, officials said.  </P> <P> Previously, contractors had been required to have their licenses in order by  the time work began, school Supt. Carolina Erie said.  </P> <P> The school board accepted the lowest bid at its meeting two weeks ago. But the  decision was challenged by another contractor, who maintained that the firm  offering the low bid did not have a proper license. Until that time, the  administrator said, the district was unaware of the change in the law, which  was enacted in July.  </P> <P> The action to reopen the bidding was taken at a special meeting Monday on the  advice of the district's counsel.  </P> <P> The renovation at the high school includes new windows and improvements to  electrical, plumbing and heating systems in the girls' gymnasium, the  industrial arts building and classrooms on the upper campus. The repairs are to  be paid for with state and local funds, officials said. AMELIA CHAFFEE  </P></p>

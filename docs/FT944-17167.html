			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / A morning outing in Mitteleuropa Having a couple of days to spare between meetings in Frankfurt and Vienna, I decided to spend the intervening weekend in Prague, and to visit a colleague in Bratislava on an outing from Vienna. Prague is now a boom town, relatively inexpensive by comparison with other European cities. It is awash not only with US tourists, but with young Americans living there. Indeed it reminded me of what I had read of Paris in the 1920s, where American writers were attracted both by the cultural atmosphere and the favourable exchange rate. By contrast the Slovak republic seems to sell itself short. Gone is the hourly tramcar which rolled between Vienna and Bratislava before the second world war. If you do not want to take a train before breakfast, the only way to make a lunchtime appointment in the Slovak capital is by the 9am hydrofoil, which I needed no urging to take. I went on one of those brilliant autumn days when the Danube seemed, if not blue, at least bright grey. Nearly all the journey is through a dull flat Austrian stretch. Then suddenly a ridge, known optimistically as the Little Carpathians, appears. A fort perched on a hill emerges on the left, followed by a modern bridge, behind which one sees some communist-type structures and an 18th century baroque city in the background. You are in Malcolm Bradbury's Slaka. The military types at the customs station would have made the 'good soldier Schweik' seem smart by comparison. All this was great fun for the tourist from the last still-working socialist economy (Austria). But Bratislava itself was spruce and clean and the people uninhibited and friendly. Yet it is difficult to find information on Bratislava in Vienna, though it is less than 40 miles down the river. And even in a top Bratislava hotel I could only find a very brief business guide which said nothing about the many picturesque baroque buildings which make the old town into a well-preserved Hapsburg city, which would be a main tourist attraction if it were in Austria, the Czech lands or Hungary. What I found more surprising was that I could not buy a copy of the Financial Times or even order a cup of coffee with Czech korunas at the (now French-owned) hotel, even though they are the more valuable variety. Nor were Austrian schillings or D-Marks acceptable. So I had to go to the cashier to buy some Slovak korunas, which I had to purchase with schillings. He explained that under an agreement between the two countries only Czechs could change Czech into Slovak korunas. I wondered whether the hotel behaviour showed that some people were prepared to pay a price in lost receipts to satisfy national pride. So I naturally offered Czech korunas to a waiter, a barman and taxi driver, all of whom readily accepted them. My train back to Vienna was due before I could continue the experiment. Travellers are officially not allowed to bring either Czech or Slovak korunas into or out of either country. Nor is there much point in trying to do so, as the official rates are pretty near those prevailing in the inactive grey markets. In fact the frontier police did not ask me any questions about currency either on my way to or from the Czech Republic. But when I took the train back from Bratislava to Vienna, I was asked by a courteous young man in smart military uniform (no Schweik he) whether I had any Slovak korunas. I showed him my wallet containing 240 (worth about Pounds 5). He told me (in German) that 100 korunas was the limit. When I held out the remainder to him interrogatively, he smiled and told me to keep it all. He even politely shrugged off a tip of 40 korunas. The Czech koruna has obviously been stronger than the Slovak variety. Since May 1993, it has been fixed against a basket with a 65 per cent share for the D-Mark and 35 per cent for the US dollar. But the result has been scarcely distinguishable from shadowing the D-Mark - the most grievous sin in the book, according to Lady Thatcher, who otherwise so admires Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister. Since the 10 per cent devaluation of mid-1993, the Slovak koruna has also been stable and growth has resumed. If Vladimir Meciar, the nationalist election victor, is wise, he will not undermine the progress made.</p>

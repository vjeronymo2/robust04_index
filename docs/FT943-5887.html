			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Market surge helps Iscor jump by 81% A surging local market and higher export prices have allowed Iscor, South Africa's largest iron and steel company, to report a dramatic improvement in earnings after four years of decline, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. Attributable earnings for the 12 months to June rose by 81 per cent to R512m (Dollars 113m), up from R283m a year ago, Turnover for the year rose 9 per cent to R9.82bn. Iscor also reported a positive cash flow for the first time since it listed four years ago. Net debt dropped R401m to R1.72bn from R2.1bn while the debt/equity ratio improved to 24.9 per cent from 33.2 per cent. Mr Hans Smith, managing director, said a 6.4 per cent increase in local sales volumes had fuelled the rise. He also noted that the decline in the rand/dollar exchange rate had combined with an improved steel price to increase export earnings. Mr Smith said overall costs had been reduced and capital expenditure had fallen 20 per cent to R498m, from R622m.</p>

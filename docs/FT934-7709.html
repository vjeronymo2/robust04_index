			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (5): An exhaustive and wearying process - Economic decision-making WHEN CHINA was grappling earlier this year with the vexed issue of what to do about an overheating economy, no fewer than seven ministers from the economic sphere were despatched on inspection tours of the provinces. Among these senior officials was Mr Liu Zhongli, the finance minister, who visited the booming coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. It was a salutary experience for Mr Liu who discovered widespread misuse of funds and a flouting of central government edicts by banks and by provincial officials. 'I was shocked by certain phenomena,' said Mr Liu of the practice of banks to ignore credit plans which required certain funds to be set aside for payments to farmers and also for key infrastructure projects. Instead, money was being shovelled into real estate ventures, often through trust and investment companies set up by the banks themselves. 'Personally, I went to the banks and checked their records,' said Mr Liu. 'I also went to construction sites to find out how money was being spent.' Among proposed ventures that came to light was one for the construction of no fewer than 10 golf courses. The economic decisions that emerged in early July to calm an overheating economy and bring order to a chaotic financial system, included a specific ban on the construction of new golf courses. In the West, the idea of the finance minister thumbing through the records of local financial institutions would seem laughable, but in China, the inspection tour remains a tradition. Mr Liu's tour of Fujian and Zhejiang, as part of a fairly exhaustive process, which eventually yielded the 16-point stabilisation plan of mid-year, reveals how economic decisions are still made in China. The process remains cumbersome, owing more to tradition than to modern methods of economic management, even in these days of glib use by Chinese officials of economic jargon that would have no place in Marxist textbooks. Implementation of the austerity programme after problems of overheating surfaced last year, began effectively at a work conference held last December in Beijing and presided over by Mr Jiang Zemin, the general secretary of the Communist party. But it was not until May this year that alarm bells really began ringing at the centre, and this was after Mr Liu and his fellow ministers reported back on the extent of the problem. Much time had been wasted since the Beijing conference, thus risking a more severe retrenchment than might have been necessary if prompter action had been taken. When the state council, China's cabinet, met in May to consider a report of the state planning commission, time for action was already overdue. Indeed, there was little argument at that meeting about the need for drastic measures to calm the economy, and to put a stop to the rot at provincial level that was eating away at Beijing's control, and playing havoc with central government finances. The state council laid down broad proposals for bringing order to the economy, and these were passed on to the standing committee of the Communist party's ruling politburo for approval. But it was left to Mr Zhu Rongji, as the senior Vice-Premier in charge of the economy to formulate detailed plans. These were the product of consultations among key economic policy-making elements of government, such as the People's Bank and the finance and trade ministries, and also among the various commissions and agencies concerned with the economy. These include, apart from the State Planning Commission, the Economic and Trade Commission, the Commission for Economic Restructuring, and the Development Research Centre under the state council. Another important element in the decisionmaking process that spawned the 16-point austerity plan and the proposed reforms of the financial sector was advice from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. A conference, jointly organised by the World Bank and the Commission for Economic Restructuring, held in June in the northern city of Dalian helped refine some of the ideas that were being formulated by the bureaucracy. CLOSER consultation with international institutions increasingly is a feature of Chinese decision-making. Ultimately, however, recommendations and ideas were distilled by a body which tends not to appear on organisational charts, that is, the Central Committee's leading group on finance and the economy presided over by Mr Zhu. This supra-ministerial organisation, effectively signs off on key economic policy decisions which are then referred to the Politburo and State Council for formal approval. The process by which economic decisions are made in China, especially where there might be risk of social and economic dislocation, is exhaustive and exhausting. Like any bureaucracy, China's is riven by competing ambitions and policy differences. Factional rivalries among leadership contenders are often played out in the musty corridors of the ministries, commissions and agencies listed above. While Mr Zhu appears shrewdly to have strengthened his hand over key ministries and agencies like the People's Bank of which he is the governor, he still faces significant opposition from conservatives in bodies such as the State Planning Commission, whose own previously all-powerful role has been diminished by the market reforms.</p>

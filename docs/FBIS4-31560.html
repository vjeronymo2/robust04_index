			<p>BFN     [Text] During the weekly news conference of the Civic  Alliance Party [PAC] today, Party Chairman Nicolae Manolescu  read out a declaration that describes the principles proposed by  the steering collegium of the party to reorganize the Democratic  Convention of Romania [CDR] so that it could become a  competitive part of the Romanian political class.    In that sense, the following things are suggested: the  transformation of the CDR into a strong alliance of political  parties able to make political and postelectoral offers on the  basis of a joint political platform; the separation of non-party  associations and their transformation into a civil forum  supporting the CDR by undertaking specific actions; the  structuring of the CDR into central political leading bodies,  working bodies, and local bodies; the making of decisions within  the CDR solely on the basis of consensus; the working out of a  protocol on the ways to participate in elections; the working  out of terms regarding postelectoral cooperation; and the  establishing of ethical rules referring to interparty relations  within the CDR.    The declaration also states that the sole way to solve  certain tensions that have emerged among the democratic  opposition is to sincerely and responsibly approach the ways in  which the CDR could be reorganized, reports our correspondent,  Iulia Gherman.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Arts: Mozart and Donizetti comedies - English Touring Opera It may seem difficult to keep track of the touring opera companies in Britain. This is a world in a constant state of revolution: Kent Opera was guillotined a few years ago and the axe now hangs threateningly over the activities of Glyndebourne Touring Opera, despite the widespread success it has always enjoyed. English Touring Opera (formerly called Opera 80) has so far kept both its head and its grant. The company would seem to want to cheer up its audiences in the regions and this autumn's tour, which started last week at the Theatre Royal, Bath, again features a pair of comedies. The not very successful version of Mozart's Cos fan tutte from the spring has been paired with a new production of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore. They work in virtually opposite fashions. For the Donizetti, Stephen Medcalf has based his production on an unpromising premise, which turns out more entertaining than by rights it should. He has set Donizetti's Latin comedy among the golden fields of the American corn-belt. The villagers have become farm-hands working on the harvest. The army platoon commanded by Belcore rides in as the cavalry, with distinctive dark blue jackets and red neckerchiefs. None of this has any significant point to make and Medcalf soon loses interest in it. What makes English Touring Opera L'elisir d'amore an enchanting and amusing evening is the very natural performances of the lead roles, especially the delightful Nemorino of Niall Morris. Boyish, tender, unspoilt in every way, he has everything this part demands, except the top notes, which arrive more by dint of determination than technique. Every scene between him and Mary Plazas's bright Adina touched the heart. The one link with the American theme is Belcore, strongly sung by Adrian Clarke and played as a bubblegum-chewing, super-confident man of action, whose idea of winning a woman is to lassoe her with his riding whip. Jonathan May's Dulcamara, less a sharp operator than a shambolic no-hoper, did not really work; more of the Italian buffo's traditional role, to sparkle with his patter and entertain, should have been retained. So long as he held stage and pit together, Andrew Greenwood was in charge of a lively performance. By English Touring Opera generally praiseworthy standards it was not an impressive production and yet it touched a nerve. One sensed that Donizetti felt for Nemorino - a shy, unassuming young man, always ignored, always undervalued - and a serious social issue lurked below the comic surface. The production of Cos fan tutte operates in reverse. A clever idea is there at the start: to play out this 'school for lovers' in a present-day art school, where students of life drawing learn about the different anatomy of the sexes. But within a couple of scenes its dramatic potential has been frittered away, reducing all Mozart's depth of emotion and understanding into the shallowest of silly farces. The English Touring Opera cast has a couple of practised comic performers, but also its share of weak singing. Fortunately, Martin Andre whips the music along so fast that the end is always in sight. The tour moves on via Halifax, York, Buxton and Canterbury, and continues until 4 December</p>

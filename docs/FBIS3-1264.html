There is a disheartening scene in Bujumbura with  streets strewn with mutilated bodies.    Meanwhile, the presidential palace has been surrounded since  last night by Army armored vehicles. In a radio broadcast  yesterday, President Cyprien Ntaryamira appealed for calm and  national reconciliation, but his appeal has apparently not been  heeded since people continued to be massacred throughout the  night.

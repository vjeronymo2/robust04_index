			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Management: When it comes to the crunch - Moves to reduce road accidents in Brazil Anyone who has experienced Brazilian roads and survived can appreciate why the country holds the world record for traffic accidents. Driving licences are more often bought than earned. The results are predictably gruesome - 55,000 deaths per year - as many as if a Boeing 737 dropped out of the sky every day. This daily carnage is also a costly headache for Brazilian industrialists who rely heavily on road freight to cover the country's continental proportions and few of whom have insurance because of its extortionate cost. Omar Carneiro Cunha, president of Shell Brasil, says: 'We have 3,300 trucks and cars driving millions of miles on some of the most hazardous roads in the world, so the risks are enormous.' As many Brazilian executives are discovering, road accidents form a large component of business costs. Yearly losses through traffic accidents are estimated at Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) and rising. Moreover, although the state of Brazilian roads is appalling after a decade of no investment, government statistics show 85 per cent of traffic accidents are through driver fault and thus avoidable. An increasing number of companies is consequently including as an essential part of restructuring, 'defensive driving programmes' for truck drivers, (both in-house and contracted), salesforce and personnel in general with spectacular results. 'The pay-offs are tremendous,' says Cunha, pointing out that Shell has halved the number of avoidable fatalities per 100m km driven since launching a road Safety programme in 1987. The strategy is simple and costs little. At Shell, a safety department was set up and consultants brought in to develop a short training course. Tarcisio Mosci, who runs the programme, explains: 'However good your hardware, there is a number of accidents caused by software so rather than focusing on the lorries we focused on people.' A specially produced video shows drivers the normal daily chaos on a Brazilian highway in graphic detail, enabling them to recognise all the errors they themselves make. 'Monitor drivers' were appointed, each responsible for 30 motorists. A list of 30 points was compiled to be checked before setting off, and all drivers underwent eye-tests. Quality groups were created for drivers and Shell representatives to exchange ideas, involving senior executives to demonstrate the importance of the scheme. More than half the trucking companies contracted by Shell were sacked because they did not come up to scratch. Some 800 drivers per year pass through the course, which has cut the number of avoidable fatalities from 15.6 per 100m km driven in 1987 to 7.8 by 1991. To improve on this, Mosci is setting up a programme focusing on speed control and based at regional centres, aiming to reduce the figure by a further 50 per cent by the end of next year. The reduction in costs is considerable, given that Mosci estimates that even under the improved figures, Shell and its contracted companies spent Dollars 10m on accident costs last year. Moreover, he adds: When you can control risk in a situation as adverse as Brazil's traffic climate, then you have good management in general.' A similar programme has been under way since 1990 at Hering Textile, Brazil's leading textiles manufacturer, reducing losses through accidents by more than half to Dollars 50,126 a year. Osvaldo Lopes, risk manager for Herco, the Hering Group's in-house insurers, which developed an eight-hour programme that more than 2,000 employees have attended, explains: 'The problem in Brazil, aside from the dreadful roads, is that most drivers have not been taught.' But both Lopes and Mosci admit there is a limit to how much they can achieve in reducing accident costs without a national campaign on road safety awareness among Brazil's 15m motorists.</p>

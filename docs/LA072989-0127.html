			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> Don Cribb, the Santa Ana resident who formed the 16-member Santa Ana Council of  Arts and Culture in December, has a new project in the works -- an exhibit of  the "high-tech" works of Los Angeles artist David Hockney that will open Sept.  2 at the Modern Museum of Art in Santa Ana. Cribb, who owns an antiques  conservation business in Los Angeles, said he has been a friend of Hockney's  since the late '60s. The 59 photo-collages and recent prints in the show will  come mostly from Hockney's own collection. Included are a group of color laser  prints of some of his paintings and experimental prints produced on a Canon  copier and a FAX machine. The exhibit's emphasis is due to the widespread  Orange County interest in technology and information dissemination, Cribb said,  adding that he wanted the show to be in Santa Ana because he believes that  "there should be a major (contemporary art) presence in central county."  Educational materials for the exhibit will be developed by Hockney's studio,  Cribb said. The approximately $25,000 cost of the show, which closes Nov. 6,  will be funded by Parducci Wine Cellars.  </P></p>

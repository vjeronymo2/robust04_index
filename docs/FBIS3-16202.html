			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The People's Movement of Belarus Coordinative  Committee [KKNDB] has appealed to political parties,  organizations, and all people of good will, "to whom the fate of  nations is precious," to proclaim 17 March 1994 as a day of  united action aimed at restoring the USSR.    According to the authors of the "Appeal to Nations of the  Former USSR," which RID has recently received, this day should  mark the beginning of activities aimed at a voluntary  restoration of the USSR. Over the last three years since the 17  March 1991 referendum, reads the document, people have realized  "that they have been sold for the benefit of international  capital and interests of the United States; deprived of the  united motherland, friendship, peace, and accord; and thrown  into the abyss of war, lawlessness, and spiritual and material  impoverishment, and that the country has been reduced to a zone  of cheap labor, raw materials, and `dirty' production, as well  as a dumping ground for industrial waste."    The KKNDB believes that at rallies, meetings, and pickets on  17 March, people should categorically voice demands to fulfill  their will, which was expressed three years ago and ignored by  "the democrats and national-extremists" who came to power.</p>

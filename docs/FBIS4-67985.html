			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is the 45th in a series of  editorial reports on political Islam in Egypt. These reports  include summaries of all articles, reports, interviews,  commentaries, or other items on political Islam that have been  published in all the issues of Cairo newspapers 'AQIDATI,  AL-NUR, and AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH since late December 1993 and  most issues of the twice-weekly newspaper AL-SHA'B. Unless  otherwise indicated, no further processing of the items  summarized below has been done or is planned.    This editorial report reviews the 22 April issue of  AL-SHA'B.  <H5>  Asyut Group Escalates Operations, Suhaj Group Seeks Dialogue </H5>   A 350-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi and 'Adil al-Bahnasawi  on  pages 1 and 7 says that the Islamic Group has claimed  responsibility for the assassination of Brigadier General Shirin  'Ali Fahmi, commander of Asyut security forces, and his  bodyguard. "In a statement faxed to AL-SHA'B" the group said  this was "the sixth in a series of operations to confront human  right violations in prisons."    The report cites a statement issued by the Islamic Group in  Suhaj "denouncing violence and the killing of innocent people,"  originally published in the London-based AL-HAYAH. Issued at a  seminar in Suhaj, Upper Egypt, the statement affirms that the  Islamic Group "does not object to engaging in any dialogue to  solve problems" and that "it calls for laying down arms,  renouncing violence, and resorting to law, reason, and logic to  contain the crisis."    The report also notes that "the security service in Asyut  has  discovered a detective in the Dayrut police station who  cooperates with the Islamic Group." The detained detective  revealed that "other officers are working for the Islamic  Group," the report says.  <H5>  Government Policies Seen as Cause for Violence </H5>   In a 2,000-word article on page 3, Dr. Rafiq Habib argues  that "terrorism has become an excuse for sustaining the ruling  regime and justifying Mubarak's continued to rule." He says  that the regime has divided Egyptian society into "terrorists  and non-terrorists," the latter being the government which,  protected by the law and the media, tightens its grip on all and  remains unaccountable.    Habib adds that it is wrong to believe the government media  campaign, which alleges that we are up against a terrorist  phenomenon financed by foreign states. He contends that this  campaign seeks to present the situation as a battle between the  Islamic groups and society, thereby authorizing the government  to play the role of the policeman who protects society. But the  truth is that these groups are against the government, not the  people; they are working to overthrow the regime.    The writer says "the armed Islamic protest" provides strong  evidence that "the regime is no longer capable of realizing  society's aspirations" and that the present policies divide  society and make violence the only effective approach.    Habib says that the problem lies in the fact that "we are  subject to imported values and are being ruled by a regime that  draws its legitimacy from Western systems at a time when our  original values are buried inside us." He adds that the  policies of the present [word illegible] are merely fulfilling  the aims of the West, from which the regime benefits in the form  of financial and political support.    Finally, he calls for rectifying the basic causes of unrest  and for reevaluating the government policy in order to avoid  further bloodshed. He advises the regime to ally with the  people instead of the West.</p>

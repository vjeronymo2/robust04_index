This indicates that there has been no change in the  Syrian proposals and views on the peace negotiations and topics  of discussion in these negotiations with the Israelis since U.S.  envoy Dennis Ross's visit to Damascus.    The Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the chain of  events since the stumbling Palestinian-Israeli agreement has  proved the Syrian views to be correct and demonstrated that  partial solutions do not establish peace in the region, that the  peace proposed by Syria is in harmony with the Security Council  resolutions and the essence of the U.S. initiative, and that the  Israelis should not believe that without such a peace the Middle  East could possibly emerge from the circle of wars, violence,  and disturbances.    The Syrian official accused Israel of obstructing any  progress in the peace process and of persisting in its practices  which are preventing the U.S. efforts from making any progress.  The Syrian official also said: Israel cannot continue to  pursue that line. It is very important that it should abide by  Security Council Resolution 904 and accept international  protection for the Palestinian people. It is also important  that it should, in future Washington negotiations, discuss the  future of the occupied territories and undertake to withdraw  from them.    He added that the Washington negotiations cannot go on for  ever and cannot remain as they are now. He said that Israel has  two options, namely peace and security or return to wars and the  law of the jungle. That is why the United States, which is  committed to peace, is requested to play the main part in  bringing about a change and in making Israel comply with the  basis of the peace process, that basis being the U.S. proposals.    The Syrian official pointed out that the massacres Israel is  committing against the Palestinian people can only mean that  Israel does not want peace, and that the failure to take any  serious and practical measures against the Israeli policy has  encouraged Rabin's government to commit more massacres and more  acts of terrorism, as confirmed when six people were martyred  and dozens wounded last Wednesday.    The Syrian official said that any progress in the peace  process will depend on ending Israel's disregard for the United  Nations and its resolutions.</p>

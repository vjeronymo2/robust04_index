In a pre-departure statement, Sha'th said that he will brief  President 'Arafat on the development in the Taba talks between  the Palestinians and Israelis.    Sha'th added that he will receive from 'Arafat his  directives  with regard to the coming round of the Palestinian-Israeli talks  scheduled to be held on Monday.    Speaking about the coming round of talks, Sha'th voiced hope  that the Israelis would not pose any obstacles before the  negotiations.    On the coming summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad  and U.S. President Bill Clinton, slated for tomorrow in Geneva,  Dr. Sha'th expressed optimism over such a meeting, adding that  it will open the door for Syria's return to the negotiations  table. If Israel expressed readiness to fully withdraw from the  Golan Heights, this would pave the way for Syria's return to the  talks, he said.    Sha'th added that there is a Palestinian continuous drive in  the peace process pointing out that 'Arafat met yesterday with  the ambassadors of the U.S. and Russia in Tunis, the co-sponsors  of the Middle East peace march.    Sha'th added that he had talks with the Norwegian foreign  undersecretary, who stressed his country's support for the  Palestinian cause and his readiness to offer any assistance to  make the negotiations a success.    Sha'th will take part in the meetings of the PLO Executive  Committee, due to open in Tunis today.</p>

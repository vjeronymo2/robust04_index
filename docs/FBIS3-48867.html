			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 January </F> Morning Edition]    [Text] Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister of  international trade and industry, in a news conference on 28  January revealed the outline of a draft agreement presented by  Japan at talks on the auto sector in the current round of  Japan-U.S. economic consultations. The main points are  proposals on the use import figures of finished automobiles by  Japan as objective criteria, and an evaluation of import  performance and discussion of remedial measures every six  months. But Okamatsu admitted there remained a big gap in views  between Japan and the United States, saying, "In the talks in  Washington early this week I could not see any change in the  U.S. demand for numerical targets, including future numbers."    The Japanese draft agreement proposes promoting cooperation  among private companies, and using as objective criteria import  figures for finished automobiles, the number of imported-auto  dealers, and figures on U.S.-made auto parts bought by Japanese  plants in the United States.    It proposes using as criteria only the numbers of actual  purchases in the past, and not quantity or the future growth  rate of automobile imports.    The draft also presents necessary future actions such as the  sale of right-hand drive cars by U.S. companies and  participation by U.S. parts makers in designing finished cars.  It proposes conducting regular evaluation to determine progress  in this area. Explaining the role of the government, Okamatsu  said, "It will not go beyond providing support for business  meetings and creating an atmosphere that encourages  private-sector cooperation, such as through the provision of  loans for the promotion of imports for instance."</p>

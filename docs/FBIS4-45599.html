			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent  environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan  Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 6 to 17 May.  <H5>  Ghana </H5>   The Volta River Authority [VRA] "banned activities like  farming, tree felling, bush burning, and charcoal production  along shores bordering the shoreline of the Volta Lake in six  districts." The districts are (Asujaman) Kpandu, (Jasikan),  Manya Krobo, (Fanti Akwa), and Kwahu South. A statement issued  in Accra yesterday by the VRA explained that these activities,  which have recently become rampant, are causing serious land  degradation along the lake. The statement said apart from  "degrading the environment, these activities have resulted in  soil erosion, earth movement, landslides, and silting at the  in-take area of the Akonsombo power plant. It noted that this  reduces the output of the power plant and also creates  maintenance problems for the VRA."    The statement further explained that bush burning in the  area  near the Akosomba dam and the port exposes the area to fire  hazards due to the storage and loading of petroleum products at  the port. The VRA appealed to "district assemblies and chiefs in  the affected areas to assist in the efforcement of the ban to  prevent further degradation of the environment around the lake."

The latter was accompanied by the executive secretary of the  Niger River Basin Authority. After the audience, Billo Soumana  spoke to Alhassan Al- Mohamed: "The Niger River Basin Authority  was established in 1964 with the objective of rational,  equitable, and sustainable management of the basin's water,  fisheries, and forest resources. Today, we are faced with a  problem, because the Niger River itself is dying. So the Niger  River Basin Authority must resume its activities in order to  salvage the river. We discussed the possibility of saving the  river, which is everything to us."    Responding to a question, the minister stated that the river  was being threatened by the low level of rainfall, and though  there could be no direct action concerning rainfall, the  environment could be restored. He disclosed that certain  sections of the river were silted, and that desilting projects  must be carried out and the basin protected. He added: "There  is another threat which is little known to Africans, and that is  the water hyacinth. This plant is unknown to Africans because  it originates from Latin America, and has just appeared in  Africa, threatening all our water resources." He concluded:  "Efforts by individual countries on their own stretches of the  river cannot save the river, and are doomed to fail if all the  other countries concerned do not take the same measures."  [Bamako Radiodiffusion du Mali in French 2000 GMT 17 May 94]  <H5>  Nigeria </H5>   The Delta State Government says "it needs about 4 billion  naira to effectively combat ecological and environmental  problems." The commissioner for works, housing and transport  announced this in Asaba when the staff and students of the  Administrative Staff College of Nigeria paid him a courtesy  call. He further said that "about 15 million naira would be  needed monthly to provide temporary relief from coastal erosion  and flooding." He used the occasion to urgently appeal to the  National Committee on Ecological Disasters to come to the aid of  the state, by providing the necessary financial and technical  assistance.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, BASAPRESS, 15/4/1994 -- The reunion of the  delegations of the CIS member states was held this morning. The  CIS presidents have met in the Kremlin and the prime ministers  in the President Hotel, says a Presidential Press Service  communique released from Moscow. After the meeting of the CIS  presidents, Mircea Snegur signed the document of joining the CIS  with the proper amendments. The amendments say that Moldova as  a CIS member will not participate in discussing problems  regarding collective security and military-political  collaboration. The meeting of prime ministers decided to create  a commission for economic cooperation. "It is very important to  sign the draft agreement regarding the creation of a free trade  zone. It is worth noting that Moldovan delegations were taken  into consideration. Most important is that the CIS states are  allowed to develop commercial ties with other countries beyond  the CIS. The session also signed the draft regarding the  Payments Union. This is, as Vice Premier Valentin Kunev said,  the first document that brings us closer to the economic union.  By elaborating the other agreements this union should be  supported. It insures a market for Moldovan output. The  document on labor migration and workers' social protection was  also signed. This document is very important for Moldova which  faces unemployment problems. By signing these agreements,  Moldovan citizens have the same rights as the citizens of the  state where they work." The prime minister examined the  agreement guaranteeing the rights of national and religious  minorities. The discussions over this agreement will be  continued in the second half of May. The declaration on  respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and  inviolability of the CIS member states' borders was also  discussed. Viktor Siniov, representative of eastern Moldova, was  among the members of the Moldovan delegation. According to  Kunev, Siniov took an active part in discussions and this shows  that the disagreements can be overcome. Beginning at 1400 the  presidents and premiers will meet to sign the agreements, says  the communique.</p>

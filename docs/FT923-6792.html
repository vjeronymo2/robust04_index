			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Ericsson returns to the black in second quarter ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, made a SKr422m (Dollars 79.2m) pre-tax profit for the second quarter of the year. This compares with a SKr363m loss made in the first quarter, caused mainly by cuts in telecommunications investments in Spain and Mexico. Over the first half of the year the company achieved a SKr59m pre-tax profit which compares with the SKr1.775bn profit it made for the same period of 1991. The company announced a 24 per cent increase in its order bookings for the first six months to SKr26.770bn from SKr21.550bn although there was a 10 per cent drop in net sales to SKr20.311bn from SKr22.463bn. Loss per share after tax and full conversion was SKr1.34 compared with income per share of SKr5.26 for the first six months of last year. The company said that the positive growth in higher order bookings would make a full impact on its net sales next year. Ericsson added that its 1992 profit forecast remained unchanged with a weak profit for the year as a whole. Mr Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson's president, said the company was 'well on the way' to a substantial revival and the latest results vindicated his decision to keep up research and development programmes in spite of falling demand last year. Although the second-quarter figures showed a financial improvement, he pointed out there had not been any 'direct recovery in the business climate'. However, Mr Ramqvist was able to point to the third successive quarter improvement in order bookings, mainly for telecommunications systems. Mr Ramqvist said that the rising order bookings were a direct result of the company's 'consistent technological development efforts', especially in digital systems and pocket telephones. This year Ericsson expected to improve its mobile phone sales by 50 per cent. He added he was 'particularly satisfied with the breakthrough in Japan' although net sales in that market will not be recorded until 1994. The company has been able to reduce its costs by 8 per cent this year as a result of its savings programme begun in 1991 which involved a cut in its 70,000-strong workforce of 6,000 people.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Observer: Warm glow Know your Financial Times, part 105. Back in February, Observer commented on a window-dressing technique perfected by Harvey Nichols, the Knightsbridge department store, which had commissioned some eye-catching sculptures made out of 100,000 old copies of the Pink'un. Jolly good they were too. Now a budding French artist, Josette Dacosta Bray, writes to say that she finds old copies of the FT glued together to be the ideal base for her acrylic paintings. She needs a base that is 'simultaneously rigid and dynamic' and after experimenting with various journals she picked the FT because of its 'broadsheet format and warm salmon-pink colour'. In return for this endorsement Observer feels duty bound to give a plug to Bray's exhibition at the French Cultural Centre in Oxford from October 23, especially since her husband, Nicholas, works for the FT's rival, The Wall Street Journal Europe.</p>

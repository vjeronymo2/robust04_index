			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel's intervention is low-key affair - Gatt chief is aware of his limited influence on the US and EC IF Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, is seen by the US as a French farm lobby stooge, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, is seen in France as a US stooge. That makes Mr Dunkel's mediation in the US-EC farm trade dispute, which took him to Brussels last week and to Washington yesterday, an especially cautious, low-key affair. His meetings in Washington, with Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, have been partly overtaken by resumption of US-EC negotiations aimed at reform of the EC's subsidised farm trade regime. Mr Madigan is due to meet Mr Ray MacSharry, his EC counterpart, in Washington tomorrow evening, the first time they have met since the Chicago talks collapsed on the eve of the US presidential election two weeks ago. It will be necessary to wait until after the Madigan-MacSharry meetings to learn if the much-needed farm trade breakthrough can be won. But that does not render Mr Dunkel's intermediation irrelevant. His presence in Washington reminds US and EC farm negotiators that more is at stake than farm products trade. Mr Dunkel was mandated to travel to Brussels and Washington by the other 106 contracting parties to Gatt, all frustrated by US-EC intransigence on farm trade reform and alarmed continued deadlock will imperil the Uruguay Round. Economists say these reforms could add Dollars 200bn (Pounds 132bn) to world trade by the end of the decade. More immediately, they could provide a fillip to Europe's recession-ridden economies, as well as boosting export hopes for many third world exporters which continue to be barred from many industrial markets. Most important, they would avert a threatened US-EC trade war that would quickly embroil the rest of the world. Mr Dunkel will try to set the stage for a rapid return by trade negotiators to Geneva if a US-EC breakthrough is achieved later this week. The return of negotiations into Gatt's multilateral context would first aim to win wider international support for any US-EC farm reform package agreed bilaterally. It would then provide urgent impetus to wider negotiations on market access, trade in services and protection of intellectual property which have to be completed under extreme time pressure. Hardly any progress has been made here since Mr Dunkel's draft Uruguay round pact, the so-called 'final act', was published last December. Some have said Mr Dunkel received perfunctory attention in Brussels last week. His meeting lasted one hour. Observers said EC officials are not keen for him to be seen to have too much influence. Mrs Hills caught some of the same mood when she said on US TV: 'He is going to implore us, having implored the EC, to try to get the Uruguay Round talks to move forward.' Mr Dunkel is unlikely to be perturbed by such put-downs. He is aware of his limited influence, and has agreed to mediate only because of signs the EC and US want to settle their differences. He emerged from Brussels convinced the EC is 'prepared to do a deal'. Whether his confidence is justified or not, only meetings later this week will clarify. IN their battle to keep Common Agriculture Policy subsidies, French farmers have had allies in farm groups around the world who believe as fervently that protection is needed to maintain their sectors, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. Farm groups in the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and Europe keep in close touch on Uruguay Round developments. Many applaud French farmers' resistance to farm trade liberalisation, believing each country must keep its own agriculture sector and the emphasis on exports by lowest-cost producers harms food supply and environment. Much of the activity is co-ordinated by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minnesota. An official said farmers worldwide had the same interest 'in creating a sustainable method of food production allowing for viable rural economies'. Zenchu, the Japanese farm organisation opposing opening the rice market, has representatives in Washington working with US and European farm groups. Most of the liaison with foreign farm groups is performed out of Tokyo.</p>

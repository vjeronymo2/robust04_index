			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 14, RIA -- There is a "unique chance"  to attain a political settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a  result of the Russian president's efforts, Russia's Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Radovan Karadzic, the leader of  Bosnian Serbs, at their meeting in the Russian Foreign Ministry  today.    Kozyrev said that in Geneva, there is every opportunity to  settle the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina by political  means. A second meeting of foreign ministers will be held soon  to make a new step towards the settlement of the conflict,  Kozyrev believes.    If Bosnian Serbs opt for peace, he stressed, they can count  on Russia's decisive support. On the territorial issue, they  would be able to count on getting 49 per cent of the territory,  although this part is populated by approximately 30 per cent of  the republic's overall population. They would be able to count  on Moscow's support on the issues of lifting sanctions against  the Union Republic of Yugoslavia, the country's return to the  global community and the restoration of its war-ravished economy.    And then again, said Kozyrev, Bosnian Serbs may be  stubbornly  rejecting sensible compromises and holding onto the 70 per cent  of the territory they have seized by force of arms, which will  hardly help settle the conflict. The Russian foreign minister  said he believed in Bosnian Serbs' common sense and hoped they  would opt for peace. In case they do not choose peace, they  would not be able to stake on Russia's support.    In his turn, Radovan Karadzic stressed that Serbs have  highly  valued Russia's support on all stages of the effort to attain a  peaceful settlement in Bosnia. Serbs and Russians have  maintained traditionally close ties of friendship for centuries.  "What we want is an impartial approach to the issue of Bosnian  settlement," Karadzic said. "We are tired of the many years of  war and want peace in order to build a free, democratic society  like Russia's," he noted.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 2  February.    The Colombian Government has decided to cut its 1994 budget  by 369.8 billion pesos in order to stop the revaluation of the  peso and to ease the achievement of keeping the inflation under  the 19-percent mark. Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes has said  this will cause the budget deficit to drop to only .16 percent  of the gross domestic product. The government will subtract  171.8 billion pesos from operation costs; 50 billion pesos will  be saved in foreign debt payments and 98 billion pesos in  investment. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 22 Jan 94,  p 1B)    The National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane)  and the National Customs and Tax Directorate have reported that  while imports grew by 49.7 percent in the first 10 months of  1993, exports grew by only 2 percent. Imports amounted to $8.08  billion, compared to $5.403 billion over the same period in  1992. The increase in imports was due mainly to the boom in the  construction sector; coal was the only traditional export  product that achieved a growth. Coal exports grew from $429  million over the first 10 months of 1992 to $463 million in  1993. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 27 Jan 94, p 1B)    Antonio Pretelt Emiliani, president of the Colombian Coal  Enterprise (Carbocol), announced on 27 January that Carbocol  will be put on sale this year and that, although the evaluation  that will allow the authorities to set its minimum price is yet  to be carried out, its approximate value is $1 billion. Pretelt  confirmed the government is willing to privatize the state-owned  portion of the Cerrejon coal mining complex, which includes part  of the railroad and the port. He also said the enterprise has  reduced its liabilities by $900 million and now has only $800  million in debts. The Cerrejon Mine exported 13.8 million tons  of coal during 1993 for an amount of 371.570 billion pesos ($464  million). (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28 Jan 94, p  2B)    On 1 February Dane announced the inflation rate for January.  It was 3.15 percent, which is less than the rate for January  1993, when inflation grew by 3.24 percent. The cost of  transportation increased by 9.23 percent, and the cost of food  increased by 3.94 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision  Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0000 GMT 2 Feb 94)    An economic report released by the Invest in Colombia  Corporation states that foreign investment in Colombia increased  by 24.6 percent in 1993 as compared to 1992. The majority of  foreign investment went into the manufacturing sector, which  received $198 million. The report states that some of the  countries that invested the most in Colombia in 1993 were the  United States, with 57.7 percent; Venezuela, with 15.1 percent;  and Panama, which invested $49 million. The European country  that invested the most was Sweden, with $27.7 million. (Mexico  City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1753 GMT 2 Feb 94)</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Action on cash machines launched LEGAL PROCEEDINGS were started yesterday against four UK banks and one build-ing society for compensation and costs over alleged 'phantom withdrawals' from automatic teller cash-dispensing machines. If it comes to court the case will be the first serious challenge to the claimed infallibility of the machines. More than 200 customers, who say money has disappeared from their accounts via such machines, are involved in the multi-plaintiff, multi-defendant action. One writ was lodged in the High Court yesterday and will be served during the next few days. The banks are Barclays, Lloyds, Midland, and the TSB, while the building society is Nationwide. All have denied phantom withdrawals are possible. They say the machines require simultaneous use of electromagnetic information stored on a card which is inserted into a cash dispenser and the customer keying in a personal identification number (PIN). Customers say they have never let anyone else have their cards or PINs, as the banks in most cases claim they must have. The action is being co-ordinated by Mr Denis Whalley of a St Helens firm of solicitors. Mr Whalley said yesterday that three new allegations of phantom withdrawals a day were being made to the firm following recent publicity. He expects the list of plaintiffs to grow as the new complaints are investigated. Mr Whalley added that he intended to start proceedings 'pretty soon' against five more institutions. They are National Westminster Bank, Girobank, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Halifax and Abbey National building societies.</p>

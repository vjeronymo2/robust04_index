			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APARTMENT LIFE: LANDLORD PUTS OFF RESTORING HER PORCH LIGHT  </P> <P> QUESTION: I am 71 and live alone. My landlord stuccoed the San Pedro duplex  where I have lived since last summer. He has had one excuse after another for  not restoring the porch light. It's very dark at night, and I am afraid to  answer the door when I can't see who it is. What can I do to get the landlord  to get the porch light working?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Proper lighting is more than just a convenience. As you indicate in  your letter, it's a safety issue as well. If your repeated efforts to get the  landlord to fix the porch light have been unsuccessful, you can report him to  the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety at (213) 485-7091.  </P> <P> You might want to let the owner know that you are going to report him and get  him cited if he refuses to cooperate. You should also inform him that if a  crime or accident occurs because of the lack of lighting, which he knows about,  he could be the target of a major lawsuit. He should get the light fixed for  his own peace of mind, if for no other reason.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Evicted Tenant Left Her Personal Property  </P> <P> Q: I am writing on behalf of my wife and mother-in-law, who co-own a rental  home in Los Angeles. After five months of non-payment of rent by the elderly  tenant who lived there, they were finally able to evict her.  </P> <P> While we all felt sorry for her, paying all of the mortgage out of their own  pockets on this rental home was becoming financially difficult.  </P> <P> Here's the problem. The former tenant has not made any attempt to remove her  personal belongings from the home since her eviction. Unfortunately, the former  tenant may also be senile, and she has no relatives in California. She's  staying in the psychiatric ward of the county hospital.  </P> <P> The owners have phoned and written her many times, asking her to remove her  belongings but nothing has happened.  </P> <P> Now, they must do something. Storing the belongings would be too expensive. Can  they legally sell her belongings and deduct her back rent from the proceeds and  give her the difference? If not, what legal action can they take?  </P> <P> A: Los Angeles County's "Public Guardian" is charged with caring for the  property of those with severe mental problems. You may contact him at (213)  974-0511. Otherwise, the state provides property owners with methods for  disposing of abandoned personal property.  </P> <P> After an eviction such as you describe, state law requires you to notify, in  writing, the person or persons whose property you intend to dispose of. You  needn't establish whether or not the property is abandoned, as is sometimes the  case. It is clearly abandoned after an eviction.  </P> <P> Your written notice must give the respondent at least 15 days to claim the  property if served personally, or 18 days if mailed. It may also require her to  pay the reasonable cost of storage of the property.  </P> <P> If the total value of the property is under $300, you may dispose of it in any  way you see fit if the former tenant doesn't claim it in the prescribed time.  </P> <P> If your former tenant doesn't claim the property in the prescribed time, and  it's worth more than $300, here's what happens, according to California Civil  Code Section 1988:  </P> <P> "If you fail to reclaim the property, it will be sold at a public sale after  notice of the sale has been given by publication. You have the right to bid on  the property at this sale. After the property is sold and the cost of storage,  advertising and sale is deducted, the remaining money will be paid over to the  county. You may claim the remaining money at anytime within one year after the  county received the money."  </P> <P> You must carefully inventory the property, regardless of worth, for your public  sale. You must also publish, in any newspaper of general circulation, a notice  of the upcoming sale.  </P> <P> After the sale, as noted above, you can keep only the costs associated with the  storage and sale of the property. There is no provision in the code authorizing  you to keep any part of the proceeds of the sale for unpaid rent. That issue  should have been addressed during the eviction action.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Landlords' Telephone Obligation Defined  </P> <P> Q: I live in Los Angeles, and I was shocked to read your Feb. 18 response to  the question "Tenant Wants Owner to Repair Phone Jacks." You stated: "The  reason the phone companies offer the insurance to renters is because renters  are responsible for fixing it." In fact, phone companies offer the insurance to  persons ordering phone service, whether they be homeowners, lessees or  sub-lessees.  </P> <P> Please advise me and your readers as to the legal authority and facts upon  which you based your answer.  </P> <P> A: Prepare to be further shocked. According to Jim Fleck, director of research  for Los Angeles' Rent Stabilization Division, the landlord is not responsible  for telephone wiring or jack repairs, except in very limited circumstances.  </P> <P> For instance, if the landlord provides telephone service (few do), the  responsibility for its repair may be his. Similarly, if the rental agreement  makes some kind of provision for the landlord to make such repairs or maintain  the phone system, then the repair of the jacks or wiring may also be the  landlord's.  </P> <P> Absent a situation like those, maintaining the phone wiring and jacks is the  responsibility of the tenant.  </P> <P> "If the tenant doesn't pay the phone bill, it gets disconnected," Fleck noted.  "The landlord doesn't have to pay to reconnect the phone. He also doesn't have  to pay to fix it when it breaks."  </P> <P> According to Marina del Rey real estate attorney Duane Hall, "Telephones are  amenities like television sets. Asking a landlord to fix the phone system is  like asking him to fix your television set."  </P> <P> Your letter states: "Phone companies offer the insurance to persons ordering  phone service, whether they be homeowners, lessees or sub-lessees." Absent from  that list is "lessors."  </P> <P> Postema is the editor of Apartment Age Magazine, a publication of the Apartment  Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' service group.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Jointly organized by the State Press and  Publications Administration and the United Nations World  Intellectual Property Organization, an "Asia-Pacific Regional  Seminar on Copyright Protection and Economic and Cultural  Development" was held in Kunming on 24 March. More than a  hundred representatives from over a dozen Asia-Pacific nations  attended the meeting. Currently, as Asian countries are  attaching greater importance to the protection of intellectual  property rights, including copyrights, the establishment and  perfection of intellectual property rights protection is very  important. This meeting will play an active role in promoting  copyright undertakings among Asian countries, and copyright  exchanges and cooperation among nations.

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: British Assets holders urged to reject reorganisation Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker, is urging shareholders in British Assets Trust to vote against the proposed reorganisation at the extraordinary meeting scheduled for December 20. It is also suggesting that shareholders who have already voted in favour should withdraw their proxies by the cut-off date of December 15. Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh fund manager, admitted last month that British Assets, its flagship investment trust with 30,500 shareholders, could not maintain its high dividends. It is offering shareholders a choice between keeping their ordinary shares, with a maintained dividend but the possibility of future earnings dilution; and swapping them for a package which offers an immediate cut in income but the hope of greater long term capital growth. Shareholders who want the package need to make the election by December 15.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: American Express to pay SKr865m for travel agent AMERICAN Express is making its biggest-ever purchase within travel-related services through a SKr865m (Dollars 115m) deal to buy Nyman &amp; Schultz, the leading Swedish business travel agency. The US group has agreed to buy 70 per cent of the company from its three largest shareholders while making an offer for the rest of the shares, which are largely owned by management and employees. It said the move would expand its European travel business as Nyman &amp; Schultz has a strong presence in the Swedish, Norwegian and UK markets. It would also strengthen its ties with international corporate customers as Nyman has a strong relationship with many leading Swedish multinationals. Mr Jonathan Linen, president of American Express Travel Related Services, said in New York yesterday that the Swedish company would be a natural fit with the US group. The deal meant American Express was now well placed to take advantage of the deregulation in the European airline industry. He said the group would like to be stronger in Europe and would continue to look for opportunities to expand not only in Europe but in other regions such as eastern Asia and Latin America. Nyman &amp; Schultz, which will continue to operate as a separate company after the acquisition, achieved a profit after financial items of SKr96m last year on turnover of SKr7.3bn. It has around 200 offices and 1,700 employees. A sale of the group had been rumoured for some time because of the desire of its three main Swedish shareholders to dispose of their stakes. The biggest shareholder, NCC, with a 28.9 per cent stake, had made clear it wanted to concentrate on its core property and construction business. The US group has more than 1,700 offices in 120 countries. Last month, the group's Travel Related Services division reported a 68 per cent rise in first-quarter net income to Dollars 211m. Revenues fell by 5.6 per cent to Dollars 2.34bn.</p>

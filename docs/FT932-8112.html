			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Leading Article: China's landing RISING CHINESE inflation and discreet expressions of concern by officials are reminders that Deng Xiaoping's economic miracle remains vulnerable to familiar constraints. Since Mr Deng began to dismantle state control of the economy in 1979, there have been three spectacular booms, of which the first two were followed by busts. The question to be answered in coming months is whether reforms have progressed sufficiently for the economy to escape the roller-coaster and make a soft landing. After Mr Deng's call for faster growth and reform was trumpeted last year as Communist party policy, the economy grew 12.8 per cent. Fixed asset investment grew 38 per cent, and banks' new loans were more than double the government's target. Latest figures show distinct signs of overheating. Urban prices in April were rising at an annualised 17 per cent rate and retail sales at 25 per cent. Surging domestic demand pushed the trade balance into a Dollars 1.7bn deficit in the first four months of the year, and the currency has weakened on the unofficial market. In 1988 the cycle led to urban inflation of over 30 per cent, panic buying and hoarding. The brakes were slammed on with tight controls on credit, prices and imports. There is no sign yet of such a crisis, or of a heavy hand from government to deal with the problem. Officials have indicated that they want to direct credit to areas such as transport and energy in such a way as to avoid inflationary bottlenecks, and a repeat of the late 1980s. Several factors point to a greater chance of a soft landing than was previously possible. Inflation is partly due to the one-off effect of price deregulation for some 600 commodities. Until the most recent figures, consumption growth has not appeared too rapid. The development of the market economy reduces fears of shortages of basic goods, and increases the available investment options. Price decontrol and trade liberalisation have made the economy much less rigid. Foreign debt is not excessive and foreign exchange reserves are strong. However, the difficulties of moving from communism to the market are underlined by weaknesses in fiscal and monetary policy. Though the inefficient state sector now accounts for only about half of industrial output, it still contributes to a large budget deficit and a big dollop of monetary creation. The tax system needs reform to reflect the growth of the non-state economy. The central bank has only blunt instruments to control credit, with interest rates playing virtually no role. Planned deregulation of financial markets, with the monetary authorities setting base interest rates, may come too late to help in this economic cycle. The ability to manage the economy is therefore severely limited. Macro-economic control is made harder by the devolution of power to provincial governments anxious to join in the development race. China's leaders face huge challenges in continuing to guide the economy towards the market while keeping in check the social problems thrown up by reform. Foreign investors need to keep in mind the limitations of economics, and also those of politics - the fundamental priority of China's leaders is to remain in power.</p>

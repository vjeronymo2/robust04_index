			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Vancouver company is UK tin mine's rescuer The company that came to the financial rescue of South Crofty, the last operating tin mine in the UK, was last night revealed as Crew Natural Resources, a Vancouver-quoted company formed in 1982 by two Britons, Mr John Darch and Mr Gerald Wright. Mr Darch, 47, is a Dorset man with banking experience with the National Westminster in the south-west of England and Mr Wright, 45, is an Ulster man with a PhD in Water Resources Engineering from Queens University, Belfast. Crew has acquired 60 per cent of South Crofty in the recent Pounds 1.15m cash-raising exercise and, in due course, proposes to offer other South Crofty shareholders the chance to exchange their holdings on the basis of two Crew shares for every one of South Crofty. The company's name is likely to be changed to South Crofty and it will attempt to gain a listing on a more senior stock exchange, possibly London. Mr David Williamson, the consultant who was instrumental in putting Crew and South Crofty together (and who is a director of a Crew subsidiary) said: 'Those financial institutions wishing to have an equity exposure to the tin market will now have the opportunity to do so.' He said South Crofty had been starved of cash for many years and it was probable that Crew's management would want to raise further funding for the long-term development of the South Crofty mine. Mr Williamson said Crew's long-term commitment could be judged from its other operations - developing Canada's first geothermal energy project in British Columbia and a potash deposit in Thailand and exploring for diamonds in Botswana. He suggested that a 'modest' rise in the tin price would return South Crofty to profitability in 1995. It employs 260 people and produces about 2,200 tonnes of tin a year.</p>

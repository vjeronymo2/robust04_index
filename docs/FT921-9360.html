			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Collapse of the second Guiness Trial: A model whizzkid of 1980s - The case that brought a city financier close to breakdown MR ROGER SEELIG's experiences exemplified the 1980s boom years in the City of London, Neil Buckley writes. As a flamboyant corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, he masterminded some of the biggest takeover bids and corporate deals of the decade. He also helped to make Morgan Grenfell the City's top takeover bank, involved in bids worth Pounds 13.5bn in one year, at its peak in 1986. He was well-rewarded for his efforts, earning more than Pounds 200,000 a year when six-figure salaries were rather less common than they are today and gaining the nickname 'Mr Gucci shoes' through his expensive taste in clothes. Like many of the 1980s' generation of city whizzkids, he had a reputation for living fast and working fast, often conducting business over a mobile telephone from his Porsche, restaurant table or seat at the opera. 'He had a very high opinion of himself,' said one former colleague. 'But he was very able - one of the very best corporate financiers of his generation.' Mr Seelig joined Morgan Grenfell in 1971. He became a corporate finance director in 1979. In just seven years he transformed the fortunes of Morgan Grenfell, and the somewhat grey image of merchant banking. He pulled off a string of high-profile deals, helping Dixons, the high-street electrical retailer, to take over arch-rival Currys; building up Sir Terence Conran's Habitat, Mothercare and British Home Stores retailing conglomerate; launching the Underwoods chemists chain; and advising Mr Richard Branson on the flotation of the Virgin group. The Guinness bid for Distillers was to be the peak of his career. Mr Seelig played a leading role in persuading Mr Saunders to launch the bid, and in devising a way of side-stepping the bid's referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But his career was to come to an abrupt end when he resigned in December 1986, four weeks after inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry launched their investigation into the Guinness affair.</p>

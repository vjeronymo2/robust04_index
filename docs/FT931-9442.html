			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Markets: Bright outlook for composites - The Bottom Line PROSPECTS LOOK good for Commercial Union, one of the biggest insurance groups, judging by the stock market's positive response to the company's Pounds 428m rights issue on Wednesday. The one-for-five offer, which gives CU shareholders the opportunity to buy new shares at the discounted price of 490p, was accompanied by a results statement showing better-than- expected profit figures for 1992. It has been well received by investors. 'The issue was designed to take off like a space rocket,' said one analyst. It has come amid an improvement in market sentiment towards the sector resulting from forecasts of an across the board return to profitability in 1993. The five composites - so-called because they underwrite a mixture of general and life insurance - lost around Pounds 2bn in 1990 and 1991, mainly because of an upsurge of weather and recession-related losses. But because so much capital has been sucked out of the industry, competition has declined and companies have been able to increase premium rates substantially. The loss of several thousand jobs in the last two years, has also improved productivity and profits. The two companies hardest hit in the downturn have both witnessed spectacular rises in the share prices in recent months. Guardian Royal Exchange was up 50 per cent last year, while the market capitalisation of Royal Insurance, which briefly left the FT-SE 100 after omitting its dividend last February, doubled between September and January. Sun Alliance (up 19 per cent) and General Accident (up 26 per cent) also grew ahead of the FT-A All-share index last year, while CU itself rose by 29 per cent in 1992. CU's price has fallen only marginally since the rights issue and most London analysts have been revising upwards profit forecasts for 1993. The market has been impressed by the strength of the company's growth, especially in the UK market in the fourth quarter of 1992, as well as pre-tax profits of Pounds 32.4m for 1992. Steven Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, expects the share to outperform the All-share index by more than 15 per cent this year with the dividend yield falling below the market average by the end of the year. He says that of all the composites CU is in the best position to take advantage of the improvement in insurance markets. David Hudson, of Credit Laing Lyonnais, who has been sceptical about CU in the past, has revised his view: 'It is the first time I have been a buyer for seven years. The shares will outperform.' 'Upwards revisions in profit figures tend to be good for market sentiment. The management is top notch. You cannot find any fault with what they have done.' There is less unanimity about the prospects for other insurers, however, with many analysts suggesting that investors have already discounted future profits. Recent figures indicating that mortgage arrears are running ahead of expectations, show that there may be more bad news in store for Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance which have most exposure to domestic mortgage indemnity (dmi) insurance. The policies cover mortgage lenders against losses on some of their sales of repossessed properties. Paul Hodges, of James Capel, suggests that if other companies follow CU's example and seek to raise capital, the flood of cash into the sector could re-expand insurance capacity, triggering price competition. 'The input of capital could lead to a curtailment of the upturn. This is the risk that is emerging,' says Hodges. He says this could aggravate a decoupling of the sector between companies which have stronger balance sheets and were able to expand or maintain market share during the downturn - CU, General Accident and Sun Alliance - and those which have weaker balance sheets and have been forced to shrink their business - Royal Insurance and Guardian Royal Exchange.</p>

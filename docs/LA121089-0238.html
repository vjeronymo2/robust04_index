			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO SAYS 23 SITES ARE QUAKE RISKS  </P> <P> Twenty-three buildings in Redondo Beach -- from the city library to a room in  the local Elks' lodge -- are built of unreinforced masonry and could collapse  in a major earthquake, city building officials report.  </P> <P> Reinforcing the buildings could cost the owners up to $25 per square foot, and  none of the Redondo Beach structures is eligible for existing state subsidies,  Chief Building Officer Nagy Jacob reported in a memo to the City Council.  </P> <P> The report, mandated as part of a statewide hazard mitigation program passed by  the Legislature in 1986, came with a proposed ordinance submitted to the  council by city staff this week to minimize potential earthquake damage.  </P> <P> The proposal is based on a Los Angeles ordinance and applies only to buildings  built before 1934 of unreinforced masonry or a combination of unreinforced  masonry and wood, Jacob said.  </P> <P> By state law, each city must have a list by year's end of all such buildings  within its jurisdiction and must notify owners that their buildings could be  vulnerable in the event of a major quake.  </P> <P> Cities may also require that buildings be upgraded, Jacob said, or that  occupancy be reduced if the building is to remain in operation. But such work  is expensive. For example, just working up an assessment of what it would take  to bring the city's 59-year-old public library at Veterans Park up to code will  cost $20,000, Jacobs said. In some cities, owners have preferred to demolish  rather than spend thousands of dollars on seismic upgrades.  </P> <P> Under the proposed Redondo Beach ordinance, property owners would have 60 days  to appeal a city finding that a building needs seismic work. After that, the  owner would get 180 days to prove the building is safe, to demolish it or to  submit plans for bringing it up to code. Any upgrades would have to be  completed within three years. The City Council is scheduled to consider the  ordinance Dec. 19. Among the 23 buildings is the Benevolent Order of Elks Lodge  No. 1378 at 315 Esplanade. Its meeting room was built 100 years ago as a cable  car depot.  </P> <P> With its high ceilings and two-foot-thick brick walls, the big room has never  been made quake-proof. Seismic work on the walls of the room would necessitate  upgrading the entire building, which the fraternal group cannot afford, said  Past Exalted Ruler Don Smith.  </P> <P> The group has posted a sign over the doorway to the lodge room, warning that it  isn't quake-proof, but the Elks haven't stopped having their dances and regular  meetings there, Smith said.  </P> <P> "We aren't really worried about it," he said. "After all, the thing was there  when the big quake hit in '33, and it got through it without even a crack."  </P> <P> </P> <P> VULNERABLE BUILDINGS IN A MAJOR QUAKE  </P> <P> Redondo Beach buildings built before 1934 of unreinforced masonry or a  combination of unreinforced masonry and wood:  </P> <P> * Redondo Beach Public Library, Veterans Park.  </P> <P> * Meeting room of Elks Lodge, at 315 Esplanade.  </P> <P> * The South Bay Masonic Lodge Hall, at 501 S.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our political correspondent  Shlomo Raz reports that the cabinet decision to outlaw Kakh and  Kahana Hay was passed unanimously. Minister Ya'ir Tzaban was of  the opinion that the definition of terror should also be applied  to Rabbi Moshe Levinger, but he was told that such a decision  would not withstand an appeal to the High Court of Justice.  During the session, the cabinet examined documents presented by  Shin Bet officials about suspicions connecting the two terrorist  organizations to unsolved murder cases in the territories.    The issue of firing regulations in the territories also came  up in the meeting, but the cabinet decided not to discuss the  issue because it is currently being dealt with by the State  Commission of Inquiry.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated in the meeting that the  question of the curfews and closures on the territories are  being constantly revised. The cabinet will hold another session  this afternoon.    Kakh leader Barukh Barzel said that his movement will  continue to operate from the underground and, if necessary, also  from jail. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that the police  have arrested another Kahana Hay activist, a resident of Kfar  Tapuah, who refused to turn in his weapon.</p>

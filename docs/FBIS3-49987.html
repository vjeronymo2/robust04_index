There are 27,000 refugees here whom Travnik has been taking  care of for a long time and we do not know how we are still  managing to help them survive, but the fact that the local  population of Travnik is also hungry and that they need  humanitarian aid just as the refugees do should [word  indistinct] all those people who should and must help us. The  local population are getting food mainly in soup kitchens where  food reserves are only sufficient for a few days. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / People: Hoping to make the cab fit At 48, Michael Thurlow is taking up cab driving. Well, cab company driving, to be precise; he has just moved into the managing director's seat at Metrocab (UK). Tamworth, Staffordshire-based Metrocab, after spending some of 1990 parked in receivership, is back in business making the main rival to London's famous FX4 'black taxi'. Metrocab's assets were bought just over a year ago - following the failure of previous owner Reliant - by Hooper group, the London vehicle coachbuilder. As well as steering Metrocab, Thurlow is to remain as finance director of Hooper, which is best known for its 'customised' Rolls-Royces and Bentleys. Thurlow, who has been with Hooper for three years after spending most of his career in South Africa, clearly relishes his new driving role. 'I was very much involved in setting up Metrocab (UK),' he says, 'and I'm looking forward to running and expanding it.' Thurlow and the current total of 100 Metrocab employees have had plenty to occupy them since Metrocab (UK) became a formal entity last July. The plastic-bodied, purpose-built taxis, with which Londoners are already familiar - they were first launched in the early 1980s - have been substantially re-engineered with an eye to export markets, and 50 are destined for Australia. 'We're already up to 16 a week since production restarted in January (with 15 workers),' says Thurlow. An accountant by training - his 'school', like so many UK motor industry men, was Ford - Thurlow will have as Metrocab's chairman Paul Crowder, managing director of the Hooper group as a whole. But with Thurlow settled at the wheel, Crowder is now ready for some back-seat thinking about the strategic development of the group. ***** One of Michael Heseltine's first actions on becoming President of the Board of Trade was to appoint two deputy chairmen to BRITISH COAL - which he will be in charge of privatising before long. He has nominated Ken Moses and Albert Wheeler, both lifelong coal men. Moses, 60, has worked his way up from the bottom. He worked underground in the Lancashire pits, rising through the company to become strategic planning director, and earning a doctorate from Nottingham University in 1990. Wheeler came up through the Scottish and Midlands coal industry and is now in charge of mining operations. ***** Billy Kane, md of WOODCHESTER UK, is leaving to return to Ireland. John McQuaid, head of corporate planning at GPA, is to become group treasury director of Woodchester Investments. ***** Ove Sorenson, former president and chief executive officer of Grand Metropolitan's Haagen-Dazs ice-cream company, is joining United Distillers, the Guinness spirits subsidiary, as president and ceo of its North American operations. He takes over from Phil Parnell who becomes regional managing director, United Distillers Europe. Danish-born Sorenson, who has lived in the US for the past 12 years, has overseen the worldwide growth of the Haagen-Dazs brand of premium ice-cream since the GrandMet takeover in 1989. Before that, he held senior marketing and sales positions with Pepsico and Mars. The moves complete UD's new senior management team under Crispin Davis, who next month takes over as UD managing director from Tony Greener on his appointment as chief executive of Guinness. ***** Jim Nelson, president of Arbor Acres Farm, BOOKER's US subsidiary, has been appointed to the main board; Angus McKenzie is retiring following the disposal of the company's health products interests. ***** BASS, the brewing, hotels and leisure group, has reshuffled the responsibilities of its executive directors. Peter Sherlock, present chief executive of Bass Leisure, will become president of hotel operations, Holiday Inn Worldwide. He will be responsible for owned and managed hotels in North America, and all Holiday Inn business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Charles Darby will head the group's UK retailing and leisure interests as chairman of Bass Taverns and executive chairman of Bass Leisure. Jimmy Angles, md of Britvic, will succeed Darby as chief executive of Bass Taverns; and Stephen Davies will take over the Britvic post. ***** Bryan Sanderson (above), chief executive of BP Chemicals, has been appointed a managing director and to the board of BP.</p>

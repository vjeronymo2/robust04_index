			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ, 4 ALLIES URGE MIDEAST NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL ARMS BAN;  </P> <P> WEAPONS: THEY CALL ON WESTERN GOVERNMENTS TO PRESSURE ISRAEL TO COMPLY.  </P> <P> Iraq and four other Arab nations called Thursday for a ban on nuclear and  chemical weapons in the volatile Middle East, urging Western pressure on Israel  to comply.  </P> <P> The proposal, coming three days after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threat  to retaliate with nerve gas against any Israeli attack, appeared designed to  paint Israel into a diplomatic corner. It was made by the foreign ministers of  Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen, meeting in Amman, Jordan. It was seconded by the  Syrian foreign minister in an Israeli newspaper interview.  </P> <P> In public, Israel officials were skeptical of the proposal, but regional arms  reduction has become a topic of serious discussion in the Foreign and Defense  ministries, government sources said.  </P> <P> Iraq and its three allies in the Arab Cooperation Council, concluding a two-day  meeting in the Jordanian capital, declared that any Mideast disarmament "should  be balanced."  </P> <P> "All kinds of destructive weapons, including nuclear, chemical and biological,  should be prohibited in order to guarantee regional and international  security," the foreign ministers said.  </P> <P> Israel is the only Middle Eastern nation reputed to have nuclear arms, a  strategic trump card in any regional conflict. Although the government refuses  to confirm its nuclear capability, Israeli leaders responded ominously to  Hussein's threat. Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel could  respond "many times over" to an Iraqi chemical assault.  </P> <P> Responding to Thursday's Arab proposal, Yosef Olmert, a government spokesman,  remarked, "Let those who have used chemical weapons ban them first," referring  to Iraq's wartime attacks on Iranian troops and indigenous Kurdish rebels. In  general, Western governments accept nuclear deterrence as legitimate, but not  chemical-warfare forces.  </P> <P> In wording similar to the Arab communique, Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh of  Syria, a stubborn foe of both Iraq and Israel, told a reporter for the Israeli  daily Hadashot based in Paris: "If there was a sincere desire for peace and  security, then Israel should agree to declare the Middle East an area clear of  all destructive weaponry."  </P> <P> If that phrase means elimination of strategic forces, including nuclear  weapons, Israel would remain heavily outmanned by Arab forces, despite its 1979  peace treaty with Egypt. And despite the vaunted Israeli edge in battlefield  technology, discipline and training, the Arab countries continue to build up  their conventional forces. Iraq's army, in particular, is battle-tested and  equipped with first-class imported and adapted weapons.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, independent Israeli analysts view the Arab offer on arms reduction  as something new. Previously, Arab states had basically lobbied to get Israel  to sign the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Now, they have linked  nuclear arms control with the proven Arab capacity to deliver chemical weapons.  </P> <P> Despite the conventional-forces advantage enjoyed by the Arabs, Israel might  find a way to respond to arms control offers, defense analyst Gerald Steinberg  said. "Israel could link nuclear arms control with reductions in conventional  forces," said Steinberg, a researcher at Bar Ilan University.  </P> <P> Steinberg pointed out that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed  to this formula in talks about arms reduction in Europe. "Israel bases its  nuclear program on the presence of large Arab armies. To give it up, Israel  would have to be assured that it is not falling into a conventional arms trap,"  he said.  </P> <P> In the past, Israel has declined to link chemical and nuclear arms in a single  package. It also would prefer a regional pact on nuclear arms that would permit  each country to inspect each other's atomic facilities. "Just having inspectors  from hostile countries in each other's back yard would greatly reduce  tensions," said analyst Dore Gold from the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies  in Tel Aviv.  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein's tough speech Monday in Baghdad was condemned by the United  States and other Western powers -- State Department spokeswoman Margaret  Tutwiler branded it "inflammatory, irresponsible and outrageous" -- but it has  rallied Arab opinion.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the Arab League, meeting in Tunis, Tunisia, issued a statement  warning Israel that any attack on Iraq would be considered an attack on all 22  league members, Reuters news service reported. Iraq had requested the meeting  to rally support in its disputes with Britain, Israel and the United States.  </P> <P> The Iraqi president's words have filled the Arab world with "will, power and  vigor," declared the Jordanian newspaper Al Rai. Jordan's King Hussein, quoted  by the national Petra news agency, said Hussein "did not threaten anybody but  affirmed Iraq's ability to face any planned aggression and its legitimate right  to defend itself."  </P> <P> The Cairo reporter for the London-based Mideast Mirror wrote: "Saddam's tough  remarks created a feeling of excitement, even exhilaration, among the public,  monopolizing conversations in sidewalk cafes."  </P> <P> Hussein was stung by Western criticism of his government's execution last month  of a British-based reporter on spying charges and by the arrest in London last  week of Iraqi citizens in an alleged plot to smuggle U.S.-made nuclear-weapons  devices to Baghdad.  </P> <P> In response, he suggested that Israel and its Western allies were creating an  atmosphere that invited Israeli attack on Iraqi military facilities.  </P> <P> "Let them drop such attempts to give Israel a pretext to strike. . . ," he  warned. "I swear to God we will let our fire eat half of Israel if it tries  anything against Iraq."  </P> <P> Hussein's threats and complaints struck a sensitive chord among the Arabs,  whose pride has been hurt time and again by Israel's ability to strike targets  far from its borders without fear of vengeance by strategic weapons. By  brandishing chemical weapons, Hussein has attempted to introduce a balance of  fear in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Military analysts are doubtful that the threat is fully substantive, noting  that Iraq would need an arsenal of accurate missiles to carry out the boasts.  But Iraq's mid-range missile development has jumped alarmingly since  cross-border missiles were first introduced to the Middle East during the  1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.  </P> <P> The foreign ministers of the Arab Cooperation Council, ostensibly an economic  alliance, decided the time was right to once again try to tie Israel's nuclear  hands.  </P> <P> Nick Williams reported from Nicosia and Daniel Williams from Jerusalem.  </P></p>

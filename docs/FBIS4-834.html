			<p>BFN     [Text] Five men showing signs of serious assault have been  taken to the district surgeon after a police swoop on the ANC's  PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] offices in  Johannesburg last night. A police spokesman, Colonel Dave  Bruce, said that an injured black man had stopped a police  patrol in Hillbrow last night and had taken them to the ANC's  regional offices at Lancet Hall from where he said he had  escaped earlier. There the police had been confronted by a man  armed with a handgun. The man was wounded and arrested.    Inside the building, four males, the youngest of whom was 14  years old, were found in a barred holding cell. All of them  showed signs of severe assault. Col. Bruce said ANC officials  had claimed that the five had been detained at the ANC offices  for suspected car theft, and that they were to have been handed  over to the police. The police are investigating charges of  abduction and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm.</p>

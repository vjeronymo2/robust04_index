			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. EUROPE SEEKS TO END WARSAW PACT;  </P> <P> ALLIANCES: THE LEADERS OF FORMER SOVIET SATELLITES ARE PRESSING FOR THE  ABOLITION OF THE MILITARY ORGANIZATION.  </P> <P> Leaders of former Communist states of Eastern Europe, further shifting the  Continent's balance of power, said Tuesday that they are pressing for the  abolition of the Warsaw Pact to complete the dramatic changes that began there  a year ago with the wave of anti-Marxist revolutions.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Jozsef Antall of Hungary said that he expects the pact, which  once defined the "solidarity of the fraternal socialist countries" on the  Soviet Union's western borders, to decide to disband when its leaders meet next  month in Budapest, the Hungarian capital.  </P> <P> Such a step would formally end a military alliance that confronted the Western  Alliance and held Moscow's East Bloc satellites in an iron grip through more  than three decades of Cold War.  </P> <P> "Agreement has now been reached, I am gratified to say, on the dissolution of  the military organization among the members," Antall told the 34-nation Paris  summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. "We  trust that the prerequisites for a complete dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty  Organization will be brought about through the European security process at the  latest by New Year's Day, 1992."  </P> <P> Antall's message to the Soviet Union was that the Warsaw Pact could not  continue even as a political grouping, as Moscow has hoped, and thus was  underscoring both the sharpness of the political reorientation in Eastern  Europe and its permanency.  </P> <P> The Hungarian leader was joined by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland,  who addressed the conference later, and then by President Vaclav Havel of  Czechoslovakia, who told reporters that the Warsaw Pact has been "a typical  product of Stalinist expansion" and has no further function.  </P> <P> "Dinosaurs might be nice for museums, but they are not for our time, and the  Warsaw Pact is a dinosaur," Havel said. "It is hard for anyone in our country,  and not just ours, to hear the words Warsaw Pact and not think of 1968 (when  Warsaw Pact troops crushed Czechoslovakia's pro-democracy movement). How can we  as free nations want to remain members of the Warsaw Pact?"  </P> <P> But the East European leaders also had words of warning for the West. Economic  and ethnic tensions could again divide Europe, they said, and a wall of wealth  could divide the rich from the poor as the Iron Curtain divided the free from  the oppressed until last fall.  </P> <P> "Our common future may be darkened by the sinister clouds of the resurgent  conflicts of bygone days unless the split into a rich and a poor Europe, an 'A'  class and a 'B' class Europe, is overcome," Mazowiecki said, echoing a theme  from the opening day of the meeting.  </P> <P> "This is the key to the unit of Europe as a whole. It is a fundamental issue .  . . for which determined and consistent solutions cannot be delayed  indefinitely."  </P> <P> Antall said that, as the nations of Eastern Europe emerge from the  Soviet-dominated political, military and economic system where they had been  "held captive" for about 40 years, they need closer political dialogue and  economic integration with the West.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who sat quietly as Antall and Mazowiecki  addressed the conference, had said Monday that the Warsaw Pact would make  "important decisions before the end of this year on transforming the  organization and changing its character."  </P> <P> Members of the Warsaw Pact signed a nonaggression treaty with NATO on Monday as  well as an agreement sharply reducing the deployment of conventional arms in  central Europe.  </P> <P> Soviet officials had made clear their hope before the conference that the  Warsaw Pact, which had grouped Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary,  Poland and Romania together with the Soviet Union for 35 years, would become a  political forum for East European countries as they shed their Stalinist  systems and end their long isolation from the West.  </P> <P> "Europe is blessedly peaceful, but all our problems have not disappeared,"  Alexei G. Arbatov, a European security specialist at the Soviet Institute of  the World Economy and International Relations, commented earlier in Moscow. ".  . . There are problems of disarmament that the Warsaw Pact could help resolve.  There are problems of transition for which the Warsaw Pact is a good forum for  exchanging views. And there are simple neighbor-to-neighbor problems that the  Warsaw Pact can handle better than some new organization."  </P> <P> While Soviet officials expect Hungary to announce its withdrawal and  Czechoslovakia probably to follow, they had hoped that Poland would remain a  member along with Bulgaria and perhaps Romania, and that this nucleus would  become the basis for the pact's transformation into a regional political  grouping.  </P> <P> "We believe that there is an objective and solid basis for continued  cooperation among the members of the Warsaw Treaty Organization," Vitaly  Zhurkin, director of the Soviet Institute of Europe, a leading Moscow think  tank, commented here Tuesday. "This will take time to explore and develop, and  the changes in Europe are still coming very, very fast."  </P> <P> The memory of Moscow's use of its military power, under the pretext of  assisting an ally, to suppress pro-democracy movements over the years in  Hungary, Poland and East Germany as well as Czechoslovakia, is especially  strong, and Antall bluntly warned the military leaders of Eastern Europe and  the Soviet Union against intervening in politics and again using force to  suppress the democratization finally under way there.  </P> <P> "We hope . . . that there will be no country where humiliated armies feel  tempted to embark upon political adventures or disappointed military men might  attempt to bar the way for the development of democracy out of ambitions for  power," the Hungarian leader said.  </P> <P> "Such attempts can offer no solution to the grievous social and economic  tensions that confront our societies."  </P></p>

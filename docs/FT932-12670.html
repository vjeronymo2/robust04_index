			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Schneider ahead despite Spie losses SCHNEIDER, the French electrical engineering and construction group, mustered a modest increase in net profits to FFr305m (Dollars 56.2m) in 1992 from FFr275m in 1991, in spite of continued losses at Spie-Batignolles, its construction subsidiary. The group, which was also affected by the cost of servicing the debt amassed in its acquisition of Square D, the US construction company, indicated that it anticipated another difficult year. Schneider managed to counter the competitive economic climate by raising capital in asset sales and through improved performances from Square D and Merlin Gerin, its electrical distribution business. Although Spie remained in the red, it reduced its net loss to FFr274.3m from FFr952.2m. Group sales rose to FFr61.4bn from FFr59bn. However, Schneider swung from an exceptional credit of FFr201m to an exceptional loss of FFr24m over the same period, due to FFr400m of new provisions and amortisation charges.</p>

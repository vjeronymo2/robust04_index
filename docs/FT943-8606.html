			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Impala Platinum earnings dip 15% Impala Platinum Holdings, the world's second largest platinum mining company, has reported a 15 per cent drop in attributable earnings to R170m (Dollars 47.4m) for the year ended June, down from R210m the previous year. The drop was largely due to the weak international rhodium price. Although platinum revenue rose to R1.44bn from R1.23bn and palladium sales increased to R202m from R144m, this was largely due to a 15 per cent depreciation in the rand and improved metals prices. Overall production of both metals declined, with platinum dropping to 1.05m ozs from 1.1m ozs a year ago and palladium to 472,000 ozs from 500,000 ozs. But a steep drop in the price of rhodium led to a fall in earnings to R285m on sales of 91,000 ozs, from R564m on sales of 95,000 ozs last time. Capital expenditure increased 27 per cent to R199m from R157m, and the company has continued to improve its cash position, currently at a net positive R21m.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Terms fixed for special issue to cover Efim debts THE dispute between the Italian authorities and foreign bank creditors of Efim, the state holding company which went into voluntary liquidation last July, moved closer to resolution yesterday as the terms were fixed for the special government bonds to be issued to repay creditors. However, there was growing concern among the group's bank creditors that the European Commission might yet derail the agreement. Representatives on the steering group set up last year to co-ordinate foreign banks' negotiations with the Italian authorities said they believed the EC was querying whether government support in repayment of Efim creditors involved unfair state aid. 'That could put the whole thing back several months,' one US banker said. The details of the bonds to be issued remove some of the continuing uncertainties regarding the group's borrowings, which are believed to have reached L17,500bn, including trade creditors. Interest on the special bonds, which will have a five-year maturity, will be paid at 50 basis points above six-month RIBOR (Rome Interbank Offered Rate). The new bonds will be issued from April 1 and pay interest six-monthly in arrears. However, doubts remain as to whether the terms will satisfy bank creditors, some of which have been threatening legal action. The main issue still to be resolved concerns the treatment of accrued interest on Efim's debts since it was put into liquidation last July. Negotiations are also still continuing on how to treat debts of Efim subsidiaries which are not 100 per cent owned by the parent company. There was also uncertainty yesterday about whether Efim's foreign bank creditors would receive the new Lira bonds, or whether they would be paid in cash raised from the sale of the bonds. Bankers in London said that they had reached agreement with the Italian authorities to be repaid in cash. Late last year, Mr Alberto Predieri, the liquidator, said the L9,000bn offered by the government was insufficient, since accumulated interest payments had raised the sum required to about L10,000bn. Bank creditors had threatened last month to block parts of the government's liquidiation plan as a way of putting pressure on the authorities to have their debts repaid.</p>

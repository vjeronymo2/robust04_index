			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: STARS TWINKLED ON MAN OF THE YEAR  </P> <P> So many superstars, so little time.  </P> <P> "This is tall cotton, isn't it?" said John Crean on Saturday night, ogling the  galaxy of luminaries crammed into the ballroom of the Century Plaza Hotel in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> On view at the bash, which raised more than $1 million for St. Jude Children's  Research Hospital in Memphis: Danny Thomas, Bob Hope, George Burns, Milton  Berle, Steve Allen, Buddy Ebsen, Red Buttons, Carol Channing, Bea Arthur, Cyd  Charisse, Tony Martin, Virginia Mayo, Cesar Romero and more. So many more.  </P> <P> But -- are you ready for this? -- the stars were there to ogle Crean, the  second Orange County resident in as many years to receive the St. Jude Man of  the Year Award from Danny Thomas, who founded the hospital in 1962. (Car dealer  Roger Miller received the prestigious nod last year.)  </P> <P> Crean's coup had its beginnings in 1981, the year he and his wife, Donna,  became aware of the hospital and began to support it.  </P> <P> Then last year, Crean, who lives in Newport Beach, was invited by L.A. Rams  owner Georgia Frontiere to watch a football game in her Jacuzzi-appointed suite  at Anaheim Stadium. Danny Thomas, a buddy of Frontiere's, was also there.  "Danny came up to me and asked me if I wanted to be St. Jude's Man of the  Year," Crean said. "And I told him I certainly did. So here we are!"  </P> <P> The award has a hefty price tag -- a $100,000 donation to the hospital. "John  sent me his check one week after I asked him," said Thomas, beaming a megawatt  smile at Crean during the star-studded VIP pre-event party (where George Burns  sat in a corner smiling impishly at guests while he puffed a cigar). "Do you  know how many people do that? Few. The money has been collecting interest for  the hospital ever since. Crean is a wonderful guy."  </P> <P> Among guests who came from Orange County to the affair (some of them in luxury  motor coaches provided by the Creans) -- former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, home  from his whirlwind tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first walk on  the moon. "John is a very kind man, generous with those of all statures,"  Aldrin said. "He is most helpful to those in need."  </P> <P> After settling down to a feast that included Chateaubriand and chocolate  squares crammed with whipped cream and fresh berries, Bob Hope welcomed guests.  </P> <P> "If he can't get your attention, no one can," said Danny Thomas' daughter,  Terre, who followed Hope to the podium. (Indeed. One of the most dreaded  challenges for gala hosts is hushing guests.)  </P> <P> Tony Thomas, the comedian's son, did the presenting honors. He said of Crean:  "His company, Fleetwood Enterprises, a Fortune 500 company, employs 10,000  people in 17 states and Canada."  </P> <P> "I accept this honor gratefully," said Crean as 1,700 guests listened in  silence. "It is wonderful the way Rose Marie (Thomas) and Danny Thomas inspire  others to keep their special dream alive."  </P> <P> Show time. Milton Berle, Steve Allen and Danny Thomas came on stage to crack  guests up with a show dubbed "The Living Legends of Comedy." (Sid Caesar was  supposed to have performed, but got hung up in New York. Allen volunteered to  replace him.)  </P> <P> A sampling of the madness that had guests rolling in the aisles:  </P> <P> Berle to Allen: "I love your suit. You never throw anything away, do you?"  </P> <P> Allen to Berle: "If I did, you'd put it in your act."  </P> <P> Berle to audience: "This hotel opened in 1967 with my act!"  </P> <P> Allen to Berle: "Who was doing it at the time?"  </P> <P> Thomas to audience: "They say I'm religious. Bob Hope once said I was so  religious that the California Highway Patrol stopped me for having stained  glass windows in my car."  </P> <P> Also on the scene: Jolene and Tom Fuentes, Pilar Wayne (in scarlet silk and a  twinkling tiara), Buck and Colleen Johns (who are busy-busy cleaning their  Santa Ana Heights house to prepare for Vice President Dan Quayle's visit there  Aug. 24), Carl and Margaret Karcher, Barbara and Alexander Bowie, Mardy and Art  Svendsen, Virginia and Paul Bender, Marion and Tony Montupert, Arvella and the  Rev. Robert Schuller, Lois and Ted Lundberg, and Vikki Vargas and Mike Nason.  </P></p>

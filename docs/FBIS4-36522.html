			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> correspondent Yaron Deqel on 9 June; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports  that high-level sources have confirmed that Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin held a secret meeting with King Husayn a few days  ago. It was that meeting which led to the breakthrough in the  talks between Israel and Jordan. Our correspondent Yaron Deqel  today asked the prime minister about the secret contacts.  Yitzhaq Rabin neither confirmed nor denied the meeting.    [Begin recording] [Deqel] Mr. Prime Minister, has progress  with Jordan been achieved in the wake of some type of secret  talks which were held recently?    [Rabin] I will not address myself to the reasons that led to  this progress. I think there are many reasons, the main one  being Jordan's willingness to make slow moves toward a peace  treaty. Will this treaty be signed before progress is made with  Syria, or not? I do not have an answer. [end recording]    [Later during the broadcast, political correspondent  'Imanu'el Rosen relays a live report from Tel Aviv, stressing  that "the recent breakthrough with Jordan was surely not  accidental. A process of several weeks, of three weeks at  least, involving secret contacts, away from the media, had taken  place. The details of the recent meeting in Washington were  concluded more than two weeks ago. Incidentally, even some of  the delegation members were not aware of the nature of the  agreement. In short, we were told by high-level sources that a  meeting did take place between Yitzhaq Rabin and King Husayn.  The prime minister's bureau refuses to confirm this meeting,  but states that very high-level contacts indeed took place."]</p>

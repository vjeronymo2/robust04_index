			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SIGNS BILL HIKING BASE WAGE TO $4.25  </P> <P> President Bush on Friday signed a bill that will raise the minimum wage to  $4.25 an hour from $3.35 by the spring of 1991, formally accepting the  compromise that ended a year of disagreement with congressional Democrats and  organized labor.  </P> <P> Bush praised the measure, which he said would "protect jobs and put more money  into the pockets of our workers." But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said it  merely marked progress "to the 50-yard line" on the issue.  </P> <P> The increase, the first since 1981, would bring the wage to $4.25 an hour by  April, 1991, after going to an intermediate $3.80 on April 1, 1990.  </P> <P> The new law includes a lower "training wage" for new workers who are  teen-agers, a provision sought by Bush but initially opposed by congressional  Democrats.  </P> <P> Bush in June vetoed a bill that would have increased the wage to $4.55 over  three years.  </P> <P> At an Oval Office signing ceremony attended by congressional leaders and  sponsors, Bush called the new act "a good example of what we can do in the  future on other matters."  </P> <P> Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, told  reporters: "It's not as much as the working poor deserve, but it was a real  compromise and it brought the President's position to one of not saying take it  or leave it."  </P> <P> Kennedy said a Democratic-led effort to raise the wage further in 1992, a  presidential election year, was "a live option."  </P> <P> Under terms of the new law, young people 16 to 19 years old who have never  worked could be paid the training wage for 90 days. Employers with a training  plan in place could pay the young workers a training rate for 90 days more.  </P> <P> The training wage would be $3.35 an hour after next April 1. When the minimum  wage increases to $4.25 a year later, the subminimum would increase to $3.61 an  hour. The provision allowing for the subminimum expires in April, 1993, unless  extended by Congress.  </P> <P> Among others at the signing ceremony were Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford  Dole, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Senate Minority  Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.)  </P></p>

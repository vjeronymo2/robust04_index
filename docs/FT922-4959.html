			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / MPs set to challenge Maastricht bill agenda SOME MPs are set to challenge the amendments chosen for discussion at the start of today's debate on the legislation to enact the Maastricht treaty. They have complained that proper consideration of the terms of the Maastricht agreement has been made harder because the bill - only four clauses long - has been very difficult to amend. Though more than 100 amendments have been tabled, not all are even eligible for selection for debate by the Chair because they are beyond the scope of the bill. 'When the 1972 act taking the UK into the Community started its committee stage, points of order began at 3.30 in the afternoon and continued until 7.00 the following morning,' one Euro-sceptic recalled yesterday. As a procedural device to allow debate on aspects of the treaty, the Labour frontbench has put down a series of amendments to omit various sections of the agreement. Though some of these are almost exactly the same as amendments put forward by Euro-sceptics, the opposition business managers do not plan to vote on most of them. Labour does, however, intend to press for a vote on its amendments on economic and monetary union and on the social chapter, but it would not receive the support of Tory rebels. Both the Labour Euro-sceptics and the Tory rebels have put down amendments that would enable a referendum to take place. Other amendments would require consent of the Commons before ratification or implementation of the treaty. The decisions about which amendments will be allowed is critically important to the rebels' chances of exerting any pressure on the government. If progress is slow, not just today and tomorrow but on future days for the committee stage, ministers may be forced to consider guillotining debate. The danger is, however, that the opposition parties could combine with the rebels to vote down a timetable.</p>

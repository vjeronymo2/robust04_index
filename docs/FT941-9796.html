			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: Italian banking scandals mar BCI sell-off preview Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), one of Italy's biggest banks, yesterday launched its privatisation roadshow against a background of mounting criticism over the country's banking sector. The past week has seen the temporary resignation of the heads of two top banks, who were allegedly involved in corruption, and the release by Moody's, the US debt rating agency, of a bearish report on the prospects for the sector. Mr Sergio Siglienti, BCI's chairman, sought to distance his bank from the corruption affair, which has nevertheless embraced two former BCI executives. He emphasised BCI's sound financial condition and the fact that its bad-debt ratio was about half the national average. The BCI float will be Italy's biggest privatisation, raising about L3,000bn (Dollars 1.7bn) for the IRI state holding company. IRI is selling all its 571m shares, equivalent to 54.35 per cent of BCI's total share capital. The bank's shares closed at L5,491 on the Milan stock exchange yesterday. The sale, starting on February 28, will involve three segments. Domestic retail investors, who have shown a strong interest in privatisation, will be offered at least 200m shares, while 240m will be set aside for institutions. The institutional tranche comprises 60m shares for Italian companies, 50m for the US, and 130m for institutions in the rest of the world. A further 30.7m shares will be held back for possible market stabilisation purposes, but may be added to the institutional tranche. BCI, which is co-ordinating the deal with Lehman Brothers, said the precise allocations would depend on demand. The domestic retail tranche, including up to 40m shares for BCI employees, could rise to 300m shares, it noted. The pricing will be announced on February 26, and the offer, which officially lasts five days, may be closed ahead of schedule on the second day if oversubscribed. BCI is the third big bank to be privatised in the past three months. Its sell-off marks IRI's exit from the banking sector. In December, IRI raised almost L1,750bn by selling its stake in Credito Italiano. Separately, the treasury expects to make almost L2,400bn from this month's disposal of about half its holding in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the financial services group. BCI, which will report 1993 group results next week, made net parent company profits of L268.2bn last year, 1.7 per cent up on 1992. Mr Siglienti said the group figures would mark a substantial improvement on the L218.5bn made in 1992, thanks to restored profitability at BCI's French and Canadian operations.</p>

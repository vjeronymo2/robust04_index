			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: More stable performance by equities A MORE confident perform-ance from the UK stock market yesterday saw share prices move steadily forward after brushing off initial uncertainty caused by the rise in some Spanish interest rates. Trading volume, however, was unimpressive and stock shortage pushed prices ahead in an equity market still taking its lead from the futures sector. Two modest buying programmes were identified and shares advanced across the broad range of the market. Store and retail issues came in for support as some strategists shrugged off the latest statistics on consumer credit and stressed the annualised gain in retail sales in November. Although firm at the opening, equities were held back initially by the rise in some ever, the stock market recovered its confidence as traders had second thoughts on the implications of the change in Spanish rates. Perhaps more significantly for the market in its present mood, the March futures contract opened strongly and, with sterling also in better form, the stock market advanced by nearly 25 FT-SE points, recapturing the 2,500 territory. The first trading programme came, reportedly, from a leading agency broking firm and helped the market forward. The second programme was smaller but helped to steady a market cautiously awaiting the opening of the new session in New York. However, with Wall Street ahead by 20 points on the Dow in UK trading hours, London resumed its upward track to close at the day's best. The final reading of 2,516.3 left an advance on the session of 26.2 points. Seaq-reported volume, which does not distinguish between genuine customer business and intra-market dealing, increased to 519.7m shares from Monday's 429.3m. Stock Exchange statistics confirmed that retail business fell away on Monday, totalling only Pounds 781m, compared with daily totals above Pounds 1bn in recent trading sessions. Traders believed that customer business had recovered yesterday but stressed that marketmakers were forced to push prices ahead sharply when a few buyers caught them short of stock. The erratic performance of the market since Christmas, often in response to an even more erratic stock index futures sector, has put pressure on trading books still recovering from the holiday period. The latest data on domestic producer prices, disclosing a gain of only 0.1 per cent on output prices last month, buttressed expectations that inflation is being curbed. Among securities houses taking a more positive view on UK equities, Strauss Turnbull saw the Footsie in the 2,600 to 2,650 range by April, when the political background may become more difficult from the market's point of view, since the UK will by then be very close to a general election. Further support for leading oil shares again provided a strong boost for the UK market yesterday. Both BP and Shell were wanted, although some other international blue chips held back while awaiting a clearer sign on the outlook for the US dollar. Glaxo, still regarded as the wonder stock of the international sector, gave back a few pence yesterday, and the pharmaceutical sector as a whole turned in a less dramatic performance than of late.</p>

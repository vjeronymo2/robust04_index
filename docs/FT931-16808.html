			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Saudi government to raise spending SAUDI ARABIA yesterday projected a 9 per cent increase in government spending to SR196.9bn (Pounds 34bn) in 1993 but gave no breakdown of revenue sources, report Reuter and Our Middle East Staff. Budget figures and other financial statements published by the official Saudi Press Agency after the budget was approved by the cabinet put revenues at the same SR196.9bn figure projected for spending. This figure is more than Pounds 6.5bn above the optimistic revenue forecasts of less than a year ago. There was no mention of the kingdom's persistent budget deficit, which was projected at Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in 1992. It was largely financed last year by domestic borrowing and seems likely to increase in the year ahead. The finance ministry estimated Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product rose 5 per cent in 1992. SPA quoted King Fahd, who chaired the cabinet meeting, as saying that his govenment's priority was economic development and raising living standards in the kingdom. He said there were 7,000 government projects now under construction. 'We hope that stability will be maintained in this region to allow each state to focus on building its economic and its people's prosperity,' he added. The budget set military and security spending at SR61.6bn, up 13.7 per cent. Education was allocated SR34.1bn, the lion's share of civilian spending. This was almost 10 per cent up on the previous year's allocations. The government said 800 new schools would be opened in 1993 and six colleges of further education started. Health and social services were to receive SR14.1bn, a 15 per cent rise, and transport and telecommunications SR9.1bn. The statement said government subsidies for various economic and social activities were set at SR9.2bn.</p>

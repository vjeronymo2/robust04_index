			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: NONFICTION  </P> <P> ANCHORS: Brokaw, Jennings, Rather and the Evening News by Robert Goldberg and  Gerald J. Goldberg (Birch Lane Press: $19.95; 399 pp.) Every night some 40 to  60 million Americans learn about the day's events from the three intelligent,  earnest, white, Protestant men who anchor the network evening news.  </P> <P> Each of them is on camera for about eight minutes. Each receives over $2  million a year. The Goldbergs (father and son) have written an absolutely  first-rate examination of the three men, and the way in which the news is put  together -- as well as the way the network's new corporate owners have changed  the process of choosing what goes on the air.  </P> <P> Money talks louder than ever: It determines whether a story is really important  (will it cost too much to cover?). At CBS, one-sixth of the news organization  was fired in the name of profitability; you have to wonder what stories we  didn't get to see because there weren't enough people left to cover them.

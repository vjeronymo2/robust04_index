			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: ALUMNI AT SDSU TAKE TO THE FIELD FOR ONE LAST TIME  </P> <P> At Aztec Bowl last Saturday, the twin concrete stands stood empty, seeming to  stare moodily at each other across a football field that, in earlier days, rang  to the chants of as many as 16,000 fans of the San Diego State University  Aztecs and their opponents.  </P> <P> The old scoreboard, which sees limited action now, was lighted and displayed:  Visitors 00, Home 99. And, as the twilight shades gathered along the hand-set  cobblestone walls, old Aztecs began to drift toward the northern end of the  field. Most wore black tie.  </P> <P> Some of the SDSU alumni were so eager to visit the site of former glories, in  fact, that more than 20 couples arrived 30 minutes ahead of the official  starting time of the university's 1990 Annual Alumni Awards Gala. This 14th  annual event, "Memories: An Evening in Aztec Bowl," drew a record attendance of  560, a figure that organizers attributed both to the roster of alumni to be  honored -- it included journalist Eileen Jackson and her artist husband,  Everett Gee Jackson -- and to nostalgia for the stadium.  </P> <P> Aztec Bowl, a Depression-era Work Projects Administration arena dedicated in  1936, saw its last Aztec football game in 1966 and is scheduled to be  demolished, after serving as the site of SDSU's May 27 graduation exercises, to  make way for a student activities center that will include a 12,500-seat  stadium.  </P> <P> Gala chairwoman Yvonne Larsen, decorations chairwoman Betty Brayshay and their  committee frosted the upper end of the field with grass-green carpeting and  topped it with a great celebratory cake of a white tent, garlanded with  red-and-black balloons and furnished inside with replicas of the school's  campanile and with tables set in the SDSU crimson and ebony tones. The tent was  ordered with clear sides so that, said Brayshay, everyone could "see the  scoreboard and share in the nostalgia we all feel for the place."  </P> <P> Not many in the crowd needed visual clues to prompt feelings of nostalgia, but  the committee spread them around the perimeter of the outdoor cocktail area  anyway, primarily in the form of photographs taken of attendees back in their  undergraduate years. Most examined these with some care, and then trundled off  to stare for another moment at what for many was a true field of dreams.  </P> <P> Ben and Nikki Clay co-chaired a host committee of more than 40 couples that,  without exception, were alumni or had at least attended the university. The  idea was to give the couples a feeling of shared nostalgia, and it worked. Ben  Clay recalled watching -- or rather, not watching -- a mid-1960s game against  Fresno State that was so shrouded in fog that a spotter with a microphone had  to be sent on the field to report the plays to the stands. Nikki Clay said  that, in 1963, she rode around the field as queen of the high-spirited chariot  races sponsored by SDSU fraternities; she represented Lambda Chi, which  captured the trophy.  </P> <P> "We made the cocktail hour extra long just to give everyone time to reminisce,"  said chairwoman Larsen, a 1952 graduate and a runner-up for homecoming queen.  "I've been to lots of events on this field, and this stadium is filled with  wonderful memories."  </P> <P> The memories extended to the program, which offered photographs of important  dates in Aztec Bowl history, such as the commencement address offered in June,  1963, by President John F. Kennedy, and the placement of a plaque in May, 1983,  that named the bowl California Registered Landmark No. 798.  </P> <P> SDSU President Thomas Day offered an unexpected and solemn addition to the  formal program by taking the podium to ask for a moment of silence in memory of  Malcolm S. Love, who died earlier that day. Love served as president from 1952  through 1971 and is credited for raising SDSU to preeminence in the California  State University system.  </P> <P> The program also included a welcome by Art Flaming, the outgoing president of  SDSU Alumni &amp; Associates, who informed the crowd that there are more than  100,000 SDSU alumni in the immediate area and then led the election of new  officers, a most unusual feature at a fund-raising gala. Attorney Jim B. Kuhn  was chosen to preside over the new slate of officers.  </P> <P> The decision to name a couple as co-alumni of the year was unprecedented,  although the choice of the Jacksons was indisputably popular. Eileen Jackson,  who for 60 years has reported the city's social events for several newspapers  and now writes a weekly column for the Tribune, let her husband do all the  talking during the awards presentation.  </P> <P> "I was thinking that, with all this publicity, I might run for some office,  like city dogcatcher," Everett Jackson said to much laughter, adding, "but you  were all on the beam in choosing Eileen for this honor."  </P> <P> Named alumni of the year by the school's seven colleges and Imperial Valley  campus were attorney Dwight Stanford, a graduate of the College of Arts and  Letters; executive Arch Rambeau, College of Business Administration; investment  real estate broker and former San Diego Chargers defensive back Willie  Buchanon, College of Education; engineer William Sevier, College of Education;  Union of Pan Asian Communities executive director Beverly Yip, College of  Health and Human Services; educator Elena Castro of the Imperial Valley Campus;  San Diego Union columnist Tom Blair, College of Professional Studies and Fine  Arts, and biochemist and medical researcher E. Aubrey Woodroof, College of  Sciences.  </P> <P> The program followed a dinner of roast beef tenderloin bordelaise and  strawberries Romanoff -- rather more elegant fare than most guests recalled  consuming on other occasions in Aztec Bowl -- and preceded a live auction of  five items particularly appropriate to the evening. The pace of the auction,  conducted by 1961 graduate Bob Arnhym, picked up somewhat after a friendly San  Diego skunk paid a call to the immediate neighborhood; a choice item on the  block was the right to lead the SDSU Marching Aztec Band during halftime at the  1990 homecoming game against the University of Utah.  </P> <P> The attendance included Frank and Marsha Aronoff, Betty Hubbard, Tom and Tracy  Stickel, Tim and Sharon Considine, Kay North, Tom and Judy Carter, Kim and  Marilyn Fletcher, Roy and Judy Lessard, Anne Evans, Doug and Betsy Manchester,  Tammy Smith, Dick and Liz Miller, Gordon and Karon Luce, Roger Conlee, George  and Ethel Sorenson, Dick and Betty Meads, Bruce and Mary Hazard, Lee and Sharon  Grissom and Bob and Patricia Menke.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Toshiba Corp. said Tuesday  [14 Jun] it will begin global marketing of a new red-light  semiconductor laser diode that significantly increases the  storage capacity of optical disk systems.    The TOLD9151mb operates at a wavelength of 685 nanometers,  compared with the 780 nanometers currently used in optical disk  systems, Toshiba said. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter.    The smaller spot size allows almost double the volume of  information to be stored on the same size disk, it said.    Mass production of the device, at some 60,000 units per  month, will begin at the end of the year. Toshiba has begun  shipping samples of the laser diode at a price of 15,000 yen per  unit.</p>

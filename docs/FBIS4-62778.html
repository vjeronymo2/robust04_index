			<p>BFN     [Text] The dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister Sergey  Shakhray from the post of minister for nationalities and  regional policies is a "great mistake of the Russian  leadership," Interfax was told Tuesday by the leader of the  Chechen opposition Umar Avtunkhanov. He said that Shakhray was  the only person in the Russian leadership who knew the situation  in the regions, for example, in the North Caucasus.    Until the last day in power Shakhray headed the Russian  delegation at the talks with Chechnya.    Avturkhanov believes that Shakhray's dismissal was done by  the middle echelons of power in Russia, who are connected with  President Dzhokhar Dudayev through oil products and arms.    Shakhray was dismissed at the moment when Russia developed a  more or less concrete position concerning the ethnic policies,  for example, concerning the settlement of relations with  Chechnya, said Avturkhanov.    Meanwhile, the official Groznyy welcomed with satisfaction  Shakhray's resignation. In an interview with Interfax, the  Chechen president's aide Soltmurat Alazov said that this should  have taken place long ago.    The man whose unseemly role is vividly seen in the  Ossetian-Ingushi conflict, could not occupy the post of minister  for nationalities and regional policies for very long, said the  aide.</p>

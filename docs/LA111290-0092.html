			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS / THOMAS BONK;  </P> <P> CONNORS TALKS A GOOD GAME FROM BOOTH  </P> <P> Jimmy Connors was dueling with Miloslav Mecir in the broiling sun and Mecir was  winning. Connors fidgeted with his shirt and, as he wiped his face on his  wristband, someone shouted from the stands:  </P> <P> "Come on, Jimbo!"  </P> <P> Connors stood motionless, then turned in the direction of the voice. "OK, where  are we going?" he asked.  </P> <P> That was the last match Connors played in Southern California, in the  semifinals of the 1989 Newsweek Champions Cup at Indian Wells, which if  everything goes right, might be where the 38-year-old left-hander returns as a  wild-card entry next March in what will be his 20th year on the professional  tour.  </P> <P> Connors lost the only three matches he played in 1990, which was basically a  total washout for the five-time U.S. Open champion. Tendons in his left wrist,  injured in February, would not allow Connors to hit a ball without pain. And  although he tried to avoid surgery, Connors needed a wrist operation last  month, which he hopes will permit him to still be playing by the time he is 39  next September.  </P> <P> Connors, of course, expects to succeed. After a year on the sidelines and  working for NBC, he has been busy sizing up the opposition.  </P> <P> "I certainly learned a lot about the players," Connors said. "I saw guys who  had a lot of guts and I saw some who didn't.  </P> <P> "I don't think a lot of guys have my attitude," he said. "I don't know whether  that's because I have a lot of confidence in my game or because I have none in  theirs. But I do realize that when they say, 'experience counts,' that's bull.  If you don't get to the ball, experience doesn't count. I still think I can get  to the ball."  </P> <P> He can also get to the bank. In February, Connors will play a four-city  exhibition series, called, "The Fire Still Burns," to prepare for the ATP Tour.  One of the stops is tentatively scheduled for the Forum. After Wimbledon,  Connors will take time out to play TeamTennis. Some estimates of his two-year  TeamTennis contract run as high as $2 million.  </P> <P> Controversy Cup: It's still more than three weeks away, but the Davis Cup final  between the U.S. and Australia at St. Petersburg, Fla., has already reached  Grand Slam proportions, at least as far as ill will and controversy are  concerned. Consider:  </P> <P>  -- Tennis Australia protested a four-day delay by the U.S. Tennis Assn. in  announcing the playing surface, even though the ruling International Tennis  Federation had already approved the delay. That the USTA would choose clay was  not much of a secret anyway.  </P> <P>  -- The Australians protested the clay for the court that was to be imported  from Germany.  </P> <P>  -- Tennis Australia protested to the ITF the starting times of the matches: 5  p.m., EST, on Nov. 30 for two singles matches; 12:30 p.m., EST, the next day  for the doubles match. The USTA scheduled the matches at those times because of  television, which should not exactly surprise anyone.  </P> <P> As expected, the ITF rejected the appeal of Tennis Australia, which wanted the  first day's matches played earlier. Agence France-Presse quoted Geoff Pollard,  president of Tennis Australia, as saying that Philippe Chatrier, president of  the International Tennis Federation, "must be dirty (angry) we beat France in  the first round."  </P> <P> Australian Captain Neale Fraser said the times are unfair because he intends to  use Pat Cash in both the singles and doubles. If so, Cash could be playing  until midnight the first day and returning to the court before noon the second  day.  </P> <P> All told, Australia is batting .333 in the protest department, winning only the  battle to stop the importation of the red clay from Germany. Instead, the USTA  is using red clay crushed last week in Tampa, Fla.  </P> <P> Add Cup: "After all this, wouldn't it be something if Australia won?" Connors  asked. "I've got a funny feeling."  </P> <P> Name game: The six-year-old San Diego women's professional tournament, which  used to be the Virginia Slims of San Diego and later was renamed for the Great  American Bank, has a new name and a new venue for 1991 -- the Mazda tennis  tournament.  </P> <P> The $225,000 event, with a 28-player draw, will be held July 29-Aug. 4 at La  Costa, with the winner receiving a new car. Steffi Graf has won the past two  years.  </P> <P> His new line?: Appearing on the "Oprah Winfrey Show" last week, Andre Agassi  said he is considering a second career away from the tennis court -- acting.  "Acting is something I've always toyed around with," he said. "Part of what I  do is more than just sport, it's entertainment. . . . It's fun to entertain."  </P> <P> He won't Budge: Don Budge, 75, who in 1938 became the first man to win a Grand  Slam, is recovering from eye surgery at his home in Dingman's Ferry, Pa. Budge  had a cataract removed from his right eye. He knew he had to do something to  correct his vision when he was in London this summer to watch Wimbledon and  played a little tennis with friends. Budge had trouble getting his racket on  the ball.  </P> <P> "I thought, 'God, the people I am playing with are going to wonder how I ever  won Wimbledon,' " Budge said.  </P> <P> Within a month, he expects vision in his right eye to return to 20-20. "I've  got to be patient," Budge said. "And, gosh, I feel great. At my age, I should  have one foot in the grave, but I feel so good, I'm staying."  </P> <P> Shaping up: U.S. Open champion Pete Sampras, who credited his improved  quickness and agility as ingredients in his rapid success, is a student of the  training techniques of Henry Hines of Westwood.  </P> <P> A former long jumper at USC, Hines is not a conditioning coach, but a quickness  and agility specialist who began working on and off with Sampras 11 months ago.  "His improvement was pretty dramatic, actually," said Hines, who also has  worked with Michael Chang, Amy Frazier and Mary Joe Fernandez.  </P> <P> "He just had a lack of knowledge of movement before, but once he learned, he  felt he could get to every ball. He really believed his game was complete."  </P> <P> Tennis Notes  </P> <P> The Southern California Tennis Assn.'s junior development program is sponsoring  college and university scholarship meetings at 2 p.m. next Sunday at the Los  Angeles Tennis Center and at 7 p.m. on Dec. 4 in the Salomon Lecture Hall on  the University of San Diego campus. Tennis scholarships for men and women in  the fall of 1991 will be discussed. The meetings are free and open to  scholarship athletes, parents and coaches. Information: Mark Winters of the  SCTA at (213) 208-3838.  </P> <P> Martina Navratilova said she has no plans to play in the Virginia Slims of Los  Angeles next August but intends to play in the inaugural Virginia Slims of Palm  Springs in March. . . . Hyatt Grand Champions in Indian Wells made Tennis  magazine's list of the top 50 tennis resorts in the United States for the first  time. Other California places on the list are John Gardner's Rancho Valencia in  Rancho Santa Fe, Rancho Bernardo Inn in San Diego, La Quinta, and Marriott's  Desert Springs and Shadow Mountain in Palm Desert.  </P> <P> How costly was John McEnroe's loss in his first match in the Paris Indoor  tournament last week? McEnroe, who double-faulted on match point against Jakob  Hlasek, said: "I guess you can say I choked." McEnroe refused to shake either  Hlasek's hand or the chair umpire's hand afterward. During the match, McEnroe  was one step away from defaulting after receiving two prior code violations,  for slamming the ball and for throwing his racket. McEnroe's defeat ended his  chances of qualifying for the ATP Tour World Finals in Frankfurt, Germany,  because he needed a good showing in Paris to climb into the top eight. Instead,  McEnroe fell two places to No. 13. McEnroe was probably a longshot for  Frankfurt anyway: He needed to defeat Hlasek, Goran Ivanisevic, Stefan Edberg,  Sergi Bruguera and Boris Becker to qualify. McEnroe seemed to indicate that his  season has ended, which would mean he will not play in the $6-million Grand  Slam Cup. "I was waiting for the last minute to know how I felt," McEnroe told  the Associated Press. "Now I feel like I need a break. I don't feel at the top  of my game."  </P> <P> The Net Gals from the San Fernando Valley reached the finals of the 4.0  division in the USTA/Volvo National Tennis Championships last week in Palm  Springs. The Net Gals, who represented Southern California in the competition,  were singles players June Sugasuwara, Heidi Broecking, Tina Clarfield, Lily  Reeves, and doubles players Doreen Goldberg, Edda Speisser, Beverly Lever,  Laura Pearl, Edith Stefel, Val Hait and Myrna Craig.  </P></p>

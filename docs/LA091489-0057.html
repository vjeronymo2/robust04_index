			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: ADDING NEW WRINKLES IN MEN'S FASHION  </P> <P> One of the things I enjoy most in the fall is looking at the men's fashion  supplements in the magazines and newspapers. I study them faithfully in the  hope that I can find out what I should be wearing in the months to come.  </P> <P> I must admit that I am puzzled about what the supplements show. A jacket looks  as if it's falling off the model's shoulders, the pants are tumbling down to  his knees, the shirt is wrinkled, and the sleeves are so long you can't see the  man's fingers.  </P> <P> Every suit looks as if it was just unpacked from a duffel bag, as does the  person who is wearing it. Page after page is filled with men whose overcoats  hang down to their ankles and whose hats fall over their ears. In most cases,  there is a jazzy girl in the picture hanging on for dear life to the man's  scarf.  </P> <P> There isn't an outfit in the supplements that anyone would buy. So, I ask  myself, who purchases these creative works of tailoring?  </P> <P> To get the answer, I went to see Gerry of Georgetown, a hot haberdasher, who is  a fifth cousin to Louis of Boston.  </P> <P> "Gerry, I just looked through this fancy men's magazine and it seems to feature  clothing for the homeless. Who buys this stuff?"  </P> <P> Gerry said, "Nobody. It's aimed at kids on trust funds who hang out in  discotheques all night long because their parents are divorced."  </P> <P> "Why would they produce clothes like this if no one buys them?"  </P> <P> Gerry took me into a fitting room and whispered, "They don't manufacture those  kind of clothes. They're not idiots."  </P> <P> "If they don't make the clothes, why do they advertise them?"  </P> <P> "Because they need something new to display. People are not going to be  attracted to an ad showing ordinary clothes like the ones they wear to work. In  real life, every man's suit looks like every other man's suit. So, they make up  one of each of these KGB monstrosities and they put them in the supplement. If  anyone calls to inquire about one, they hang up on him."  </P> <P> "How do they get that rumpled, washed-out, down-and-out look in the sports  jackets?"  </P> <P> "I don't know about the rest of the menswear tycoons, but I have a friend who  throws his clothes onto the New Jersey Turnpike and lets the 18-wheel  tractor-trailers do his pressing for him."  </P> <P> "No wonder they look so great in the ads."  </P> <P> "My friend is a trend-setter in the men's fashion business. He was the first  one to develop a necktie that looked as if the person wearing it was hanging  himself with a noose."  </P> <P> "Do the manufacturers ever advertise anything in a supplement that a man can  actually wear?"  </P> <P> "I've never seen it. You have to get it out of your head that just because you  see men's clothing in a magazine doesn't mean it has anything to do with what  you are expected to put on this winter. If you attempted to wear any of that  stuff, you'd lose your arms in the sleeves, trip over your baggy pants and kill  yourself with your belt buckle."  </P> <P> "I'm glad that you explained it to me, otherwise I would have thought I was  weird."  </P> <P> "If you try on one of those corduroy, double-breasted, off-the-collar,  silhouette suits -- then you'll know what weird really is."  </P></p>

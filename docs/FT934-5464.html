			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Driving a new product to the heart of carmaking: A small factory which is on the brink of big sales Mr Keith Jones, managing director of Henrob, a small company based in Wales, was flying to Detroit yesterday to talk with US manufacturers about applying its self-piercing riveting technology 'which every month is gaining momentum'. Its partnership with German carmaker Audi marks the first application of the technology, which replaces spot welding, to a complete car body assembly. The machines and rivets installed at Audi's Ingolstadt plant have all been designed and manufactured in Flint. Henrob, Mr Jones said, had been 'pushing' its technology for some time, but everyone was comfortable with spot welding. 'Then the technology changed, with aluminium and plastic coming in as the need has grown for lighter vehicles. At that point, they (Audi) realised that welding wasn't suitable - and at that point it became really exciting for us.' Henrob is already active in other fields - about 1,000 of its riveting machines are installed worldwide in applications such as washing-machine assembly lines in Iran and India. The electronically operated sliding roof of Toronto's all-weather sports stadium is held together by Henrob's system. In the motor industry the catalyst for the surge of interest has been the prospect of aluminium cars being produced in volume. But manufacturers are realising that the technology is applicable to steel as well, particularly as they move to corrosion-resistant coated steels. Spot welding can destroy the coating and leave the vehicle vulnerable to rusting. Ford US, in a research paper presented to the International Body Engineering Conference in Detroit in September, said: 'Only the self-piercing rivet shows a significant strength advantage over spot welds.' The size of the potential market is enormous. Mr Jones said: 'There are about 130bn spot welds put into cars each year - an average of 3,000 per vehicle.' There is no heat involved in the new process, so it can join unlike materials, such as the plastic composite body panels some vehicle makers are using as an alternative to steel. Other advantages claimed are low energy consumption compared with the hefty electrical current required for welding, near-noiseless operation and only about half the investment. But Henrob executives accept that the motor industry's need to amortise large investments in spot-welding plant and equipment makes an 'overnight' switch to pierce riveting unlikely. The French Peugeot group is also introducing a simpler form of the technology to assemble part of the body shell of its 106 and 306 car ranges. A simplified form of the process is being used to assemble seats for Ford's new Mondeo model. Only 68 per cent of joints on the Audi aluminium car are riveted because the design of the car was under way when Henrob was approached. 'Now that the technology has been accepted future cars will be designed with it in mind from the start, bringing it much closer to 100 per cent,' Mr Jones said. Henrob set up in Flint in 1986 - helped by a Pounds 500,000 grant from the Welsh Office - after acquiring technology rights which originated in Australia. It is investing Pounds 1.8m in expansion and creating 20 jobs in addition to the current 34. Mr Jones predicted 'significant' further growth in employment. The company has enjoyed a 40 per cent growth in turnover this year 'and we're expecting 80 per cent compound over the next three years,' Mr Jones said. 'Audi isn't even on stream yet.' Henrob exports more than 80 per cent of the output of its small Flint plant, which produces several million rivets of varying size each week.</p>

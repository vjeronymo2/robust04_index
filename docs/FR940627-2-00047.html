			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Abandoned Infants Program is covered under Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, and 45 CFR Part 100, Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Program and Activities. Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All States and territories, except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau, have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established State Single Point of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants from these 18 jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applicants for projects to be administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424, item 16a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline to comment on proposed new or competing continuation awards. For this particular announcement a waiver of the 60 day period has been approved and SPOC's are asked to provide comments within 30 days of the application deadline. The 30 day SPOC comment period provides all potential applicants with a full 60 days for application preparation and submission. This will allow for the greatest number of applicants, and also not give an advantage to applicants who have received similar awards in the past. The 30 day SPOC comment period ensures that all applications can be thoroughly developed and reviewed, and that awards can be made in FY 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations which may trigger the accommodate or explain rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Health and Human Services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration for Children and Families,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Division of Discretionary Grants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 370 L'Enfant Promenade SW.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6th Floor East, OFM/DDG,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, D.C. 20047.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Appendix B of this announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

Private Metered postmarks shall not be acceptable as proof of timely mailing.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications may be mailed to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Health and Human Services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration for Children and Families,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Division of Discretionary Grants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 370 L'Enfant Promenade SW.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6th Floor East, OFM/DDG,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, D.C. 20047.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hand delivered applications are accepted during the normal working hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, on or prior to the established closing date at: Administration for Children and Families,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Division of Discretionary Grants, 6th Floor East, OFM/DDG, 901 D Street SW.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, D.C. 20047.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Late Applications:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications which do not meet the criteria stated above are considered late applications. Each late applicant will be notified that its application will not be considered in the current competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

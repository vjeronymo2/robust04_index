			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Miners shift their efforts to fresh fields / A report on one county's campaign to compensate for the loss of its pits EARLY this year a group of leading employers will go underground at one of County Durham's collieries. The visit, arranged by British Coal Enterprise, the state-owned company's job-creation arm, is intended to prove that the image of pitmen as primitive militants, grimly hacking at the coalface with picks, is a myth. Modern miners, the message runs, are skilled teamworkers operating machinery worth millions of pounds. The trip has been organised because today's miners in this former colliery heartland are tomorrow's unemployed. In the Durham coalfield, which in 1951 employed 104,000 men in 129 pits, just 5,000 now work in four collieries, two in Tyne and Wear and two on the east Durham coast. East Durham lost two of its last pits, Dawdon and Murton, last year. Few locals would bet on the last survivors, Easington and Vane Tempest/Seaham, continuing for long. Mr Brian Wright, brought in from south Wales as British Coal's new north-east director, has been dubbed 'Terminator Two' by Durham miners. Staff at the British Coal Enterprise Job Shop in Dawdon are bracing themselves for long queues after the holiday break. 'Get a job' will be many local ex-miners' new year resolution. British Coal's announcement last week that its supplementary redundancy payments of up to Pounds 10,000 per head are to end in March has increased the likelihood that most of the 929 men at Murton, which closed five weeks ago, will opt to leave the industry rather than transfer to pits with an uncertain future. Battered by the loss of more than 10,000 mining jobs in the last decade, east Durham's Easington district epitomises the difficulties facing Britain's declining coalfields. Although the postwar development of Peterlee new town has helped boost manufacturing employment locally by 2,500 jobs since 1981, the pace of job creation has lagged behind mining job losses. The district has 6,000 fewer jobs than in 1981 and a male unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent. The recession and the knock-on effects of mining's rundown are biting too. Mining has bequeathed environmental scars  - once-golden beaches have been reduced to black quagmires by the dumping of colliery spoil, sludge and sewage. Its ebb is leaving rundown villages and dereliction. Because decline has been gradual the area has missed out on the special government help focused on communities affected by more dramatic closures. East Durham is also handicapped by powerful competition for inward investment from government-backed development corporations in neighbouring Tyne and Wear and Teesside. Alarmed at the area's 'death by a thousand cuts', Durham County Council spearheaded the launch of the East Durham Task Force in September last year. It is pressing for Pounds 158m over the next decade to revitalise the economy and environment. Mr Kingsley Smith, Durham County Council's chief executive and the task-force chairman, said: 'We believe it is essential that 8,000 new jobs are created over the next 10 years if the area is to have any chance of recovery.' But Professor Ray Hudson of Durham University has suggested in a report on Easington district that even Pounds 158m and 8,000 new jobs might not be enough. And one of the task force's main hopes of finance  - the European Commission's money for regenerating former mining areas  - is still held up by a dispute between the government and Brussels. British Coal Enterprise remains optimistic, however. Since 1984 it has invested Pounds 7.5m in 261 job-creating projects in the Durham coalfield, and is spending Pounds 1m a year on redundancy counselling and training for Durham's ex-miners. It estimates that of 1,000 who sought its help in 1989 and 1990, 91 per cent were resettled in work or training. Because of the recession the 1991 figure will fall to about 80 per cent. British Coal Enterprise's determined push to resettle ex-miners may be bad news for other job seekers. Mr Ron Lee, BCE's Dawdon manager, said: 'Even the Jobcentre will say we offer very stiff competition for them. It's a vicious world and we're in at the deep end.' The hardest men to place, he said, were those wanting to work locally. 'They picture a nice steady little job, nipping home for lunch  - these jobs don't exist.' Mr Benny Salmon, who worked for 28 years as an underground maintenance worker and was made redundant a year ago, will vouch for that, after writing in vain to 327 Durham-based companies. Mr Salmon, aged 45, has two plastic bags of rejection letters and thinks age must be against him. Last year was not without triumphs: he learned to cook and iron well, raised a family of pigs on his allotment and paid off the mortgage on his former council house in Seaham, using some of his Pounds 30,000 redundancy money. But his goal, a modestly paid job in his home area, still eludes him. He said: 'I thought if I went with the first wave from Dawdon I would have better prospects of getting a job, before everybody else went. But the prospects are very grim.'</p>

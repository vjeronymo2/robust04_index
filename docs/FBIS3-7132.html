Do  Muoi, the general secretary of the Vietnam Communist Party, said  this at a question and answer session with participants of the  10th general meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation  Council, PECC, in Kuala Lumpur this evening. He said Vietnam is  currently studying the ASEAN working mechanism and will join the  group when the situation is right. Mr. Do Muoi also said that  ASEAN can contribute greatly to the rebuilding and modernization  of Vietnam. He pointed out ASEAN can contribute to the economic  well-being of Vietnam, especially in terms of technology. He  hoped ASEAN member countries will invest more in Vietnam.    Malaysia is currently the 10th largest investor in Vietnam  with a total investment of 400 million U.S. dollars.    When asked for Vietnam's opinion on the dispute over the  Spratly Islands, Mr. Do Muoi said that all parties concerned in  the claim to the islands should resort to action that will not  raise tension in the region. He reiterated that the issue  should be resolved either through bilateral or multilateral  meetings.</p>

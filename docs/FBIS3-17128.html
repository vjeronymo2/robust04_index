			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent on President Geydar </F> Aliyev's meeting with NATO representatives in Baku on 21 Mar]    [Text] [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Tugay  Ozseri, Turkey's ambassador to NATO, was heading the delegation.  The actual aim of this delegation was to ensure Azerbaijan's  participation in the international Partnership for Peace program  and in the military and political consultations.    Republic President Geydar Aliyev told the guests that the  meeting will be useful, and added that this visit to Baku by a  high-ranking delegation shows NATO's enormous interest in  Azerbaijan, and that we will try to carefully listen to your  views and proposals and discuss them in a spirit of cooperation.    Tugay Ozseri said that NATO adopted the Partnership for  Peace  program at the beginning of the year and that any country could  freely become a member of NATO's new structure within the  framework of this program. So far Ukraine, Moldova, the Czech  and Slovak Republics, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria,  Albania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have signed this  agreement. It is expected that Russia and Georgia will also  join NATO's new program.    But, as a country waging a war, what will Azerbaijan expect  or gain from the endorsement of this plan?    The head of the delegation and its members gave an  unequivocal reply to this question, which was of interest to all  those present at the meeting. The military alliance that they  represent favors the defense of the territorial integrity of any  independent state, it only holds military and political  consultations and acts as a mediator in providing humanitarian  assistance.    Geydar Aliyev reiterated that NATO's new structure is of  enormous importance for Azerbaijan, and this is how he expressed  his views on the subject:    [Aliyev] We know about NATO's appeal to the independent  states, which were members of the former Warsaw Pact and Soviet  Union, and its decision to accept their response. We want to  clarify certain matters and establish our Republic's final  position regarding this decision.    Undoubtedly, we welcome as very positive the declaration of  the Partnership for Peace established within such a major  organization as NATO. That is, we regard it as being very  positive. This program is probably more important and urgent  for our Republic than it is for the other countries that have  joined it. This is because, as you know, Azerbaijan is in a war  with Armenia. You yourselves indicated that 20 percent of  Azerbaijani lands are under the occupation of the Armenian Armed  Forces. The war is still continuing. Therefore, I reiterate  that the enlistment in the program put forward by NATO, which is  one of the most respected and prestigious international  organizations, is very important in solving our problems.    Therefore, in joining this program it must be clear what  Azerbaijan will gain. You noted that the benefits primarily  rest in the fact that we will be in this organization, that is,  we will have our representatives in this organization, that it  will be possible to hold political consultations with this  organization, and that certain problems might be taken into  consideration in the bilateral agreement that will follow the  signing of this program. We are interested in seeing the  emergence of such possibilities for Azerbaijan, and we will  appraise them. However, our demands go beyond these  possibilities. And such demands are only natural, because as I  noted we are in a war and our lands are under occupation. It  will be inappropriate not only for Azerbaijan but also for NATO  if we fail to solve this problem despite being, if not fully,  almost a member of this most powerful military and political  organization in the world. It is obvious that since its  establishment, there has been no military conflict or discord  between NATO countries. This is only natural, and that is how  it should be, because countries that are members of a major  political and military alliance cannot fight amongst themselves.  But unfortunately, the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia  started when they were still two republics within a single  Soviet state, let alone a mere alliance. The state failed to  prevent this conflict. Now, Azerbaijan is a member of the newly  formed CIS, you know this. Armenia was a member of CIS from the  day of its inception. Could you imagine that despite being  members of this union and having signed a collective security  treaty within this union, the two states are at war? I declared  during the Ashgabat meeting of the CIS heads of state on 24  December 1993 that such a situation is abnormal, and I requested  that the states signatory to the collective security treaty come  together and look into this matter. However, no positive result  has been achieved. It could be that the CIS is still young and  has little experience. Whereas, such a major organization as  NATO established in 1949 has accumulated enormous experience,  and maybe it can find an opportunity to help us after we join  this Partnership for Peace program.    We invited you here to clarify these matters, and I would  have wished that regarding these matters you [changes thought].  I know that it is not possible to deviate from certain  long-established principles of this organization, but a new  program has now been drawn up. You said that 12 states have  already signed this program. But, they probably do not have such  a problem, whereas we do. Armenia also has such a problem.  However, Armenia might approach this problem from a different  angle, because its aggressiveness is obvious; it is the  aggressor, and is occupying another state's territory. Whereas,  we are victims of an aggression. In drawing your attention to  these matters, I want to reiterate that we consider the  Partnership for Peace program as being very useful. We, too,  want to sign and became partners in this program. However, in  view of present conditions in our Republic, we consider it  important to clarify certain matters. In this connection, you  already noted that our foreign minister has spoken to you about  military budget and other matters. I hope that our ties in this  direction will continue, and I hope that we will arrive at a  consensus.    [Unidentified reporter] Republic Foreign Minister Gasan  Gasanov, Turkish Ambassador to Azerbaijan Altan Karamanoglu, and  State Adviser Vafa Gulizade also participated in the meeting.

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Accountancy Column: Meeting of minds fails to strike the right balance - The gulf between academe and the profession revealed by a key conference IF THE British Accounting Association conference held this week is anything to go by, the profession should be sadly shaking its head. As a slice through the current state of academia, the omens from the UK's principal annual research gathering held at Strathclyde University in Glasgow are not good. Both the focus and the quality of research seem to an outside observer to leave much to be desired. While many academics criticise accountants for creating a profession shrouded in mystique and self-interest, they are doing exactly the same in their own work - with one important difference. Unlike accountants in business or public practice, they have apparently no 'customers' to prevent them becoming smothered in self-absorption. Karl Marx is certainly alive and well in accountancy departments across the country. But he is also no doubt turning fast in those tombs at the thought of those who have failed to move with the times, and who invoke his name while failing to match both his level of analysis and his writing abilities. 'Calls for concomitant change in accountancy practice have been made from perspectives if not entirely internal to the discipline then internal to a dualistic ontology,' the abstract to one jargon-ridden and highly abstract paper begins. Education would not be fulfilling its purpose if it was entirely utilitarian and vocational. A fascinating paper - unfortunately withdrawn at the last minute - promised to reconstruct the fifteenth century accounts of the Cely family, London wool and wheat merchants who diversified into shipping and overseas trading. The findings? The accounts were in some ways highly sophisticated, and showed gross profits from shipping of 100 per cent against 10 per cent for the domestic wool trade. No surprise that the shift in activity took place. But stripped of the blubber of verbiage, too many of the academic papers and presentations had little meat of original or interesting intellectual content, let alone solid bone of theoretical framework or structure. Those attending the conference stressed the importance of meeting colleagues and carrying on work informally outside the seminars, and that many of the papers were at an early stage. But as the principal academic meeting in the UK each year, the output was disappointing. Ironically, one of the better papers was given by two US academics, who suggested that women accountants were more moral than their male counterparts in the Big 6 firms. Others looked at the accuracy of analysts' forecasts, studied the reasons for changes in audit firms by companies and examined the effectiveness of the government's reforms of the National Health Service. Research in many academic subjects has no obvious ties to a profession. Some, such as literature, have little scope for becoming directly 'relevant' to the world outside universities. But what seems surprising is that in one so young and so dependent on practitioners as accounting, there should be so little dialogue. Many of the academics betrayed ignorance or naivety of the profession if not downright hostility. A good number seemed unable to even read a basic set of accounts. As one survey presented at the conference showed, most practitioners believe accounting research is largely theoretical, with less concern on relevance to practical problems. It lacks general application, and focuses on multinationals more than small and medium-sized firms. The mismatch works in both ways. The accountancy profession cannot escape without some blame. It seems to be making little attempt to build bridges, or learn from the more meaningful research. There was no sign of any technical staff or partners from the larger firms at the conference, for instance. The only outsiders to the 400-odd academics were a handful of publishers. Aside from its sponsorship of a few academic posts - rather than specific research projects - its role is negligible. That is not to say that all the practical papers were of the greatest value. One consumed 45 pages of regression analysis to find that the turnover of newly-qualified accountants in the firms is determined by job satisfaction, and commitment to the organisation and the profession. Another provided a useful review of the status of audit committees around the world, but finished with the hardly profound conclusion that: 'they are not, and cannot be, the solution to all corporate ills'. There is clearly a danger that, with funding pressures tightening, research will be diverted too far to practical applications, or dressed uneasily in empirical clothes. A large number of the papers presented in Glasgow used surveys, but their sample sizes and hence reliability were risible: as low as 18 in one case. The university academics mutter that standards have fallen now that polytechnics have been re-titled universities and that their lecturers, recast as dons, are being required to undertake serious research for the first time. But some of these papers do at least have relevance, reflecting the vocational bent of the former polytechnics. One considered ways to make accounting information friendly and useful to managers in business, for instance. A more valid reason for low quality may be that academic accounting is fragmenting, with the more worthwhile research being presented at specialist conferences away from the annual gathering. Yet if there is better work being done elsewhere, there certainly seems to be little attempt to disseminate the findings beyond abstruse technical journals which circulate only to university departments and libraries. That may be the best way to gain personal career advancement for academics, but it does little good to society at large. An interesting start to re-focusing attention outwards was made at this year's conference in the form of a debate between politicians and practitioners. (In the interests of full disclosure, take note that the author of this column chaired the session). Austin Mitchell, the labour MP who is making a second career from lambasting accountants, continued his calls for an end to self-regulation, the introduction of regular rotation of audit firms and a new companies act which sets out auditors' duties to shareholders, including the detection of fraud. Stuart Bell, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, called for a US-style Securities and Exchange Commission, the enshrinement of accounting and auditing standards in European directives and the possibility of German-style supervisory boards to oversee companies. Primrose McCabe, senior vice-president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, asked for time to let the new mechanisms of discipline and enforcement work, while conceding that auditors may have given way to chief executives too easily during the 1980s. Bill Morrison, deputy senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick and chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, stressed the need for litigation protection for auditors and for recognition of the role of professional expertise and judgment in the audit rather than simply simplistic, dogmatic rules. However accurate or misguided these views, they provide an illustration of the some of the concerns vexing the profession. Perhaps academics should take heed of them in determining their own research interests, and then be sure to disseminate the findings widely. While most turn their backs on the world off-campus, the risk is that an unrepresentative handful that do speak up distort the image and reputation of the discipline.</p>

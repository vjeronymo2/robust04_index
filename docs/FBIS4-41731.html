			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 530 ] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, June 27, ELTA -- Opposition leader  Vytautas Landsbergis made a statement on the  Lithuanian-Russian agreement on military transit.    Landsbergis claimed in his statement that "during the  recent days some governmental statements on Russian military  transit via Lithuania have caused great concerns".    Head of negotiation group Bulovas said that the agreement  which had been proposed by Russia could be signed after two  weeks when Lithuania established transit rules for  dangerous and military cargoes.    According to the statement, "President thinks that transits  for all partners should be legalized as soon as possible. As I  can see no logics in such statements, they possibly  include something that should be known by Lithuanian people  before our country finds itself entangled into the Russian  military system".    "Lithuanian labour democratic party has no mandate to  condemn the whole nation", Landsbergis said.</p>

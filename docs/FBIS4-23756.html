			<p>BFN     [Text] The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] has threatened to  embark on mass action if the state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal  is not lifted. The IFP member of Parliament, Mr. Themba Khoza,  has questioned the motive for the declaration of the emergency  regulations in KwaZulu/Natal only and not in other provinces  effected by the violence. He added that the IFP had no problem  with the deployment of the army on the province.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KAROLIUSSEN FEELS RIGHT AT HOME IN U.S.;  </P> <P> SOCCER: EXCHANGE STUDENT FROM NORWAY, WHO BEGAN PLAYING AT 5, HELPS CORONA DEL  MAR TO 7-2 RECORD AND SHOT AT LEAGUE TITLE.  </P> <P> Draped on a soccer goal at Corona del Mar High School was a banner that read,  "Ola, The Winter Formal???"  </P> <P> Ola Karoliussen, an exchange student from Norway, smiled. He carefully removed  the invitation, then neatly folded it up to take home.  </P> <P> "She's a good girl; the answer will be yes," he said.  </P> <P> Obviously, Karoliussen has adjusted to life in Southern California.  </P> <P> He came to the United States, like his father before him, to learn more about  the country and its culture -- including American football. He has absorbed as  much as possible and been a boost to Sea King soccer in the process.  </P> <P> Last season, Corona del Mar finished fourth in the Sea View League. This year,  the Sea Kings are 7-2 and a favorite to win the league title.  </P> <P> Karoliussen, who plays every position except goalie, is big reason for that  success, having scored four goals and assisted on six.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of players back from last year, so I felt we would be a pretty  good team," Corona del Mar Coach Martin McGrogan said. "But Ola was a great  bonus. He's a tremendous player."  </P> <P> Karoliussen grew up in Namsos, a city of 7,000 about 420 miles from Oslo. He  began playing soccer when he was 5 and has developed into an outstanding  player, even by tough European standards.  </P> <P> But Karoliussen's interests extend beyond athletics.  </P> <P> His father, Eagal, was an exchange student in 1957 and remains in contact with  his host family in Alabama. The Karoliussen family visited Alabama in 1974,  Ola's first trip to the United States.  </P> <P> Two of Karoliussen's three sisters also were exchange students; one went to  Baltimore, the other to Wisconsin. So Ola decided he, too, wanted to see the  United States.  </P> <P> "I think it's important to know many languages and cultures," he said. "It can  help you in the business field. I wanted to build up my English and learn about  this country."  </P> <P> Keith Wellput and his family previously have been hosts to exchange students  for the American Field Service. In the past four years, three students have  lived with them.  </P> <P> This year, Wellput wanted to take a year off, but agreed to help place students  in other homes.  </P> <P> "One day I came across Ola's application," said Wellput, a lawyer. "After  reading it, I decided we had to have him live with us. He had such a strong  academic record and other members of his family had been in the program. I  thought it would be a positive experience for all of us."  </P> <P> Karoliussen had a few misconceptions about the United States.  </P> <P> "We know a lot about this country from what we see from music, movies and  television," he said. "But I found that people here were a lot friendlier than  I thought they would be. It's easy to get to know a person, because Americans  are very open."  </P> <P> Karoliussen made a smooth transition. His blond hair helped him fit in at  Corona del Mar and his personality made him popular.  </P> <P> One girl even asked him where his surf board was, because she thought he was a  resident. Karoliussen told her that he was from Norway and had reindeer  instead.  </P> <P> "Most of the time, the exchange students we get here are very timid at first,"  Corona del Mar Athletic Director Jerry Jelnick said. "Not Ola. The first time I  met him, he was outgoing and funny. I was trying to pronounce his name. He  stopped me and said, 'Just call me Dallas. It's easier.' "  </P> <P> Dallas is a nickname from Karoliussen's attempt to play football. He considers  football as the American sport, so he felt compelled to try out for the team.  </P> <P> Karoliussen was a wide receiver and kicker this fall.  </P> <P> "I knew a little about the sport from television, but I had some problems at  first," he said. "I wouldn't run the right patterns and sometimes the ball  would hit me in the face."  </P> <P> Sea King football Coach Dave Holland said Karoliussen learned the game quickly.  Although he never played in a game, Karoliussen became a good receiver.  </P> <P> "Ola was very daring and he liked the contact," Holland said. "I think he could  be a very good player. In fact, I wish I could have him for another year."  </P> <P> But soccer is definitely Karoliussen's sport. He had contacted McGrogan when  school began and asked for a tryout.  </P> <P> McGrogan said the audition was a quick one -- it was obvious Karoliussen had  superior skills.  </P> <P> It was also apparent to opponents from the first game, when Karoliussen scored  twice in a 4-1 victory over Mater Dei.  </P> <P> Since then, opponents have double-teamed him, but they've done little to stop  him.  </P> <P> "Soccer here isn't at the same level," Karoliussen said. "The practices are  different. It seems like guys practice because they have to, not because they  want to. But that's because soccer isn't as big over here yet."  </P> <P> Karoliussen will return in July to Norway, where he plays for a club team. He  said he would like to play in college and maybe as a pro.  </P> <P> But those plans will have to be put on hold for at least a year. He has to  repeat his senior year in high school next year in Norway.  </P> <P> "I don't mind, because the experience I've had will help me," he said. "I've  learned a great deal about this country and my English is much better. I have a  lot of new friends and I have a new family."  </P> <P> And a date for the Winter Formal.  </P></p>

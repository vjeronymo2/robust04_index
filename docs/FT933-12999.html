			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Amdahl loss worse than expected AMDAHL reported heavier than expected losses for the second fiscal quarter as its revenues dropped by one-third. The US mainframe computer manufacturer said poor economic conditions, particularly in Europe, and a trend toward decentralised computer systems had reduced the volume of its business. Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 23.7m, or 21 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 463.2m against net income of Dollars 16.9m, or 15 cents, on higher revenues of Dollars 693m in the same period last year. First-half losses were Dollars 263.4m, or Dollars 2.32, including after-tax charges of Dollars 177.4m in the first quarter, when the company cut back manufacturing capacity with the loss of 1,000 jobs. In the first half of 1992, net income was Dollars 21.3m, or 19 cents. First-half sales were Dollars 843.9m, against Dollars 1.19bn last year. Amdahl said it had cut costs during the quarter by reducing its workforce and closing surplus manufacturing facilities. It also reduced inventories and cut capital spending. The company added that the shift away from central mainframe computers towards networks of smaller computers was more pronounced in some industry sectors than others. It said a customer survey suggested growth in mainframe computer sales would vary widely depending on the business involved. Last month Amdahl and Electronic Data Systems formed a joint venture software company, the Antares Alliance Group, which is working on software that will speed the development of applications programs. Last week, Amdahl also announced an agreement with Fujitsu, the Japanese computer manufacturer, and ICL of the UK to collaborate in the development of a common UNIX operating system for the companies' computer products. Fujitsu holds an equity stake in Amdahl and owns ICL.</p>

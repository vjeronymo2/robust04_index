			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Capture of Carlos makes Pasqua's summer: France's bluff interior minister is emerging as a force to be reckoned with Mr Charles Pasqua, France's bluff, gruff, interior minister, is on a roll. The arrest of Carlos 'The Jackal', the terrorist who had eluded the world's security forces for two decades, represents a coup in a political career which has earned Mr Pasqua the reputation of a populist enemy of crime and terrorism. The snaring of the Jackal followed hard on the heels of a high-profile clampdown on Islamic militants after the killing of five French citizens in Algeria earlier this month. This brought a sweeping stop-and-search operation and the internment of 26 suspected militants in a disused army barracks in north-eastern France. The combined effect of the clampdown and the arrest has been to thrust the interior minister to a decisive position in French politics, nine months ahead of presidential elections. With Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, and most other cabinet members on vacation, Mr Pasqua has been de facto leader of the centre-right administration, trampling on the territory of colleagues such as Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister. Referring to his rise, the French press have dubbed the past few weeks 'the summer of Pasqua'. Mr Pasqua's influence is set, however, to last well beyond the summer to next spring's presidential poll. His exploits have prompted speculation that he himself could run for the presidency. 'It is very possible that Pasqua could be interested in the election,' says one member of the UDF, the junior partner in France's centre-right coalition. Mr Pasqua, who would be trusted as president by 30 per cent of voters, according to a poll this week by the CSA institute, has been untypically guarded about his ambitions. 'With political ideals based on those of Charles de Gaulle, one doesn't act on the basis of personal interests but on the basis of the national interest,' he told Agence France-Presse, the French news agency, at the beginning of the month. For most observers, however, Mr Pasqua is much more likely to be a kingmaker than a candidate in the elections to succeed Socialist President Francois Mitterrand. Both Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac, who are currently shadow-boxing in their quest to represent the Gaullist RPR party, will need to court the support of Mr Pasqua in their bids for the Elysee. As a reward, Mr Pasqua may be hoping to be selected as prime minister. The importance of Mr Pasqua's support lies in his populist appeal to traditional Gaullist voters. His tough stance on crime and his opposition to the creation of a federal Europe, means he can deliver the votes of many who might be tempted to back the National Front party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, or of those attracted to Mr Philippe de Villiers, the Eurosceptic who shocked the French political establishment by winning 12 per cent of the vote in this year's European elections. For Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac, however, harnessing Mr Pasqua is a tricky task. Although he was an ally of Mr Chirac, under whom he served as interior minister between 1986 and 1988, relations between the two have become strained. In particular, Mr Pasqua felt snubbed by Mr Chirac's failure to back him in opposing the Maastricht treaty on European union. In the case of Mr Balladur, there is a clash of style as well as substance. The smooth, cautious Mr Balladur is a graduate of the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration. By contrast, the coarse and straight-talking Mr Pasqua based his political ascent on the creation and leadership of Gaullist organisations such as the Service d'Action Civique. Opposites can, however, attract. Mr Balladur, mindful of Mr Pasqua's grass-roots popularity in a country increasingly anxious about law and order and immigration and suspicious of the process of European integration, has expressed his 'full support' for his minister's security operations. As ever, with Mr Pasqua, there are risks involved. Allegations of a tradeoff between France and Sudan to secure the Jackal's extradition could yet prove an embarrassment to the prime minister and his hardline colleague. The clampdown on Moslem militants could prompt reprisals from extremist groups. In expressing his support for Mr Pasqua, however, Mr Balladur is aware that he may be an abrasive ally, but he is certainly a dangerous opponent.</p>

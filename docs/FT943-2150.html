			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Toshiba plans Y100bn chip plant: Productivity advances expected at D-Ram facility in central Japan Toshiba, the Japanese integrated electronics company, is to invest Y100bn (Pounds 645m) over three years in a new semiconductor factory it will build in Japan that will significantly boost its chip production capacity. The proposed investment, announced yesterday, helps ease fears that Japan's industrial base is 'hollowing out' as a growing number of Japanese manufacturers have stepped up investments in overseas plants in order to combat the adverse effects of a high yen. When completed, Toshiba's chip factory - to be built in Mie Prefecture in central Japan - will be the largest in the country. With the new plant, Toshiba will add production capacity of 4.5m 16-megabit dynamic random access memory chips (D-Rams) per month to its current capacity of 3m a month. The company also plans to raise productivity in its semiconductor operations by 2.5 times over the next three years by cutting development time and reducing the number of processes involved in manufacturing. The new plant will eventually produce next generation 64-megabit D-Rams, which are expected to be in strong demand by about 1997. The race to increase semiconductor manufacturing capacity has been spurred by buoyant demand for semiconductors, particularly D-Rams, from the computer industry. Toshiba, for example, saw revenues grow 6 per cent last year and expects to see a 14 per cent rise to Y830bn in the year to March 1995. Industry leaders, however, believe there is a pressing need for greater investment in capacity to meet expected buoyant demand. Japanese semiconductor makers have slipped behind in their capital spending in recent years, compared with investments by US companies. Korean semiconductor manufacturers, which have been fierce competitors in the D-Ram market, are also stepping up investments. Not to be left behind, Japanese semiconductor companies are increasing spending this year on manufacturing facilities. NEC, which is one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, is building a new chip plant in southern Japan, at a cost of Y95bn, to make advanced generation chips and has indicated its intention to invest a similar amount in another plant, possibly in Scotland. Altogether NEC plans capital spending of Y110bn this year, up from Y90bn last year and in line with its peak level of expenditure in the semiconductor business in 1990. Toshiba plans capital spending in its semiconductor operations of Y90bn this year compared with Y80bn last year and a peak of Y125bn in 1990.</p>

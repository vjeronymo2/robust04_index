			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Indian group finds cure for investment lethargy - Ranbaxy Laboratories is well placed to capitalise on government reforms Mr Parvinder Singh, chairman of Ranbaxy Laboratories, India's second-largest drugs company, started building international links long before they became fashionable in India. Examining the success of the large western multinational pharmaceutical companies, he decided in the early 1980s to concentrate on exports and seek foreign partnerships. Ten years before Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, embarked on his widely-praised liberalisation, Mr Singh was already establishing ties around the world. Today, Ranbaxy's exports amount to over 30 per cent of its turnover; by the year 2000, they are planned to rise to 45 per cent. The group has a trading company in Hong Kong, joint venture manufacturing plants in Nigeria, Malaysia and Canada, and another under construction in southern China. It is talking to potential partners for joint-venture marketing companies in the US and in Europe. It has an agreement with Eli Lilly of the US for the sale of Eli Lilly products in India. To help fund these ventures, Ranbaxy plans to tap international markets this spring with a Dollars 100m equity issue. The family-owned company has suffered from its share of the in-fighting which has hit a number of Indian business families. Mr Singh, aged 51, took control of Ranbaxy from his father Mr Bhai Mohan Singh, the company's founder. However, Mr Singh senior tried to retain an influence over Ranbaxy long after he handed over day-to-day management to his son in the early 1980s. Unlike some other family rows, however, these conflicts have not prevented Ranbaxy from growing faster than any other leading Indian drugs group. With sales of Rs5.6bn (Dollars 180.6m) in the year to March 1993, and pre-tax profits of Rs770m, Ranbaxy is still small by the standards of the western drugs companies which dominate the international markets. Mr Singh, however, is convinced that by exploiting the right niche opportunities he can compete with the leaders, even in industrialised country markets. The key to his plan is the fact that patents on important internationally-known branded drugs expire in the next few years. They include drugs in the two areas in which Ranbaxy has specialised: antibiotic preparations made from flouroquinolones, and anti-bacterial medicines based on cephalosporins. Mr Singh says both drugs are reasonably difficult to make - so western groups wanting to compete with the former patent-holders will value Ranbaxy's techniques. Mr Singh faces some formidable hurdles. First, the Indian pharmaceuticals market has long been squeezed by strict government price controls, designed to bring cheap medicines to the poor. These have limited the industry's profits, and so its capacity to invest in research. Also, operating under tightly-regulated conditions, it has had little need to develop high-quality marketing skills. While the government is considering easing restrictions, drugs companies do not expect radical changes in the regime. Moreover, Indian law has until now not acknowledged patents on products, only on processes. So, Indian companies have been free to copy western drugs simply by devising different ways of producing them. This has done nothing to foster competition in product research and development. At the same time, western companies have had every reason to be cautious about sharing know-how. Mr Singh says Ranbaxy has coped with these conditions better than other Indian companies by not neglecting investment in improving production and marketing. In the 10 years to March 1993, the company's net asset rose from Rs141m to Rs630m. Its plants in India and abroad are modern and have won official approval from standards authorities in western countries, including the US's tough FDA. The emphasis on internationalisation has permeated the whole company, says Mr Singh. 'Everyone has it at the forefront of their mind not to be satisfied with success in the Indian market, but to aim for world markets,' he says. Mr Singh says Ranbaxy has also distanced itself from other Indian drugs companies by advocating that India should accept western countries' demands and protect products as well as processes. This may now be inevitable, as India has accepted the conclusions of the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks, in which the participants agreed to strengthen patent laws. However, it may take some time for the laws to be enacted, and for the enforcement agencies to be established. Mr Singh argues that product patents are in Indian companies' long-term interest: only such patents will encourage the Indians to develop their own products. Mr Singh is sure that India has the potential to become an innovator in pharmaceuticals, given the quality of research engineers and the success of Indian emigrants in other countries. 'We have the right ingredients for success,' says Mr Singh, who himself has a doctorate in pharmacy. 'Deep-down we have an inquiring mind-set. Now that the country is opening up, in the next five to 10 years there will be a change in the industry. We will become more research minded.'</p>

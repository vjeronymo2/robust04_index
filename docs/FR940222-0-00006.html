This action requires removing a sample of the wing front spar lower cap (spar cap) material for examination, and, depending upon the results of that examination, inspecting or replacing the spar cap. Reports of cracks caused by stress corrosion in the spar cap on several of the affected airplanes prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure caused by cracks in the spar cap. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Effective April 11, 1994.

The action proposed to require removing a sample of the spar cap material for examination, and, depending upon the results of the examination, inspecting or replacing the spar cap. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 215, dated March 3, 1992. The proposed replacements, if necessary, would be accomplished in accordance with one of the following, as applicable:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK&hyph;144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992, which applies to Twin Commander Model 690B airplanes; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK&hyph;145, dated August 21, 1992, which applies to Twin Commander Model 500S airplanes; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;AVIADESIGN, Inc. Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), dated July 16, 1992, which applies to Twin Commander Model 690B airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 80 affected airplanes registered in the United States, 34 have already accomplished this inspection in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 215, dated March 3, 1992. For five of these airplanes, or approximately 15 percent, the examination revealed a grain structure that would require spar cap replacement under the criteria of this proposed AD. These five airplane operators voluntarily replaced the spar cap in order to assure safety of their airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the 10 comments received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight commenters concur with the proposed rule as written.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommends deleting the terms ``fine equi-axed'' and ``unusual cap grain structure'' from the proposal. This commenter states that there is no standard for grain structure in aluminum alloy products and believes that characterizing the spar cap grain structure as unusual is inappropriate and may not focus on the best course of corrective action. The Commenter also states that the word fine in ``fine equi-axed grain structure'' is so imprecise that the structure is unable to be accurately measured. The FAA concurs that ``unusual grain structure'' could be inappropriate and has changed the wording in the final rule AD to ``smaller than the large elongated grains, but not fine equi-axed''. The FAA does not concur that the term ``fine equi-axed'' is imprecise because the FAA included in the proposal (Note 2) a definition of this term. In addition, the EMTEC Corporation, which is the laboratory conducting the metallurgical examinations, has established, with the FAA and Twin Commander, the acceptable grain structure size of the spar cap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter also states that the grain structure should not be the sole indicator of susceptibility to stress corrosion. The FAA concurs. The affected airplanes are also included in the applicability of the actions specified in Dockets No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;38&hyph;AD and No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;43&hyph;AD, which require other inspections of the spar cap. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same commenter also recommends consideration of other comprehensive corrective actions that deal with the impact of design and operating stress and sources of bi-metallic-initiated general corrosion. The FAA has determined that the current corrective action is one that will return the airplane to its original certification level of safety. The FAA will evaluate any detailed corrective action, and, if determined to provide an equivalent level of safety, will approve it as an alternative method of compliance to that portion of the required action. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter, the Civil Aviation Authority of Australia (CAA), recommends that the FAA expand the range of serial numbers in the applicability and expand the spar cap replacement to include all unusual grain structures as well as fine equi-axed grain structures. The FAA has re-examined all information related to this subject and has determined that the airplanes manufactured with spars of the fine equi-axed grain structure are limited to those manufactured between May 1978 and October 1979. The results of inspections received to date including those from the CAA verify this conclusion. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After examining all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the minor wording change and minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 80 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 15 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $32 per airplane, and the metallurgical inspection will cost approximately $150. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $81,360. As previously discussed, 34 of the 80 affected airplanes have already accomplished the required actions. This reduces the cost impact of this AD upon U.S. operators to $56,392. The manufacturer will also incur the cost of the required metallurgical examination. The EMTEC Corporation will bill the manufacturer and send the results of the required inspection to the airplane owner/operator. This will further reduce the cost impact upon U.S. operators by $8,400 from $56,392 to $47,992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

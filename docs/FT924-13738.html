			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Coal takes the unkindest cut MARKHAM MAIN, Bevercotes, Cotgrave, Frickley, Grimethorpe, Houghton Main. The names echo across a century of Britain's industrial history and culture, recalling a conflict here, a brass band there, a disaster elsewhere. These six, along with 25 others, are pits which will cease to produce coal as a result of the cuts announced yesterday by British Coal. Coming at the nadir of recession, the loss of 30,000 more jobs, is a grave matter. It is proper to ask who is to blame for this state of affairs and whether any other course is available. The accusing finger points most obviously at the National Union of Mineworkers and its leader, Mr Arthur Scargill. It was he who proclaimed a mission to defend the coal industry but whose reckless and misguided actions ensured that miners became a symbol of political extremism and their industry a byword for instability and unreliability. The Thatcher government vowed to destroy Mr Scargill's power and had the backing of most British people when it succeeded in doing so during the 1984-85 miners' strike. Scargill factor Since the strike, Mr Scargill has continued his menaces, but ever more hollowly as the industry has crumbled around him. But his ghost has served as a pungent reminder that coal had thrown away its biggest asset, that it is indigenous, plentiful and above all secure. Since British coal has powerful natural disadvantages - it pollutes the air more than gas, oil and nuclear and is 50 per cent more costly than imported coal - this put British Coal in a very vulnerable position. The result has been that as soon as coal's customers in the electric power industry achieved, through privatisation, the freedom to diversify away from coal, they have done so, even in some cases contracting for gas-fired power stations whose economics is questionable. The two big generators, National Power and Powergen, are bargaining British Coal into the ground over a five-year contract to apply from next April. Yesterday, British Coal admitted that it can persuade the generators to take no more than 40m tonnes of coal in the first year of the new contract, compared with 65m tonnes this year. By the time the details of this contract are complete, the government plans to have submitted to parliament a bill to privatise what remains of the coal industry. In one way, then, the coal story can be viewed as a triumph of market economics, albeit one with very painful consequences. The government says electricity bills will be 3 per cent lower than would otherwise have been the case, with obvious benefits for industrial competitiveness. Market forces The story is not, however, quite that simple, since the private sector utilities to which British Coal either offers competition or supplies are themselves imperfectly exposed to market forces. In supporting the reference of British Gas to the Monopolies Commission this year, the government has at last recognised that its privatisation as a single entity was a serious mistake. It has yet to be quite so candid about electricity, where the inadequately regulated duopoly of National Power and Powergen is a candidate for draconian scrutiny by the competition authorities. Then there is the nuclear power industry, still in state hands, heavily subsidised and due for official review in 1994. This industry is already pressing its case for investment in additional power stations, further threatening the coal industry. There is no case for paying British Coal to produce fuel no one wishes to buy, and none for denying to the British economy the benefits of low world energy prices. That other EC countries do subsidise their much more inefficient industries cannot alter this judgment. But as they line up for their redundancy pay, Britain's coal miners will be right to reflect that the harsh wind of market forces has not blown uniformly across British energy policy. It is not possible to judge whether the Pounds 1bn the government said yesterday it would make available to help regenerate the economies of shattered mining communities is an adequate sum. As victims of the energy policy errors of the 1980s as well as of their own misjudgments, the miners deserve generosity.</p>

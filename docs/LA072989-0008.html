			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REBECCA SCHAEFFER'S MURDER: THINGS THAT WENT WRONG  </P> <P> A lonely man worships and adores a beautiful, distant woman. She's the only  brightness in his life. Then, one day he shoots her. We react in disbelief. Who  can fathom such behavior? Who can explain it? Finally, we content ourselves  with a resigned "there is no explaining it."  </P> <P> But of course that's nonsense. The behavior is entirely fathomable, it's easy  to explain. It's the behavior of a jealous child who takes his friend's new toy  and breaks it -- it's "If I can't have it, no one else will." It's selfishness,  only selfishness taken to the most awful level.  </P> <P> What is unfathomable is our part in this. We let it get to that awful level. We  provide the gun.  </P> <P> Year after year America puts guns in the hands of sick men who are no better  equipped to manage them than those jealous children would be. Then we react in  disbelief when tragedy results. We make it easy to get guns and we make it easy  to kill.  </P> <P> Gun control makes it harder. America still can't understand that. That's the  only thing there truly is no explaining.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER LLOYD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: An uncomfortable animal seeks big game status - Guy de Jonquieres looks at Cadbury Schweppes' plans to change its international image CADBURY Schweppes thinks it suffers from a perception problem. 'People today want an uncomplicated, two-word description of everything,' says Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman. 'But if you are more than national, yet less than global, you are an uncomfortable animal to describe.' The stock market seems to agree. Until last autumn, Britain's largest confectionery and soft drinks company was a City darling. Applauded for the quality of its management, its tight focus on two core businesses and its strong commitment to product innovation and brand support, its shares handsomely out-performed the UK food sector from mid-1991. But recently, Cadbury's City halo has slipped and its share price with it, although the latter has recovered partially in the last few weeks. As its premium rating has eroded, some erstwhile fans have begun to wonder if their earlier enthusiasm was overdone. This swing in sentiment seems hard to pin only on Cadbury's recent performance - or on the fading of long-standing speculation that it was a prime bid target. True, pre-tax profits rose only 5.7 per cent last year, well below the annual growth to which investors have grown accustomed. But the results, depressed by a Pounds 14m restructuring charge, handsomely exceeded expectations and were accompanied by bullish management forecasts for this year. The doubts most often expressed concern the longer term. One is that Cadbury has outgrown the UK but lacks a convincing international expansion strategy. The other is that, to secure future growth, it must take some bold strategic initiative soon. Mr Les Pugh, food industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, says Cadbury is 'at a watershed'. Mr John Campbell of NatWest Securities, which recently issued a bearish report on the group, argues that it is 'in a strategic bind.' 'Baloney,' replies Mr Cadbury, insisting no dramatic moves are needed or likely. 'Our task is to go on growing the business by incremental steps. We've done it in the past 10 years - why should we not be able to in the next 10?' He points to the success of both UK businesses, Cadbury Ltd and Coca - Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages, the six year-old venture with Coca-Cola, in increasing sales and profits. Both are the market leaders and earned margins of more than 10 per cent last year. Sceptics agree that the record is impressive, but wonder whether the businesses can grow much faster than their markets in the future. They argue that Cadbury Ltd has profited from one-off rationalisation at Trebor Bassett, its sugar confectionery division, and from temporarily weaker performances by rivals Nestle and Mars. Meanwhile, the recent sale by Terry's, United Biscuits' chocolate division, to Philip Morris of the US has brought another heavyweight contender into the UK. But the keenest debate centres on Cadbury's international businesses, into which a growing share of resources has been channelled. Seventeen of its 20 acquisitions in the past five years were abroad and accounted for Pounds 900m of the Pounds 1.25bn total spent. But while half of sales has for some years come from abroad, the share of profits has slipped from 63 per cent in 1989 to 55 per cent last year. Cadbury's overseas operations, spanning some 150 countries, are widely, but thinly, spread. It is clear leader only in a few - mostly traditional Commonwealth markets. The group says exploiting profitable sub-sectors of the market matters more than overall category leadership and scale. Nonetheless, it has recently been stung by the sceptics into raising the profile of its international ambitions, particularly in confectionery, where foreign expansion has historically received less emphasis than in beverages. 'The aim is very clear. We intend to be part of the big league,' says Mr David Wellings, who became group chief executive last month after running the confectionery business. He wants Cadbury to rise from fourth position in the Dollars 45bn world market to rival Philip Morris for second place behind Nestle. The challenge is how to do it. Cadbury sold its US operations in 1988 to Hershey, which makes its brands under licence, though it remains free to sell sugar confectionery there. Cadbury also concedes it is weak in continental Europe, where its confectionery sales in France, Germany and Spain were Pounds 269m last year. The group needs acquisitions to expand further in Europe and is counting on competitive pressures to shake out more candidates. But rivals have already purchased many of the best targets, and most of those remaining are small and privately-owned. They are also being eyed just as eagerly by Philip Morris and Nestle, which have deep pockets and reputations for paying sky-high prices. Mr Wellings remains undaunted. 'If we can't find a ready - made hotel to buy in Europe, we'll build our own brick by brick.' he says. Apart from Australia and New Zealand, where Cadbury is well-entrenched, that leaves Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The group thinks these regions are set for rapid growth and has long had a presence in all of them. It recently built a plant in Egypt and plans another in China. However, the investments needed to build sizeable businesses in so many countries look formidable. Though the group's balance sheet and cash flow are strong, Mr Cadbury admits new markets take time to contribute to the profits stream which he is committed to increasing every year. Nor is the Cadbury brand that powerful an asset. Though the company is known worldwide, its name and established confectionery lines mean little to consumers in many countries. Even in Europe, Mr Wellings says, UK products need to be re-formulated and re-branded locally. In beverages, the challenges are different. Brands such as Schweppes and Canada Dry are genuinely global. However, like much of the group's beverage range, they are niche products with limited mass market appeal. Though the world's third largest soft drinks producer, Cadbury Schweppes' 4 per cent market share puts it far behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. The group's prosperity hinges on balancing between two options. Either it can franchise its brands to other soft drinks bottlers, which minimises investment but also control over distribution. Or it can invest in its own bottling facilities, as it did by acquiring a Mexican mineral water company for Pounds 188m last year. That gives a firmer grip on marketing but requires high sales volumes to be economic. Cadbury Schweppes' success in treading this tightrope has depended heavily on its agility and skill in forging alliances around the world with its bigger rivals. 'We can help Pepsi by strengthening its ability to compete with Coke, and we can help Coke by filling niches in its portfolio,' says Mr Frank Swan, head of the group's beverage business. That did not prevent an uneven performance in continental Europe last year, due partly to structural changes and fiercer competition in the soft drinks business. But Mr Swan thinks these shifts will also create chances for deals and ventures which Cadbury is well-placed to seize. In the US, he says, the group can continue to grow profitably by distributing existing products more widely. But he would also like to expand its modest 4 per cent market share and brand portfolio through acquisitions. He does not rule out a deal with Dr Pepper, the soft drinks group which Cadbury tried to buy in the 1980s and which has US sales double those of the UK company. But some observers believe that, with Mr Wellings as chief executive, any big medium-term developments are more likely be outside soft drinks  - a view reinforced by his recent emphasis on the global ambitions of the confectionery side. Nor does Mr Wellings exclude expansion into new fields. While dismissing as speculation reports that Cadbury had discussed a possible merger with United Biscuits earlier this year, he says: 'Just because we make products that are brown and sold in little packets doesn't mean that is the only business we are going to be in. It is a statement of fact that we're in confectionery and soft drinks. It need not be a statement of intent.' What lies behind those comments is unclear. The group's top managers emphasise that they remain pragmatic about how to further the group's development and will take opportunities as they come. 'Acquisition, alliance, joint venture - we're open to it,' says Mr Wellings. However, that also implies a dependence on the right opportunities turning up at the right moment. Perhaps the one certainty is that, as a group which is committed to sustained increases in annual profits and has already experienced the threat of hostile takeover, Cadbury knows it cannot afford to disappoint the expectations its performance has created among its shareholders.</p>

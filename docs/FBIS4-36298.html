			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi -- Union Minister for External Affairs  Dinesh Singh will be out of action for the month as he is  leaving or Monday for treatment in London.    Singh, who took over as External Affairs Minister a  year-and-a-half ago, has kept indifferent health almost  throughout the period.    Though Singh could not be contacted, his colleagues told  INDIAN EXPRESS that the minister was leaving for London on  Monday morning. He was likely to be away for a month, they said.    Through sheer coincidence, the top bureaucrat in the  ministry  is also not expected to be in Delhi for some days. Foreign  Secretary K Srinivasan is also in a London Hospital; he flew  there after catching malaria during his Bulgaria trip with  President Shankar Dayal Sharma.    With an ailing cabinet minister at the top, much of the work  is split among his two deputies, Ministers of State R L Bhatia  and Salman Khurshid.    Bhatia has just returned from the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)  Foreign Minister's Conference at Cairo, and Khurshid left on  Sunday for a week-long trip to Kazakhstan, Kyrghizistan and  Tajikstan.    With illness taking him to London, Dinesh Singh will be  missing from the scene just when he might be needed at home.  The Foreign Office should now be working at consolidating the  gains of Rao's US visit, and another important summit is  scheduled later this month when Rao flies to Moscow to meet  President Boris Yeltsin.    Like always, Dinesh Singh's illness triggers off bouts of  speculation about replacing him with a fitter man. The rumour  mill has begun churning again; and Human Resource Development  Minister Arjun Singh is now being mentioned as the man who might  take over the ministry.</p>

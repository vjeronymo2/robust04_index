			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Philosophical Sciences Valeriy </F> Khmelko, chief of the department of sociology of the Kiev-Mohyla  Academy University, under the rubric "Election 94--27 March":  "Deep Down, Most of Us Are Private Operators"]    [Text] Given that the greatest concern of voters is the  condition of the economy, their attitudes toward the main  alternatives on which various proposals for overcoming the  economic crisis are actually based are particularly interesting.  The well-known political forces fall on the common ideological  cliche of "capitalism or socialism" in order to characterize the  opposition of these alternatives. However, this merely makes the  essence of the issue mythical because actually this is about the  opposition of two kinds of "capitalism": one--with free  competition, which defends the right of man to private economic  activities and ensures free competition among various forms of  ownership and organization of production, and the other, which  we are directly familiar with, is state-monopoly capitalism,  which bans (or extremely constrains) private economic activities  by the people, destroys free competition, and protects the  monopoly of the machinery of state on the command management of  the entire economy.    Capital forms the economic foundation of both these systems.  However, in the former case it is mostly private capital, and in  the latter case solely state capital. For almost 60 years (since  the end of the 1920's) we have lived under the absolute  dominance of state property and its administrators. In the last  few years (since the late 1980's), a small proportion of  capital, approximately 8 percent, has become private. At  present, when state capital remains dominant but the process of  privatization is advancing somehow, albeit at a snail's pace,  Ukraine is confronted with the decisive choice of who to elect  to the new parliament: those who will stop the development of  private enterprise or, on the contrary, those who will support  its development.    At present, not only the fate of Ukrainian independence but  also the welfare of a majority of Ukraine's citizens hinge on  the correct resolution of this issue. For this reason the  attitude of voters toward the development of private enterprise  in Ukraine and, accordingly, toward private property is  particularly interesting.    What is the opinion of urban voters?    Only 11 percent of those surveyed believe that private  enterprise should not be developed, 14 percent refrained from  giving a firm answer, and an impressive majority--75  percent--believe that private enterprise should be developed.  More than one-half of the latter come out in favor of developing  private enterprise as rapidly as possible.    These data indicate that despite the catastrophic condition  of the economy and the efforts of certain forces to pass off the  appearance of the private enterprise sector as the main reason  for the economic crisis and impoverishment of the people, a  majority of people do not believe this (75 percent of urban  voters amounts to more than one-half of all voters). In the last  two years the proportion of urban residents who do believe it  has increased only slightly. According to data in surveys by the  Kiev International Institute of Sociology together with the  research department of the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) in  December 1991 and November 1992, at the time respectively 6 and  10 percent of those polled among the urban population (answering  the same questions as this time) came out against the  development of private enterprise. On both occasions, 83 percent  came out in favor of developing private enterprise--only 8  percent more than at present.    It is also important to note that opponents of the  development of private enterprise are almost 1.5 times less  numerous among those who intend to turn out for the elections  and those who are not sure than among those who do not intend to  turn out. On the other hand, supporters of the development of  private enterprise account for 69 percent of those who do not  intend to vote and 72 percent among those who are not sure,  whereas among the voters who intend to vote the proportion of  supporters of private enterprise comes to 79 percent. Of these,  42 percent came out in favor of developing private enterprise as  fast as possible, and 37 percent believe that private enterprise  should be developed slowly and gradually.    Among the urban population as a whole, men (79 percent) came  out in favor of developing private enterprise more often then  women (71 percent). This support falls with age (from 86 percent  among young people to 59 percent among those over 60) and grows  with the educational level. Among those with less than a  secondary education, 57 percent of urban residents have a  positive attitude toward private enterprise, among those with a  complete secondary education--77 percent, and among those with a  higher education--87 percent. The proportion of such voters is  notably greater among students (95 percent), managers (89  percent), servicemen (88 percent), and specialists (86 percent)  than among clerical employees (79 percent) and workers (76  percent), and especially retirees (58 percent). Among unskilled  workers, 64 percent came out in favor of private enterprise,  whereas among skilled workers the figure was 82 percent.    Overall support for the development of private enterprise is  actually the same among Ukrainians and Russians (73-74 percent).  However, "gradualists," if you will, the supporters of the slow  and gradual implementation of this development, are somewhat  more numerous among Ukrainians--37 percent compared to 32  percent among Russians. Among the latter, "radicals," supporters  of the fastest possible development of private enterprise, are  somewhat more numerous: 41 percent against 37 percent among  Ukrainians.    The difference between the urban populations of the Western  and Eastern Regions is even greater in this regard. The  proportion of "gradualists" among voters in the West (45  percent) is considerably greater than in the East (25 percent),  and the proportion of "radicals" in the East (41 percent) is  somewhat greater than in the West (35 percent).    However, in general it might make sense for candidates for  Supreme Council deputy to factor in the fact that even in the  east of Ukraine an impressive majority, two-thirds of those  surveyed, come out in favor of the development of private  enterprise. This is to say nothing about the south and the  center, where more than three-quarters of urban voters come out  in favor of it, and in particular the west, where this  proportion reaches four-fifths.</p>

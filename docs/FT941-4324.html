			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Applied Distribution valued at Pounds 40.9m Shares in Applied Distribution were priced yesterday at 135p, valuing the contract distribution group, which was formed five years ago under a Pounds 16.5m management buy-out from Geest, at Pounds 40.9m. The placing of 17.25m shares, representing 57 per cent of the enlarged capital, was completed yesterday by NatWest Wood Mackenzie, broker to the issue. The sponsor is Baring Brothers. Some 11.35m new shares are being issued, valued at Pounds 15.3m, and the balance consists of 5.9m shares being sold by existing shareholders. Part of the Pounds 14.5m net proceeds will be used to repay bank and other borrowings totalling about Pounds 11m. The rest will be used for working capital and investment. Since the buy-out, the group has achieved compound annual growth in turnover of about 20 per cent and operating profits have grown at a compound average annual rate of 7 per cent. Last month the group reported operating profits of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.4m) on turnover of Pounds 26.4 (Pounds 21.4m) for 1993. Pre-tax profits increased by 27 per cent to Pounds 2.23m. Applied Distribution has benefited from the growing trend among UK retailers and manufacturers to switch from in-house warehousing and distribution arrangements to third party contracts. Customers, including J Sainsbury, Somerfield/Gateway and Esso, are served from five national depots. Dealings in the new shares are expected to begin on March 17.</p>

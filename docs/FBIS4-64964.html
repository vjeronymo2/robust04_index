			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Solveig Rodsgaard: "A Long, Long Election </F> Campaign"]    [Text] The frantic search for big issues has begun. We are  not accustomed to an ordinary Folketing election that has not  been called because of an issue.    The future of the welfare state is currently the key phrase  for the campaign. Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has not  yet called the Folketing election, of course, and the four  government parties have not yet decided whether they will  conduct a joint campaign and what the election platform will be  if they do.    But the ideological tone has been set. The prime minister  and  the government will use the possibility of a VKZ  [Liberal/Conservative/Progress Party] majority as a bogeyman and  have rejected the new Liberal and Conservative economic  initiatives for the time being, noting that "the Liberals and  Conservatives are setting the stage for heavy-handed treatment  of the weakest groups in society." Naturally the two parties  indignantly reject that interpretation.    In any case it will be a long campaign. Prime Minister  Rasmussen is still floating the idea that Tuesday, 6 September,  would be a good election date. But in reality the date has not  been determined. Government sources say the election will  probably be held either in September or at the beginning of  November. If it is held in September the four government parties  will be bound together by the 1995 budget bill that will be  presented before the end of August. Moreover, the newly elected  Folketing could start work on 4 October when the Folketing  session begins. If the election is held at the beginning of  November, the four government parties will be bound together by  both the budget bill and the prime minister's opening address,  which can be used as a joint election platform. The election  could then be called in connection with the opening of the  Folketing.    The risk of a long campaign is obvious. Of course the  government will present some bills and proposals in the months  ahead, but big reforms will be out of the question. That  provides a possibility that minor political issues will be blown  out of proportion and dominate the political picture. This kind  of debate can be hard to control. For both the government  parties and the opposition parties.    Danish politicians are not used to long election periods  where a Folketing election is not called until just before the  end of the four-year term. Usually there are approximately two  to two and a half years between elections, after which an  election is called on the basis of a particular issue. On the  rare occasions when the politicians go through three years of an  election period they all have their eyes fixed on the coming  election. That is also the case this time.    The prime minister attacked the Liberal and Conservative  proposals on Wednesday [23 March] after a two-day government  meeting at the Toruplund conference center near Hundested. At  the meeting the government agreed on a number of legislative  initiatives that will be worked out in the months ahead.  <H5>  Government Proposal </H5>   The government has presented an action plan, "Focusing on  the  Patient." According to the plan, illness prevention will be  strengthened, waiting periods at hospitals will be reduced, and  the quality of the health system will be improved. The plan will  be discussed with the County Council Association and the  government will not promise more money for the health area in  advance.    Education Minister Ole Vig Jensen will present another plan  this spring. "Growth in the Universities" is the name of the  plan, which is aimed at improving the quality of institutions of  higher education over a 10-year period.  <H5>  Pension and Cost-of-Living Funds </H5>   The four government parties have also finally agreed on a  bill that will enable the wage-earner funds to increase their  investments in the private business sector. The government will  give the Labor Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP) and the  Wage Earners' Cost-of-Living Fund (LD) an opportunity to invest  35 percent of their total capital in stocks compared with the  current limit of 25 percent. At the same time the limit on how  much of the capital can be invested in a single firm will be  raised from 2 to 3 percent on condition that the listed company  has net capital of over 250 million kroner. The government -- at  the request of the Radicals in particular -- has decided to  appoint a committee to investigate how to create more democracy  in the pension and wage-earner funds and report back by the end  of 1994.    The question of the ATP's and LD's increased investment  opportunities created political turbulence a few weeks ago when  Conservative Party leader Hans Engell declared his willingness  to engage in a debate on the funds. The government responded  eagerly. But Engell is not satisfied with the government's  proposal because it does not meet his demand for providing an  opportunity to pay the LD money to wage earners earlier. Engell  wants an age limit of 50 years for payment. Liberal political  spokesman Anders Fogh Rasmussen also rejects the government's  proposal because it does not support the Liberal demand that  individual wage earners be given greater freedom to withdraw the  money.  <H5>  Conservative Plan </H5>   All in all the prospect of broad cooperation between the  government and the opposition looks somewhat dim now that the  ideological banner on the welfare state has been raised. The  Liberal tax initiative has been shot full of holes by the  government, led by Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft and Tax  Minister Ole Stavad.    On the other hand the finance minister was more conciliatory  Monday when he commented on the Conservatives' economic  proposal. But the prime minister's comments after the Toruplund  meeting were considerably sharper. Apparently the idea of  driving a government wedge between the Liberals and the  Conservatives has been abandoned, now it is a question of  issuing warnings about a VKZ majority.    "The Danish Economy Toward the Year 2000 -- Growth and  Prosperity" is the name of the Conservative plan. According to  the plan, 160,000 new jobs can be created over the next five  years, mainly in the private sector. In the labor market area it  proposes limiting the unemployment compensation period to just  four years. The level of unemployment benefits would be 80  percent for all four years, but the maximum benefit would be  increased so that workers with higher incomes would have better  coverage in the initial unemployment period. The maximum benefit  would be 180,000 kroner in the first year of unemployment,  140,000 in the second, and 110,000 in the third and fourth years.    It is precisely this proposal to pay higher unemployment  benefits to workers who earned higher wages that has been  sharply rejected by the government, which considers it an attack  on the weak groups in society.    In the longer term the Conservatives also want the  unemployment benefits system privatized, making the labor market  factions responsible for the system themselves. There would also  be no barriers to setting up unemployment funds. The  Conservative plan calls for abolishing the tax on gross income  and replacing it with "earmarked insurance contributions" to  finance unemployment insurance expenses.    To create better conditions for private trade and industry  the proposals include eliminating the tax on capital, dropping  the CO[.sub]2[/] tax until European Union (EU) rules in this  area are established, making entertainment expenses fully  deductible, easing generational succession taxes, providing a  125-percent tax deduction for research and development costs,  granting tax exemptions to newly established firms for the first  three to five years, and eliminating the tax reform's increased  taxes on stock and property profits and goodwill.  <H5>  Liberals' Tax Breaks </H5>   The Liberal tax proposal, which is actually an attack on the  welfare state, according to the government, operates with the  possibility of lowering taxes by 5 billion kroner a year for 10  years, based on the assumption of zero growth in the public  sector. Liberal tax spokesman Peter Brixtofte is the main person  behind the tax initiative, which was presented by the Liberal  Party as a debate proposal.    The proposal lists 20 things that would improve the tax  system, improvements that according to Brixtofte can be started  as soon as the new government is formed. Brixtofte talks about  the "new liberal government" in his proposal. In point of fact  the Conservatives have not felt inspired to offer much comment  on the tax proposal. Brixtofte, on the other hand, has called  the Conservative economic proposal both "sensible and  constructive," noting that it could be unified with the Liberal  proposal and serve as part of the platform for the future  coalition government.</p>

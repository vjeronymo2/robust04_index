			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: PFEIFFER'S NEXT  </P> <P> After quite a career splash with "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (a Golden Globe for  best actress in a drama) and a starring role opposite Sean Connery in the film  adaptation of John le Carre's "The Russia House" wrapped for fall release,  Michelle Pfeiffer's about to hit the road in "Love Field."  </P> <P> Pfeiffer will play a frustrated young woman who heads for the 1963 funeral of  assassinated President John F. Kennedy -- hoping the historic event will  somehow change her mundane life.  </P> <P> En route to Washington, she has a chance encounter with a black man and the  young daughter he's snatched from an abusive stepfather. Turns out they'll  change the direction of her life.  </P> <P> Midge Sanford -- who'll produce with partner Sarah Pillsbury -- declined to  discuss the project with us ("It's too premature"). But she confirmed that  they'll be reteaming with director Jonathan Kaplan ("Immediate Family"), and  that the script marks the film debut of prolific TV series writer Don Roos.  Casting's under way, and shooting is set for April in North Carolina, Virginia  and D.C.  </P> <P> The title of the Orion project is also the name of the Dallas airfield where  J.F.K. arrived for his fateful 1963 visit.

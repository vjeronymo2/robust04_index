			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mehmet Ali Birand: "Turkey Must Reject the U.S. </F> Military Aid Package"]    [Text] It is impossible for anyone not to realize what lies  in the future for Ankara if they contact the members of the U.S.  Congressional committees concerned with matters related to  Turkey and their aides, who determine the way the committee  members should vote. The U.S. Congress has placed the Kurdish  problem on its agenda because of our exaggerated behavior and  the anti-Turkish lobby's influence. In fact, it seems reluctant  to exclude it from its agenda. Obviously, it intends to  intensify pressure on Turkey on this matter in the next few  years.    Unfortunately, the U.S. Congress is unable to separate the  Kurdish problem from the terrorist activities that are carried  out by the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. It regards the  matter as a whole and believes that the terrorist activities are  related to "the uprising of a miserable people who have been  oppressed for many years, in pursuit of their natural rights and  their cultural identity." The approach of the U.S. Congress to  the Kurds in Turkey is similar to its sympathetic approach to  the Kurds in northern Iraq because it is unable to see the  difference between the two peoples. That is why there is  confusion on the matter. Tomatoes and potatoes are being  confused. However, Turkey has suffered as a result of that  approach.    The atmosphere in the U.S. Congress is changing, so much so  that Turkey may in the future face several resolutions that will  completely suspend the military aid programs and ban the use of  U.S. arms in southeastern Turkey. These developments are  serious. Therefore, we must seriously assess the indications and  reconsider Turkey's basic policies.  <H5>  The Administration Shares Congress' Criticism... </H5>   One of Turkey's basic policies, which should be  reconsidered,  is related to the U.S. military aid program. It is common  knowledge that the U.S. House of Representatives linked 25  percent of the $453 million the Clinton Administration has  earmarked for Turkey to the Kurdish problem, the progress Turkey  achieves on human rights, and the reports the U.S. State  Department and the Pentagon will submit in that regard. That  means that Turkey will make progress on the Kurdish problem and  the question of human rights, and the U.S. Departments of State  and Defense will submit reports to Congress to confirm it. In  other words, the U.S. military aid program has been linked to  the Kurdish problem and the developments in southeastern Turkey.  Apparently a mechanism has been established that cannot be  stopped but which can be intensified and broadened very easily.  It is common knowledge that 25 percent of the aid program has  been suspended. Another half of that program may be suspended  in the near future. In fact, the whole program may be  completely suspended. No one should doubt that.    From 1974 to 1976 Congress linked its aid program to the  Cyprus problem. In fact, it went as far as to impose an arms  embargo on Turkey at that time. Nevertheless, the embargo was  lifted after a short time because the U.S. Administration  opposed it and supported Turkey's struggle to change Congress'  mind.    However, that situation is different now. On the contrary,  the Clinton Administration has encouraged the U.S. Congress. It  is true that it does not wish to have its aid package reduced.  However, it supports every statement that is made in the  Congress on the Kurdish problem and the question of human  rights. That includes the criticisms leveled against Turkey on  the two matters. The U.S. Administration and Congress have a  common approach in that regard... Meanwhile, the influence of  Congress on the Clinton Administration must also be taken into  consideration. That has made things even more difficult. The  Clinton Administration clearly fears the U.S. Congress on the  question of human rights. In fact, it is as if it has  surrendered to Congress. It seems impossible for the U.S.  Administration to wage a struggle against it on that matter.  <H5>  Military Aid Will be Completely Cut... </H5>   Congress has reduced the U.S. military aid program to Turkey  over the course of many years. In fact, the program will be  completely cut in a few years because it is deemed unnecessary  after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Furthermore, the  economic situation in the United States requires the  cancellation of that country's economic aid programs. That has  already been outlined by U.S. officials. This means that the  future of the military aid Turkey receives is not very bright.  A time will come when no country, including Turkey, will  receive military aid from the United States.    In view of all that, it is becoming more and more imperative  for Turkey to move to reject the conditional aid package at this  time.    1. Although the bill on the aid package has been approved by  the House of Representatives, it may be turned down by the U.S.  Senate. That is a strong possibility. Nevertheless, the link  has been established and the House of Representatives will  maintain it. Meanwhile, the Senate committees will debate the  Kurdish problem in detail in the next few weeks... The  rejection of the aid package by Turkey would remove one of the  important trump cards in the Congress... It would be regarded  as an important reaction.    2. It is understood that the aid package, which has been  reduced to $341 million, will be further reduced to $250  million. That will be the amount of the contribution the United  States will make toward the F-16 project in Turkey. It will be  in the form of a credit. However, Turkey can easily acquire an  equal loan from the international money markets with similar  conditions. That means that Turkey does not stand to suffer any  material loss if it rejects the reduced aid package.    3. It is unthinkable that the U.S. Administration may decide  to abandon the F-16 project. In view of that, it will  definitely try to redeem what it contributes to the project by  another way.    Turkey must reject the present form of the aid package if it  wishes to avoid a problem in its relations with the United  States (because each and every cut or condition creates  tension), obstruct further pressure in the future, and avoid  being pushed here and there by the U.S. Congress.  <H5>  That Will Not Suffice To Resolve the Problem... </H5>   Here is a factor we should keep in mind: Even if Turkey  decides to reject the military aid package, it will be unable to  rid itself of Congress if it fails to change its basic policies.  Rejecting the aid package would be a short-term reaction.  However, our general approach to the Kurdish problem and the  question of human rights is very important. Ankara will be  confronted with serious problems if the U.S. Congress moves to  take action against Turkey because of them.    We felt obliged to warn against such a state of affairs. It  is up to Turkey's leading officials to take the necessary  measures.</p>

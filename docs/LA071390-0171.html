			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> LONGTIME MAKEUP ARTIST RETIRES  </P> <P> Makeup artist Frances (Frannie) Arvold, who powdered the noses of TV  celebrities from Edward R. Murrow and Ed Sullivan to Walter Cronkite and Dan  Rather during 40 years at CBS, has retired.  </P> <P> The network announced Arvold's retirement Thursday.  </P> <P> Richard M. Nixon's refusal to let Arvold make him up during his 1960 debate  with John F. Kennedy -- the first televised presidential debate -- may have  cost him the election, some historians have said.  </P> <P> Nixon, looking haggard next to the youthful Kennedy, lost the debate in the  eyes of those who watched it on television but won it among those who listened  on radio, polls at the time showed.  </P> <P> "Don Hewitt, who directed the debates, told Nixon several years later that had  he only allowed Frannie to apply some pancake to his 5 o'clock shadow, she may  have changed the course of history," CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said.  </P></p>

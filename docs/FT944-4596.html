			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures had a roller-coaster session, sliding steeply during the morning but clawing back steadily towards the end of the day's trading, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract was at 3,022 at the close of pit trading, down 19 points. The premium to the cash market was eight points, or more than six points over fair value. Sentiment was weak at the close but it had been far blacker during the morning session when heavy selling pushed the December contract down to a low for the day of 2,988 in good volume, with some 9,000 contracts dealt by mid-morning. There was an eerie lull around midsession but by 2.30pm, when Wall Street came into the picture, buyers were beginning to emerge. Traders said the final hour of trading produced a significant squeeze, hoisting the December contract back above 3,000. In late screen-based trading the December contract moved up to 3,027. At the official close, volume totalled 15,800 lots - against 12,683 on Monday - but 2,500 of this was spread trading into the March contract. Traded option activity showed a clear bounce, rising to 43,188 lots from 30,168 on Monday. Puts outnumbered calls by more than two-to-one. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE lots totalled 30,500.</p>

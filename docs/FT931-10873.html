			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Nuclear threat posed by dispute over the status of Kashmir Sir, In your editorial, 'Kashmir's plight' (January 25), you note that 'the misery of Kashmir has tended to be forgotten amid the upsurge of disputes elsewhere. It should not be.' This is absolutely correct. The crisis in Kashmir has claimed many lives. As in Bosnia and Somalia, the majority of the victims of the Kashmir crisis are civilians, particularly women and children. These non-combatants have been targeted by military forces and suffer from chronic shortages of food and medicine. But in Kashmir there is an added dimension to the crisis. This is that both India and Pakistan, which as you say have fought two wars over Kashmir and remain at loggerheads, are now believed to possess nuclear arsenals. As tensions rise again today, the continued hostilities between them pose a nuclear threat to the Indo-Pakistani region, and to the world. The Bush administration had no policy for Kashmir. Its efforts to encourage nuclear non-proliferation were therefore doomed to failure since reducing the threat of a nuclear exchange in south Asia is inexorably linked to resolving the status of Kashmir. How can one talk of disarming India and Pakistan when the cause of their tensions, the usettled status of Kashmir, was not up for discussion? Reducing the threat of a nuclear exchange in south Asia is inexorably linked to resolving the status of Kashmir. Prime Minister John Major is to be congratulated for recognising this fact, and for seeking to bring about negotiations with Britain as the mediator. He should not be deterred by India's recent rebuff, and should also encourage the new Clinton administration to make Kashmir a priority. Time is not on our side. Every day more and more atrocities are being committed by Indian security forces. Humanitarian considerations for action in Kashmir are tremendous. But the geo-strategic considerations are even more compelling. Kashmir's strategic location makes it a 'nuclear trip-wire' for south Asia - a trip-wire more unstable than the threat posed by the nuclear arsenal in the Commonwealth of Independent States.

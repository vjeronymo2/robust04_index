Chen Jian stated: With the changing of the international  situation and the continuous expansion of UN membership, growing  calls have been heard from the vast number of UN members, and  from developing countries in particular, for enlarging the  Security Council, an important UN body. China favors the  expansion of the Security Council at the appropriate time. He  pointed out: Expansion of the Security Council should be done  under the guidance of the UN Charter and in a manner which  provides full consideration to the principle of equitable  distribution so the Security Council will be more  representative, more efficient, and more capable of dealing with  major international issues in a positive, balanced, equitable,  and efficient manner.    He added: Expansion of the Security Council involves the  interests of all quarters. Balancing these diverse interests is  a very complicated issue. Therefore, we should consider this  issue from all sides, especially taking into account the fact  that the developing nations make up a majority of the UN  membership, so as to strike a balance between developed and  developing nations as well as between various regions.  Moreover, it is also important for the regions to reach a  consensus.    Chen Jian also said: It is necessary to give full play to  democracy by extensively enlisting the views of the member  nations, medium and small nations in particular; by conducting  comprehensive, in-depth, and full consultations; and by finding  a rational formula acceptable to all through negotiation and  consensus-building.</p>

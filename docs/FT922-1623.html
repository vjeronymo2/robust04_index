			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (16): A pension for every citizen - The hottest political issue IF you mention the words pension reform to a French financier, the response is almost certain to be one of unalloyed glee. Say the same words to Tresor officials and they are likely to reply with a sigh. The apparently arcane subject of pensions is one of the hottest topics in French politics. The extreme left apart, everyone seems to agree that the existing system must be reformed. The problem is that noone seems to know how to reform it. The present pension system is a product of post-war France. Almost all pensions are provided by the state, with the exception of the tiny number of senior executives who belong to fonds salariaux company pension schemes. The system is administered by the Caisse de Retraite, a government body that acts as a cash manager by paying for pensions with money received from those in employment. This system worked well in the 1950s and 1960s, when France had a young workforce and proportionally fewer pensioners. But in the 1980s, as the population aged and the number of young employees diminished, the system has come under pressure. This problem will worsen in the future as these demographic trends accelerate until the 'crunch year' of 2020 when there will be more people of pensionable age than there will be working to pay for their pensions. Private pensions look like the solution. Earlier this year Mr Pierre Beregovoy, then finance minister and now prime minister, confirmed that the government was committed to expanding private pensions to relieve the strains on the state system. He has since sanctioned a series of small reforms notably the announcement in March of plans for a new tax-efficient personal equity plan. Mr Beregovoy is believed to favour more ambitious changes including the eventual introduction of corporate pension funds. So far he has been thwarted by the opposition of the trade unions - which maintain that pensions should be the state's responsibility - and by the sheer complexity of reform. One of the trickiest problems for the Tresor is persuading the electorate that they should shell out extra money for their own private pensions at the same time as they continue to pay for today's pensioners. Mr Beregovoy has not yet found a solution. The consensus is that he will wait until after next year's National Assembly elections when he - or his successor - will feel more confident about tackling the trade unions and about tabling potentially unpopular legislation. The French financial community can hardly wait. After all, the new breed of private pension funds will not only provide a lucrative new market for France's banking, broking and insurance industries but also a sorely needed source of investment for the stock market. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and one of France's most powerful financiers, summed it up with: 'Pension reform is quite simply the single most important issue on our agenda'.</p>

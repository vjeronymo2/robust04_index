			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 27 May (PL) -- A spectacular judicial  process could begin today against the U.S. State Department if a  suit filed to stop the U.S. Government from again denying visas  to Cuban artists and intellectuals goes through.    The suit was filed in November 1993 at the Federal Court in  San Francisco, California, by the organization Encounter of the  Popular Song [Encuentro del Canto Popular] in response to the  government's refusal to grant visas to three members of the  Cuban musical group Mezcla.    According to Bill Martinez, a lawyer and director of the  organization Latin Action [Accion Latina] that sponsors these  annual song festivals in San Francisco, the judicial process  could establish a favorable precedent that will keep President  William Clinton's government from denying visas to Cuban artists  and intellectuals.    However, this will all depend on whether the judge today  accepts as valid the viewpoint presented by the State Department  that has asked for the annulment of the process. "Then, all  will be finished," Jim Mayock, a member of Encounter of the  Popular Song, said.    "Anyway, we do not know how he (the judge) will react. We  know that this will be difficult because President Clinton  handles, at his discretion, the matter of visas for Cubans,"  Mayock added.    The Mezcla group musicians had received the approval of the  U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for their visas, but  at the last minute, the State Department overruled the approval,  basing its refusal on Presidential Resolution No. 5377.    "This is an arbitrary and inconsistent way of acting... The  State Department abusively interprets the resolution that was  implemented in 1985 and which restricts the approval of visas  for Cubans," Martinez said.    The presidential resolution was signed during a period of  one  of the worst state of relations between Washington and Havana,  when former President Ronald Reagan declared that all Cubans are  government officials and as such were not eligible for visas to  enter the United States.    In March 1994, President Clinton's government denied visas  to  two Cuban ballet dancers who had been invited to the Oscar  presentation in Hollywood.    Cuban intellectuals and clergymen invited by Yale  University,  as well as Daniel Diaz Torres, a Cuban actor, were also denied  visas to enter the United States recently.</p>

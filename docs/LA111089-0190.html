Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 5 TONS OF COCAINE FOUND IN N.Y.  </P> <P> Federal agents and police today finished digging more than 5 tons of cocaine  with a street value of about $851 million from barrels of caustic lye and  planned to burn the lot.  </P> <P> Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Mark Hannan said the massive stash of  cocaine weighed 10,648 pounds and was the largest seizure in New York history  and the third largest in the United States.  </P> <P> The cocaine was found a week ago when Customs and DEA agents armed with search  warrants raided a warehouse in Queens. Agents found 2.2-pound bricks of cocaine  wrapped in plastic and packed into hundreds of 10-gallon barrels, each topped  off with caustic lye.  </P> <P> Authorities said that the barrels had been shipped from Latin America by Arenal  Inc. and that federal agents were looking for five suspects they believe are  linked to the Cali cartel in Colombia.  </P></p>

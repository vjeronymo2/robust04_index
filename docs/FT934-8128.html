			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (10): Damage limitation in a death zone - Bronwen Maddox reports from Chernobyl on the awesome results of the world's worst nuclear accident GHOST towns are scattered across the fields and marshes around the Chernobyl nuclear power station, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident. A wire fence, 10 kilometres in radius, stops anyone but the plant's operators and a few scientists and visitors from entering this silent, poisoned zone. The explosion at Chernobyl in April 1986 is the shadow that hangs over the world's nuclear industry. It left thousands of acres of farmland in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia contaminated beyond recovery, and thousands of people exposed to radiation - the consequences for their health are still unknown. Yet last month the Ukrainian government reversed its earlier decision to close down the remaining three reactors at Chernobyl by the end of the year because of the cost of buying oil and gas from Russia. Instead, work is underway to repair the second of the three reactors, which has been out of operation for two years following a fire. That decision illustrates the problem facing a handful of the world's poorer countries: they have few alternatives to nuclear power, but lack the cash, technicians and management to run them safely. It presents richer countries with a challenge of how best to deploy assistance and funds to solve what is clearly an international threat: radioactive dust from Chernobyl reached much of western Europe. The public hostility to nuclear power provoked by Chernobyl also raised the question of how high richer countries' nuclear standards should be. Safety measures in Western Europe, Japan and North America - pushed steadily higher by powerful 'green' pressure groups and public opinion - are responsible for a large proportion of the costs of nuclear power, though one that is hard to quantify. Recent Western efforts to improve the safety of the 58 Soviet-designed reactors in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have focused on the 25 worst. In particular, they have targeted Kozloduy in Bulgaria and Ignalina in Lithuania. Two years ago, Kozloduy was condemned as the world's most dangerous nuclear plant by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog, which found that it lacked even the emergency cooling system standard in western reactors. Since then, Western European nuclear experts have been training the operators and ordering pipes and valves to be strengthened, as part of a programme run by the World Association of Nuclear Operators, an organisation set up three years after Chernobyl to promote high standards of nuclear management. In June this year, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development also approved a 24m Ecu grant to improve fire protection, cooling systems and valves. At Ignalina, an IAEA report in February cited a long list of safety concerns including inadequate systems to relieve steam pressure. Efforts to upgrade the plant are being led by Sweden, the first country outside Ukraine to detect the Chernobyl explosion, and just across the Baltic Sea from Ignalina. So far, the Swedish government has paid SKr70m (Pounds 5.7m), with another SKr53.2m due next year to upgrade equipment and improve management. But funds have so far fallen short of the problem: estimates have put the cost of thorough improvements at between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn. Moreover, progress has been handicapped by western companies' concerns about sharing in liability for the plants. Some have told the IAEA that they are worried that if there are accidents at the plants, they could be held to blame because their name is on some of the equipment. Awareness of the urgent problems at the eastern reactors has also heightened public pressures in richer countries for close scrutiny of nuclear standards. Mr Simon Roberts, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, has attacked western governments for paying too little to improve the 'rickety reactors' of eastern Europe or for developing alternatives to nuclear power at home. The UK's Health and Safety Executive, which licenses nuclear installations, in a detailed and thoughtful report last year, pointed out that assessing the risk of disaster in nuclear plants is extremely difficult, as it consists of the judging the probabilities of failure in many interconnected pieces of equipment. Some of the factors, such as human error, which was responsible for the accidents at Chernobyl and at Three Mile Island in the US, are 'of their nature very hard to estimate,' it comments. It observes, too, that people will tolerate much higher levels of risk in events they can control, such as riding motorcycles, than they will in others such as nuclear power or water quality. They have a particular fear of radiation, frequently out of proportion to the risks of exposure: many seem to rate death by radiation as worse than a death in a traffic accident, the HSE comments. Its conclusion is that safety standards in any future nuclear plants - although the government has not yet decided whether to lift a moratorium on building new plants - should be set so that the risk to the public is at least 10 times less than that of a traffic accident. This is a much higher standard that that for non-nuclear plants, it points out. The result of these pressures is an uncomfortable future for nuclear operators in richer countries. They face pressure at home for tighter and more expensive safety standards at a point when many governments are scrutinising the economics of nuclear power closely. But they know, too, that much of the world's nuclear industry is run on much lower standards, a problem which international organisations have not yet successfully addressed. The risk they face, which they cannot control, is that another Chernobyl will irrevocably turn public opinion against nuclear power. It is in the nuclear industry's interest that the eastern problems are tackled soon.</p>

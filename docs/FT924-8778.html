			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Chevron to axe 1,000 jobs at head office CHEVRON, the fourth biggest US oil and gas group, yesterday unveiled plans to cut annual corporate headquarters operating costs by Dollars 200m, or 30 per cent, as a result of reductions in staff. The San Francisco-based company said that the decision - which is part of a broader programme to reduce total group expenses - was taken following a six-month long study. The changes will result in a net reduction of about 1,000 positions, or 28 per cent, from the level of headquarters staff at the beginning of this year. Since about 550 corporate staff employees have already opted for early retirement, the net number of jobs being cut will be about 450. The job cuts will occur in more than a dozen departments, including tax, treasury, legal and human resources. The oil and gas group also announced a separate measure to reduce costs by restructuring its in-house technology company. This move is expected to save Dollars 35m to Dollars 45m a year and will result in the reduction of another 500 jobs, or 22 per cent of the total. Mr Kenneth Derr, Chevron's chairman, said that he regretted 'that these changes will leave some employees without jobs'. He said that the cuts reflected the business environment. Chevron's third-quarter net earnings, announced last month, were 21 per cent higher at Dollars 378m.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: D-Mark tends to lose ground THE D-Mark yesterday lost ground against most of the other important European currencies, writes Peter Marsh. It gained slightly against the dollar as investors weighed up the implications of the continuing weakness in the German economy. In spite of signs that Germany is some way from returning to growth, the Bundesbank council at its meeting today is thought unlikely to opt for a further reduction in its Lombard and discount interest rates. The council announced a  1/2 percentage point cut in both these rates two weeks ago. A reduction of one basis point yesterday in the German central bank's 13-day repo rate to 6.39 per cent was dismissed by many market analysts as largely technical. On a quiet day's trading, a talking point among European traders was action by Denmark in cutting its discount and key deposit rates to 7 per cent from 7.25 per cent. The move failed to lead to any notic-eable sell-off in the Danish krone. It strengthened moderately against the D-Mark to DKr3.9895 last night from Tuesday's DKr3.9990 close. The German currency slipped against the French franc to FFr3.484 from FFr3.490 previously, while against the Belgian franc it receded to BFr21.39 from BFr21.55. It also fell against the lira to L965.3 from L967.4. But the D-Mark's exchange rate against the Spanish peseta was up to Pta80.10 from Pta79.98. People looking for the German currency to return to unmitigated strength gained some consolation from its performance against the dollar. Last night the D-Mark was quoted at DM1.6930 to the US currency, up from DM1.6945 on Tuesday. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6890. Investor preference for the German currency as compared with the dollar was largely because of ideas that the Bundesbank is unlikely to cut its key interest rates for at least another month. Also, some investors are concerned that tomorrow's US employment figures may indicate a weak-ening in US growth. The pound declined  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.5075. This followed from a new spurt of bullishness in financial markets about the prospect for a cut in UK base rates around the end of this month when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, presents his first Budget. Against the dollar the pound slipped to Dollars 1.4805 from Tuesday's Dollars 1.4825. Reports from the Bank of England and the Treasury appeared to indicate that the UK authorities are relatively optimistic about inflation in the long term. This could leave the way clear for an early cut in interest rates. The Greek central bank's reserves rose to Dollars 7bn last month from Dollars 5bn in October 1992, the Bank of Greece said. Reserves in September were about Dollars 6.2bn. The bank has built up reserves recently after fears of a drachma devaluation abated.</p>

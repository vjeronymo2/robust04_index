			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOP PANEL SIDESTEPS DEBATE ON PARTY'S STAND ON ABORTION  </P> <P> The Republican Party's internal debate over abortion boiled into the open  Thursday, with a party committee refusing to consider a resolution affirming  the GOP's anti-abortion stance.  </P> <P> The action came on the opening day of the Republican National Committee's  winter meeting, a session dominated by public and private discussions about  whether the party should moderate its official stand on abortion as the 1990  elections approach.  </P> <P> The session also included a complaint from the leader of a black GOP group, who  said that despite minority outreach commitments from party chief Lee Atwater  some state chapters "overlook" blacks.  </P> <P> Fred Brown, head of the National Black Republican Committee, also said that  while he has been unable to organize a presidential dinner as an organization  fund-raiser, Jesse Jackson and other prominent black Democrats "constantly meet  with the President."  </P> <P> But abortion overshadowed other topics as the committee convened in a hotel  blocks from the White House.  </P> <P> One committee member, Idaho state GOP Chairman Randy Ayre, sought to offer a  resolution endorsing the party's 1988 platform recognition of the "sanctity of  life."  </P> <P> Ayre was told that his request would not be considered because he had not  submitted a formal resolution in advance of the gathering and that the issue  might be discussed at the next committee meeting in June.  </P> <P> Ayre said after the session that he personally opposes abortion and believes  the party should too, but that the GOP should not use a candidate's position on  abortion as a litmus test for party support.  </P> <P> Atwater and other prominent Republicans -- including President Bush and Vice  President Dan Quayle -- have sought in recent months to portray the GOP as an  umbrella organization that welcomes candidates with varying views on abortion.  And, mindful of the role abortion played in several major elections won by  Democrats last year, Atwater has been urging Republican candidates to state  their position on the issue early and firmly in an attempt to diminish  abortion's campaign role.  </P></p>

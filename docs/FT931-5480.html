			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Merrett drops to Pounds 0.84m and omits dividend Merrett Holdings, one of the largest agencies at the Lloyd's insurance market, yesterday reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.21m to Pounds 839,000 for the 12 months to September 30 1992. Earnings per share were steeply down at 2.76p (10.25p) and the group has omitted its dividend. Profit commission fell to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 3.16m). The result was also adversely affected by a payment of Pounds 700,000 in connection with settlement of a lawsuit brought by Names on the Outhwaite syndicate. The money represented the balance of the deductible on the group's errors and omissions' insurance policy. Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman, said the groups underwriting results had held up well amid difficult trading conditions at Lloyd's, but noted a hefty fall in syndicate capacity for 1993.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: General Motors to take Dollars 950m charge GENERAL Motors is to take a Dollars 950m pre-tax charge against third-quarter earnings to cover additional costs from its programme to close 21 redundant manufacturing plants in North America. The news came shortly after GM reached a new three-year labour agreement with the United Auto Workers union which will sharply push up the company's pension costs, while allowing it more freedom to relocate laid-off workers to new plants. The company, which is to report third-quarter figures tomorrow, said the charge resulted mainly from greater productivity gains than had been expected when it first made a provision for the plant closing programme. This meant fewer jobs would be available within the group for workers from plants that GM was closing, which in turn would push up its job security costs. Under a long-standing job security programme, GM continues paying its workers even after they have been laid off. However, the company said that even with the charge it believed it could attain its 1993 financial goal for its North American automotive operations  -to break even before interest, taxes and non-cash healthcare expenses. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit information agency, said it had revised its rating outlook for GM to negative from stable because of the new labour pact. It said the reported provisions of the agreement would not bolster the company's cost-cutting efforts in North America, as had been anticipated. GM's market share performance had been disappointing in recent quarters, S&amp;P said. These factors heightened uncertainty about the company's ability to achieve meaningful profits in North America, it added. GM has ended a 28-month search for a strategic partner for its locomotive group. It said that it could not find potential partners able to offer the kind of investment needed to enhance the unit, Reuter adds. The locomotive group, which includes the electro-motive and diesel divisions, is based in Ontario, Canada, and manufactures locomotives and defence-related products. GM first announced that it was looking for a partner for the unit in June 1991.</p>

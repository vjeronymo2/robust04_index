			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "It Turns Out that Admirals Can </F> Sink, Too. Underwater Currents in the Pacific..."]    [Text] Despite strict official explanations, many officers  at the Defense Ministry and the General Staff are more and more  often comparing the explosions of the Pacific Fleet arsenals  with those that rocked the North Caucasus during the withdrawal  of the Russian Army from the area. One is getting the  impression that the Defense Ministry is "disarming" itself in  this unconventional fashion by destroying excess reserves  without taking any unnecessary trouble. Suggestions that Admiral  Gurinov, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, may have been  fired for reasons other than the latest explosion also incline  one toward this theory.    The situation at the Northern Fleet, say, is hardly any  better, if not much worse. While an arsenal blew up at the  Pacific Fleet, the Northern Fleet saw a much more serious  incident: nuclear materials were stolen twice within a month  there. But the fleet commander has emerged from the incidents  unscathed.    Once he arrived in the fleet following the tragedy on the  Russkiy island last year, Admiral Gurinov launched a flurry of  activity, trying to create some semblance of a Navy out of the  Pacific Fleet, or rather out of its remnants. But the inertia  of disintegration had gone so far that the energetic admiral was  scarcely able to accomplish anything within so short a period.  Meanwhile, Grachev waited for reports of drastic change. But  no rosy reports were forthcoming. Gurinov reported to Moscow  that the situation was extremely unfavorable in virtually all  areas. Moreover, on that same Russkiy island several more  tragic incidents occurred, also because of paralysis; it was  ordered to keep them strictly secret. The fleet continued to  degenerate. Furthermore, the new commander appeared to have  decided to put an end to lavish receptions for ministerial  commissions, a move that added fuel to the fire.    But according to an old tradition of top authorities in  Russia it was "something personal" that appears was the last  straw. A Japanese company undertook to mediate the sale of the  Pacific Fleet's 12 decommissioned diesel submarines to North  Korea. Somehow the State Property Committee also stuck to the  deal drawing on support from a very high-ranking official at the  Defense Ministry. Once the first two submarines were sent to  North Korea for dismantling, a universal outcry was raised that  the North Koreans could use the submarines as combat ships  (after repairs and the installation of weapons). Journalists  demanded explanations from the Pacific Fleet command.    Then the angered admiral Gurinov took a step unheard of in  the Armed Forces. In his interview for a major news agency he  said that the deal was for some reason sponsored by the State  Property Committee and was struck at the consent of the defense  minister, who did not even think it necessary to advise the  Pacific Fleet commander of what percentage of the deal the fleet  would get. A number of informed sources at the Defense Ministry  started openly saying that Gurinov's career after that could be  considered finished.    At a meeting of the Defense Ministry collegium in early May,  where the level of combat training of the Army and the Navy in  the first six months of this year was assessed, Grachev, as the  saying goes, razed the Pacific Fleet to the ground.    Naval commanders are becoming increasingly petty. These are  not Ushakov, Nakhimov, or Kornilov. This time, Russia has lost  yet another "unlucky" admiral. To all appearances, he fell  victim to intrigues at the ministerial palace, not battles for  improving the fleet's combat readiness.</p>

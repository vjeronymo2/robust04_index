			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH TO MEET IN PHOENIX DESPITE KING DAY DEFEAT  </P> <P> The Episcopal Church will hold its 1991 General Convention in Phoenix despite  the defeat on Election Day of a referendum designating Martin Luther King Day  as a state holiday.  </P> <P> Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning, who traveled to Phoenix last spring to lobby  for the holiday, expressed disappointment at the measure's narrow defeat.  </P> <P> Some Episcopal church leaders urged a move after the Nov. 6 vote.  </P> <P> But Browning said this week that a meeting in Phoenix could serve as an  occasion for Episcopalians to demonstrate their faith. "The fight has been a  bruising one and they need our support," said Browning, referring to "people of  good faith in Arizona who are working and fighting to overcome prejudice."  </P> <P> The triennial convention of the Episcopal Church, which draws about 10,000  delegates and visitors, will be held July 11-20.  </P> <P> A smaller denomination, the homosexual-oriented Universal Fellowship of  Metropolitan Community Churches, is having attorneys look into whether it can  get out of a hotel contract in Phoenix for its convention July 14-21. Nearly  3,000 delegates and visitors are expected to attend its biennial meeting.  </P> <P> "I imagine we will have to honor our contract," said Troy Perry,  founder-moderator of the Hollywood-based denomination. "But I know we will  cancel the option we had with the hotel to meet in Phoenix two years later."  </P> <P> Perry said the Metropolitan Community Churches selected Phoenix as a national  convention site without being aware that the Episcopal Church, which faces a  convention debate on homosexuality issues, will be in the city at the same  time.  </P> <P> "That was probably the move of the Holy Spirit," Perry said.  </P></p>

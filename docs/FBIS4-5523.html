			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Guideline for Development of Chuche-Based Health Service" </F> -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  dedicates an article to the 20th anniversary of the publication  of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's famous work "On  Further Developing Health Care for the People" (April 9, 1974).    The author of the article says:    The work is a highly important guideline which opened a  bright road of developing health service to a new, higher stage  as required by the modelling of the whole society on the chuche  idea.    The work says socialist medicine is preventive medicine, the  basic mission of which is to prevent diseases and protect and  promote the health of the people.    On the basis of a scientific exposition of the essence,  character and basic mission of socialist medicine, the work  calls for correctly implementing the party's policy of  preventive medicine through energetic hygiene propaganda,  hygiene culture, prevention of pollution and anti-epidemic work.    The work gives answers to all questions arising in the  development of health care, including the enhancement of the  standard of medical (?assistance), development of chuche-based  medical science and technique and improvement of the quality of  medical education.    The work has served as a powerful weapon in exalting the  health care system of Korean-style socialism centred on the  masses because it gives answers to theoretical and practical  questions in the improvement of socialist health service and  helps further develop health service as required by our  revolution and the reality of health care.    A phenomenal progress has been made in health service and  its  material and technical foundation has been consolidated through  the efforts to implement the tasks set out in the work over the  last 20 years.    Today the number of doctors in Korea is 29.7 per 10,000  people and that of hospital beds is 136. This is the highest  level in the world. 18.4 times of medical service is given to  each head of the population in a year. Life expectancy at birth  is 74.5 years.</p>

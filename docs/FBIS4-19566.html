			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kh. Kharalambidhis] </F>   [Text] Since Sunday night [17 April], the Republic's  security authorities have been dealing with a case of spying  against the National Guard by a British colonel and an American  first lieutenant. Due to the involvement of foreign military  personnel serving in Cyprus, this case is considered one of the  most serious against Cyprus' defense and domestic security that  has been discovered since the Turkish invasion.    According to verified information obtained by I SIMERINI,  National Guard personnel were on a mission in the area of  Larnaca airport Sunday night, based on a plan drawn up in  advance. As soon as the National Guardsmen began their mission  at 1940 hours, they saw a car approach and stop in the area.  The car's presence in that area was unjustified and suspicious,  and for that reason the National Guardsmen informed Larnaca  police. Before a police patrol car arrived in the area, another  car approached at precisely 2000 and stopped next to the first  car. One person left the first car and entered the second car.    In about 15 minutes, the police patrol arrived at the point  where the two suspect cars were stopped, but before the patrol  car stopped, the two persons who were observing the National  Guardsmen's moves with night binoculars from the first car sped  from the area, leaving the second car behind. The abandoned car  had been rented, whereas the car that left had diplomatic  plates. The police patrol chased the first car but only for a  short time. Then, the police patrol returned to the area and  parked in a concealed place. At 2215, exactly two hours after  they left, the two suspects returned to the scene of the crime  [as published] in the car they had escaped in. As soon as they  approached the abandoned car, they came out of the diplomatic  car and at that time a police call was heard: "Do not move, put  up your hands." Both were surprised. The policemen approached  and began interrogating them. The man driving the diplomatic  car told police he was a U.S. first lieutenant, a member of the  U.S. Embassy staff, and had gone there to pick up his friend.  Police made note of his identity and let him go.    The other man was arrested and taken to the Larnaca police  station, where it was confirmed that he is a colonel serving at  the British base in Episkopi. The police have not announced  anything regarding the incident, nor did they allow anything to  leak out, mainly for political reasons. The focus of the police  and National Guard investigation is in the following three  directions:    First: Whether the British colonel and the U.S. first  lieutenant were spying on the National Guard on behalf of their  embassies.    Second: Whether the two foreign officers were acting on  behalf of Turkey, without the knowledge of their embassies.    Third: How did two officers, a Briton and an American, know  that at that specific time and place officers and men of the  National Guard would be on a planned mission?</p>

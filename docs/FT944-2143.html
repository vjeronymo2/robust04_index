			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Chiltern consolidates recovery Following a modest return to the black at the interim stage, Chiltern Radio yesterday announced a resumption of dividends as it consolidated the recovery over the full year to September 30. On turnover ahead 8 per cent to Pounds 6.21m, the pre-tax line showed a turnround of Pounds 760,000 to profits of Pounds 514,000. The outcome took in net costs of Pounds 53,000 related to the unsuccessful bid from CLT, the Luxembourg-based multimedia group, which was more than offset by a gain of Pounds 72,000 from the disposal of its stakes in Independent Radio News and Gloucester Broadcasting. The group now operates 11 radio stations, all but one having the full 8-year licence period outstanding. Mr Peter Burton, chairman, said that national advertising revenue was up 20 per cent year-on-year but local revenue sources remained relatively flat. Earnings were 5.4p against losses of 3.4p; dividends are restored at 1p.</p>

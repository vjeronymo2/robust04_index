			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> VOTE PAVES WAY FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The Camarillo City Council approved creation of a tax district and sale of up  to $31 million in bonds to pay for road and sewer improvements, taking a step  toward major development on vacant land in the west end of the Ventura County  city. The council voted 4 to 0 to form the district near Camarillo Airport,  clearing the way for developments that city officials have already approved on  about 600 acres. It was Camarillo's largest planned borrowing for improvements  since 1987, when the entire city treasury of $25 million was lost in high-risk  trading ventures.  </P></p>

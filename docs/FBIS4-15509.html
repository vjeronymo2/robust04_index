			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valentin Zhdanko under the "Diplomacy" rubric: </F> "Belorussia's Foreign Ministry Asks UN Secretary General for  Support. Minsk Worried at Position of Ethnic Minority in Latvia  and Estonia"]    [Text] Before UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's visit,  which ended 7 April, Belarus authorities preferred to solve  bilaterally the problems of ethnic Belarusians finding  themselves outside their own country, and scored certain  successes in that.    For example, agreements with Lithuania, where the Belarusian  community is especially large, are already working: national  schools have been opened in Vilnius and in a Belarusian village  there. The Belarusian language is now heard on Lithuanian  radio, and a Belarusian newspaper appears in Lithuania's  capital. The interests of Lithuanians who live in Belarus are  being served in a similar way.    The problems of Belarusians in Latvia, and especially in  Estonia, have a somewhat different nature. The matter is that  the Slavic population along Lithuania's southeastern border has  been there for centuries and has preserved its culture and  language. Lithuanian Belarusians had no problem acquiring  citizenship. Latvia and Estonia are a different matter. There,  Belarusians encounter the same difficulties as do all  non-Latvians and non-Estonians.    Until recently, the Belarus side had been trying to resolve  the arising difficulties through bilateral talks, in particular  during the recent visit to Minsk by Latvian Prime Minister  Birkans. All the more unexpected was the news heard from  Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko that, during his discussions  with Mr. Butrus-Ghali, considerable attention was devoted to the  topic of the Belarusian ethnic minority in Baltic countries.  The UN leader promised cooperation in solving this problem and  voiced the intention to send, at Belarus' request, a special UN  human rights mission to the Baltic countries.    Local observers think in this connection that such an  initiative of Minsk officials is the result of private  "consultations" held by Belarus diplomats with their Russian  counterparts.</p>

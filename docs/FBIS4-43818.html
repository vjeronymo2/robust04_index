			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patrick de Saint-Exupery: "Rwanda: Complicated </F> and Hazardous `Humanitarian' Intervention"]    [Excerpts] The "duty of intervention" in Rwanda advocated  by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Wednesday [15 June] is a  matter fraught with questions. Deploying 1,000-2,000 soldiers is  proving an extremely complicated issue and above all, a  "hazardous" one, according to Alain Juppe. Nevertheless,  President Francois Mitterrand insisted on French determination  this weekend, even if it means that Paris has to act alone, he  argued. The genocide that has been going on in Rwanda is no  longer "tolerable." The following is a compendium of questions  raised by the notion of such an intervention. [passage omitted]  <H5>  How Can This Intervention Be Carried Out? </H5>   Several potential scenarios have been identified. It appears  that the most likely one would entail establishing a rear base  on the Zairian-Rwandan border. Initially 800 French soldiers  would be stationed there. From this base, they would enter  Rwanda, focusing exclusively on the regions held by government  forces and militias. Their mission would be to protect dozens of  areas containing Tutsi refugees "threatened by extermination" by  militias and government forces. The whole operation would  gradually unfold until French soldiers succeeded in protecting  several such areas and saving thousands of people who may  otherwise be killed at any moment.    This scenario is dependent on President Mobutu's consent.  Zaire's head of state has given no formal answer yet. However,  Zairian diplomatic sources indicate a concern to "stop the  slaughter."  <H5>  What Means Will Be Made Available to French Soldiers? </H5>   They will be significant, and the operation will be quite a  large one. The Americans, Belgians, and Italians are reportedly  ready to provide logistical support. As for the French  Government, it is willing to go quite far: 1,000 professional  soldiers would be deployed initially, including 600 belonging to  the ground forces and 400 men performing support tasks  (logistical, air control, helicopter crews, etc.). A second  wave comprising another 1,000 men would stand by, ready to act  within 24 hours.    Only professional soldiers will take part in the operation.  Most elite units (paratroopers, the Foreign Legion, and marine  troops) will be called upon.    The first troops will be taken from permanent bases in  Africa  (Central African Republic, Gabon, Ivory Coast, and Djibouti).  Bangui would be used as an "operational platform."  <H5>  When Would All This Happen? </H5>   Shortly. President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur, Alain Juppe, [Rally for the Republic President]  Jacques Chirac, and several political leaders have all agreed on  the "urgency" of the situation. The first units will probably  be deployed as soon as the United Nations has approved a  resolution authorizing French soldiers to act under Chapter 7  ("possible use of force"). According to the Quai d'Orsay [French  Foreign Ministry], it is "almost certain" that such a resolution  will be passed. China, which is generally adamant about the  principle of noninterference in a state's internal affairs, has  reportedly agreed to abstain, considering there is "genocide"  taking place.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Uwe Jean Heuser: "Trade Liberates"] </F>   [Text] All those critics who accuse Bill Clinton of  pursuing a wishy-washy policy have been set right by the U.S.  President. He linked the decision to continue to grant China  most-favored-nation [MFN] status to an unambiguous message:  Henceforth, the most powerful man in the world will no longer  make favorable trade conditions dependent on human rights. This  change of position is based on opportunism to a large degree;  nevertheless it is reasonable.    After all, the President has to put up accusations that he  has broken his word. The Chinese rulers do not take human  rights more seriously now than they did a year ago, although  this is exactly what Clinton had demanded as a condition for  continued free trade. Now, the White House has clarified the  issue once and for all. It was the only possibility for Clinton  to avoid having to deal with the tiresome Chinese problem year  after year.    The decision is the result of practical interests. To gain  the support of the U.S. public, which is sensitive as far as  human rights questions are concerned, Clinton was unusually  explicit about the advantages. U.S. exporters now cannot only  expand their position at the largest regional future market, but  even consumers at home will continue to benefit form inexpensive  Chinese goods. Moreover, the Americans need China to keep North  Korea in check.    After all, from the other industrialized nations no support  for sanctions was to be expected -- officials in Bonn, Paris,  and Tokyo would have secretly even been happy about the  weakening of the U.S. competitors. One example: At the moment,  Daimler-Benz and Chrysler are vying for a license to construct  minivans in China; Clinton's tough position would have  threatened the chances of the car manufacturers from Detroit.  Uncle Sam is no longer strong enough to be able to simply  ignore -- as sometimes during the Cold War -- that his partners  were shamelessly taking advantage of such opportunities instead  of backing the U.S. course. Finally, Clinton also had to  consider the suspicion of other Asian countries that have  accused Washington of cultural imperialism. Recently Britain  experienced how sensitive dealings with the new economic powers  in the Far East have meanwhile become: As a result of  corruption accusations in the English press, Malaysia excluded  British enterprises from public orders -- a short time ago  Britain's trade minister left for Kuala Lumpur with an offer for  reconciliation.    So much for plain pragmatism, but Clinton's step was correct  even under more principled criteria. Trade not only increases  prosperity, it also exerts a pressure for liberalization --  particularly in view of the rising internationalization of the  economy. Although this thesis is regarded as vague by many, and  as hope based on an ideology that is geared toward the economy,  in most cases it is, after all, true: Once the material basic  needs are fulfilled, and it is possible to achieve modest  prosperity, the people will press for political freedom. In the  long run, economic progress will undermine the foundations of  dictatorial rule.    This is why, without being cynical, one can follow the  motto:  "If in doubt, opt for free trade." Yet, those who support this  position must also think of the consequences. Although China is  not the only country in Asia that infringes systematically on  human rights, the faults of the regime in Beijing are certainly  grave; and nothing is likely to change in the short term,  either. Therefore, it has nothing to do with cultural  imperialism when the West criticizes oppression in Tibet and the  arrest of dissidents. Clinton saw himself even forced to admit  that one could not even prevent the import of goods produced by  forced labor.    Yet, the United States' decision and the attitude of the  other industrialized nations also illustrate the yardstick for  future sanctions. In similar cases, moral arguments for trade  barriers will no longer be acceptable, even if political  interests and election dates would suggest that it is advisable  to isolate certain states from trade by pointing to human  rights. Those who opt for free trade with China can hardly  maintain sanctions against Cuba.    The outrage of Western politicians about working conditions  in threshold countries that are unworthy of man also become  implausible. The United States, for example, has strongly  criticized the lack of social standards in Malaysia and  Indonesia. To pretend that one is worried about the labor rights  in such cases, while importing products of forced labor from  China, is hypocritical. The important point here is  protectionism -- closing the market for one's own advantage.    Of course, there will always be exceptions. When it is  necessary to stop ethnically motivated crimes as in the former  Yugoslavia or to isolate the former apartheid regime in South  Africa, then sanctions will undoubtedly be legitimate. With the  exception of South Africa, the FRG almost always rejected trade  sanctions. Although this was done out of German economic  interests, the position of the government in Bonn has also been  politically worthwhile, as can be seen by the example of the  former East Bloc.    Therefore, the Germans, in particular, must be careful when  political opportunism -- different to the case of China -- will  call for trade sanctions. Bill Clinton's change of policy would  have a liberating effect if it were to make such double moral  standards more difficult in the future.</p>

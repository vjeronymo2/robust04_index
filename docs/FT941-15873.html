			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia acid plant for Amoco Amoco Chemicals of the US, one of the world's largest petrochemicals manufacturers, is to build a MDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 307m) plant in Malaysia to produce purified terephthalic acid, a basic ingredient for making polyester, reports Kieran Cooke from Kuala Lumpur. The plant, to be built in the state of Pahang on the east coast of peninsular Malaysia, will have an initial production capacity of 500,000 tonnes of PTA. The Malaysian government has been encouraging investors to move away from areas around Kuala Lumpur and the island of Penang off the west coast and go to parts of the country where there are plentiful supplies of workers. The state of Pahang has already established itself as a centre for Malaysia's fast expanding petrochemicals industry. Amoco has been investing heavily in the east Asia region and already has manufacturing facilities in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and China. Amoco is also considering new ventures in Singapore and Indonesia.</p>

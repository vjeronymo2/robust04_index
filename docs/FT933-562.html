			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (5): The condensed art of literary deception - Industry THEIRS WAS THE KINGDOM: LILA AND DeWITT WALLACEAND THE STORY OF THE READER'S DIGEST by John Heidenry Norton Dollars 29.95 701 pages IN 1921 a young man armed with sheafs of yellow notepaper took to spending long hours in the periodicals room of the New York Public Library, sitting alongside local down-and-outs sheltering from the cold. Many of the library staff dismissed him as just another eccentric. Had they but known it, they were witnessing the birth labours of the world's most successful magazine, Reader's Digest, the foremost literary exponent of conservative, middle-brow, middle American values and one of the country's leading cultural exports. The man in the periodicals room was DeWitt ('Wally') Wallace, founder of the Digest, who was trawling through the library's magazine racks for articles he could summarise in his new publication or pithy quotations he could recycle under the title 'remarkable remarks.' Wally, the son of a mid-western academic, was in the grip of one of the best publishing ideas of the century, which had come to him one summer night on a sheep farm in the vastness of rural Montana, where he was working temporarily as a hired hand. He believed a market might exist among ordinary, hard-working American families, with little spare time and less money, for a magazine with no advertisements and no illustrations which condensed the most useful non-fiction articles published by other journals. Numerous publishers whom he approached rejected the idea. But Wally, stirred out of the resulting bouts of depression by his new wife Lila, raised sufficient funds from his family to start it himself, as a mail order venture. It was an instant success. From its first issue, says John Heidenry, Reader's Digest became a secular Bible of a 'deeply religious and immensely disaffected and fearful majority  -three-fourths of whom still lived on farms. Even when its circulation numbered only in the thousands, the RD was a mass magazine in sensibility, taking the side of the vast conservative majority on almost every issue.' Heidenry, a freelance author, has produced a gripping, wry and gracefully written narrative history of the Wallaces and their publishing empire. He makes clear that Wally's genius was twofold. First, he possessed an extraordinary common touch - a feeling for just exactly what the general reading public wanted. Second, he was a master of the art of mail order solicitation. In the early days, he used to read the YWCA house magazine for news of job transfers, on the principle that a young woman sent to a strange town would welcome 'any letter, even a promotion piece.' The Digest became proprietor of the world's largest mailing list. Wally's keen marketing sense was evident from the Digest's very first issue. Assuming, correctly, that the magazine would be primarily bought by women, he named his wife and her cousin as co-editors, even though neither ever had any real involvement in the editorial side of the publication. In later life, Wally rankled at the fact that his wife was given joint credit for his creation. Yet Lila was throughout her life a powerful presence behind the scenes. That was brought home in traumatic fashion on Christmas Eve, 1965, when Wally used a staff party to summarily oust his long-time general manager, Al Cole, and demote Cole's protege Fred Thompson, who happened to be Wally's nephew-in-law. Thompson had been widely regarded as the heir to the Wallaces' business, on the strength of his business ability rather than nepotism. Heidenry says the 'Christmas Eve' massacre was the work of Lila, who, having endured her husband's infidelities for years, drew the line at his recent affair with her tall, blue-eyed niece, Thompson's wife Judy. 'Lila, like Salome, demanded the head of Fred Thompson on a platter. Wally finally had to render to his wife the most valuable thing he possessed - the power to determine the future of the company.' Sex, in one form or another, had always played a significant role in the life of the Digest. Heidenry points out that in its early days the publication was to 'publish more and better sex information, and take a more progressive attitude towards sex in general, than any other commercial publication in the English language.' It was also to publish more off-colour jokes than any other respectable magazine in history. Yet this liberalism was combined in the editorial pages with the reactionary political views, including an ugly racist chord the Digest was to sound for decades. A further paradox was that this most wholesome of magazines had it origins in literary piracy. In the Digest's early years, Wally lifted articles without permission or payment of fees from other magazines - and made sure that all of his subscribers lived far from the publishing centres of the East coast, where his theft might be discovered. It was the start of the company's culture of secrecy, which persisted until very recently. In the 1930s, when the Great Depression took a toll on magazines, and thus the source of Digest fodder, the magazine resorted to another great deception: it commissioned and paid for articles which it planted in other magazines, purely so it could itself run condensed versions. Heidenry is at his best when describing these early decades, and the group's phenomenally successful move into fiction publishing after World War Two. The second half of the book, which deals with the Digest's development from a huge 'mom and pop' business into a global bureaucracy, is equally authoritative, but the story is less compelling and burdened with too much detail. This is a very good book, but one which could perhaps have learnt something from the Digest's art of condensation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] If the 200-million-dollar gas debt to Turkmenistan  is not repaid within days, gas supplies to Georgia will be  suspended on 1 May.    A spokesman for the Gruzgaz department told INTERFAX the  debt  to Turkmenistan is unlikely to be paid-off before the end of  April. The gas consumers in the republic -- enterprises and the  population-- pay practically nothing for the use of fuel. They  owe the department over 5 trillion Georgian coupons.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Relations between China  and Peru have progressed so well that Peru has become China's  fourth largest trade partner in Latin America.    This point was made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin when he  had a two-hour talk here today with visiting Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori.    The two presidents pledged to push bilateral relations to a  new height. After their talks, China gave Peru a 39.1 million  U.S. dollar export credit.    Fujimori, who is here for a four-day state visit, previously  visited China in April 1991, and in the same year paid a transit  visit to Shenzhen in November.    Welcoming Fujimori, Jiang said: "We are happy to see the  great achievements that the Peruvian Government and people have  made in maintaining political stability and in promoting  economic development, under your leadership."    Jiang said that China and Peru enjoy traditional friendship.  In recent years, he said, that the frequent exchanges of  high-level visits between the two countries have further  enhanced bilateral understanding.    Jiang said that the friendly cooperative relations between  the two countries in various areas have been developing smoothly  in recent years, adding that bilateral trade volume has been  increasing annually and now Peru has become China's No. 4 trade  partner in Latin America.    Jiang, expressing satisfaction with bilateral economic and  technological cooperation, said that China is willing to expand  such mutually beneficial cooperation in different forms, and  that it encourages Chinese enterprises to invest in Peru and  Peruvian ones are also welcome in China.    Fujimori agreed with Jiang's views. He said that Chinese  products were suitable for Peru, and that Peru would like to  expand bilateral trade and wants to take in more Chinese  technology and welcomes Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in Peru.    He thanked China for its assistance and the favored  treatment  China offers in bilateral trade.    Fujimori said that Peru values its relations with China --  the only country to which he has paid two state visits.    Fujimori voiced support for China's entry into the  Pan-American Development Bank, saying that China's entry will be  conducive to trade cooperation between China, Peru and other  Latin American countries.    After the talks, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen and Goldenberg Schreiber, president of Council of  Ministers and minister of foreign affairs of Peru, signed two  agreements: A Sino-Peruvian consular agreement and an agreement  on encouragement and mutual protection of investment between  China and Peru.    At the same ceremony, Wang Xuebing, president of the Bank of  China, signed with Goldenburg an agreement for China to provide  Peru with a 39.1 million U.S. dollar export credit.    Before the talks, Jiang presided over a ceremony welcoming  Fujimori to visit China.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. Vasilyev: "On the Verge of Bankruptcy"] </F>   [Text] Today we can characterize the economic situation in  which a majority of farms find themselves as being on the verge  of bankruptcy. We are once again convinced of this fact after  acquainting ourselves with the report entitled "Operational  Results of the Agro-Industrial Complex and the Tasks for 1994,"  as prepared for the government by Minselkhoz [Ministry of  Agriculture] of the RF [Russian Federation]. Many agricultural  enterprises, as emphasized in this report, have not been paying  wages for 3-4 months; for all practical purposes they have not  been carrying out repairs on equipment, since they are unable to  purchase spare parts and they are not supplying mineral  fertilizer or accumulating fuel and lubricating materials for  the spring sowing work. Some farms are even unable to purchase  seed. There have been instances of funds not being available for  acquiring the fuel needed for delivering the livestock products  produced to the consumers.    For the most part, this critical situation in the rural  areas  has been conditioned by a considerable weakening in state  support. During the 1991-1993 period, investments in  agricultural production installations have declined by a factor  of roughly sevenfold. Over the past two years, there has been a  sharp decline in the capital-labor ratio and the equipment  workload has increased.    And the damaging trend towards a decline in state assistance  is continuing this year. Thus, approximately nine trillion  rubles' worth of centralized credit resources are needed for  farms, including private farms, the organizations which provide  services for them and also food and processing enterprises for  preparing for and carrying out spring field operations and also  for their accounts with agricultural producers for products  delivered last year. Plans call for only one-ninth of the  mentioned amount of funds to be allocated for these purposes  during the first quarter of this year.    And for development of the agro-industrial complex,  Minekonomiki [Ministry of Economics] and Minfin [Ministry of  Finance] call for a limit to be placed upon centralized capital  investments, financed from the republic budget of the Russian  Federation, in the amount of 2.8 trillion rubles. In comparable  prices, this amounts to only 55 percent of the limit for 1993.    Meanwhile, the requirement for centralized capital  investments for 1994, for carrying out the state special purpose  federal programs and decrees for the support and development of  individual regions for agriculture alone, according to estimates  by Minselkhoz economists and as adopted by the government of the  Russian Federation, exceeds 37 trillion rubles. Thus, state  support for measures aimed at strengthening the logistical base  for agriculture is in essence being discontinued and the  carrying out of all programs adopted, including such an  important one as "Improving Soil Fertility," is being delayed.    An analysis of the status of affairs in the agro-industrial  complex, conducted by Minselkhoz specialists, reveals that the  branch's crisis is intensifying. And this year, if the  government fails to undertake the radical measures needed for  strengthening the agricultural economy, we may witness a drastic  decline in agricultural production.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Flotation puts Pounds 63m tag on Fenchurch FENCHURCH, the insurance broker, yesterday finalised its flotation, pricing the shares at 180p, which will capitalise the company at Pounds 63m. A placing and offer for intermediaries by James Capel, the securities house, will raise some Pounds 20.4m net. A total of 9.38m shares have been placed firm with institutions and a similar number have been placed subject to recall to satisfy valid applications under the intermediaries offer. On the basis of earnings per share for the 12 months to September 30 1993 of 11.2p (or 10.7p on a fully diluted basis), the price puts Fenchurch on a multiple of 16.1, or 16.8 on a fully diluted basis. After adjusting for the demerger of Fenchurch Underwriting Agency, effective from November 16, the multiple falls to 14.1, or 14.7 fully diluted. Of the money raised, Pounds 15.3m will be used to repay bank and other debt assumed at the time of the management buy-out in 1989; Pounds 4.1m will be used to redeem preference shares, while the balance will provide additional working capital. The directors believe the listing will enhance the profile 'with clients and in insurance markets'.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Genetically improved pig comes to market A BOAR guaranteed to be free from a gene that can lead to poor quality pork was launched on to the market in London yesterday by the Lincolnshire-based Cotswold Pig Development Company. The company claims that the UK pig industry would benefit by Pounds 52m a year if it switched to the new pig. British pig production is worth about Pounds 1bn a year at the farm gate. The so-called halothane gene has been known about since the 1920s. It could be detected only through a pig's reaction to halothane, a human anaesthetic, until the University of Toronto published a DNA genetic fingerprint in 1991. Mr John Webb, director of genetics at Cotswold, said yesterday that the company since 1983 had been breeding a line of pigs in an attempt to eliminate the gene. It had succeeded in reducing the percentage showing a positive reaction to the halothane test from nearly 90 per cent in 1983 to just 3 per cent by 1991, when the company was perfectly poised to take advantage of the DNA test and eliminate it entirely. The halothane gene had become widespread because carriers produced leaner meat than non-carriers, he said. However, it could lead to stress in the animal, whose meat then became what is known as pale, soft and exudative (PSE) after slaughter. This made it unattractive to supermarkets and reduced its shelf life. Mr Webb claimed that the new boar - the Cotswold 30 - would benefit producers and processors by providing a better yield, retailers and consumers by providing better quality meat, and the pig by reducing stress. Its production did not involve genetic engineering but used genetic breeding simply to eliminate a problem. Cotswold has an annual turnover of Pounds 20m and is the second biggest pig breeding company in the UK industry, which is a world leader. Mr Robin Shannon, managing director, said yesterday that half the company's production was exported, mainly to the EC, North America and Japan. The company has plans to sell about 500 Cotswold 30 boars this year.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS PROPOSITION 128;  </P> <P> NEW TV AD TARGETS CONCERNS OF L.A. VOTERS  </P> <P> The backers of Proposition 128 released a new television ad Monday designed to  persuade voters that the environmental initiative they call "Big Green" will  protect beaches from pollution, reduce smog and keep toxic chemicals out of  food.  </P> <P> The commercial, tailored for a Los Angeles audience, mixes images of waves  lapping onto a polluted beach and a helicopter spraying pesticides into the  air. It is narrated by actor Michael Landon and shows two small children  holding hands at the beach and on a playground.  </P> <P> "Proposition 128 protects our beaches from oil spills and sewage," Landon says.  "Proposition 128 reduces air pollution. Proposition 128 removes 20  cancer-causing pesticides from our food."  </P> <P> The footage of the helicopter is an attempt to play on the emotional issue of  malathion spraying, which is used to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly. The  spraying angered thousands of Southern California residents this year.  </P> <P> State officials have consistently maintained that malathion is not harmful to  humans in the doses used during the eradication program. Backers have said  malathion is not one of the chemicals that would be banned if voters approve  Proposition 128 on Nov. 6.  </P> <P> Duane Peterson, press secretary for the Proposition 128 campaign, said the  commercial will run only on Los Angeles stations for the next week.  </P> <P> The campaign, which has relied heavily on donations from actors and other  celebrities, has spent $250,000 to buy television time for the 30-second spot,  he said.  </P> <P> The ad touches only briefly on several of the main elements of Proposition 128,  a complex and detailed measure that also would provide funds to purchase  ancient redwoods and to cut the use of chemicals contributing to depletion of  the ozone layer.  </P> <P> The initiative's sponsors also attempt to use the commercial to counter a spate  of radio ads paid for by industry groups that oppose it.  </P> <P> The opposition, financed by the chemical industry and other businesses, has  portrayed Proposition 128 as being too costly and attempting to do too much.  Opponents also have branded the measure "the Hayden initiative" because one of  its sponsors is controversial Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica).  </P> <P> Landon contends at the start of the commercial that "oil and chemical companies  don't want you to listen to this message."  </P> <P> As smoke belches from a smokestack at the end of the ad, he concludes: "Now  those big companies are polluting our airwaves with ridiculous statements  against 128. You know who they are. Don't believe their smoke screen."  </P></p>

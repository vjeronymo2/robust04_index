The government received information that dozens of people  were shot down. "In actual fact," the statement says, "Abkhazia  continues a purposeful policy of genocide and ethnic purge of  Georgian population in Abkhazia".    The document lists six villages in the Gali district, which  were "destroyed with the use of heavy materiel": Pirveli Gali,  Konstitutsia, Rechkhi, Tskhira, Namarkalu and Gumurishi.    The Georgian Government, the document notes, "remains, as  before, an advocate of and active participant in a peaceful  settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. At the same time, it is  ready to take all measures to protect Georgian citizens now  staying in a territory occupied by separatists and their  henchmen".</p>

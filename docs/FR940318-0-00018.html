			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To clarify some misunderstanding of this criterion, the determination whether the timely payments requirement is met is made only once, at the time when the institution decides to place the multifamily mortgage loan in the 50 percent risk-weight category. ``Timely payments'' will generally be considered those payments not 30 days or more past due. The criteria that the loan be performing and not 90 days or more past due will be used to monitor the payment stream of the loan on an ongoing basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon review, the OTS has decided that, when a borrower refinances a loan on an existing property, as an alternative, the timely payments requirement may be satisfied if: (1) All principal and interest payments on the loan being refinanced have been made on a timely basis in accordance with the terms of that loan for the preceding year and (2) the net income on the property for the preceding year would support timely principal and interest payments on the new loan in accordance with the applicable debt service requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Cooperative and Not-For-Profit Multifamily Mortgage Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five commenters asked that a cooperative housing loan where the master mortgage is a joint obligation of the shareholders in the cooperative be treated as a qualifying multifamily mortgage loan under the rule. Certain cooperative and other not-for-profit multifamily housing properties, however, may not be able to generate sufficient income to satisfy the debt service ratio required by the rule. Therefore, the OTS will permit cooperatives and other not-for-profit multifamily properties to meet the debt service ratio requirement by generating sufficient cash flows to provide comparable protection to the institution. Debt service coverage providing comparable protection to the institution may take a number of different forms that include, but are not limited to, special operating reserves accounts or special operating subsidies provided by federal, state, local, or private sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Treatment of MBS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters agreed with the requirement in the proposal that, in order to qualify for a 50 percent risk weight, MBS must be secured by or represent an interest in qualifying multifamily mortgage loans at the time of securitization. Several commenters suggested that the final rule allow multifamily mortgage loans to be securitized immediately, and the MBS backed by such loans to qualify for the lower risk-weight category after the underlying mortgage loans have satisfied the timely payments requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon review of this issue and consultation with the other federal banking agencies, the OTS has decided that it will generally expect MBS secured by or representing an interest in multifamily mortgage loans to qualify for the 50 percent risk-weight category at original securitization. Thus, all of the underlying multifamily mortgage loans must satisfy the qualifying criteria, including the timely payments requirement, at the time the MBS is securitized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MBS will remain in the 50 percent risk-weight category provided the investing institution receives timely payments (generally those payments not 30 days or more past due) of principal and interest in accordance with the terms of the MBS. However, institutions holding the multifamily MBS, or servicers or trustees on their behalf, will not be required to track the continuing qualification of the underlying mortgage loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters misunderstood the interaction of this provision regarding certain MBS with other provisions concerning MBS in the OTS's risk-based capital regulation. Today's rule only addresses privately issued, non-high-quality MBS backed by qualifying multifamily mortgage loans. MBS backed by multifamily mortgage loans that are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government sponsored enterprise; that are privately issued and rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating service; and those with residual characteristics would be treated the same as MBS with the same characteristics backed by 1&hyph;4 family residential mortgage loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Grandfathering of Loans Currently Qualifying for the 50 Percent Risk-Weight Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of commenters favored the OTS's proposal to ``grandfather'' the risk-weighting of existing multifamily mortgage loans qualifying for the 50 percent risk-weight category under the OTS's prior regulation, but not qualifying under the new criteria. The other federal banking agencies are not presented with this issue since their existing capital rules do not provide a 50 percent risk-weight for any multifamily mortgage loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OTS's supervisory experience with multifamily mortgage loans qualifying for the 50 percent risk-weight category under its prior rule shows no reason to increase the capital charge on these loans to 100 percent. Associations that originated and administered these loans in accordance with the prudent criteria established by the OTS's prior rule should retain the benefit of the reduced capital charge. Therefore, the OTS has decided to ``grandfather'' any multifamily mortgage loans that, on the effective date of this rule, qualified for the 50 percent risk-weight category under the OTS's previous rule and that continue to meet those criteria. Any ``grandfathered'' multifamily mortgage loan that does not remain in compliance with the requirements of the prior rule may requalify for the 50 percent risk-weight category only by satisfying the criteria under today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters urged the OTS to retain its existing criteria or to adopt less stringent criteria for loans on multifamily properties with less than 36 units because such loans present less risk than loans on larger properties. The OTS has given serious consideration to this suggestion, but in the interest of interagency uniformity has determined not to provide a reduced risk weight to new loans qualifying under the prior OTS rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

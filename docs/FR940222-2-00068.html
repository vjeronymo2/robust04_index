DPR&hyph;58 and DPR&hyph;74 which authorize operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, at steady-state reactor power levels not in excess of 3250 and 3411 megawatts thermal, respectively. The Donald C. Cook facilities are pressurized water reactors located at the licensee's site in Berrien County, Michigan. These licenses provide, among other things, that they are subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1), ``Each licensee shall_(1) Successfully complete a requalification program developed by the facility licensee that has been approved by the Commission.

The modifications, which include replacing all Foxboro controllers with Taylor model 30 controllers and a reconfiguration of the control room, have been completed in the simulator but will not be installed in the Unit 1 and Unit 2 control rooms until the refueling outages in February and August, 1994, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee is requesting the exemption from the operational portion of the requalification examination in order to provide more simulator training time on the new modifications and to avoid administering a requalification examination on a simulator which is configured differently from the plant control rooms. The licensee will administer the operating portion of the requalification examination on the simulator in the May&hyph;June, 1994 time frame. The licensee's 24-month requalification cycle ends February 11, 1994; therefore, the exemption from the requirements of the regulation would be for a period of approximately 4 months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, ``The Commission may, upon application by an interested person, or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the regulations in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger life or property and are otherwise in the public interest.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the Donald C. Cook Licensed Operator Requalification Training Program beings and ends in early February of even years. This one-time exemption would permit an operating examination from the current 24-month requalification cycle to be administered approximately 4 months into the next cycle. The next examination will be administered on schedule in January 1995, which will be consistent with the annual examination requirement cited in 10 CFR 55.59(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> V <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff has reviewed the licensee's request and concluded that issuance of this exemption will not endanger life or property and will have no significant effect on the safety of the public or the plant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, that this exemption as described in section III is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants a one-time exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) for a period of February 1994 to June 1994, with respect to the 24-month requalification program. This exemption applies only to the operational examination portion of the requalification program. No changes to the written portion of the requalification program have been requested by the licensee or granted by this exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting of this exemption will have no significant impact on the environment (February 14, 1994, 59 FR 6978). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This exemption is effective upon issuance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of February, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jack W.

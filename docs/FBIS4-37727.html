			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi "before the </F> masses of the western Tripoli suburbs of Qirgarish, Hay  al-Andalus, and Ghawt al-Sha'al" in Tripoli on 22 June -- live  or recorded]    [Excerpts] Brothers, this evening another strong voice is  being raised from an important corner of the immortal town of  Tripoli, the Tripoli of Arabs. This voice is being raised today  from Qirgarish, Hay al-Andalus, and Ghawt al-Sha'al. This voice  is being raised to stress to the enemies that the Libyan people  have decided to accept the challenge of confrontation and  defiance, and they have decided to confront defiance with their  iron and formidable determination which cannot be defeated or  swayed.    Brothers, let your voice rise from the western corner of  Tripoli, from Qirgarish, Hay al-Andalus, and Ghawt al-Sha'aal.  Let the enemies hear this strong voice which cannot be  terrorized by threats and unjust policies. This voice,  brothers, will terrorize and shake them; the voice of the masses  and the voice of the free citizen -- the ordinary citizen -- the  voice of the street and the voice of quarters. [passage omitted]    Dear brothers, they use dirty weapons against us so as to  weaken our determination and we find ourselves forced to give in  to their wishes. They use economic and psychological weapons  and threaten us to step up the sanctions. They threaten us with  an oil embargo. This is an insult to the Libyan people when they  think that oil is more valuable than the dignity of the Libyan  people. They are mistaken and they insult the Libyan people  when they think that oil is dearer than the dignity, glory, and  our fathers and ancestors' blood which was shed before the time  of oil in defense of the freedom of this land. They insult you,  brothers, they think that eating, to you, is more important than  the homeland. They want to tell you that your are guided by you  stomach not by you brains. They want to imply that you have no  dignity when they threaten to embargo the Libyan oil.    First of all those barbarians use the dirtiest and the most  decadent weapons, they fight people in their quest to earn a  living. Why do they not say they would impose an embargo on  Libyan dates, onions, or oranges.    They say we will impose an embargo on Libyan oil if Libya  does not surrender, because they know that the main source of  wealth and the main resource of the Libyan people is oil. Hence  they embarked upon threatening the Libyan people's livelihood.  This is not the weapon of real men, nor is it the weapon of the  brave. It is not a human weapon at all. This is the weapon of  cowards, the weapon of barbarians (?of the jungle), the enemies  of human rights and the enemies of peoples.    The United States, Britain, and France prove that they are  the most decadent states and the most barbaric and savage states  when they fight the Iraqi people, the Libyan people, and the  Cuban people. They fight each country by its source of wealth.  They fight Cuba by sugar, its main resource. They fight Iraq  by deprivation of its oil. They fight Libya by threatening that  they will impose an embargo on its oil. These threats can only  come from very decadent and barbarous nations. What is this  despicable talk which is a disgrace to mankind? What is this  talk of threatening peoples' resources and wealth?    When they impose an arms ban on Libya, this is  understandable. When they impose a ban on transports, this can  also be understandable. Whether this applies to Libya or any  other country, if a state needs to be punished, political  relations with it are severed. This is also understandable and  acceptable. However, when they threaten to boycott the source  of wealth of any people, they are sinking very low in decadence  and they show that they are barbarians and snakes. After that  they should no longer have the right to talk about humanity,  freedom, peoples, and human rights. By threatening the peoples'  wealth and the people's main resource, they lose that right.  When they decide to starve peoples, they are proving that they  are more barbaric than Genghiz Khan and Hulagu, more Nazi than  Hitler, and more fascist than Mussolini.    The new Hitler is the United States, Britain, and France.  The new Mussolini is the United States, Britain, and France.  The new Hulagu is the United States, Britain, and France. The  new Genghis Khan is the United States, Britain, and France.  [passage omitted]    Brothers, how do Arab governments continue to adhere to the  three Western countries' resolution which was fabricated on  behalf of the Security Council; how do they adhere to refusing  Libyan planes even during Hajj, although new evidence has come  to light before the world regarding the so-called Lockerbie case  which categorically proves that at least the perpetrator was not  Libya?    This new evidence has come as a slap in the face for the  United States, Britain, and France, and the so-called false  Security Council. How can they impose sanctions on the Libyan  people when it has become evident that a number of sides could  have perpetrated the crime? A number of sides are now in the  dock. A number of sides are now thought to have blown up  Lockerbie [as heard]. How can sanctions against the Libyan  people continue in an obscure and ambiguous case in which the  accused have become numerous? How can they pick on one of the  accused and impose sanctions on him?    Shame on Arab governments. Shame on the rulers of the Arab  nation. Shame on you for carrying out whatever Washington tells  you without question and for carrying out what Tel Aviv tells  you without question.    It is a disgrace that the issue of Arab existence and Arab  Palestine has become an issue of the demarcation of borders  between Jordan and the enemy. Are they not ashamed of the  thousands of victims -- children and women, not to mention men  -- of letting the issue of Jerusalem, the issue of Palestine,  and the issue of threatened Arab existence become the issue of  the demarcation of borders between Jordan and the so-called  Israel.    This unconditional and unjustifiable surrender is shameful  and disgraceful. This nation has sacrificed convoys of martyrs  for Palestine. The sacrifice was not made for the border  between Jordan and the so-called Israel. [passage omitted]    We are telling the colonial countries that the veto has been  transferred from the Security Council and the superpowers to the  street, the masses, the Libyan people, the Somali people, and  the Lebanese people.    We are telling them: Do not mock the street, O Arab rulers.  Do not mock the wretched Arab citizen. Do not pile humiliation  after humiliation on this citizen. Do not gamble with the  future of this citizen. This wretched citizen in the Arab  Maghreb, the Arab Mashreq [Middle East], the Nile valley and the  Arabian peninsula will take revenge. [passage omitted]    We tell them: You should fear the citizen more than the  United States. You should fear the poor Arab citizen who is  humiliated today. You should fear him more than you fear  France, Britain, the United States, and Tel Aviv. O You, the  servile and submissive Arab leaders, who trade the future of  this citizen, this citizen will rebel and he must rebel. This  citizen is a threat to you. America will not save you from this  citizen. This citizen is closer to you than your jugular vein.  This citizen is closer to you than rescue from America and Tel  Aviv. This citizen is lying in wait for you, you the servile  leaders.    Glory is to the street; glory is to the ordinary citizen;  glory is to these generations which want to live free under the  sun, away from the United States', Britain's, France's, and Tel  Aviv's threats. It is this free citizen who will determine what  he wants. It is he, the free citizen, who should have the right  of veto. Go on, you colonialists, allying yourselves with the  most despicable agents and cowards in the Arab region. Go on  challenging the Arab citizen because this will turn the Arab  citizen into a bomb. It is this citizen who can do what your  fleets and nuclear bombs cannot do. We welcome this policy  which fosters hatred in our children and grandchildren against  you the colonialists. Go on you the colonialists, go on with  your devious and mistaken policies from which you will reap  regret. You will regret this, you colonialists.    We are happy when you despise the Arab citizen and when you  fill this Arab citizen with hatred and rancor against you. Let  there be more challenge from America to the Arab citizen, the  Iraqi citizen, the Libyan citizen and the Somali citizen. Let  there be more humiliation to the Palestinian Arab citizen. Let  there be more destruction of Lebanon because all this will  generate hatred and bombs and will generate fear, brothers.  This will generate terrorism, the real terrorism which they  fear, when the Arab citizen terrorizes them. This is the  citizen whose house is being destroyed in Lebanon and about whom  nobody talks. This citizen will take his revenge, as will the  citizen who is being jailed in Palestine and who is tortured in  Palestine and whose mother and sister are tortured in front of  him. This is the citizen who will turn into a bomb which will  destroy what is known as Israel. Israel will (?suffer at the  hands of) this citizen and what is known as Israel will be  finished; and America's fleets will not save it from the  ordinary citizen, the explosive citizen wearing an explosive  belt or carrying a bomb.    Continue, you leaders, on the path of surrender and  submissiveness to the will of the enemy because this will  shorten your life and will bring your end nearer at the hands of  the citizen who rejects surrender, submissiveness, and  servility. The peoples want to live free, brothers. The  citizen wants to be master of his own destiny and wants to live  free. He does not accept always living under the leaders' whip  and under the threats of the enemies, Tel Aviv and Washington.  God did not create us to live, generation after generation,  under America's and Tel Aviv's terrorism.    We accept death and challenge. We have decided to confront  the challenge with challenge. We have decided to accept the  challenge in the spheres of oil, arms, the economy, or in  anything else.    We do not sell the martyrs' blood for oil. We do not sell  the immortal past for oil. [passage omitted]    When the confrontation became a confrontation between the  citizen and the enemies, between the peoples and the colonialist  [word indistinct], the confrontation became one between the Arab  citizen and his rulers, between the citizen and the rulers. It  is here that the master citizen emerged, the free citizen  emerged in the free street on the free Libyan territory. He  emerged today in the western corner of the city of Tripoli, in  Qirgarish and Hay al- Andalus to make his voice heard by the  subservient rulers. [passage omitted]</p>

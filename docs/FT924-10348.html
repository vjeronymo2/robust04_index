			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Booker buys cash and carry in Spain Booker, the food distribution and agribusiness group, is expanding further in southern Europe with the acquisition of a cash and carry business near Barcelona, Spain. The deal follows last year's purchase of an interest in a food wholesaler in Portugal. The group is keen to build up the business in southern Europe. The purchase, for Pounds 2.2m plus stock, is of a one outlet operation which in 1991 made pre-tax profits of Pounds 765,000 on sales of Pounds 42.4m. Booker said that the management and systems were capable of supporting a number of additional outlets.</p>

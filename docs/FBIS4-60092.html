			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Requirements For Peace,"  AL-THAWRAH says: From the outcome of U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's talks in the region, it became apparent  that the gap in viewpoints on peace and means to achieve it is  very large because the Israeli position is very far from the  foundations and requirements of the peace process launched in  the Madrid conference.    The paper notes that the Israeli position on the peace  process and its objectives is characterized by a disdain for the  peace process, avoidance of its objective -- comprehensive peace  -- and an attempt to replace it with the objective of partial  solutions.    The paper adds: In contrast, the Syrian position on the  peace process and its objective is characterized by concern for  the peace process and full accord with the Madrid formula and  the resolutions of international legitimacy. This position was  reaffirmed by President Hafiz al-Asad when he received the U.S.  secretary of state the day before yesterday.    AL-THAWRAH says: In light of the obvious contradiction  between the Syrian and Israeli positions, one important fact  emerges: The peace which Israel seeks to achieve is different  from that which the world and the Arabs want for the region.    The paper stresses: The kind of peace the world agrees upon  and for which the Arabs entered into talks in Madrid and  Washington is the kind of peace based on justice and  comprehensiveness and the kind of peace that returns to the  Arabs their rights and occupied territories in full.    Concluding its editorial, AL-THAWRAH says: Because the  Israeli position is still far from the foundations and  requirements of the peace process, the U.S. sponsor must build a  new direction for his efforts, based on providing all that is  necessary to force Israel to accept the requirements of the  peace process, on top of which is complete, unconditional  withdrawal.    On the same subject, AL-THAWRAH says: The outcome of  Christopher's talks in Israel has revealed the big gap between  Israeli and Syrian positions on peace because Israel is very far  from the foundations and requirements of the peace process,  which started in the Madrid conference.    The paper adds: Syria has stressed, and still stresses,  concern for the continuation of the peace process and a  commitment to continue to make efforts to push this process  forward. It has also responded, and still responds, positively  to U.S. efforts in that regard. Syria, at the same time,  adheres to the resolutions of legitimacy and the UN Security  Council which obliges Israel to withdraw completely to the 4  June 1967 borders as the condition without which the just and  comprehensive peace in the region cannot be attained.    Concluding its editorial, the paper stresses the need for  Washington's assuming the role of the unbiased, fair, and  effective partner by forcing Israel to submit to international  legitimacy and its resolutions.    Under the headline "No Peace Without Land," AL-BA'TH says in  its editorial today that the U.S. initiative, which is based on  the land-for-peace formula, constituted the foundation on which  the Madrid Middle East peace conference was based. Resolutions  242 and 338 were considered the legal instruments that make the  Israeli occupation of the Arab territories null, rejected, and  impermissible, the paper says.    The paper notes that all those interested in world peace  have  acknowledged the importance of Syria's positive role in the  peace process since its acceptance to attend the Madrid  conference. They considered that acceptance to be the most  important in creating a new reality based on just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    AL-BA'TH says: When the rounds of Washington bilateral talks  started, the Arabs felt that Israel was refusing to give  specific pledges to implement international legitimacy and that  its maneuvers constituted an extortion of the state sponsoring  the talks. With the start of every round of talks, Israel  wanted new weapons and fresh financial grants. Every round was  also preceded by a flagrant Israeli attack against Lebanon or a  massacre of the Palestinian people on their soil.    The paper stresses: From day one in the Madrid conference,  Israel knew that withdrawal from all of the Golan Heights is an  indispensable condition for establishing peace with Syria. It  must also be stressed that Israeli occupation of every inch of  the Arab territories must end on the basis of the initiative on  which the Madrid conference was based.    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: If Israel is serious about  achieving peace, then the Arabs have responded favorably to  Madrid and Washington talks because they are advocates of peace  and because peace is their objective.</p>

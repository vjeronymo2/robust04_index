			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Indonesia has asked the UN Security Council to  take decisive action to save Gorazde, one of the UN-designated  safe havens in Bosnia, from the Serbian attacks. Speaking at a  formal meeting of the UN Security Council in New York, Nugroho  Wisnumurti, Indonesian permanent representative to the United  Nations, said the status of Gorazde and other safe havens must  be upheld and the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina lifted.    Nugroho said a new diplomatic initiative aimed at reaching a  cease-fire in Gorazde and the entire territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina must continue so as to find a political  settlement to the conflict. He also stressed the importance of  ensuring the safety and independence of the UN personnel serving  in Bosnia. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alejandro Gomez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 12 Jan (PL) -- One of the measures  proposed by workers to improve finances is the creation and sale  of bonds of the fatherland, which would be purchased  voluntarily, without interest or with a soft interest, and  redeemable within five to 10 years.    Workers at a canned food factory discussed this proposal,  along with other suggestions like paying for sports and cultural  events, increasing electricity charges, and seizing money and  goods that were obtained illegally.    The discussion at that Cuban industry is a sign of what will  happen at all work centers in Cuba on 30 January after more than  400,000 labor leaders conclude their analysis of these topics.    Despite the social cost of many proposals, most Cuban  workers  agree on the need to adopt a program to reorganize the country's  finances, a program that is indispensable to apply other  measures with a view to overcome the serious crisis that the  nation is facing.    With regard to this, the government also recognized the  urgency of making these decisions, but at the same time it  issued a call to preserve the achievements of the Cuban  socialist project, such as in health and education, which are  free to all inhabitants of the island.    The last session of the Cuban parliament -- 27 and 28  December -- analyzed the country's economic situation, but no  agreements were reached because, it was learned, a process of  consultations and explanations to the population was needed  first.    Cuban experts considered that the main guidelines for a  possible program to improve the financial situation will stem  from the people's opinions. Such a program could be approved by  the Cuban deputies during a special session that is to be  convoked for that purpose.    According to these experts, the fact that there is a budget  deficit of 4.2 billion pesos and that over 10 billion pesos (at  par with the dollar at the official exchange rate) are in  circulation demand the adoption of certain measures to control  it.    This latter problem is considered one of the most harmful  because it contributes to a drop in efficiency and productivity  and increases a lack of labor discipline and interest.    But the solutions, the experts said, must include measures  to  improve profitability in most state enterprises because,  according to official statistics, 69 percent of them are  operating at a loss.</p>

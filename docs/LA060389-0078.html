			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> URBAN COWBOYS;  </P> <P> REFUSE RIDERS TEST DRIVING SKILLS IN TRASH-HAULING STEEDS  </P> <P> Ron Lee has never mounted a Brahman bull but he does ride another large type of  beast: a 25-ton, fully loaded garbage truck in Los Angeles gridlock.  </P> <P> So Friday, the 28-year-old Lee came to San Diego to compete in a rodeo. . . .  That's ROAD-E-O.  </P> <P> Lee was among 10 trash-truck drivers who met on the parking lot pavement at San  Diego Jack Murphy Stadium to determine the top truck handlers in the second  annual Southern California Regional Refuse Driver's ROAD-E-O.  </P> <P> But, rather than compete with testy commuters, tight alleys or tots on  tricycles, drivers faced a slew of obstacles that proved just as harrying.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wrestled With Big Rigs  </P> <P> Donning work boots and khakis, the drivers maneuvered big diesel rigs  (unloaded, they weigh about 15 tons) over a course marked by fluorescent pylons  and barricades.  </P> <P> Seven categories tested drivers' prowess in various situations, including  cornering, backing and parallel parking.  </P> <P> Sometimes barricades tumbled and clattered loudly, to the groans of supporters  who watched when a driver miscalculated by less than an inch.  </P> <P> Other times, however, the only sound was the high-pitched burst from air brakes  or the clang of a warning bell when drivers backed up trucks perfectly into  tight spots.  </P> <P> The winners Friday of the three categories -- front loader, side loader and  back loader -- will go on to Tulsa, Okla. to compete in August in the  international ROAD-E-O with drivers from the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> Each man (none of the women drivers made the cut) had to win competitions in  their own cities. Besides San Diego and Los Angeles, drivers also came from  Newport Beach and Santa Monica. The competitors also had to have perfect  driving records and good attendance.  </P> <P> The event was an opportunity for unsung heroes, who hoist tons of rubbish  daily, to be recognized. Repeated lifting takes a nasty toll on drivers' backs  and shoulders, said Ernie Anderson, deputy director of refuse collection for  San Diego. Anderson said that, in the peak summer months, trash collectors lift  as much as 15 tons daily.  </P> <P> Injuries among drivers on the job are common.  </P> <P> For instance, last year's winner, Bernie Helton, had to bow out of the  competition after hurting his shoulder this week.  </P> <P> The injury may have been a setback for Helton, but for Albert Villa of San  Diego it meant a victory and a bonus: a day off.  </P> <P> Villa, 27, won the front-loader competition. He said he was scheduled to work a  route in Scripps Ranch, but got the nod after Helton was felled.  </P> <P> "I sweat as much today as I would have if I had worked," he joked. "The  pressure was on this morning."  </P> <P> Nearby, Jesus Ruano of Santa Monica nervously smoked a cigarette while watching  another driver navigate the course, which took about 10 to 12 minutes to  complete.  </P> <P> As the driver knocked over a barrel, Ruano said, "You've got to take your time  and relax.".  </P> <P> But, behind the wheel of a shiny white and orange rig with Armor All on the  tires, Ruano tensed up, nicking a few obstacles. He finished fourth in the  back-loader category.  </P> <P> "I did my best," he shrugged.  </P> <P> Two other San Diegans won their divisions: Danny Munoz in the side-loader and  Ron Garcia in the back-loader.  </P> <P> One judge on the course said the competition reinforces the importance of the  garbage collectors' job.  </P> <P> "When they drive through neighborhoods, the kids can look up to them as someone  to admire and respect," said Donald Reese, a San Diego refuse supervisor, who  drove a trash truck for five years.  </P> <P> "You're the one who has to do all the decision making. . . . You can't hit a  vehicle or anything else."  </P></p>

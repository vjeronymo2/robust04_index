			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service believes that a special rule of this nature will benefit the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl in Texas, and that the rule would satisfy the requirement under section 4(d) that regulations applied to threatened species embody those measures deemed necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the species in question. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and authorizes recovery plans for all listed species. The protection required for Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 and 17.31 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered and threatened wildlife, respectively. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or to attempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered and threatened wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoological exhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with the purpose of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(d) of the Act provides authority for the Service to promulgate special rules for threatened species. The Service is proposing a special rule for the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl in Texas that would relax the prohibition against incidental taking where the Service and a landowner have entered into a conservation agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments Solicited <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly are sought concerning: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The location of any additional populations of this species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be critical habitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of this species; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on this species; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Any foreseeable economic and other impacts resulting from the proposed designation of critical habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS LET DAILEY GO BUT KEEP NORMAN  </P> <P> The Clippers' youth movement, which forced Norm Nixon into retirement last  season, claimed another victim Saturday when the club announced it would not  pick up the option on guard Quintin Dailey.  </P> <P> That was the only move of any significance for the Clippers, who, as expected,  picked up the option on Ken Norman and made offers to restricted free agents  Benoit Benjamin, Tom Garrick and Ken Bannister. Benjamin was offered about  $1.25 million, a 25% raise that is required by the collective bargaining  agreement. It may increase to match an offer from another club.  </P> <P> In addition to relinquishing rights to Dailey, 28, who was not immediately  available for comment, the Clippers also decided not to make offers to Grant  Gondrezick and Rob Lock.  </P></p>

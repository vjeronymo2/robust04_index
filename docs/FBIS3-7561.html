			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoshito Horie] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 29 Mar -- A Chinese source stated on 29  March that, despite an invitation for DPRK (North Korean)  President Kim Il-song to visit China, President Kim does not  intend to visit the country until the suspected nuclear arms  development issue has been resolved. China regards Kim's  intentions as a virtual rejection.    The same source analyzes that China's invitation was  rejected  because the DPRK is wary of the possibility that, if the issue  should be resolved following Kim's visit, it would give the  impression that North Korea had responded to persuasion, thereby  giving credit to China. The "rejection" of Kim's visit  indicates not only that North Korea is strongly aware of ROK  President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China, but that there is a  limit to China's influence on North Korea.    A party delegation that visited Pyongyang late last month  extended an invitation to President Kim to visit to China, and  Chinese newspapers have reported this invitation -- aimed at  promoting an exchange of views on such issues as reform and  opening up policies. Since the two countries are known for  their close relationship, it was unusual for China to officially  announce the extension of such an invitation. This fact  indicates that China is very enthusiastic about Kim's visit.    Subsequently, however, China studied North Korean moves with  caution, and reached the conclusion that North Korea feels:  "The president's visit to China before resolution of the issue  would probably indicate subjection to Chinese pressure and  thereby give credit to China." In a recent interview, Chiense  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said: "There is no schedule for a  visit in the near future."    At a recent special council session of the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), China abstained from voting on  reentrusting the UN Security Council with the authority on  settling the nuclear arms development issue. At a similar  session held last year, China voted "against" the proposal. The  change in its position can be taken to be pressure imposed on  North Korea.    China also clearly indicated opposition to sanctions by  maintaining: "If the international community should decide to  impose economic sanctions, there is a possibility that North  Korea will risk its survival by attacking the ROK." Thus, it  can be noted that China is having difficulties tackling the  North Korean issue.    A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated on 28 March:  "Since North Korea is a sovereign state, a foreign country  should not instruct it to do this or that," and "even if we  should try to persuade North Korea, there is a limit." In  making these remarks, the spokesman must have kept these facts  in mind.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 25, RIA -- According to the State Duma  committee on international affairs, Russia has not ratified at  least 20 international treaties with foreign states, owing to  the absence of a law on the procedure for their ratification and  enforcement.    According to a committee spokesman, this makes partners ask  questions. For example, a delegation of the Slovak parliament,  which finished its visit to Moscow on May 24, wondered why the  treaty of cooperation between the two countries, signed in  August 1993, had not been ratified yet. More over, the time for  ratifying it has not been chosen. The committee spokesman said  that the deputies received a draft of the aforementioned law  from the Russian president only in late April, and will discuss  it at a session soon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Golboddin-Dostam militia's attacks were aborted  in Qala-e Ahmad Khan, and a large area was cleared up in Karta-e  Naw [southeast of Kabul]. Reports received by the Bakhtar  Information Agency [BIA] say that forces of the Islamic army  were consolidating their positions in the course of the day, and  they crushed two attacks by the Golboddin-Dostam militia in  Qala-e Ahmad Khan. As a result a number of the militia were  killed.    According to a report by BIA, calm has resumed in Kabul, and  the refugees of the city are returning to their homes in the old  Microrayon and Shah-Shahid. The report says that a large number  of Kabul's refugees who had gone to Jalalabad six months ago are  returning to their places. Over the past three days the Islamic  army's conquests have removed militia's heavy weapons positions  from the city. They can hardly cause trouble to the people, as  a result. However, the conquests have put urgent tasks on the  shoulders of the state. The reconstruction of the conquered  areas, most of which have become ruins, the reactivation of the  police security zones, and the construction of educational and  health institution in those areas rest at the top of the list of  programs.    The report adds that the danger has not completely been  eliminated, but that the Golboddin-Dostam militia threaten  residential areas through their stealthy attacks. According to  reports, in a crowded area of the city 13 residents of Kabul  were martyred as a result of three bombs dropped by a jet  airplane. The raid took place at 0800 this morning. As a  result, three shops were damaged.    According to an authentic source, strong words were  exchanged  two days ago between Golboddin and Dostam in a radio  conversation, and militia's scandalous defeat in Kabul has been  considered its real reason.    In the course of a face-to-face battle, six foreign citizens  were killed and seven others have been captured. A BIA  correspondent who had personally spoken to the prisoners  reported to us that the prisoners were taken by mojahedin in the  area of Kara-e Naw. Despite the fact that senior state  authorities have spoken about the existence of foreign citizens,  and the Islamic army reported their capture, this is the first  time that reporters have been allowed to see the prisoners and  to photograph them. The prisoners have given their names as  follows: Naddem Shahzad, from Mianbagh in Punjab; Sayed Ahmad,  from Punjab; Mohammad Aziz, from Sailkot in Punjab; Farhatnur,  from Multan; Abed Saleem, from Karachi; Jawed Akhtar, from  Peshawar; Bahram Khan, from Peshawar. Nadeem Shahzad says that  he has lost six of his friends in the course of the battle whose  bodies were left in the battlefield.</p>

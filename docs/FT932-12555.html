			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Scottish industry raises confidence SCOTTISH INDUSTRY has seen the biggest improvement in confidence for five years, according to the CBI's industrial trends survey, accompanied by an improvement in export orders and export deliveries. The survey of 134 companies showed a balance of 12 per cent more optimistic than they were four months ago. This compares with the 31 per cent balance for the UK as a whole and suggests that Scottish manufacturers are more cautious than their counterparts in England and Wales. Scottish manufacturers also reported a further fall in orders and output in the first four months of 1993, against expectations of a small rise, although the rate of deline was the smallest since 1990. Mr John Ward, vice-chairman of the CBI in Scotland, said that in spite of the improved export performance, future export prospects were tempered by the weakening of markets in continental Europe, especially in Germany. Europe was the traditional destination of 60 per cent of Scottish exports. He said there were signs of a marked slowdown in unit cost increases with better prospects for more competitive prices, especially in export markets. Scottish manufacturers are continuing to reduce planned investment for the year ahead with a higher proportion of Scottish businesses than in the UK as a whole saying they will cut investment. Labour shedding has continued at a considerable rate in the past four months.</p>

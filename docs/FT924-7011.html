			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Steady close after an erratic session FRESH reminders of the recessionary pressures on the UK economy combined with tremors in the Hong Kong stock market to keep equities depressed in London yesterday. Losses in share prices were minimal, however, and any stock on offer was readily taken up. The London market was unsettled by the fall of around 3 per cent in Hong Kong equities following disturbing comments by a visiting Chinese vice-premier, and by equity market setbacks both in Tokyo and New York. However, UK equities rallied from an early fall of 12 points on the FT-SE scale, helped by steadiness in the pound and government bonds and by a more favourable trend at the EC talks ahead of the next round of GATT negotiations. Equities moved upwards at mid-session to show a gain of 7.1, putting the Footsie just above 2,686 for its best reading of the day, before turning to face a batch of statistics on the domestic economy. A brief improvement in stock index futures helped push the blue chips ahead. However, support faded later. By the close, the FT-SE Index had slipped back to 2,679, for a net loss of 0.4 on the day; support for the second line stocks was disclosed by a 2.3 gain in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. Traders saw London's performance as 'highly creditable' against the nervous background of other global markets. Seaq volume improved to 480.4m shares from the 434.2m of the previous day but remained short of the average daily totals of the past nine weeks. Monday's retail business was worth only Pounds 717, barely two thirds of the daily business levels recorded since mid-September. The latest survey of distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), published in yesterday morning's UK press, indicated that high street sales had failed to sustain the momentum seen in September, immediately following the pound's exit from the European exchange rate network. But stores shares edged higher, focusing on the implications of last week's further cut in base rates and the hope of a further reduction in the new year. The CBI report provides a curtain raiser for the official retail sales figures for October, due today. Neither the unemployment numbers for the October quarter nor the Pounds 1.78bn Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) for last month gave much support for the equity market, although both were regarded as little more than confirmation of known trends. Nervousness over the outlook for the PSBR next year continued to hover in the background. The mixed trend in price movements in leading stocks indicated that the institutions had been shuffling their portfolios, trimming some holdings and increasing others, rather than making significant changes in long term investment commitments. Successful fund managers have seen portfolios perform strongly during October. Some strategists believe that this will prove to be the theme of the stock market until after Christmas, when equity investors will begin to look for the next cut in UK base rates. However, James Capel and Nomura Research are two leading houses known to be still taking a bullish view of the near term outlook.</p>

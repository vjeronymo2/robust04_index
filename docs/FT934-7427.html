			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Millwall's lossmaking run continues with Pounds 1.1m deficit MILLWALL, the USM-quoted football company, yesterday continued its lossmaking run with pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.09m for the 12 months to May 31. However, this marked a significant improvement over the comparable deficit of Pounds 3.64m. Millwall, which this year opened a new Pounds 15.5m stadium for its first division team, blamed part of the loss on the last fall-out from its ill-fated foray into the pubs business. It attributed Pounds 300,000 of the loss to the difference between its holding in Leisuretime Inns - previously named Tavern Leisure - and cash realised on disposal. Millwall bought Tavern in 1990 for Pounds 10m, but the chain proved a drain on resources. Mr Reg Burr, chairman, was confident that the company, which has had an unsettled time since its flotation in 1989, had seen the worst. 'We have now turned the corner.' Millwall was floated at 20p a share. Yesterday the shares stood at 3p, a fall of  1/4 p on the day. Turnover was Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 3.38m). On an FRS 3 basis, losses per share were reduced from 4.47p to 0.68p. Again there was no dividend. Profits on the transfer of players were little changed at Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 1.07m). The value of Millwall's assets are far in excess of its market capitalisation, which stands at Pounds 9.35m, and persistent rumours have run through the market of a potential bid. But Mr Burr, whose company was earlier this year in failed preliminary talks concerning a cash injection, said he had had no approaches.</p>

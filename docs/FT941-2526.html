			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Palestinians expected to join resumed Middle East peace talks The Palestine Liberation Organisation and three Arab states are expected to resume stalled peace talks with Israel soon, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said in Washington last night. He said Lebanon, Jordan and Syria had agreed to resume talks with Israel next month and this would provide 'a strong impetus' to the PLO to return to the bargaining table and to conclude arrangements for Palestinian self-rule in Jericho and Gaza. The announcement came immediately after the United Nations security council passed a resolution condemning the Hebron massacre and urged an international presence in the region. The PLO had linked resuming negotiations with Israel to passage of the resolution. The PLO abandoned Middle East peace talks last month after an Israeli settler killed about 30 Palestinians at a mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron, saying it wanted the ejection of rightwing settlers and protection for Palestinians. 'There have been intensive Israel-Palestinian contacts at the highest levels today including a telephone call between prime minister Rabin and chairman Arafat,' Mr Christopher said. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, is expected to meet Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, in Cairo early next week in an attempt to clear the way for a resumption of negotiations on Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories. Mr Peres said yesterday he planned to discuss with Mr Arafat ways to speed up the implementation of the 'Gaza-and-Jericho first' autonomy. Israel's meeting with PLO representatives would focus on security measures in the West Bank and the likely resumption of full-scale peace negotiations. US Middle East co-ordinator Mr Dennis Ross would be travelling to the region 'in the next few days for additional consultations with the parties'. In Israel, speculation intensified yesterday that the government was considering evacuating some of the settler enclaves in the heart of Hebron.</p>

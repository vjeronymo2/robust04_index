			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary </F> Achille Occhetto by Alberto Leiss in Rome; date not given: "And  Now"]    [Text] Just back from Strasbourg, where he repeated his  proposal to Martinazzoli for an possible accord between the  progressive forces and the new People's Party (if he is really  capable of opting for the left) on a joint election and  government platform, and on the point of leaving for the  Refounded Communist Party conference, Achille runs over the  situation to date, on the eve of the election campaign that will  be crucial to the history of the republic. He emphasizes the  three new fundamental factors that have appeared recently on the  scene, all of them, he adds, are goals "that we have worked  toward and that we have all gone out to achieve." The first is  the dissolution of parliament following the referendum and the  new electoral system, and the beginning of the "new political  and institutional phase in the life of our democracy, which is  one of the fundamental aspects of the birth of the PDS," a "new  phase in the reublic, with the arrival on the scene of new  alliances and the end of the political parties that featured in  the first republic." The second novelty is the "perfect timing"  with which the progressive alliance appeared at the end of the  legislature. Occhetto sees in this political event "the  signature of the constituent phase that we have spoken about so  often in the last few years, imagining that it would not have  been possible to give an advance indication of the subjects that  would have taken part." The third determining event is the end  of the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. Another consequence of  the fall of the Berlin Wall, and a confirmation of forecasts  that the breakup of the old DC would have occurred. "The moment  of truth for Catholic politicians," added Occhetto, "came closer  and closer...."    [Leiss] Let us start from here. In response to your aperture  toward Martinazzoli, the Catholic philosopher and member of the  PPI [Italian People's Party] Rocco Buttiglione has accused the  PDS of wanting to reconstruct the "associationistic system that  created Tangentopoli [the kickback scandal]." How do you judge  this response?    [Occhetto] I find it very curious. It comes from a certain  confusion of ideas that I did not expect to see in a man whose  ideas I have always valued. As well as his thesis on the need  to create a bipolar system, with the church placing itself over  and above the alternatives, thereby giving the Catholics freedom  of choice between the progressives and the conservatives. I am  continuing to move in this sense. I would therefore invite  Buttiglione to reexamine his judgement more calmly and with  knowledge of the facts. I do not see what associationism there  is in asking, before the crisis of the grab-all DC party and its  need to branch out into two elements -- one looking toward the  right and the other that should be looking toward the left --  the People's party, or rather the Catholics who have been all  involved in politics in the DC to date, to choose to govern with  the right or the left. I do not see any associationism in a  left-wing party leader hoping that Catholic forces will choose  to govern in a transparent manner with the left. Instead  associationism was represented by the existence of a party that  consisted of center, right, and left, and that was associated in  governing a country strongly occupied by satellite forces.    [Leiss] But are your not afraid that Segni will drag  Martinazzoli into an accord with the [Northern] League? The  meeting between the referendum leader [Segni] and Maroni of the  League has already been set for Monday....    [Occhetto] I have not given the People's Party a blank  check.  My reasoning is very much based on the fact that the People's  party must reclaim itself -- not so much as far as votes are  concerned -- but by really abandoning all the compromises with  the old political order if it is to to govern with the  progressives. I am not only referring to those who are under  investigation, but to the moving forces of a phase of the  republic, a direct expression of the occupation of the State and  of associationism. Then what is needed is a distinct clarity  regarding the alliances of the other side, not ambiguity.  Instead I see the People's Party trying to save the "grab-all"  aspect, to keep people like Mattarella and Rosy Bindi who are  looking left together, and those who are making eyes at Segni,  who in turn, is making eyes at Bossi and Berlusconi through a  third party. This would end up disguising the same problem.  That of a party that wants to contiue to keep its hands free.  This would worry me if I were Buttiglione.    [Leiss] Well then, are you afraid that in the end, as  Giorgio  Galli says, after the elections the various fragments of the  Catholic political world currently on the scene will reconstruct  the moderate politics of the old DC?    [Occhetto] They can try to form a center to invite the left  to an associationist solution. But we will oppose this and we  will fight to win a majority for the progressives.    [Leiss] But why is it still difficult to expect Martinazzoli  to make a statement before the elections, thereby revealing his  right side and opening up a hemorrhage of votes that could be  lethal for the PPI....    [Occhetto] But then Martinazzoli would have to play the  role of the force that is not forging alliances with anybody  right to the end. From a moral point of view it would be an  important decision but one that he could regret. I have  appreciated and continue to appreciate his no to the League and  to Berlusconi. But I also see the risk of unproductiveness as  far as providing a response to the problems of the country is  concerned. In an system that is no longer associationist and in  which things are done openly before the citizens, if Catholic  citizens consider being able to govern with the left a value,  and perhaps a historical opportunity, then it is worth loosing  the votes of the right. If, on the contrary, governing with the  moderate is considered to be more important, then it is worth  loosing the votes of the left. In a nutshell Martinazzoli must  give Catholic voters a distinct and clear choice.    [Leiss] Martinazzoli must not take part in right-wing  "orgies." But the leftists are also being criticized for having  created a pole of forces that are very different. Does the  distinction between an electoral accord and a government  agreement under discussion at the "progressive table" clarify  things or confuse them?    [Occhetto] In the current situation, with great extenuating  circumstances over the choices of government for the country,  and with a law that does not allow for a second turn and the  "desistement" mechanism, it is very important for the citizens  to know immediately that they have a valid tool to prevent the  new and the old right-wingers from getting all the seats. And  that a wide range of democratic and leftist forces that have not  been compromised by scandals, that favor development,  solidarity, and work, and that oppose the wild free-trade, have  this objective.    [Leiss] And what about the government platform?    [Occhetto] we have formed a work group to formulate  well-defined and detailed proposals. We feel it is our duty to  undertake the responsibility of defining a clear-cut government  platform for the democratic reconstruction of the country. I  think this is what is expected from us, with the workers,  businsessmen, and the manufacturing sector of the country. And  for this very reason I have scheduled meetings at NATO  headquarters, and with London investors over the coming weeks.  Even Europe is waiting to see what kind of government platform  the Italian progressives can draw up.    [Leiss] What driving ideas will be at the center of the  programs? What will be the opposition to the free trade  manifesto that the right-wingers, despite their divisions and  confusion, are in substance already advancing?    [Occhetto] We intend to take in the proposals that have  already come from the Social Christians, Democractic Alliance,  and the Greens in this phase. The basic driving idea is that  recovery and efficiency can be combined with solidarity, with a  development that takes account of employment and environmental  compatibility. I contest the fact that the other line-up has a  government platform. It seems to me that they are promoting a  free-trade propoganda only to discredit the PDS and the  progressives. These are idealogical banners that no longer have  any meaning.    [Leiss] Let us make an example and play a game. If Occhetto  was prime minister, what proposals would he make to Agnelli and  to the trade unions regarding the Fiat crisis?    [Occhetto] I would try to make the government favor  solutions  like those adopted by Volkswagen in Germany. Or by Olivetti in  Italy. I would propose solidarity contracts. Not mobility lists  [thoses workers who are available for other employment before  final dismissal after 2 years] that fatally become the  precursors of deindustrialization. A more courageous industrial  policy is needed for Italy. It is precisely here that the  difference of the progressive line-up lies. There must be a  strategy for recovery that follows along the lines of what the  Ciampi government has done. But by enrichening this with a new  and original policy on work and employment.    [Leiss] Will the generalized reduction of working hours be a  distinctive feature of the progressives program?    [Occhetto] Yes. But there will have to be two sides to this  policy. The other will consist of innovative choices to create  employment and development. This will be achieved through  program accords and agreed-upon modifications to working hours.  Without forgetting that such a strategy will have to be  compatible in Europe.    [Leiss] The right-wingers are evoking a "Liberty Pole": Is  Segni their strong point as a possible candidate for premier?  How will the progressives react?    [Occhetto] Actually, the first real act of liberty was when  Montanelli was fired using methods that I would call a little  "Rumanian." What a "liberty pole!" As for premiers, if there  were to be direct elections, I think we should first have a sort  of "primary" election. And I would accept the result. But as I  have often repeated, this law does not exist in Italy. In other  European systems the leader of the majority coalition party that  wins the elections is generally assigned this role. In our  situation there is no sense in imitating a nonexistent electoral  system. We must be careful not create contradictions.    [Leiss] Now there is talk of Ciampi no longer being the  progressives' candidate, but the new president of the republic.  You have said that he remains a "democratic reserve for the  country..."    [Occhetto] I do not think anybody said this. Ciampi has  placed himself above the sides even in this final and very  delicate phase of transition. We appreciated this very much.  But in the future, nothing would stop me from independently  providing a list of the best names for a "democratic reserve"  that is important for the country, if I were asked for advice  concerning the composition of the government from the Head of  State.    [Leiss] Regarding the Head of State. In Strasbourg you  referred to an attack, a "plot" against Scalfaro.    [Occhetto] I confirm that an international band is focusing  all its efforts against the Head of State because the president  of the republic has always acted in a coherent and legitimate  matter when facing the problem of Italy's transition. We cannot  question Scalfaro's behavior just because of the questions put  to him by a student, thereby exaggerating the accusations made  by people like Broccoletti, who is at the center of the  degeneration of our political life.    [Leiss] But judicial proceedings are underway. Are there  exceptions?    [Occhetto] No we have always respected the investigations  and  verifications carried out by the courts. We have never made any  exception, for nobody. Accepting unfounded scandals, that are  generated to damage a decisive electoral campaign by resorting  to "plague-spreader" methods as stated in Manozni's "Colonna  Infame" is a different matter.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 6 Jun (NA) -- Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo today emphasized that the trade balance deficit  "is not worrisome," and he based his opinion on the fact that  "the strength of investments and the increase in productivity  that this causes must be taken into account."    The minister said the trade imbalance will create "pressure  from many sectors for us to stop imports," but he made it clear  that the government will not back down from its policy of  opening up. "An increase in exports is the only way to overcome  the deficit," the minister said. "In view of the pressure that  will be applied we are going to act with great impartiality."    The minister made these remarks during a ceremony in which  he  installed Elias Baracat, the new director of the National  Foreign Trade Commission. This new commission was created to  study and follow the behavior of international markets.    Cavallo explained that within this framework, the commission  will have to be prepared "to evaluate unfair competition or  dumping [preceding word in English] that could appear in our  trade and to adopt the necessary measures to make the GATT  agreements prevail."    In this respect, he stated that the new commission must play  "an important role," and he made it clear that "if it is  necessary to apply any type of restrictions it will be to  counterbalance subsidies or dumping [preceding word in English],  but always within the framework of the international agreements  on trade issues signed by Argentina."    It has been reported that Baracat will work under Economy  Vice Minister Carlos Sanchez through the Trade and Investment  Secretariat.    "With this commission we have created a foreign trade  organization that is in line with the countries that have been  successful in this sector of the economy," Cavallo said.</p>

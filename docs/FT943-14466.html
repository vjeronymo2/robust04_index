			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Owners Abroad sees gains for small groups Large tour operators are failing to increase market share through their ownership of travel agency chains, according to Mr Francis Baron, chief executive of the holiday group Owners Abroad. Mr Baron, whose group has financial links with Thomas Cook travel agents, said yesterday that independent tour operators appeared to be gaining an increased share of the overseas package holiday market. While large travel agents were concentrating on selling their parent companies' holidays, they were reluctant to sell those of rival large groups, but happier to sell the holidays of smaller tour operators which did not own travel agent chains. The Office of Fair Trading has been investigating the links between large tour operators and travel agents after complaints from independent companies that they were having difficulty selling their holidays. Thomson, the largest tour operator, owns Lunn Poly, the leading travel retailer. Airtours, the second largest operator, owns Going Places, the second biggest chain. Despite Mr Baron's comments yesterday, he has criticised large tour operators for giving cash payments to staff in their subsidiary travel agents as an inducement to sell their holidays. He has said Owners Abroad's links with Thomas Cook do not provide the same advantages. Mr Baron's remarks came after Owners Abroad surpassed City expectations by reporting a pre-tax loss of Pounds 29.3m for the six months to April 30, down 24 per cent. Holiday companies usually record first-half losses. The group's performance was improved by the acquisition in February of International Travel Holdings, the Canadian tour operator. Owners Abroad previously owned a 25 per cent stake. Canadian holidaymakers tend to take their holidays during the northern hemisphere winter. As UK holidaymakers prefer to travel abroad in the summer, the Canadian acquisition helped to reduce Owners Abroad's winter losses. Mr Baron said that Owners Abroad had substantially regained the market share it lost in the wake of management changes last year. He said that since his appointment last November, the group's share of the summer 1994 market had risen from 9.5 per cent to 11.6 per cent in May. While prices remained competitive, Mr Baron thought a summer price war unlikely. Turnover rose 46 per cent to Pounds 228m. Cash balances increased 39 per cent to Pounds 86.8m. The loss per share fell to 13.8p from 17.4p and the interim dividend is an unchanged 1.4p. Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Friday [18 February] a 10 million yen donation to him  from a salt wholesalers group last August was a "gratuity for  services."    Fujii was replying at the day's session of the House of  Representatives budget committee in response to an opposition  questioner, who pressed him to account for the money from the  Enyu- Kai, an association of salt wholesalers, whose business is  under the supervision of the Finance Ministry.    Fujii said, "the money was a gratuity for my services, as I  retired from a post in the industry association."    The finance minister said he worked for the body "since 1976  or 1977," and that he returned the money "so that it would not  trigger misunderstanding."    The questioner, Takashi Fukaya of the Liberal Democratic  Party, said that Fujii contravened a legal obligation to report  to tax authorities the acceptance of the money "as personal  income."    Fujii earlier said he reported the money as an untaxable  political donation to the Home Affairs Ministry. He said his  two officially registered political fund-raising organizations  received the money last August.    The Enyu-Kai is an affiliate of the Association of Salt  Dealers' Cooperatives, to which Fujii had served as a longtime  adviser. It acts as a "political organization" for salt  wholesalers.    Fujii said, "there is nothing wrong in the fact that money  exchanged hands between these political organizations."    Fujii, now a key figure in Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  spearheaded by Ichiro Ozawa, a chief strategist of the ruling  coalition, was an LDP legislator until last June, when he and  dozens of other LDP lawmakers renounced the scandal-tainted  party to form Shinseito.    The YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the nation's largest-circulating daily,  reported on Tuesday that the industry body gave the donation in  congratulating him on being given the post of finance minister  in a cabinet formation last August.</p>

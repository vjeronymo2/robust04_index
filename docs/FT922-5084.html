			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Moscow sets terms for defence of borders RUSSIA'S defence minister said yesterday that intervention of foreign troops in states adjoining Russia, or the build-up of troops on their borders, would be seen as a direct military threat to Russia. General Pavel Grachev, recently appointed to the top defence post, told a conference in which a number of Nato officials are participating that Russia saw no state or group of states as hostile to it. It would, however, react forcefully to any state which sought regional domination. This definition of Russia's 'sphere of interest' means it sees all of the former Soviet states on its land borders as areas in which it has a right to intervene if it believes they are under threat. These would include the three Baltic states, the western states of Ukraine and Belarus, the Caucasus to the south and the central Asian state of Kazakhstan. This is in spite of the fact that Russia has not concluded a collective security agreement with most of these states. Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia and Azerbaijan, as well as the Baltic states - which are not in the Commonwealth of Independent States - have all refused to sign a security agreement. Ukraine increasingly sees itself as opposed to Russia. General Grachev promised sweeping changes in the Russian army over the next 10 years - including a cut of 700,000 men by 1995 and a further 600,000 cut by the end of the decade. The planned size of the Russian army is 1.3m-1.5m. Mr Viktor Mikhailov, head of the Russian Atomic Ministry, told the same conference that 'nuclear weapons ensure the stability of the world - even today'. He said Russia now controlled 80 per cent of nuclear weapons production facilities of the former Soviet Union - with the remaining 20 per cent confined to ore extraction and processing. The nuclear weapons industry had 140,000 employees - 14 per cent of those employed in the atomic industry as a whole. He said that 15,000 nuclear warheads, or 50 per cent of the former Soviet nuclear potential, would be destroyed. However, this process would take 10 to 15 years and would cost Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn). The heads of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments agreed yesterday that Crimea would remain part of Ukraine but enjoy special economic status, Reuter reports. Itar-Tass news agency said a statement issued after a meeting in Yalta described the Crimean peninsula, once under Russian jurisdiction, as 'an integral part of Ukraine'. The two sides will form a working group by June 5 to continue work on power sharing arrangements.</p>

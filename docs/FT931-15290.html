			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Magistrates move on Craxi charges MILAN magistrates yesterday submitted their request to the Italian parliament to waive immunity on Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, in order for him to face charges of alleged corruption and illegal financing of his party. The magistrates are understood to have listed 22 separate episodes involving Mr Craxi. Most of these relate to alleged kick-backs on public works contracts. The document, running to 118 pages, is far more extensive than those on 13 members of the senate and chamber of deputies involved in the Milan corruption scandal. In previous cases it has taken as long as five months for the process to pass through the two houses of parliament. Mr Craxi was served notice he was under investigation on December 15. But last Friday he was served with a second notice that he was under investigation for two further instances of alleged corruption. Mr Craxi last month declined to step down from the party leadership but is under mounting pressure to do so at a special party congress due to be held before the end of January. The plight of Mr Craxi and the Socialist leadership crisis has raised once again the fate of the four-party coalition government of Mr Giuliano Amato. The Socialists are the principal partners alongside the Christian Democrats in the coalition. Mr Amato has publicly stated he has no wish to head both the government and the party and one compromise being touted is for him to assume the presidency, with Mr Claudio Maretelli, the ambitious justice minister, becoming secretary. This formula could enable the government to stay in office. However, a number of leading opposition politicians including Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), Mr Umberto Bossi of the Lombard League and Mr Girogio La Malfa of the small Republican party have begun to call for a broader-based government. In recent days they have argued that only a government representing all the main political forces has the strength and legitimacy to preside over the introduction of electoral reform, which has now moved to the top of the agenda.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] UN, 6 Apr (PL) -- Cuba, Antigua and Barbuda have  agreed to establish diplomatic ties as of 6 April at the level  of nonresident ambassadors.    Fernando Ramirez De Estenoz, first deputy foreign relations  minister, and Lionel A. Hurst, Antigua and Barbuda permanent UN  representative, signed the agreement on behalf of their  respective governments in a solemn ceremony at the Cuban  permanent mission at the UN.    In a brief speech after the exchange of the corresponding  documents, Ramirez said that this event is a historical moment  for the two countries.    He added that it was not a mere diplomatic ceremony, but a  step forward for the Caribbean peoples.    He pointed out that his country expects to become part of  the  Caribbean commonwealth because of its blood, race, culture,  geographic position, and traditions. Cuba is a Caribbean nation  and gladly joins said community, he said.    Ramirez stressed that this agreement is a modest  contribution  toward the integration of the Caribbean people to ensure that  collectively we will occupy the corresponding place in the  international community.    Meanwhile, Ambassador Hurst emphasized the transformation  process that began in Cuba in 1959 and its biggest achievements  in the fields of sports, health, and education, and its steps to  join the regional commonwealth.    He added that the current step will contribute to peace and  the peoples' self-determination.</p>

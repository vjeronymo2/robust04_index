			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat stocks forecast to fall by 10m tonnes WORLD WHEAT stocks are expected to fall by the end of 1991-92 to 128m tonnes  -10m tonnes less than at the end of last year, according to the latest report from the International Wheat Council. Stocks in the US will fall from 23.6m tonnes to only 10.6m tonnes, the lowest level since 1974. But stocks in Canada are expected to rise by more than 2m tonnes to 12.6m tonnes, the highest since 1980, following the bumper crop last year. EC stocks, already 16.7m tonnes at the start of the year, could soar to a record 22m tonnes, including 14m tonnes in intervention. The main reason behind the projected fall in total stocks has been an increase in expected consumption, now estimated at 569m tonnes. However, this is still below the 575m tonnes consumed last year. Food use is forecast to be 380m tonnes, 8m tonnes higher than last year, while animal feed use of wheat is only 4m tonnes lower at 118m tonnes, in spite of the increased price of wheat compared with feed grains this season. Combined carry over stocks of the five major exporting countries - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the US - will be 47m tonnes at the end of the year, the IWC says. This compares with 54m tonnes last year, but is well above the 38m tonnes seen at the end of 1989-90. South Africa, which is usually an exporter of maize, will have to import this year because of widespread crop failure caused by drought, a senior Maize Board official said, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. The Board's general manager, Hennie Davel, said it was too soon to assess accurately the size of the current crop. He added, however: 'Even if we do have crucial rains, we will still have a deficit. That means we will have to import'.</p>

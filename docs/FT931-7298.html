			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Estate that is no longer safe as houses - The housing bill and the Duke of Westminster NO LANDLORD will be more affected by the Housing and Urban Development Bill than the Duke of Westminster, who owns 100 acres of Mayfair and 200 acres of Belgravia. The new law, likely to receive Royal Assent in the summer, will give leaseholders the right to buy the freeholds on their houses, and will force the Duke of Westminster to sell property that has been in his family for more than 300 years. He views his London estates as the 'jewel in the crown' of his holdings, which include 10,000 acres of agricultural land in Chester, shopping centres round the UK and commercial property throughout North America and Australia. His agricultural estates date back to Norman times, while the London estate dates back to 1677, when 500 acres of poor farm land was given to the Duke's forebear, Sir Thomas Grosvenor, on his marriage. It was gradually developed as Mayfair, Belgravia and Pimlico - the Pimlico estate was sold in 1953. The Duke has described his land holdings as his family heritage. 'History undoubtedly classifies the Grosvenor family as landowners,' he says. Sir George Young, the housing minister, has described the bill, which has just passed its second reading in the House of Lords, as 'an essential part of our policy on extending home ownership.' It has been enthusiastically welcomed by leaseholders who believe it will tackle problems associated with bad management of blocks of flats and the difficulties of selling shorter leases, which cannot attract mortgage finance. The legislation is particularly welcomed by leaseholders of more valuable houses with a rateable value more than Pounds 1500 in London. They were excluded from the Leasehold Reform Act of 1967 (which gave most householders the right to enfranchise) after heavy lobbying from large landowners, but will be embraced by the new legislation. But the legislation is bitterly resented by large landowners, who see it as an arbitrary transfer of property from one section of the community to another. The Duke of Westminster considers that he will not be adequately compensated for the forced sale of his property, since he will split the 'marriage value' (the gain in a property's value from putting the leasehold and freehold together) with the leaseholder. He estimates that some leaseholders will gain up to Pounds 250,000 by enfranchising. The Duke says there is principle as well as money at stake. The Grosvenor Estate says that the proposals are 'a massive infringement of two long-standing democratic principles' - the right of a private citizen to own and enjoy private property and the right to uphold contracts freely entered into.' The Grosvenor Estate also claims that the new legislation will damage the appearance of one of the most prestigious parts of London, which owes its appearance to its scrupulous estate management. 'We are concerned about the loss of uniform management, the control and enhancement of the urban environment and the broader benefits to a community an estate like ours should bring,' he said last month. The Duke of Westminster's dramatic resignation from the Conservative party is not the first high-profile protest he has made against the principle of leasehold enfranchisement. The first stemmed from the 1967 Leasehold Enfranchisement Act, which resulted in the sale of 80 houses at a loss of Pounds 2.5m to the Grosvenor Estate. The forced sale (or 'confiscation' as he put it) of these properties drove the Duke to take a case against the government to the European Court of Human Rights. However, in 1986 the Court found against the Grosvenor Estate. 'The compulsory transfer of property from one individual to another might constitute a legitimate means for promoting the public interest,' it said. This left the Duke unconvinced. Speaking last month about leasehold enfranchisement, he said: 'The implications of this legislation are fundamental in a country which has no written constitution and relies on Parliamentary precedent - because this law interferes with basic liberties it should send shivers down all our spines.'</p>

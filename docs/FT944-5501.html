			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Five held in Pounds 30m fraud probe A Barclays Bank official was among five people arrested yesterday as part of a large fraud investigation, Jimmy Burns and John Mason write. Police said yesterday that they believed they had foiled a massive international fraud straddling UK and foreign banks which could have involved more than Pounds 30m. The Barclays Bank official worked as a business-centre manager in Derby, where the bank has one of its largest regional branches. Four other people arrested in London and Kent did not work for Barclays but were described by police as having 'extensive banking expertise'. Barclays said last night that the bank had worked closely with the police investigation and was 'delighted' with the apparent success of the anti-fraud operation. The bank stressed that the fraud had been prevented and that therefore no customers had been affected.</p>

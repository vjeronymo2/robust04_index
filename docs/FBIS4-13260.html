			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F> Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the  Yemeni Socialist Party, by Tawfiq Jazulit; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Jazulit] Brother Salim Salih Muhammad: We talk to  you, as YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] secretary general and  member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, when Yemeni unity is  experiencing a stifling crisis. That is why I want this  dialogue to be frank. We hope we can learn what goes on in the  mind of the YSP leadership. As you know, Yemen has just seen  the Salalah meeting. Some believe it failed. Why did that  meeting fail?    [Muhammad] Welcome to you and to MBC, which is putting  Yemen's worries in front of the Yemenis and Arabs. The Yemeni  issue interests not only the Yemenis, but all the Arabs and the  world. This is due to what Yemen stands for and to its location  in addition to the issue of unity and how to achieve it. This  is a pan-Arab and national goal. Unity was peacefully,  voluntarily, and democratically achieved in an approach contrary  to that which was hitherto pursued and that believed that Yemeni  unity could only be achieved through war.    We appreciate the feelings of our Arab nation, our friends,  and our people. We must be frank when it comes to presenting  the issues, hardships, and challenges the process of unity is  encountering.    Everybody followed up the signing of the Pledge and Accord  Document and the political dialogues held earlier to create it.  There were domestic, Arab, and friendly efforts that helped  Yemen, its parties, and its political mentality to work out that  document.    This document stands for the collective aspiration common to  all parties and categories in Yemen today. Everyone is  convinced of its stipulations, although some are opposed to it  or have some reservations about it. But it represents the  national program, which everybody tries to implement in his own  way. That is why there were various interpretations,  particularly after the document was signed in fraternal Jordan,  and why difficulties were encountered during that meeting.    There were efforts to arrange a meeting between the brother  president and his vice president to halt the military  developments that ensued, most notably on the day the document  was signed. These developments have become the primary issues;  they take priority over the issues specified by the document.  The first issue in that document was the security problem,  which has lately experienced many developments. This issue has  not been tackled. Hence the Salalah meeting.    I can frankly say that the phrasing was not carried out in  the desired manner. There was no paper specifying the nature  and agenda of the meeting. We hoped the meeting would be held  to halt military developments, eliminate barriers and, thus,  reverse any development leading to [word indistinct] in Yemen.    [Jazulit] There are questions regarding implementation of  the Pledge and Accord Document that you all signed in Amman.  The opposition accuses the YSP of resorting to particular  political tactics to avoid signing and implementing it. This  stance is clear in one case: An agreement was reached within  the framework of the national dialogue committee to attend--in  your capacity as a member of the Presidential Council--a meeting  of the Presidential Council in Sanaa at the same time as a  Cabinet meeting in Aden chaired by Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. You  agreed to attend the meeting but then you changed your mind.  This seemed to be the reason for [words indistinct]. What are  the real reasons for not responding to the national dialogue  committee decision regarding your meeting in Sanaa?    [Muhammad] It is a Yemeni characteristic that sometimes, the  opposition and the authorities agree fully or differ to the  point of [word indistinct]. Our party has good relations with  the opposition political parties. Our party was the first to  raise the idea of broadening the political dialogue. You may  remember that the parties of the coalition insisted on solving  their problems within the framework of the ruling coalition.  Our party broached this idea to expand the dialogue and  political and popular participation in this committee. The  opposition joined this committee. We made a decision that any  agreement reached by this committee would be binding [words  indistinct]. When we attended the Amman meeting, which was  attended by Jordanian brothers, notably His Majesty King Husayn,  the Yemeni president and vice president, and the opposition  parties, of whom I remember Shaykh [name indistinct], Shaykh  Mujhid Abu-Shawarib, and the Reform Grouping secretary general  [sentence incomplete as heard] At this one meeting, which  failed, the YSP proposed a working paper relating to the  Document of Pledge and Accord to implement it according to a  timetable and mechanism. The working paper was rejected by our  brothers in the General People's Congress. So we differed and  afterward the paper was submitted to the national dialogue  committee. This paper includes interrelated issues. At its  meeting in Aden, the national dialogue committee approved every  measure relating to security. The committee formulated its  views and submitted its recommendations. Afterward, when the  committee discussed merging the institutions, it automatically  approved my attending the Presidential Council meeting. I  received no agenda, although discussion of the document should  be instructed by the Council of Ministers. The main issue for  us was implementation of the document. We believe the security  issue is the main thing and the practical approach to  normalizing (?relations). If this issue is settled, then the  institutions in both parts of Yemen can be merged and things  will return to normal. But this has not materialized. You hear  daily that security is worrisome, particularly in the capital.  There is indeed a need for intensive and bold efforts to help  us normalize security. First, we must hand over the personnel  who disturbed security and those who stand behind them to the  judiciary to issue its verdict. This issue relates to the  normalization of relations. The situation in the establishment  charged with security must be corrected. If not, this  establishment will not help to restore security. As things  stand, this establishment cannot perform its duty. We can  attend any meeting and participate in any effort to address this  issue. Otherwise the situation will remain the same [words  indistinct] and ignore the document.    [Jazulit] So as far as you are concerned, the current  security situation is a barrier to realizing unity as stipulated  by the Amman agreement. Some believe the situation the Yemenis  are experiencing has nothing to do with unity. First, your  party leadership sits in Aden. You have left Sanaa, the  capital. You have not united either the Army or the currency.  So you are not experiencing unity, but division, which has  become a fait accompli. What is left of this unity?    [Muhammad] The only thing left is popular unity. There is  movement between the two parts. But I agree with you that the  army is divided and that there are two currencies, two capitals,  and two administrations. These are the conditions that prompted  us to review the course of our unity. This is the suffering  that has made us propose 18 points, participate in formulating  the document effectively, and attempt to present the issues of  the people. We do not know what sort of unity we are in. Some  propose that we must formulate a merger unity. We believe the  situation needs to be rectified and reviewed. This is why we  have tried very hard to have the Pledge and Accord Document  contain all the issues that lead to rectifying this course.  This is a course that has not made us feel unity, except in the  united anthem and flag, and sometimes in the united  representation in the [word indistinct]. This is why the  document must be implemented. We know time will not help us.  The crisis will create harsh conditions if it continues too  long, like this. [words indistinct] I personally believe that  things will become even more complicated.    [Jazulit] Within the framework of the negative repercussions  of unity in Yemen, you, the leadership of the YSP in Aden,  suspect that religious extremism will increase. Do you not  believe your party is responsible for the failure of unity in  Yemen, as is the GPC [General People's Congress], which was your  ally in making the unity decision between the two parts, the  north and the south. The failure of your party and the GPC  dissatisfied the Yemeni people. It also helped to develop  extremism in Yemen. How could you reconcile between the process  of solving the unity problem in Yemen and confronting extremism,  as you called it, while you are the ones responsible for this  problem?    [Muhammad] Our party is undoubtedly responsible  historically,  whether in working to establish unity among the Yemeni people or  in the failure of this unity. Undoubtedly, our party is a  partner and participant in this historic process. But the truth  that has been confirmed by fact--and no one can refute it--is  that the party has played its role in trying to preserve this  unity. It presented a great deal. In my evaluation, there is  no party in power in this day and age, according to my modest  information, that pays daily, in martyrs and dead from among its  cadres and leaders, while acting as an essential participant in  power. It enjoys leadership in the Army and the Administration.  This party can also do the same things. But the party has  categorically stated that going down such a route is fatal and  cannot solve problems. This is why we have tried, since unity  was established, not to be dragged into this conflict.    Of course, some sides may have felt the party was weak. They  played some [word indistinct] cards. They thought these cards  could realize greater gains for them, not only in dissolving the  unity of the party, but also in weakening the relationship  between the party and its supporters. So they started resorting  to various methods, which I do not have the time to explain in  detail here. In general, I believe that in light of the  circumstances of Yemen and our limited potential, we have done  everything within our means to maintain unity and allow it to  succeed. We have done everything to start the course of  democracy, which is the new phenomenon in our life, whether with  regard to Yemen or the Arab region.    Proceeding from this, I believe that dialogue with the  Reform  Grouping is one of the issues that concern the party. We  believed that through this course and our attempts to gather all  the political currents and set aside all their programs, views,  and differences, we could, in light of the situation in Yemen,  the unity, and the people's aspirations, create what we have  called the Yemeni character, the Yemeni edition. This consists  of making the left, the right, and the center start united  coalition action [words indistinct]. We have tried to learn  from the Algerian lesson. We have tried to learn from our  mistakes. We have also tried to do something new that can be  added to the unity and democracy process we have started.  Unfortunately, there are some mentalities that are below such  levels of thinking. They have harmed unity, democracy, and the  outstretched hands. They started adopting two kinds of  terrorism: physical terrorism represented in cutting off roads,  killing people, and creating a state of terrorism and mental  terrorism, judging people as heretics and issuing fatwas on  agents, as well as resorting to the mind-set of the sixties and  seventies, which consists of falsely accusing others if they do  not agree with their opinion.    Thus, we bear our responsibility toward rectifying the  situation and toward the mistakes and emotions affecting us in  realizing unity quickly and without any settling of accounts.  We went to Sanaa with one thing in mind--that the others are of  a particular standard. But time has proven that this standard,  unfortunately, is not there.    [Jazulit] A trend within your party says that YSP Secretary  General 'Ali Salim al-Bid unilaterally decided to go ahead with  the unification process. This same trend is now opposing the  continuation of unity saying that the circumstances are still  not right. How influential is this trend within the YSP?    [Muhammad] We are a real party, one that interacts with its  members and leaders. Any decision is made through the party's  institutions ...    [Jazulit, interrupting] Is it true that al-Bid made the  unity  decision unilaterally?    [Muhammad] It was not a unilateral decision. As you know,  unity was one of the party's concerns and strategic issues when  it was in power in the south. The same applied to the other  part in the north [words indistinct]. Our leadership was  united. For us, unity will remain a fateful issue. But what  kind of unity do we want? The YSP formed a team that continued  to study the issue for one year. The team made recommendations  and proposals regarding unity. It offered several options,  including a federation and a confederation. But developments  and circumstances dictated that policy, namely, that we sign the  30 November agreement and adopt the existing Constitution, which  we are still adopting. The YSP secretary general made no  unilateral decision, as some people are claiming; the decision  was made through consultations with the leadership--the  Political Bureau [words indistinct], and the Central Committee.  I remember that day when brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  came to Aden and was received by brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The  Central Committee of our party was in session and we were  discussing that particular subject. We in the YSP make no  unilateral decisions; we always refer to the party's  institutions when we make fateful and important decisions.    [Jazulit] You did not answer the essence of my question,  brother Salim Salih Muhammad. There is undoubtedly a trend  within your party saying that unity cannot continue because the  circumstances are not ripe. How strong is this trend on the  level of the leadership, the cadres, and the members of the  party?    [Muhammad] I am not exaggerating if I say that our situation  has never been better as far as trends, wings, and blocs are  concerned. We are now in agreement on national issues more than  ever. We have no trends against these issues, among the  leaders, or the base. But opinions are expressed by this person  or that or this group of brothers or that. Now we are expanding  democracy in the life of the party and society. We are dealing  with things through dialogue and we make decisions through  dialogue. What is happening now is that some people are  proposing rectifying unity's course. They express their views  and we discuss them within the framework of the party's  institutions. These days, we are discussing a host of issues in  the Central Committee. We are trying to find the right thing  and convince each other about the best formula the party should  offer and deal with [words indistinct]. We must not restrict  ourselves or reject opposing views regarding these issues  because we do not want to repeat past mistakes. We, therefore,  accommodate this [word indistinct] and do not have trends in the  old sense of the word, that is, that a particular trend has a  particular opinion and will triumph and the other trend will  lose. All the trends must coexist within dialogue to formulate  the right position for the party.    [Jazulit] Arab mediation has been expanding. What is the  essence of this mediation?    [Muhammad] From the beginning, we have welcomed every  initiative by our Arab brothers. We deal with this mediation.  At first, the Jordanian and Omani brothers helped, whether  through the military committee or the political dialogue. The  initiatives produced the known results. I would like to thank  the Omani and Jordanian brothers and also the friends, whether  [words indistinct] for their role in defusing tension and  calming the military situation. But the crisis was  oversimplified, and this is perhaps what foiled the meetings and  efforts. We insist on an intensive Arab role. We do not feel  shy about saying that the brothers in Saudi Arabia are concerned  with Yemen's developments, and we ask for their help. The  brothers in Oman, the Gulf states, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and all  Arab countries are also concerned. Yemen is part of the region,  and what happens here concerns the Arab brothers. Arab efforts  should be effectively redoubled, first, to prevent a civil war  that would have dire consequences for the Yemeni people and  unity [word indistinct], and second, to help normalize the  situation. The security issue is integrated: Yemen is facing  an organized international terrorism practiced by the  international fundamentalist movement, which has its centers and  sources of finance. So what happens in Yemen does not concern  Yemen alone. [Words indistinct] Yemen began to export some  trouble to fraternal and friendly countries.    [Jazulit] In view of the unity crisis and its  complications, some alternatives have been proposed. I remember  that when the crisis started you proposed the alternative of  federalism. This option was strongly opposed by the GPC and the  Islamic Reform Grouping. Now you are again proposing  federalism. Where does federalism stand now as an alternative to  the Yemeni crisis?    [Muhammad] This idea should have been discussed. When we  proposed this idea, before the document was signed, it was  supposed to be an alternative that could have been discussed.  When I was asked about it, I said that we are ready and willing  to discuss any alternative that could rectify the course of the  country and the situation in it, including the issue of  federalism. Of course, the thinking prevalent among the older  generations is fixed in many ways. If there is a warning or  statement that does not agree with the accepted concepts  imprinted in the Arab political mind, they will automatically  reject it and categorize it into different things. Therefore,  this idea was buried right from the start. We know that the  document [word indistinct] addressed some 70-80 percent of this  issue in my estimation ...    [Jazulit, interrupting] What do you mean? How come?    [Muhammad] The document addresses the issue of provinces for  local government. In Yemen, we could have anywhere between four  and seven provinces. They have full powers, except for judicial  authority and nominating portfolios for the Cabinet. The  federal situation or the known unity conditions--I do not want  to delve into detailed explanations; I will neglect its legal  aspects and the characteristics that could [words  indistinct]--led us to understand that there will be local  governments. There is also a general framework for maintaining  the sovereignty of the homeland, Yemeni patriotism, the united  economy, and legislation. There are all these issues. We are  really trying to strengthen this unity as we explained at the  beginning of the interview and to clarify its various aspects.  It is truly regrettable. The document was set out and now, as  a party, we are proposing that the real introduction to  realizing this goal is possibly local government and [words  indistinct]. As I said, the inherent contents of this document  are the federal unity that we proposed.    [Jazulit] Let us go back to the beginning of the crisis. The  Amman summit failed. Then the Salalah meeting failed. There  are preparations now for a summit that might convene in Cairo  during the coming few weeks. Has a date been set for this  meeting or for such a summit?    [Muhammad] There is no invitation to such a meeting or  summit. But there are calm and important preparations to avoid  making the same mistake as previous preparation, such as in  Amman and [word indistinct].    [Jazulit] Is there a bilateral agreement between the YSP and  the GPC over points on which to agree before going to Cairo so  that you do not fall into the same trap you fell into in Amman,  for example?    [Muhammad] We feel that the Egyptian and the United Arab  Emirates [UAE] roles, as well as the Arab role, despite [words  indistinct] political presence, and even though some Arab  countries rule out implementation of any decisions--the Arab  role has clearly tried to politically support the Egyptian and  UAE roles--have been trying from the beginning to diagnose the  issues. At the same time, they work on proposing solutions and  preparing for a meeting that will really be a success. We  believe this is good work.    [Jazulit] You continue to ask the Arab countries in general  to work on salvaging what can be salvaged from Yemeni unity.  This is something you have confirmed often. What are the  concessions that the YSP could make to guarantee the  continuation of unity and its success? We mean building the  structures of unity. You must make some concessions if you  really want unity. What are the concessions that you might make  if you go to Cairo for a meeting?    [Muhammad] Our party has made every possible concession,  especially big concessions. It abandoned power; it went to  Sanaa.    [Jazulit] But you are still in power.    [Muhammad] What power are you talking about ...    [Jazulit] You, in Aden, are still in power, as is the  president in Sanaa.    [Muhammad] You know the situation we are in. All those  inside and outside Yemen know our situation. Our party, as I  said, might have worked and sacrificed for the big aim or it  might have committed a naive political act. But all this is not  very important. We are very ready to make concessions and to  have a new government for example. We are ready to work to  rectify issues. We are ready to concede our right as  individuals or a party but we cannot make concessions over  issues that define the fate of unity and the future of the  generations. This is a matter over which we can make no  concessions. If we made any concessions over it, we would be  abandoning our credibility toward our people, our friends, and  everyone.    [Jazulit] Do you believe that the awaited Cairo summit could  yield some positive results if you make use of the negative  aspects of the Amman and Salalah summits?    [Muhammad] There are efforts we appreciate a great deal. We  address them and interact with them, not just on our level. We  also try to exchange trust with other parties so as to render  these Arab efforts a success. I believe the Egyptian and other  brothers now have a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the  crisis. They could help Yemen overcome the stage of fighting as  a first step. After that, we need to work jointly with everyone  and all the parties to bury such thinking. Second, we can start  rectifying the course of unity, which would calm the various  parties.    [Jazulit] We thank you for this meeting.</p>

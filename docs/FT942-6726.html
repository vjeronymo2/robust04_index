			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Court allows Parker bid for Bridge Oil An Australian court ruled yesterday that Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texas-based oil and gas producer, should be allowed to proceed with its ADollars 294m (USDollars 211.5m) bid for Sydney's Bridge Oil. The ruling permits P&amp;P to present its formal 'part A' takeover statement to Bridge shareholders. After hearings this week in the New South Wales Supreme Court, Mr Justice Windeyer determined that the bid was not invalid, although he also said the bidder should issue a supplementary statement to accompany the 'part A' documents. Lawyers for the target company had argued that P&amp;P's takeover documents should be scrapped and the offer redrafted. The cash bid, the latest in a series of moves which have indicated a growing interest on the part of US energy exploration groups in the Australian market, is pitched at 70 cents a share. This has been firmly rejected by the Bridge board.</p>

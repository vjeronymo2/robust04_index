Asked why Kiev decided to deactivate the weapons, he said  there was no reason to try to keep on combat duty a missile  which Ukraine could not and was not going to use anyway.    Tarasyuk said different options were being discussed by  negotiators from Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. on how to  compensate for the transfer of nuclear weapons to Russia.  However, he declined to comment on a reaction from Russia and  the United States to Kiev's proposal to reduce its debt to  Moscow at the cost of tactical nuclear weapons.    Tarasyuk does not rule that Moscow and Washington have  agreed  to talk with Ukraine following the process of deactivating its  nuclear weapons. But he gave no evidence to back his theory.    The minister stressed that the Ukrainian government would do  its utmost to lift the strings attached by the Supreme Soviet  while ratifying the Start-1 agreement.    Tarasyuk denied allegations of Ukrainian weapons exports to  countries falling under the U.N. arms embargo such as Libya,  Iraq, South Africa, and the former Yugoslavia. However, he said  there were a number of incidents of weapons transfers to such  countries and areas of conflict by go-between companies. The  minister admitted to mistakes made in the transfer of dual  purpose technologies. However, he said Kiev had at one time  intervened to prevent the transfer of chemical fuel for missiles  to Libya.</p>

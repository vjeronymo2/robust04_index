			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Retailers of fitness products face legal fight with franchiser Former retail franchisees of Weider Health &amp; Fitness, a subsidiary of the US fitness and bodybuilding products group, are engaged in a legal battle with the company. Six former franchisees, running nine stores in England and Scotland, terminated their contracts with Weider last year and changed the names of their shops to Work-Out World. They said Weider had broken a verbal agreement not to supply goods to other retailers, leaving them unable to compete. Weider withdrew an application for a High Court injunction last month to stop the franchisees from trading, on the grounds of breach of contract. But the company is now suing the franchisees for 'conspiracy to take away Weider's business'. The franchisees have been told the legal action is likely to continue even though Weider's UK retail business was recently sold to a group run by former Weider employees. Three franchisees travelled to the US 10 days ago, where they secured a promise from Mr Ben Weider, president of the International Federation of Bodybuilders and younger brother of the group's founder, former bodybuilder Mr Joe Weider, to investigate the case. Weider UK refused to comment. The franchisees say that when they entered their agreements in the late 1980s they had a verbal, though not written, commitment from Weider that it would not supply its products to any other retailer, except for a limited range at Argos, the catalogue retailer. About 2 1/2 years ago, however, they found an increasing number of other retail outlets being supplied with Weider goods. As franchisees had to pay Weider 10 per cent royalties on all goods - including non-Weider goods - sold, they say they could not compete with other retailers on price. Five franchisees claim to have gone bankrupt as a result. One franchisee, who asked not to be named, said: 'When I went into this business I was a layman. My understanding was that the term franchisee implied something with trade exclusivity.' The retailer said his weekly turnover fell from up to Pounds 7,000 a week to between Pounds 3,000 and Pounds 3,500 after Weider goods began being stocked by other retailers. He added that even before this, after paying Weider Pounds 50,000 royalties out of his Pounds 500,000 annual turnover, he was left with a profit of only Pounds 9,000. The rebel franchisees say that while their contracts with Weider prevented them from trading in the same area for two years after termination of the contract, they had received legal advice suggesting this was not enforceable. They say they no longer sell Weider goods, and have changed their product mix to include swimwear and athletic wear. They add that there is no question of a 'conspiracy' to take business from Weider.</p>

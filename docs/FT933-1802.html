Claudio Aranzadi, former industry minister and Solchaga acolyte, has been parcelled off for an unstressful few years as Spain's representative to the OECD in Paris. JJ Ruiz, the former assistant economy secretary, is now head of research with Argentaria, the pool of state owned banks. Jaime Gaiteiro, former chief of the revenue service, is now running the national mint, while Antonio Zabalza, the former finance secretary, is chief of staff in the prime minister's office. But Pedro Perez, Solchaga's amiable deputy, has been waiting for something to come up since the June election.

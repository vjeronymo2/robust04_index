			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING ON FIRED WORKERS' SUITS  </P> <P> Pared to essentials, the California Supreme Court decision in the Foley case  ("Justices Limit Damages in Fired Workers' Suits," Part I, Dec. 30) says to  fired employees:  </P> <P> 1. You still can sue and collect punitive damages from an employer who fires  you because you "whistle-blow," won't break a law or take some other action  that benefits the public at large.  </P> <P> 2. You don't need a written contract to sue an ex-employer for failing to keep  promises, whether they're express or implied, but your damages will be limited  to back pay or reinstatement.  </P> <P> Wrongful termination still lives in the law, even though the court has refused  to protect employees from "bad faith" contract abuse. That's reserved only for  those who sue insurance companies.  </P> <P> WILLIAM F. DWYER II  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Observer: Down and out Calling all those with next June's G7 summit pencilled in to the diary. Book now to avoid disappointment. The powers-that-be have just twigged that the picturesque but sleepy city of Halifax, Nova Scotia (population 300,000) cannot possibly accommodate those thousands of officials, journalists and assorted hangers-on who grace these lavish jamborees. Having jettisoned the notion of using vacationing students' empty digs to house the overflow, members of the Canadian organising committee are now hastily calling up the big cruise lines. Any chance of piloting a luxury vessel or two from the Med or the Caribbean up into Halifax's - notoriously polluted - harbour? Well, not much, actually. The reaction to date has been remarkably cool. Either the budget even for a G7 jolly will not stretch - or else the cruise operators can think of better ways to market themselves than filling their cabins with squabbling bureaucrats.</p>

"If they will withdraw their troops, I will have to find  other member states who will be ready to replace them," he said.    "The role of the UN is to maintain peace, is to contain a  dispute, to try to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute.  If you just say they can continue to kill each other, I will  say that this is an abdication," Butrus-Ghali said.    He also expressed confidence in EC mediator Lord Owen, whose  replacement was demanded Thursday by the European parliament,  and UN representative Stoltenberg.    "I have no criticism, on the contrary. I want to thank them  for the wonderful work they're doing. It needs a lot of  patience, of perseverance. I support them and express them my  gratitude," he said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: De Beers faces 'delicious dilemma' - The diamond producer's role in times of recession WHEN Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, delivers his annual statement today, he will be seeking to strike an optimistic note about the diamond market, while not laying himself open to unsustainable predictions. Last year Mr Ogilvie Thompson forecast that the Central Selling Organisation (CSO) - the De Beers' organisation which markets about 80 per cent of the world's uncut diamond production - was confident of sustaining sales. In the event, CSO sales for 1991 were 6 per cent down on 1990 at Dollars 4.17bn. Caution is thus likely to be the watchword in today's statement. Diamonds, like few other businesses, thrive on euphoria and confidence. Fear and pessimism are the enemies of the diamond trade, so Mr Ogilvie Thompson will be doing his best to make an optimistic reading of the tea-leaves. It will not be easy. The US which, like Japan, accounts for about a third of sales, has been a weak market in recent years. Had it not been for prosperity in Japan, CSO sales would have been much lower. However, analysts report that the Japanese diamond sales have now slowed markedly in 1992, partly as a result of the precarious state of the Japanese stock market. News from the first three 1992 sights - the term for the rough diamond auctions, which occur 10 times a year - is not good. Mr Richard Stuart, analyst with Martin, believes sales are cumulatively about 30 per cent down on the same period in 1991. He predicts sales for the first half of the year will be 25-28 per cent down on 1991 and expects CSO sales for the year to drop to about Dollars 3.65bn from Dollars 3.93bn in 1991, this being predicated on an increase of about 25 per cent in second-half sales compared to 1991. De Beers is playing its traditional role in a recessionary climate, acting as a shock-absorber in the pipeline from producer to final buyer. The CSO attempts to bring stability to the market by adjusting supplies to the diamond cutters to meet demand, while maintaining purchases from producers in terms of contractual commitments. The impact of this policy can be seen in the level of diamond stocks held by the CSO, which have risen by nearly 50 per cent in the past three years. The ratio of stocks to CSO sales reached a high of 136 per cent in 1982, which was the worst period for De Beers since 1929. It then dropped to 48 per cent in 1988, only to climb again to 77 per cent at the end of 1991, or 97 per cent on some estimates if account is taken of Russian stocks held as loan collateral. Analysts point out that are few parallels between the current mild recession in the market and the dark days of the early 1980s. Then a deflationary period in the world economy caused vast stocks of diamonds, which had been bought as an inflation hedge, to be deposited on the market. De Beers, as a result, lost a degree of control over the supply of diamonds into the pipeline below the CSO. Today there are at least two important differences: there is no large overhang of diamonds, held by non-CSO parties, and De Beers has improved its control over the pipeline. It has, for example, detailed information about the state of indebtedness of the cutters. The 'delicious dilemma' for De Beers, as one analyst puts it, is that its control of the market has never been better - it is when times are good that producers get greedy and think of leaving the CSO - but the market is weak. While De Beers' stabilising role is good for the market, it is not so good, in the short term, for shareholders. The price of stability is higher stocks and paying for this involves a drop in interest receipts. Thus De Beers' interest income dropped from Dollars 378m in 1989 to Dollars 282m in 1990 and Dollars 209m in 1991. De Beers is also the swing producer in the industry and thus more likely to cut its own production in recessionary times than are, say, the Russians. This will be the likely consequence of the coming on stream this year of De Beers' new Venetia mine in the Northern Transvaal. Venetia's production will probably displace that of other more marginal group producers. The vulnerable state of the market at present makes a CSO rough diamond price rise unlikely. The last was 5.5 per cent in March 1990. In 1981 a small price increase caused a very sharp drop in sales - over 40 per cent by value - and De Beers will not want to repeat that. The longer-term picture must be giving Mr Ogilvie Thompson food for thought. De Beers profited handsomely from the heady consumer days of the middle and late 1980s. The question now is: how large is the sustainable market? Can similar growth be expected again, or has the market matured?</p>

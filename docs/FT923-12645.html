			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / French politician ordered to court MR Henri Emmanuelli, president of the French national assembly, was yesterday summonsed to appear before a court between September 8 and 14 to answer charges over alleged illicit fund raising by the ruling Socialist party. The move intensifies tensions between the government and the judicial investigation system and will bring a long-running scandal over political corruption into the public eye in the weeks before the September 20 referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Mr Emmanuelli's lawyers said the summons, from the Rennes appeal court, indicated he was likely to face charges in his capacity as former Socialist party treasurer. He was expected to be charged with complicity in trading favours, attempting to conceal this, and having illicitly collected cash for the Socialist party from two construction companies, Urba and Gracco. This was a charge against the Socialist party itself, said Mr Emmanuelli, and his lawyers said he would therefore not resign.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / University cuts first-year intake The University of East Anglia will cut its intake of first-year students by 8 per cent this year because of cuts in government funding. The university said the cut was 'much greater than had been expected', and that there were 65,000 more students in the English university system in October 1993 than the Treasury had expected to pay for. Figures on next year's grants for each university will be announced next week by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Both the funding council and the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals suggested that East Anglia's cut might prove exceptional, and predicted an average reduction closer to 3 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS GET FAST START IN BEATING WHO-ARE-THEYS?  </P> <P> The hobbled San Francisco Giants took the field against the Dodgers Monday as a  collective argument for putting first names on uniforms.  </P> <P> There was a guy playing first base named Leach. A guy on second named Litton.  One in right field named Leonard. The catcher was Manwaring.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, countering with guys named Murray, Brooks and Daniels, needed only  two innings to show what you don't know can't hurt you.  </P> <P> Using home runs by Eddie Murray and Hubie Brooks and a two-run double by Kal  Daniels, the Dodgers scored nine runs in the first two innings in winning,  11-1, before 42,202.  </P> <P> "They had a different lineup, for sure," said Mike Sharperson, whose Dodgers  had not seen the Giants since April 30.  </P> <P> He shrugged: "But I don't think we dwelled on it."  </P> <P> The third-place Dodgers are now beginning dwell on second place, moving to  within 2 1/2 games of the Giants while remaining 13 1/2 games behind  Cincinnati.  </P> <P> The largest Monday crowd since opening day saw the biggest Dodger winning  margin of the season, back-to-back Dodger homers for just the second time this  season and the most runs by a Dodger team since May 27.  </P> <P> They also saw Fernando Valenzuela's best outing since his June 29 no-hitter.  Valenzuela (8-8) was needed for only six innings, allowing one run on four hits  with four strikeouts.  </P> <P> The fans even saw a high-speed chase featuring the team's premier Keystone Kop,  Mickey Hatcher.  </P> <P> With Jose Vizcaino on first base and one out in the eighth inning, Hatcher,  batting for reliever Tim Crews, lined a ball down the right-field line. While  Vizcaino was scoring, Hatcher was rounding first and second and, surprisingly,  sliding into third base just ahead of the relay throw from second baseman  Ernest Riles.  </P> <P> Riles' throw rolled past the base and deep into foul territory. This is where  Hatcher made his first mistake.  </P> <P> "I never should have gotten up and run home," Hatcher said, smiling. "I should  have just stayed put."  </P> <P> Instead, Hatcher stood up and took off. Except his legs argued. Halfway to the  plate, his knees began to knock. Several feet short of the plate, he fell on  his face.  </P> <P> "It was unbelievable," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "His legs wouldn't let  him move."  </P> <P> Hatcher crawled across the plate, slapping it as he turned and sprawled on his  back in exhaustion.  </P> <P> "Vizcaino was yelling for me to score standing up. . . . He didn't know what to  do," Hatcher said. "Hey, I just hope we can turn this season around and make it  exciting for the fans."  </P> <P> The Giants have lost a season-high five consecutive games.  </P> <P> Will Clark, batting .429 against the Dodgers this year, was on the bench Monday  after fouling a ball off his right foot Sunday in Chicago. The bruised foot was  X-rayed with negative results, and Manager Roger Craig said he was going to  rest him anyway, but before the game Clark said the foot was still hurting.  </P> <P> "When I get well, I will run out there like I always do, but I can't do it on  one foot," said Clark, batting .280 with 14 homers and 65 RBIs.  </P> <P> Said Sharperson: "Every time Clark is in there, it's like he's a presence. So,  you wonder if that didn't affect the outlook."  </P> <P> Second baseman Robby Thompson was out with a sore back, and catcher Gary Carter  is on the disabled list with a bruised right shoulder. Shortstop Jose Uribe was  being rested.  </P> <P> The only recognizeable veterans were Matt Williams, Kevin Mitchell and Brett  Butler. Craig started Rick Leach at first, Greg Litton at second and catcher  Kirt Manwaring. And, in an odd but forced maneuver against the left-handed  Valenzuela, Craig gave left-handed hitting Mark Leonard his first major league  start in right field.  </P> <P> "I told him Valenzuela was right-handed," Craig said. "He said, 'OK.' "  </P> <P> It was not OK for left-handed Giant starter Trevor Wilson, 24, who earlier this  year had carried no-hitters into the ninth and seventh innings.  </P> <P> Stan Javier, playing for a resting Kirk Gibson, broke up this no-hit bid within  seconds, leading off the Dodger first inning with a single to left. Two outs  later on an 0-and-2 pitch, Murray homered to center, his 14th overall and  second in his last six at-bats.  </P> <P> On a 3-and-0 fastball, Brooks followed with a homer to left, his 11th of the  season. The only other Dodger back-to-back homers this year were hit by Gibson  and Daniels on June 8 in San Diego.  </P> <P> The Dodgers were just getting started. Juan Samuel led off the second inning  with a walk and one out later was bunted to second by Valenzuela. The Dodgers  then scored six runs with two out.  </P> <P> Javier singled in a run. Sharperson singled. Daniels doubled in two runs,  taking the team lead with 50 RBIs. His career high is 64.  </P> <P> After Daniels' double, Randy O'Neal replaced Wilson. He intentionally walked  Murray, but then Brooks singled to score another run. Rick Dempsey, who entered  with six RBIs in 63 at-bats, then drove in two more with a double down the left  field line.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> The bar fight involving the Dodger middle infielders Saturday morning in  Pittsburgh started when Alfredo Griffin jokingly told a woman he was Pirate  second baseman Jose Lind, two sources have confirmed. Sources say the woman  then asked for Griffin's autograph, which started an argument between her and a  male companion. Griffin and Juan Samuel then allegedly attempted to calm the  man, causing busboy Wilson Sturgeon Jr. to intervene. Griffin and Samuel are  charged with assaulting Sturgeon and are scheduled to appear for a preliminary  hearing in Pittsburgh's City Court July 31.  </P> <P> Griffin was easy to spot Monday. He was the only player wearing sunglasses  during batting practice. Griffin was protecting his left eye, which is still  swollen and infected after it was scratched and punched during the fight. He  missed his third consecutive start and today will be examined by  ophthalmologist Matthew Bernstein. If Griffin is placed on the disabled list,  look for triple-A shortstop Jose Offerman to join the team.  </P> <P> Jamie Jarrin returned to the Dodger broadcast booth for Spanish-language KWKW  radio (1330) for the first time since suffering internal injuries in an  automobile accident March 26. "I am so thrilled and thankful to be here," said  Jarrin, who nearly died in the spring training crash in Vero Beach, Fla. "The  only regret I have is that I was not here for Fernando Valenzuela's no-hitter."  Jarrin, who served as Valenzuela's interpreter during the days of Fernandomania  in the early 1980s, left the June 29 game against St. Louis in the first inning  because of fatigue. He normally works seven innings of a broadcast but worked  just four innings on Monday and will gradually increase his time.  </P></p>

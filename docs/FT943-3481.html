			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Childcare subsidy hopes dashed Hopes that the government might extend childcare payments to more parents with young families diminished yesterday after a government minister called for clear limits to state aid in this area. Mr Alistair Burt, the social security minister with responsibility for the Child Support Agency, delivered a robust defence of 'traditional' family values but said that ministers 'believe it would be wrong to use taxpayers' money to subsidise childcare costs for all parents'. Mr Burt, speaking at a Glasgow conference on Families and the Future, said that the Department of Health was already spending Pounds 2m in grant aid this year to help voluntary organisations increase the amount of childcare for the under-fives, and that there had been a steady growth in non-state day-nursery provision by the private and voluntary sectors. Last year the chancellor announced a new allowance available to people receiving family credit who need to pay for childcare. But this has not reduced the calls from parents' pressure groups calling for more childcare allowances to help both single and married mothers take up employment. Mr Burt insisted in his speech that the government 'does not take a view on what the ideal family should be'. However, he said the ideal of the 'traditional' family was under pressure, noting that the number of lone parents had increased from 150,000 in 1981 to 430,000 in 1991. He added: 'Stability is important in a child's life, and stability is provided by the strength of the parents' relationship.'</p>

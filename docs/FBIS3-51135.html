			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 10 Jan (PL) -- The Cuban labor unions today  announced a broad consultation process to influence the economic  changes that are being studied to improve the country's internal  finances that are characterized by a high fiscal deficit and  excess circulating currency.    The Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), the only labor movement  on the island, pointed out in a press note that the process will  take place in two stages and conclude with grass-roots meetings  at labor centers.    In the first stage more than 400,000 labor leaders will  contribute their ideas and prepare for assemblies with union  members, to which deputies of the National Assembly of the  People's Government will be invited.    Parliament did an initial analysis of internal finances on  28  December when it was officially revealed that the fiscal deficit  will reach 4.2 billion pesos -- which is equivalent to the same  figure in dollars based on the official exchange rate -- and  that there is a 10-billion-peso excess in circulating currency.    On that occasion the Legislative Branch did not adopt  measures to tackle this situation, but the members agreed on the  need to solve this delicate problem without resorting to  neoliberal-type measures that involve high social costs.    The CTC announcement coincided with an editorial in the  weekly TRABAJADORES, mouthpiece of the labor union, that  strongly attacks the formality of the Cuban labor movement.    We can no longer bear, without growing impatient, the  ritualistic and repetitive language of those who incessantly  issue general slogans but fail to even touch the specific and  objective reality that should be the basis for their actions,  the publication underscored.    It also urged the labor unions to participate in all  political battles, to "assume an offensive stand everywhere,"  and to censure indolence and negligence, lack of control over  costs and expenditures, and unpunished deviation of resources.  These are among the things that the publication condemned,  considering them to be "signs of capitulation."    The weekly warned that the outcome of "the country's current  epic" ... "compromises not only the fatherland's fate but also  the workers' existence, decorum, dignity, and power."    In this regard, the publication urged them to contribute  solutions and to adopt measures, some of which, if finally  approved, might not be popular -- reduction of payroll,  elimination of certain gratuities, and elimination of certain  subsidies within an economic system that is described as  paternalistic.    Labor unions in the capital city analyzed the issue for the  first time over the weekend and agreed to focus their efforts on  cost reduction and on obtaining higher net revenues.    As for the rationalization of surplus employees, CTC  Secretary General Pedro Ross pointed out that this process is  based on convincing arguments and reasons, not on decrees.    Ross said that there is a need to work with much prudence  and  to confront arbitrary actions. He added that labor union  efforts with regard to the workers -- who are guaranteed a 60  percent subsidy on their salaries -- will include the  organization, attention, and defense of their rights.    In December, Parliament announced that special sessions  would  be held to discuss the country's financial situation following a  broad analysis of the nation's social bases.    At noon today Legislative Branch President Ricardo Alarcon  said on a radio program that "the people will be the key player  of these actions," but he did not give details on the date of  the upcoming parliament meeting.</p>

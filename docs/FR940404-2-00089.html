			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent Order from TCH Corporation (``TCH'' or ``Thrifty'') and Green Equity Investors, L.P. (``GEI''), under which TCH and GEI would divest pharmacy assets in five (5) geographic locations where they face limited competition. TCH operates the Thrifty Drug Store Chain and the BiMart chain of discount stores. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 1, 1993, TCH and Kmart Corporation (``Kmart'') entered into an agreement whereby GEI, through TCH, would acquire all the stock of PayLess Drug Stores Northwest, Inc. (``PayLess''), a wholly owned subsidiary of Kmart. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would constitute a violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the market for the sale of prescription drugs in retail stores in the following towns: Bishop, California; Mt. Shasta, California; Taft, California; Florence, Oregon; and Ellensburg, Washington (hereinafter ``relevant geographic areas''). The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by maintaining the current number of competitors in the relevant geographic areas where Thrifty and PayLess are direct competitors and where they face limited competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Consent Order provides that within one (1) year of the Order becoming final, TCH and GEI shall divest all assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in PayLess or Thrifty retail stores in the relevant geographic areas. The divestiture of the PayLess or Thrifty pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas shall be made only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The assets shall be divested to an eligible acquirer or acquirers that will operate a pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas. Eligible acquirers in each relevant geographic area include, but are not limited to: Owners of retail stores that currently do not operate a pharmacy in that relevant geographic area; persons previously employed by Thrifty or PayLess; persons who will operate a pharmacy within an existing Thrifty or PayLess retail store; or persons who will open a new retail store. In the event that TCH and GEI have not divested the Thrifty or PayLess pharmacy assets in the relevant areas in one (1) year, the proposed Consent Order provides that TCH and GEI shall consent to the appointment by the Commission of a trustee to divest the pharmacy assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

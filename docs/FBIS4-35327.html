			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden radio broadcast a statement this morning by a  responsible source in the Democratic Republic of Yemen -- which  has been declared in the south -- denying Sanaa's assertion  that officials in the Yemeni Socialist Party have proposed an  unconditional cease-fire in Yemen.    The source declared that Aden insists on two basic  conditions  for a cease-fire. These are the withdrawal of all northern  forces to positions behind the previous borders between the two  parts of Yemen, and the holding of direct talks with the Aden  government.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Carrie Lee] </F>   [Text] A monitoring committee will be set up in each of  China's state-owned commercial banks which are presently  specialised banks, according to a senior Chinese banking  official.    Such a committee whose members will include representatives  from the People's Bank of China and related government  departments, will be delegated by the State Council to monitor  and examine each bank's operational approach and its capital  preservation and growth situation. It will also monitor, assess  and record the performance of each bank's director, proposing  performance rewards and penalties.    Ma Delun, the People's Bank's policy research department's  deputy director, yesterday said branches of state-owned  commercial banks would also see the establishment of such  committees. A monitoring authority already exists in the State  Development Bank -- one of the mainland's policy banks.    Under existing banking reform, China's four specialised  banks  are now in the process of transforming into commercial banks  which, being new financial entities, calls for a new mode of  regulation.    These banks will not be allowed to invest directly in  non-financial enterprises with their investments in insurance  trust services and securities also restricted to a proportion of  available capital. Their branches are granted no investment  rights.    Meanwhile, the People's Bank has adjusted the bank reserve  requirement to three per cent as one of the measures to maintain  currency stability.    Mr Ma said the banking system put currency stabilisation  before economic development, with the former expected to affect  the latter. Previously this approach was reversed.    He also said the implementation of financial reforms should  be preceded by the establishment of a system of regulations,  such as the present one. "In the past, some reforms were just  about implementation and action was taken before (attention was  paid to) other considerations...existing financial reform starts  with the establishment of financial rules," he said.    Mr Ma conceded the insurance industry was still not well  developed on the mainland. "People don't understand the concept  of insurance very well. More publicity is needed to educate  them that it is an investment apart from being a kind of  protection," he said.    "Policy insurance and commercial insurance should be audited  separately...for fair and orderly competition.    "The industry should be differentiated into life insurance  and non-life insurance. We should develop national, locality  and specialised insurance companies."    Reinsurance companies should be set up and a rural insurance  industry should be developed, he said.    "We should expand the scope and autonomy of capital use for  insurance enterprises, and duly raise insurance solvency margins  to strengthen the industry's financial strength."</p>

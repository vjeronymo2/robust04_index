			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Zverev, from Odessa: "In Odessa, There Is </F> a Wondrous Team: Eight Marxists, Three Lawyers, Two Captains and  a Shadow--One for Two"]    [Text] Of the 23 seats in the Odessa region, 4 remain  unfilled after two rounds of elections, while the 19 elected  people's deputies can be broadly divided into three groups.  Eight hang out on the left, while eight others, who ran for  parliament from various managerial entities, are on the right.  It is an illusory right, and it is called so only because there  is no real right wing in the Odessa delegation. This group  includes many well-known names: Bodelan, Symonenko, Kudyukin,  Plotkin, Hurvits, Hovorun, Popov and Honchar. Apart from them  are the rest, the representatives of a Lawyer's Union: Shyskin,  Evdokymov and Karmazin, who for the sake of speeding up reforms  declared willingness to cooperate with all parties and movements.    Two weeks after the fright caused by the first round of the  election we can breathe easier. All of a sudden, Odessa  residents voted with wonderful moderation. New Russian  demagogues, the writer Vershynin and the television star  Vaserman, as well as more noisy Leninists Pylypenko, Prokopets  and Anyshchuk failed to get into parliament. Those Communists  who won seats in the Supreme Council are at least distinguished  by party work or are authorities in the world of business. The  two representatives of the Countryside Party as not so much  party activists as kolkhoz chairmen. Only the leader of the  city's Social Democrats, now People's Deputy Rychagov, is one of  those who only know how to talk.    It is not even worth it to discuss the other eight. Almost  all of them were early favorites and stuck in the memory of the  people not so much by worlds but deeds. Maybe it was a mistake  by Oleksiy Kostusev to stress the ephemeral "struggle against  the mafia" and not his own practical activities in his election  campaign. As a result, he suffered a defeat at the hands of the  main object of his anti-mafia crusade, Yeduard Hurvits.    Today, it is hard to tell where the Odessa delegation will  steer its ship. But it is clear as day that not everything that  the candidates promised before the election will become reality.  Everything will depend on two factors. First, on the balance of  forces in parliament itself and, second, on how the big cheeses  of the Odessa delegation, Valentyn Symonenko and Ruslan Bodelan  steer it. Competition, not to say cold war, has been going on  between them for a good decade. But now they may well declare a  truce in order to protect together their regional Odessa  interests against the encroachment by the powers that be in Kiev.    Yet, it is unlikely that they could remain neutral relative  one another even for a short period of time. The elections for  Odessa mayor and Odessa regional governor are approaching. Even  though most likely neither Symonenko nor Bodelan want these  posts, they will attempt to get their stand-ins elected to them.    For the rest, a violator of peace on the Odessa team may  become the colorful head of the Zhovtnevyy rayon council Yeduard  Hurvits. But it is unlikely that he could enter the competition  for leadership. He has already been the shadow of Symonenko and  the shadow of Bodelan. More recently, Hurvits has found it safer  to hide in the shadow of Leonid Kuchma.</p>

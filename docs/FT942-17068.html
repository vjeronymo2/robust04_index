			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / World Trade News: Warning on China MFN row The World Bank has warned the US and China that both countries could face consequences ranging 'from the dramatic to the disastrous' if the US were to withdraw most favoured nation trade privileges from China. In a study of trade reform in China the Washington-based development bank estimates that Chinese exports to the US could drop by between 42 and 96 per cent if the MFN privileges are not renewed - a loss of between Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) and Dollars 15.2bn (Pounds 10.2bn). The Clinton administration has demanded progress on a number of human rights issues before it will agree to renew MFN, which is due to expire on June 3. An end to MFN privileges would mean that Chinese goods would be taxed at general tariff rates which are often five to ten times higher than MFN rates. The average tariff would rise from 13.4 per cent to 42 per cent. The precise effects will vary, depending on how much other countries are able to sell substitutes for goods now sold by China. US consumers could also lose, the World Bank says. They might end up paying as much as Dollars 14bn a year more in higher prices.</p>

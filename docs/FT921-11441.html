			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Shaposhnikov gives pledge on missiles TACTICAL nuclear weapons have been withdrawn to Russia from all the other former Soviet republics except Ukraine and Belarus, Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, commander of the joint armed forces, said in London yesterday. The weapons, previously spread throughout the former Soviet Union, have been the principal source of concern about the possibility of nuclear arms getting into the wrong hands. About 11,500 tactical nuclear arms are believed to have been deployed with army, air defence and air force units, but Moscow promised last year to destroy a large part of the stockpile. Marshal Shaposhnikov, who was accompanying Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, told British officials that all the tactical weapons would be in Russian sites by July. Strategic nuclear weapons are due to be withdrawn from Ukraine by 1994 and from Belarus and Kazakhstan - the other two republics outside Russia where they are based - by 1998. Britain is to send specialists to Moscow to assess Russia's needs for technical assistance in dismantling its nuclear arms. The US will end or reduce operations at 83 more military installations in Europe and bring home 17,000 troops from those sites, mostly in Germany, the Defence Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. A Pentagon spokesman said the military was accelerating its reductions in Europe and now planned to withdraw 106,600 troops instead of 86,600 previously announced for the year ending on October 1. US troop strength in Europe had gone from 314,000 in September of 1990 to 227,000 and would be further reduced to 208,000 by the end of next September.</p>

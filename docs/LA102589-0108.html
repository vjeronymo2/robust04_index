			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> CURTIS RECALL EFFORT NEARS SIGNATURE GOAL  </P> <P> County officials who are reviewing petitions for recalling Mission Viejo City  Councilman Robert A. Curtis verified several hundred additional signatures  Tuesday, bringing recall supporters to the brink of the number needed to force  a recall election.  </P> <P> In response to the latest count, Curtis all but conceded that the latest tally  of signatures means he will probably face a recall election next year.  </P> <P> Final word is expected today.  </P> <P> The number of verified signatures is growing as officials comb through the  petitions, searching for valid signatures that were overlooked during the first  review.  </P> <P> By 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, the total number of valid signatures had grown to 7,778,  eight more than needed. But early rejoicing by the Coalition to Recall  Councilman Curtis was squelched when officials pointed out that 127 of the  valid signatures were turned in by petitioners who had incorrectly filled out  their affidavits.  </P> <P> That left the coalition just below its threshold but made it appear that the  requisite number would soon emerge from the 12,001 signatures turned in on  Sept. 28. After a discouraging Monday during which coalition leaders discovered  that they were 477 signatures short, Tuesday's news brought sighs of relief.  </P> <P> "The fat lady hasn't sung yet," said Helen Monroe, chairwoman of the recall  campaign. "But we're confident that we'll get enough valid signatures, much  more confident than we were yesterday."  </P> <P> According to City Clerk Ivy J. Zovel, the county registrar of voters office  hopes to find at least 7,950 valid signatures before approving the petitions.  That, she said, would provide a safety margin beyond the needed 7,770  signatures.  </P> <P> Curtis, whose enthusiasm bubbled over Monday, was more subdued after hearing  the latest count. "I'm assuming they'll qualify," he said. "At this point, I'm  looking forward to an election. I think it's the clearest way for the voters of  Mission Viejo to send a message to the Philip Morris Co. to stay out of the  affairs of this city."  </P> <P> The New York-based Philip Morris Companies Inc. owns the Mission Viejo Co.,  which has donated $35,717 in cash and in-kind contributions, including the loan  of a political consultant, to the recall effort. Curtis and the Mission Viejo  Co. have sparred furiously in recent months, most notably over a proposal to  annex Aegean Hills, a pie-shaped area of unincorporated Orange County.  </P> <P> Curtis championed the annexation and the company opposed it. The annexation bid  crumbled last spring. The Mission Viejo Co. now leads all contributors in the  effort to recall Curtis. In addition, several developers who have done work for  the company are among the recall campaign's other major backers.  </P> <P> The coalition has collected $156,422 and spent more than $124,000 on its recall  campaign to date, and observers note that those enormous resources have  produced paltry results -- about $10 spent for each of the 12,001 signatures,  with thousands declared invalid. The coalition's travails have emboldened  Curtis.  </P> <P> "They've had to struggle mightily to get this far," he said. "The time that  they spent and the resources that they spent to get these few signatures shows  how little support there is for them."  </P> <P> Monroe declined comment on Curtis' remarks, saying that she and other coalition  members would wait until after the signature verification is complete. If  sufficient signatures are declared valid, Mission Viejo's City Council will be  required to set a special election date, probably sometime early next spring.  JIM NEWTON  </P></p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Sharp drop in business overdrafts THE NUMBER of small businesses with bank overdrafts has dropped sharply during the past year as the cost of borrowing continues to be seen as a serious constraint, according to a survey of Institute of Directors members in England. Only 52 per cent of small businesses now borrow from banks - 17 per cent of those surveyed said they had paid off their overdrafts during the past 12 months. The reduced borrowing mirrors the repayment of debt in the household sector, the institute says. Small businesses in the south were more likely to have paid off their bank overdrafts than those in the north, according to the survey. A total of 7 per cent of businesses in the north cleared their bank debts, compared with 20 per cent in the south. The use of overdrafts was also linked to the size of the company and the sector in which it operated, the report says. Companies with medium turnover, particularly in agriculture, property and construction, were the most likely to have continued borrowing from banks. Although half of small companies consider the cost of overdrafts to be a serious business difficulty, relatively few were being charged excessive margins of interest over the base rate, the survey shows. The institute decided to carry out the research after complaints from members that banks were charging high margins and failing to pass on base-rate cuts. A random sample of members whose companies employ fewer than 100 workers was interviewed. Just over half of those surveyed were being charged 1 to 2 percentage points above base rates at the time of the survey in late July, with 39 per cent paying 3 to 4 points above base rate. Overall, 90 per cent paid 4 percentage points or less above base rate on their business overdraft. Again, there were substantial regional variations: 79 per cent of businesses in the north paid 1 to 2 points above base rate while in the south only 44 per cent enjoyed such low margins, the research found. A quarter of those surveyed reported that they had not had reductions in the base rate passed on to them in the form of lower interest rates, with a slight bias towards those in the north having reductions, the research found. Overdraft facilities were reduced during the year for 16 per cent of those businesses questioned. Top justifications given by banks for the reductions were: reductions in the value of property used as security for the loan, and lack of take-up of the existing facility.

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Pyongyang suspends propaganda North Korea has suspended its usual loudspeaker broadcasts of propaganda against the Southern president at the truce line dividing the communist and capitalist states, writes Bradley Martin in Seoul. The broadcasts attacking South Korean President Kim Young-sam, normally directed to southern soldiers along the border, halted at 5pm on Tuesday, just before the announcement of an agreement to hold the summit in Pyongyang next month. Temporarily turning off its propaganda insults has been a standard North Korean measure whenever the two sides approach face-to-face meetings. The pattern has been for the insults to resume after failure of the talks. In recent months North Korean propaganda has denounced the South Korean president as a traitor. Seoul generally is more restrained in its broadcast characterisations of North Korean President Kim Il-sung.</p>

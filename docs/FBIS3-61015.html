			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel-General Ye. Rusanov, chief of the </F> Aviation Flight Safety Service [SBP] of the Armed Forces of the  Russian Federation, under the rubric "Flight Safety: Experience,  Analysis, Problems": "Thousands of Dangerous Situations..."]    [Text] ...those being the thousands of dangerous  situations that arise owing to omissions and oversights by many  officials that are compensated for every year by military  pilots, risking their health and sometimes their lives.    The conditions for maintaining the level of flight safety  that had been attained (not to mention further improvements in  it) have changed for the worse in recent years. The extent of  the hazardousness of factors affecting the failure-free  operation of all components of the  "pilot--aircraft--environment" system has increased first and  foremost, and flying time has decreased in general and for each  pilot or crew in particular. The lack of the necessary quantity  of fuels and lubricants and training ordnance, along with the  difficulties of infrastructure and amenities for the personnel  of aviation and supporting units caused by the cutbacks and  relocations of the troops, is having an acute impact. All of  this is having a negative impact on morale and the psychological  state of the fliers, and is reducing the motivation to continue  both flight work and military service as a result.    It is nonetheless namely in this difficult climate that it  is  essential not only to pursue, but even to intensify the work to  prevent flight accidents, since each of them causes great harm  to our aviation and the army as a whole.    It would obviously not be sensible, given the realities of  the current moment--where instances of failure to observe the  requirements not only of official documents, but even  fundamental ones (decrees, edicts, resolutions), are becoming  far from isolated--to be limited just to the customary directive  and disciplinary methods for ensuring flight safety.    Yes, the aviation documents are strict. One difficulty of  the  current period is the fact that most of the basic manuals and  guides regulating flight work, whose unconditional fulfillment  by every aviation specialist--first and foremost the pilot  himself--is required, unfortunately assume his complete  provision with everything that could have an impact on flight  safety. That is far from always possible everywhere or for  everyone today, however. And closing our eyes to these gaps  between, figuratively speaking, yesterday's and today's flight  organization is not the best method of action for aviation  commanders of all ranks or for the officials of the SBP. Under  these conditions, it would be expedient, while preserving the  established principle of ensuring flight safety "from the top  down" (High Command--larger formations and units--air  unit--pilot), also to take into account the degree of motivation  to prevent accidents "the other way"--"from the bottom up" (that  is, to start right with the pilot).    The pilot was considered to be the object of  exhortation, monitoring and, of course, sanctions under the  command-administrative system for his failure to observe a host  of flight-safety requirements from officials at all levels when  preventive measures were organized to avoid accidents. It came  to pass that he, while personally risking, at a minimum, his  flight and service career and, frequently, the state of his  health and sometimes even his life in a flight accident,  seemingly had considerably less of a vested interest in the  safety of his flights than a host of superior officers!    When preventive work is optimized relying on the predominant  role of the personality of the pilot, for whom all  the higher structures should be working, we obtain a powerful  supplement in the form of the organizational energy of thousands  of pilots (or members of flight crews) to the efforts of dozens  of SBP specialists. It is no secret that it is namely the pilots  who in practice prevent thousands of dangerous situations  arising from the omissions and oversights of officials in  various fields every year. But there are reserves here as well,  since almost every one of the crashes and accidents that occurs  over the course of a year could have been prevented or, at  least, had a less grave outcome with timely and correct actions  (after the dangerous situation arose) by the crew. The  unsatisfactory level of training of the flight personnel in  practical prevention of the accidents that are most typical of  their branch of aviation and type of airframe, however, leads to  the systematic repetition of one and the same accident and crash  situations arising out of objective or subjective unfavorable  factors that are exhaustively studied by the SBP specialists,  but prove each time to be new and unexpected for the next crew  to get into the difficult situation.    That is just what happened when an Mi-8 helicopter hit a  mountain slope hidden by cloud cover and crashed while  transporting refugees from the Transcaucasus in July of last  year. The air-traffic control bodies had not satisfactorily  analyzed the conditions for flying over this mountain pass,  while the crew, going up into mountains with cloud cover, was  not able to assess the danger of that factor under the concrete  conditions of the flight. Three crew members and ten passengers  were killed as a result.    Another crash, even more grave in its consequences, occurred  a month later in the same area when the same mission was being  carried out. The crew of an An-12 cut short their takeoff run  virtually without separating. The aircraft rolled over the end  of the runway, hit some obstacles, was smashed and burned.  Thirty-six people died. Doubts of the successful outcome of the  flight had arisen among the pilots owing to the high air  temperature, the maximum loading of the aircraft and the  specific features of the shape of the runway. All of these  dangerous factors had not been taken into account by either the  crew or the airfield dispatcher.    Could the crews have averted just these outcomes in these  specific situations? Investigation indisputably demonstrated  that such a possibility was virtually guaranteed--the crews were  entirely able to avoid creating a situation fatal for each of  them and then, when it had arisen all the same, could have  countered its unfavorable development and ended the flight  safely even though it had begun to be aggravated. It is namely  in these two directions--not creating dangerous  situations, and if they arise anyway, preventing their  aggravation and reducing the gravity of the outcome by the most  effective means--that should guide the training of flight  personnel.    The seeming simplicity of such a concept for practical  preventive work, however, requires sound analytical and  methodological work in each branch of military aviation to  select and quantify the typical (repeating) special situations,  to practice techniques for averting them, and then to localize  each of them and ultimately devise and maintain the skills for  the whole range of techniques developed. It can be accomplished  most effectively at the centers for the combat application of  aviation, in close interaction with the specialists of the  Combat Training Directorate and the Flight Safety Service.    In the realization of the proposed model for preventive  work,  each pilot or crew will be able to select, regardless of  directives from above, the most expedient positions from among  the set of techniques for repetition namely those elements of  the flight mission, in the fulfillment of which he senses the  predominant danger, and to practice them in class, on a  simulator or on a computer when preparing for a specific flight.    The activity to ensure flight safety by the higher commands  and inspectorates will undoubtedly require optimization under  contemporary conditions. Each of them should strive to create  for their subordinate levels (or interacting levels) the most  favorable working conditions to maintain the required level of  flight safety in a contemporary setting. This is already being  realized through the cutbacks in the previously widespread host  of inspectorates and checks, performance ratings and other  measures of an administrative type, and the redistribution of  efforts in the direction of performing methodological measures  and assisting in each area. The basic principle of the  structures controlling the activity of the air regiment should  be to provide its command personnel with the most favorable  climate for planning, organizing and conducting flights.    The urgent task of all the services participating in flight  training should be considered to be the elimination of dangerous  factors under their control that a the cause of the appearance  and aggravation of dangerous situations. Thus, for example, the  investigation of the most severe flight accident of last  year--the crash of a transport aircraft landing with passengers  on board at night in minimal weather conditions at a back-up  airfield that had not been assimilated before--first placed the  focus on crew error in the performance of the pre-landing  maneuver. Detailed study of the circumstances of this tragedy,  however, showed that the actions of the crew only crowned a  situation that had been conditioned by violations, omissions and  blunders by a whole series of officials who had given the  assignment and prepared the crew, made the decisions for takeoff  and rerouting, were responsible for the lighting and electronic  equipment of the airfield, analyzed the weather etc. If any one  of these had made the correct decision and carried it out, the  crash situation may not have arisen.    As for scientific developments in flight safety, it would be  expedient to concentrate efforts today on the "applied"  questions--maintaining the level of proficiency of pilots under  conditions of irregular flights, and substantiating measures to  avert the most serious flight accidents.    It is essential to emphasize in conclusion the importance of  uniting the efforts of specialists from all agencies in the  performance of everyday work to prevent accidents in aviation  under contemporary conditions. The expensive experience that has  been acquired in the investigation of flight accidents should be  utilized with the maximum possible promptness and completeness  in the aviation of the armed forces of the Russian Federation. A  closed-doors mentality is impermissible here, since it only  reinforces the method of trial and error (such as the fact, for  example, that analogous accidents happened after the crash of  the An-12 on civil aircraft in Vladivostok and Tbilisi). This  pertains entirely to the intelligent utilization of foreign  experience in flight safety.    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

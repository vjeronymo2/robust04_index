			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 VOLVO ADS REV UP CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Volvo advertising suddenly appears stuck in reverse.  </P> <P> Just one day after Volvo pulled an advertisement for what company officials  conceded were misleading statements over how well Volvo cars can stand up to  giant trucks rolling over them, a spokesman for the Swedish car maker said  Tuesday that yet another of its newest TV spots is raising the ire of abortion  rights activists.  </P> <P> That commercial features a video of a fetus -- inside a woman's body -- that  appears to be waving at the camera. An off-camera spokesman asks, "Is something  inside you telling you to buy a Volvo?"  </P> <P> That has upset some who favor abortion rights. "My gut reaction is the ad is  ridiculous," said Renee Schwalberg, a board member of the San Francisco-based  Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights. "It definitely gives a fetus a greater  autonomy than it really has. It's clearly a distortion."  </P> <P> Although Volvo has received complaints about the ad from both abortion rights  activists and abortion foes, it says it will continue to run the spot created  by the New York ad agency Scali, McCabe, Sloves. "We have no plans to pull the  spot," said Robert Austin, manager of public relations at Rockleigh, N.J.-based  Volvo Cars of North America. "Corporately, Volvo does not have a position on  abortion."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Volvo has pulled from television and magazines an advertisement that  shows a so-called monster truck attempting to crush a row of cars with only a  Volvo car remaining intact. Following a lawsuit brought by the attorney general  of Texas, where the ad was filmed, the company ran an advertisement Tuesday in  the Wall Street Journal, U.S.A Today and 19 Texas newspapers that acknowledged  the demonstration in the ad was rigged.  </P> <P> "The advertisement . . . inaccurately characterized the event as a car-crushing  exhibition when in fact it was a dramatization of the actual event," said an  open letter from Joseph L. Nicolato, president and chief executive of Volvo  Cars of North America. "It was never the intention of Volvo to produce an  advertisement that deceived or misled."  </P></p>

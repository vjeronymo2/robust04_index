			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Isotron static at Pounds 3.07m Isotron, provider of sterilisation services to the healthcare industry, yesterday announced static pre-tax profits at Pounds 3.07m for the year to June 30, compared with Pounds 3.11m. This followed a rise at half-way from Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 1.51m. The profit included interest income down from Pounds 319,000 to Pounds 151,000 and was achieved from turnover 6 per cent higher at Pounds 7.75m (Pounds 7.3m). The fall in income was due to cash being invested in a new Irish plant and lower interest rates. The operating profit, up 4.5 per cent at Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 2.79m), was after charging Pounds 111,000 of pre-operating costs at the Irish plant. The dividend is raised by 10 per cent to 4.77p (4.34p) with a proposed final of 3.11p from earnings per share of 17p (17.3p).</p>

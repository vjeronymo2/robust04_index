			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM; FIRST AND FIFTH EDITIONS BY  EDWARD FITZGERALD (DOVER: $1 EACH)  </P> <P> In 1859, the English gentleman and scholar Edward FitzGerald published his  first translation of the quatrains attributed to the Persian mathematician,  astronomer, philosopher and poet Omar Khayyam (1048-1122). FitzGerald spent the  next decades reworking his translations: The fifth version was published  posthumously in 1889.  </P> <P> This edition of the two most famous translations is part of a new literary  series from Dover that includes "The Call of the Wild" by Jack London, "The  Importance of Being Ernest" by Oscar Wilde, Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness"  and Herman Melville's "Bartleby" and "Benito Cereno," each priced at just $1.  Although the notes in the plain-wrap volumes are minimal, the bindings are  sturdy and serviceable. These Thrift Editions return to the original notion of  the paperback book as an inexpensive way to build a library of literary  classics.  </P></p>

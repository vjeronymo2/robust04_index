			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY -- CRUEL PUNISHMENT OR JUSTICE?  </P> <P> I was extremely interested in the article with statistics on the death penalty.  </P> <P> How can the social scientists say that the death penalty is not a deterrence  when we haven't had an execution in 23 years? Now Atty. Gen. John K. Van de  Kamp predicts it will be at least another year before the next execution. What  good is the death penalty if it is not used?  </P> <P> Let's have an execution every week for 52 weeks.  </P> <P> This will not only bring the crime rate down but will save our taxpayers a lot  of money to house these criminals and pay for their attorney fees.  </P> <P> MORGAN FOTTRELL  </P> <P> La Quinta  </P></p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Jaguar to introduce three-year warranties JAGUAR is preparing to sharpen competition in UK and continental European luxury car markets by introducing three-year, 60,000-mile warranties from June 1. Such warranties have been standard since the mid 1980s on new cars sold by Europe's prestige carmakers in the highly competitive North American market. In Europe, the norm for BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar and other non-Japanese prestige cars is a one-year, unlimited-mileage warranty, with some manufacturers offering additional years at extra cost. The decision to launch the extended warranty follows an intensive effort at Jaguar, which is owned by Ford, to improve quality and productivity. Mr Roger Putnam, sales and marketing director, said that the move would give Jaguar 'an important advantage over our competitors' in the UK and on the Continent. BMW (GB) said last night that the company would be studying the move but gave no indication that it might alter its own warranty terms. Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Mitsubishi already offer two or three-year warranties throughout Europe. The warranty move comes as Jaguar has begun returning to a five-day working week on its saloon car lines.</p>

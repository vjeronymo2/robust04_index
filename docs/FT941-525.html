			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Balladur's support plummets Public confidence in the French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, crashed by 12 percentage points in March to stand at just 40 per cent, according to an opinion poll published yesterday, his first anniversary in office. The poll by the CSA institute for the Roman Catholic weekly newspaper, La Vie, was the latest evidence of a sharp decline in public approval of the conservative Gaullist prime minister following a wave of youth unrest. It showed Mr Balladur's confidence rating had fallen below that of the socialist president, Mr Francois Mitterrand, who rose by 6 points to 45 per cent in the same period.</p>

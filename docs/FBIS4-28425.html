			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Anti-Chongnyon Campaign Must Be Stopped" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today  denounces the search of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of  the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon)  and houses of Chongnyon officials by the Kyoto prefectural  police.    Noting that it, part of the hostile policy for stifling the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was perpetrated by the  Japanese reactionaries in a premeditated way to destroy  Chongnyon and check its patriotic activities, the analyst says:    The search cannot be construed to have been done by the  Kyoto  prefectural police at its discretion or an accidental incident.  It is a grave suppression for a sinister political purpose and  a never-to-be-condoned illegal act.    The Japanese authorities must admit their mistake in the  unjustifiable search of the Kyoto organization of Chongnyon,  apologize for it and immediately return what they confiscated.    The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, clearly  mindful that no matter how desperately they may try, they have  nothing to get in their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Insurers win hint of concession The government is prepared to consider 'sympathetically' suggestions by the insurance industry that it should be given the option of accounting for the new 3 per cent tax introduced in the Budget on a 'premium-written basis'. Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general, told the Commons last night that the use of this procedure would tie in more closely with many of the accounting arrangements in the industry. He said the implications, including whether gross premiums rather than net premiums should be the basis of the tax, required further study by government and industry. The new tax, which begins in October, will apply to most general insurance where the insured risk is in the UK, and is expected to yield Pounds 775m in its first year of operation. Sir John, speaking in the committee stage of the finance bill, confirmed that the insurance element in subscriptions paid to the AA, RAC and other motoring organisations would be subject to the new tax. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour spokesman on financial services, warned that because of the new tax there would be a 'substantial risk' that many people would under-insure when taking out policies on their homes and possessions. A Labour attempt to delay the imposition of the insurance premium tax until a report had been presented to parliament on its effect on policyholders and the future of the industry was defeated by a government majority of 42 (327-285). Clauses in the bill authorising the insurance premium tax,and the increase in income tax arising from the non-indexation of of personal allowances were approved by government majorities of 37. The government secured a majority of 27 (315-288) authorising the use of the parliamentary guillotine to ensure that the committee stage of the bill is completed by March 29. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, accused the government of imposing a timetable designed to prevent Labour mounting a new challenge against the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel.</p>

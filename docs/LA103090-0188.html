			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW HOME SALES OFF 6%; WORST IN 6 MONTHS  </P> <P> Sales of new homes slumped 6% in September, the ninth decline in the last 12  months and the worst drop in half a year, the government said today.  </P> <P> New home sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 503,000 last month,  the Commerce Department and the Housing and Urban Development Department said  in a joint release.  </P> <P> Sales fell 1.8% in August and 0.9% in July. Both figures were revised from  earlier estimates of a 1.4% decline in August and a 0.2% drop a month before  that.  </P> <P> During the first nine months of the year, sales totaled 435,000 homes, down 15%  from the same period of 1989.  </P> <P> Economists viewed today's report as more confirmation of a weak housing market,  attributed to consumers' fear of a recession, high home prices and high  interest rates.  </P> <P> While the weakness was bad news for builders, it was good news for home buyers.  The median price of a new home dropped to $115,000 in September. That was down  from $118,400 in August and $120,000 a year earlier.  </P> <P> In response to the enactment of the budget deficit-cutting package, the Federal  Reserve on Monday nudged short-term interest rates lower. The rate charged  among banks for overnight loans fell to 7.75% from 8%. However, it was unclear  whether banks will pass the benefits of the cut through to consumers,  stimulating home sales with lower mortgage rates.  </P> <P> At the September sales pace, it will take 8.4 months to exhaust the inventory  of unsold new homes, up sharply from a backlog of 7.9 months in August.  </P> <P> By region, the sales decline was worst in the Northeast, where sales dropped  15.6% in September after falling 9.9% in August. Sales shrank 7.9% in the  South, 2.2% in the Midwest and 0.7% in the West.  </P></p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Books: Devious tricks with the thriller genre - Fiction LEVIATHAN by Paul Auster Faber Pounds 14.99, 245 pages PAUL AUSTER'S new novel - his seventh in eight years - epitomises the genre of the highly literate and literary thriller which he has virtually invented. The short novels of The New York Trilogy, published in this country in 1987, and with which he made his name, play devious tricks with the conventions of detective fiction, exploring a shadowy ground on which a novel's narrator becomes indistinguishable from a private eye, and characters' names assume surreal significance. References to the classics of American literature - Melville, Thoreau, Whitman and, most notably in this case, Hawthorne - are repeatedly worked into the texture; and it has frequently been suggested that Auster's work convincingly assimilates the existential scenarios of Kafka and Beckett to traditional American realism. Auster's subsequently published books - with the exception of his curiously inert, sub-Beckettian poems  - use the trilogy's distinctive straight-talking, confiding and inviting authorial voice, and similarly exploit techniques of suspense to unusual and decidedly literate ends. Arguably his most appealing book, the apparently non-fictional memoirs of The Invention of Solitude (published here in 1988) is quite as suspenseful as the novels, and reveals the detective quest as a primary psychological source for this author - who only unearthed the fact that his grandmother murdered his grandfather as the result of a very unlikely coincidence and a great deal of sleuthing. For Auster the workings of chance - those weird Jungian synchronicities we all know so well and on which he built his 'Book of Memory', the second part of The Invention of Solitude - have much more exalted status than that of cogs and wheels for the mechanism of a mystery novel, but they do serve very nicely as that. The complex plot of Leviathan is neatly articulated by a series of amazing coincidences which, separately from their relevance to the novel, Auster invites us to consider as a metaphor for the labyrinthine unknowability of all our lives; and, in his submission, the more thickly the coincidences are laid on, the more essentially true to life the book becomes. The novelist-narrator Peter Aaron (he shares initials, profession, and much else with the author) observes at the point of tightest-screwed coincidence: 'No matter how wild we think our inventions might be, they can never match the unpredictabilty of what the real world continually spews forth.' But after finishing the novel, formidably entertaining though it is, one may not escape the thought that there is no need for a writer to take part in such a competition. For all the interest of its themes - the Hobbesian title and Emersonian epigraph point to the book's preoccupation with anatomising the American body politic; the fascination of characters like the tall, bony, sexual Maria, conceptual life-artist and Austerian 'goddess of the unpredictable'; and the central figure, Benjamin Sachs, who blows himself up in the novel's first sentence and for whose strange career as novelist-turned-pseudo-terrorist the narrative is a tense apology - Leviathan does not offer the deeper satisfactions of literature. Those of the more solidly factual Invention of Solitude are deeper, and that book invites re-reading and pondering in a way that is as impossible for this one as it is for thrillers in general, once the final twist is known. Auster is sunk in the end by the vessel he has commandeered.</p>

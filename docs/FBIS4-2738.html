			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Taiwan Businessman Flees With $92,000"] </F>   [Text] A Taiwan businessman fled Fuzhou last week after  taking away an estimated 800,000 yuan ($91,955) and leaving  behind an empty factory and more than 60 workers with no food  and no place to live.    Cai Shunming, a native of Taoyuan County in Taiwan, stopped  production at the Fuzhou Daguang Paper Products Company Limited  on March 31, saying he was giving workers a six-day leave for  Ching Ming Festival, when Chinese commemorate the dead.    Most workers left for home. But the remaining 60 female  workers knew the next day their boss had fled town when they  discovered the kitchen air blower had been stolen and everything  in Cai's office removed, according to China Business Times.    The company, which was founded last March in the city's  Xindian Town, manufactured tin foil. It purchased raw materials  in China and sold products overseas.    The tin foil products were made by hand by some 300 women  hired from places as far away as Shandong Jiangxi, Sichuan and  Fujian provinces.    When the Taiwan businessman skipped town, he was three  months  behind in payments to his workers and was in arrears for about  110,000 yuan ($12,650) in rent to the local industrial zone, the  newspaper stated.    Before skipping town, Cai subjected his workers to inhuman  conditions according to newspaper reports.    He locked the factory gate daily and forced workers to do  more than 10 hours manual labour daily, some workers said.    Four or five women had to share two single beds nightly by  putting them together. They were forced to take cold-water  baths. They only had porridge and vegetables for three meals  daily.    Cai refused to admit visitors, including local leaders, on  the pretext of being a solely Taiwan-funded enterprise, the  China Business Times quoted a local leader as saying.    The Fuzhou city government is now handling the case and  trying to make proper arrangements for the workers.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> KILLUM SPARKS LYNWOOD IN VICTORY  </P> <P> Lynwood High School's Ernest Killum put his personal punctuation marks on both  ends of his team's semifinal game against Brea-Olinda in the Laguna Beach  tournament Friday night, and he did it with his usual flair -- way above the  rim.  </P> <P> Killum accented the opening minute of the game with a swat. He batted away the  first shot attempted by Brea-Olinda's Keith Walker.  </P> <P> Then with 2:24 left, Killum jammed home a two-handed slam off an alley-oop pass  from point guard Mike Singleton to snap a 53-53 tie. Lynwood (5-0) went on to a  62-56 victory and will meet Compton at 7:30 tonight in the championship game at  Laguna Beach High.  </P> <P> Friday night's first half showcased the matchup of Lynwood's Killum, who  finished with 17 points, and Brea-Olinda's Walker. After watching his first  shot get blocked, Walker returned the challenge by swatting away a couple of  Killum's shots.  </P> <P> Then Walker and Killum put on a two-man slam duel. Walker's 360-degree reverse  dunk off a steal might have been the best, but Killum's first-half jams  featured another alley-oop from Singleton and a soaring tomahawk dunk over the  head of Brea's Rodney Stewart.  </P> <P> Walker led all scorers with 27 points, including three three-pointers, but he  wasn't enough to lift Brea (3-1). Brea's biggest points may have come on Jeff  Roeser's only basket, a soft jump shot that tied the score with 2:55 left.  </P> <P> Brea forged a comeback after Killum left the game with 11 points and four fouls  with 6:38 left in the third quarter. When Killum went out, Lynwood had a  comfortable 40-30 lead.  </P> <P> But Brea cut into that lead on a pair of inside baskets from center Fritz  Wickman (eight points) and a key three-pointer by Walker.  </P> <P> In the other semifinal game:  </P> <P> Compton 74, Laguna Beach 57 -- Laguna Beach cut Compton's lead to 46-42 at the  start of the fourth quarter, but forward Dain Blanton scored 19 points and the  Artists (5-1) fell apart in the final period.  </P> <P> Compton (5-0) was led by sharpshooting guard Curtis Thomas, who had four  three-pointers and led all scorers with 25 points. Compton also got solid  inside play from center Darnell Patterson (15 points) and forward James  Williams (14 points).  </P> <P> In the fifth-place semifinal game:  </P> <P> Corona del Mar 75, St. John Bosco 60 -- Doug Hesse scored 20 points and Mark  Flint and John Paulsen each had 18 for Corona del Mar. Flint also had 11  rebounds. Jon Upham had 14 for Corona del Mar.  </P></p>

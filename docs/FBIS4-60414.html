			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of </F> staff, by Eli Nisan at the Knesset on 24 May -- recorded, in  Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; processed from the Hebrew]    [Text] [Nisan] Two weeks after the implementation of the  autonomy agreement in Gaza and Jericho, can you say Israel is  pleased with the way the agreement is being implemented and with  the deployment of the Palestinian police?    [Shahaq] The Palestinian police is in a process of entering  the territory; this is not completed yet. So far, more than  3,200 policemen came in, and more are to arrive. Those who have  arrived, and I saw them on the ground, came from far away. I  believe they have to study Gaza. They are not familiar with  Gaza and I do not believe they are familiar with policing duties  because they have not been policemen for several years. At the  same time, judging from discussions with the police commanders,  I can say that the Palestinian police commanders understand they  need to be effective on the ground immediately and see to it  that law, order, and security prevail.    [Nisan] Do you believe that the PLO will be able to  establish its control in Gaza and Jericho, vis-a-vis Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad, and prevent  acts of terror against Israel?    [Shahaq] I believe that the PLO realizes that if it does not  establish control over the territory, others will. If others  control the territory, the PLO will have simply failed. I  believe the PLO understands this, and it has a vested interest  in and the ability to attain full control.    [Nisan] As the person who conducted the negotiations with  the Palestinians, do you believe 'Arafat's declarations will  impinge on the continued implementation of the autonomy  agreement?    [Shahaq] I believe that such declarations do not contribute.  Just the contrary, they damage the process. It is irrelevant  which declarations these are. Any declaration that can be  interpreted in more than o6e way, with some interpretations  being of the kind we have heard recently -- justifiably, I  believe -- cause damage. The Palestinian leaders are better  advised to think twice before they issue declarations.    [Nisan] How do you refer to the threats made by Hizballah  after the abduction of Musfata al-Dirani?    [Shahaq] Hizballah made threats and carried out operations  before the kidnapping of al-Dirani. Let us not be naive and  start believing that Hizballah will suddenly attack us only  because we kidnapped al-Dirani. Hizballah has always tried to  hurt us in various locations. I believe we should be on the  alert wherever Hizballah might attempt to attack Israel.    [Nisan] Do you expect an escalation in the north?    [Shahaq] I believe Hizballah will attempt to make good on  its declarations. We must be ready wherever we believe  Hizballah might attempt to take action.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CHINA WATCHER  </P> <P> So Orville Schell now realizes that he has been somewhat mistaken about the  government of China ("The Re-Education of a China Watcher," by Jacques Leslie,  Oct. 15). Hasn't he ever heard of the large-scale executions that took place  there in the 1950s? What about the ongoing genocide against the Tibetans that  has recently intensified?  </P> <P> May we be protected from these naive, starry-eyed "China experts." Their  misinformation is partly responsible for the continual misery of the Chinese  people and our own befuddlement and inaction over events in China.  </P> <P> RICK GARCIA  </P> <P> El Monte  </P></p>

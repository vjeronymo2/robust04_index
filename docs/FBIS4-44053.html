			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rainer Nahrendorf: "No Fair Play in EU </F> Financing"]    [Excerpts] It is said that one does not discuss money, one  simply has it. But Germany has not had any money since  unification. In the European Union [EU] prosperity league,  Germany has fallen from second place to sixth or seventh place;  at the end of 1995 the national debt, including the debts of the  former GDR, will have reached 2.1 trillion marks [DM].  Expenditures have reached the almost prohibitive level of 45  percent of the budget.    We should also not be ashamed to discuss "disparities" in  financial contributions to the EU in front of our European  friends, many of whom deserve our thanks for their support for  German unification and for eastern Germany's integration into  the EU. A good friendship must also include money. The  reduction of the high German net contribution to the EU forms  part of the European agenda.    In 1993, Germany's net contribution to the EU was DM23.6  billion. It is supposed to rise to DM25 billion this year. The  German Bundesbank assumes that it will reach DM30 billion in  1997. Were it not for German unification and the consequent  reflux of EU funds, especially since 1994, Germany's payments to  the EU would have been even greater.    A reduction in the German contribution can hardly be  achieved  by means of a mere increase in the financial reflux from  Brussels and the application of a red pencil to EU expenses,  most of which have already been decided upon. That would  require an alteration to the entire system of financing the EU.  But the government, faithful to the motto "Pacta sunt  servanda," [agreements must be observed] does not dare try to  make the financial principles which the EC heads of state and  government signed in Edinburgh in 1992 and which remain valid  until 1999 the subject of new discussions. In Edinburgh, the  European Council merely tried to induce the European Commission  to produce by 1999 a report on the functioning of the individual  finance system in the EU. [passage omitted]    Helmut Kohl, for whom Europe unification is with good reason  the other side of German unification, wants to achieve progress  in the process of EU consolidation. He is handling the subject  of EU finances with tact. In the Bundestag European debate he  said: "It is true that we, as the economically strongest  country, pay more to the EU than anyone else, because we have  the greatest advantage. But it is also true that in the future,  the concept of EU finances must be geared more strongly to per  capita income in the individual countries. Our aim is that  other member countries with a per capita income similar to ours  should assume more financial responsibility than in the past."  Helmut Kohl, duty president of the EU as of 1 July, will have  to accept the fact that Germany's high net contribution to the  EU is going to be a topic of the election campaign.</p>

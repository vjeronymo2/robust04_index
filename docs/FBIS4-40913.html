			<p>BFN     [Text] The murder of military personnel and state officials  in Tajikistan has become an epidemic. Three republican Internal  Affairs Ministry officials were killed in a Dushanbe suburb the  other day. Two others are still missing. Another 12 people  have been injured as a result of a sortie by Tajik opposition  guerrillas. All this is despite highly encouraging information  arriving from Tehran, where inter-Tajik talks are being held.    [Nikulin] A series of acts of terrorism have been committed  in Tajikistan since the start of June. The principal victims  have been servicemen of the collective peacekeeping forces, the  Russian border troops and the Tajik Defense Ministry. These  incidents worried the public at large. Nobody in the Republic  doubts that these deeds were carefully planned in advance and  that their aim is to destabilize the sociopolitical situation  and to wreck the second round of inter-Tajik talks which has  begun in Tehran.    Concerned at the rampage of crime, foreign missions and  embassies accredited in Tajikistan are taking steps to guarantee  the safety of their staff. The U.S. State Department has even  advised its citizens to avoid trips to this Central Asian  republic for the time being. But, no doubt, the greatest alarm  at the events taking place here is felt at the Russian Embassy.  After all, most of the officers who have been killed by  terrorists have been Russian.    [Sinkevich] As ambassador, I have every reason to state  quite authoritatively, on behalf of my government, that Russia  will not sit idly by. It will take all necessary steps to  guarantee the safety of Russian servicemen and our  fellow-countrymen. Russia reserves the right to use all the  resources at its disposal to this end. We hope that the same  resources will be deployed by the Government of Tajikistan.</p>

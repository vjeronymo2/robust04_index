			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wheway urges holders to accept McLeod bid HAPLESS shareholders of Wheway, the environmental engineering group, yesterday watched their troubled company slide towards the waiting hands of McLeod Russel, the paints production and distribution group, as directors recommended acceptance of its 1-for-10 share bid. At the annual general meeting in Birmingham about 150 shareholders, having just received news of the recommendation, vented resigned wrath against the absent Mr John McGowan, once chairman and chief executive. He has left Wheway with a reported pay-off of Pounds 400,000. 'The entitlements in his contract were bigger than what we settled for,' said Mr Hugh Ashton, the current chairman, as he stonewalled. 'You can't blame Mr McGowan solely for the difficulties into which Wheway has got itself.' Those problems include a 1991-92 pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.5m, qualified accounts, restructured credit lines at what the annual report said were 'very heavy cost,' net bank borrowings of Pounds 14.4m against shareholders' funds of Pounds 15.3m and a share price which tumbled from 140p in 1989 to 6.5p last Christmas. McLeod's shares fell 5p to 95p yesterday, valuing its offer for Wheway shares at 9 1/2 p. They fell  1/4 p to 9 1/2 p valuing the company at Pounds 13.3m. Mr Nigel Openshaw, McLeod's chairman, overcoated and flanked by his executives, watched the shareholders' frustration and felt afterwards that Mr Ashton had come off lightly. Mr McGowan's pay-off he thought was 'astronomical. I don't believe in rewarding failure.' His team is waiting to move in at Wheway. Where that leaves Mr Richard Long, chief executive for three weeks, is unclear. 'I've never met Mr Long,' said Mr Openshaw. 'Probably I'd have one or two questions about his contract.' Mr Long is reported to have received a Pounds 200,000 inducement to join Wheway.</p>

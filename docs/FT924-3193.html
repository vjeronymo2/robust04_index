			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Letter: Building societies - a spread that would be a little too thin (1) Sir, Mr Mark Hull (Letters, December 4) suggests that 30 years ago building societies borrowed money at 4 per cent and lent it at 5 per cent, whereas now there is a 3 percentage point spread. In 1962, the average rate of interest paid on building society shares was 3.7 per cent which, after payment of tax by the building society, equated to a gross cost of 4.46 per cent. The average rate of interest charged on mortgages was 6.61 per cent, a margin of 2.15 per cent. In the first half of 1992, the average cost of shares was 9.04 per cent and the average rate charged on mortgages was 10.9 per cent, a smaller margin at 1.86 per cent. Mr Hull would like a 1 percentage point spread and his manager on the golf course at 3 o'clock. Sadly, neither is attainable at present. A 1 percentage point spread might just be sufficient to cover the management adequacy of a society. However, it would be insufficient to meet rigorous capital adequacy requirements, especially bearing in mind the effect of the recession on bad debts provisions.

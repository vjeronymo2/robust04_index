			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zvornik, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem authorities in  Tuzla, a former major chemical industry centre in northeast  Bosnia, have over the past few days intentionally prevented the  distribution of international relief aid to the civilian  population aiming to cause mass discontent among their own  people, TANJUG learned on Wednesday.    According to well-informed sources in the Bosnian Serb  Republic (RS), this discontent is used as an argument in the  efforts to open up the former military airport in Tuzla on the  pretext that this would step up humanitarian aid.    However, official RS sources confirm that there is enough  food because all international aid for Tuzla passes through  Zvornik, a town near the border with the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia.    In the past ten days only, 13 convoys (a total of 172  trucks)  of the U.N. High Commissariat for Refugees (UNHCR) and the  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) brought 1,400  tonnes of food and medications and 1,200 litres of engine oil  and fuel to Tuzla via Serb-held territory.    However, the bulk of this aid is siezed by the Bosnian  Moslem  army, never arriving in the hands of the tens of thousands of  Tuzla's children, women, the ill and elderly, the Bosnian Serbs  said.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK contractors For some months now the market has brushed aside the sky-high earnings multiples for UK contractors and valued them on their yields and continuing cash flows. For many, another factor in favour was the potential for housebuilding to recover early in the cycle. Yesterday, Taylor Woodrow's chairman, Mr Colin Parsons, effectively told shareholders that this view is wishful thinking. His remarks had an immediate impact elsewhere, with shares of Wimpey, Costain, and Persimmon among several to suffer 5 to 10 per cent falls. Warnings about this year's dividend, thin contracting margins and the subdued level of property sales should come as little surprise to the market. The really alarming feature of Mr Parsons' statement was its implications for Taylor's cash flow. It is there in the gloomy reference to the structural steel plant of Octavius Atkinson. It is apparent from the admission that the contracting side is preparing for a reduced workload this year. And it is obvious from the hint that some of the Greenham wholesaling businesses could be put on the block. The question for investors - given the company's existing development commitments - is whether it can even afford to pay the 5p per share dividend which was being pencilled in for this year. The message is there for the whole sector. It is no coincidence that Mowlem, for example, is now trading on an 11.6 per cent yield even after the payout has been halved. There are implications, too, for Eurotunnel, which will be under no illusions now that the UK contractors with which it is negotiating have anything to give away.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> CULINARY EVENTS OFFER TASTE OF GEORGIA REPUBLIC  </P> <P> When chefs in the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia want to make an omelet,  they break some eggs. But they generally prefer to avoid the whole issue by  whipping up such specialties as mtsvadi (lamb shish kebab), basturma (grilled  strips of marinated beef filet) and lobio, a bean stew that in its rich  creaminess bears a sunny resemblance to refried beans.  </P> <P> San Diegans will be able to taste these and other dishes prepared by a team of  six visiting chefs from Tblisi, the capital of Georgia, at a number of public  events from Oct. 22 through Nov. 4. The visit, coordinated by restaurateurs  Piret and George Munger, is slated as an adjunct to the city's Soviet Arts  Festival that will allow locals to take a bite out of perestroika. Most should  find themselves chewing with smiles on their faces; travelers to Moscow report  that the best of the new, for-profit "cooperative" restaurants specialize in  Georgian cuisine.  </P> <P> The Georgian chefs will close ranks with U. S. Navy mess specialists (that's  cooks to you) at the Naval Training Station's Advanced Food Preparation School  from Oct. 19 through Oct. 21 to prepare the more than 9,000 "tastes" of  Georgian cuisine that will be offered at the Oct. 22 "Super Powers Sunday" in  Balboa Park.  </P> <P> The daylong event, which will feature 3,000 performers on 15 stages and is  expected to attract at least 50,000, will allow those who have feasted their  eyes on the jeweled Faberge eggs at the San Diego Museum of Art to nibble on  grilled sturgeon and sour plum sauce at immense tasting areas set up in the  Plaza de Panama and on the Federal Building lawn. Each tasting area will be  manned by three Georgian chefs, Navy personnel and the staffs of 14 leading San  Diego County restaurants and hotels. An additional 11,000 servings of the five  featured Georgian dishes will be prepared and sold for $2 each.  </P> <P> The Georgian sextet will perform at several more elaborate functions that also  are open to the public, although reservations are required.  </P> <P> The first of these will be Oct. 27 at the UC-San Diego Faculty Club, beginning  at 6 p.m. with a broad sampling of such classic Georgian hors d'oeuvres as  aragvi (a salad of chopped tomatoes, cucumbers and assorted fresh herbs), the  pate-like vegetable pkhali, and turkey with quince jam, and continue with lamb  kebabs and walnut pastries. The cost, including wine, is $45 per person. For  information, call Claus Sellier at 534-1755.  </P> <P> A Georgian Sunday supper will be from 4 to 9 p.m. at the Piret's cafe in La  Jolla Village Square, and will include a full selection of specialties. Cost  per person is $20, excluding wine, tax and tip. For reservations, call the  restaurant at 455-7955.  </P> <P> The American Institute of Wine and Food, the Chefs de Cuisine of San Diego and  the Southern California Culinary Guild will present a reception and banquet  Oct. 30 at the Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel. The Georgian chefs, aided by a  battalion of local cooks, will prepare a complicated menu for the 7:30 p.m.  dinner; the 6:30 p.m. reception will feature caviar and vodka. Cost is $20 per  person for the reception and $35 per person for the dinner; the cost to attend  both is $55 per person. For reservations, telephone Lauren Ash at the Sheraton  at 291-2900.  </P> <P> The Albert Schweitzer School for orthopedically handicapped children will  benefit from a cooking demonstration and buffet Nov. 4 at the patio at Vic's  restaurant in La Jolla. Chef Jim Hill will join his counterparts from Tblisi in  demonstrating the finer points of grilling meats and stewing beans. Caviar  tasting is also included. The cooking exhibition and meal, including wine,  costs $25 per person. For reservations, call Vic's at 456-3789.  </P> <P> Children touring the exhibit of religious icons at the B Street Pier will be  treated to fanciful Georgian New Years cookies baked and handed out by Navy  personnel. The cookies are free, and will be given out from Oct. 31 through  Nov. 3 and again from Nov. 7 through Nov. 10.  </P></p>

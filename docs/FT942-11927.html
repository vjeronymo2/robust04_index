			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strong financials take Frankfurt to record high The absence of British participation took the edge of bourse trading, but German investors seemed happy to do without foreign support, writes Our Markets Staff. Other senior bourse had their problems: technical bugs delayed the Paris opening by four-and-a-half hours; Milan, after extended attempts to clear a blockage in the system, suspended trading for the whole day; and Madrid, taking a local holiday, saw its thunder stolen by a combination of Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia. FRANKFURT hit a record closing high, although strength in financials was offset by a less enthusiastic performance in many cyclicals, and falls in the big three chemicals stocks after profit-taking. The Dax index rose 22.67 to 2,268.5 with German traders especially encouraged by the DM67, or 2.6 per cent gain to DM2,655 in Allianz on a higher dividend, the deep discount on the insurer's planned rights issue and on relief that rumours of a negative weekend magazine article on the company turned out to be unfounded. Brokers also saw switching from chemicals, which saw gains of around 10 per cent on last week's first quarter figures, into financials, where Bayernverein rose DM13 to DM524, Commerzbank by DM7.50 to DM366.50, and Deutsche Bank DM15.30 to DM796.50 as shock waves following the Schneider property debacle continued to diminish. Turnover eased from DM9.1bn to DM7.9bn. In chemicals, Bayer and Hoechst both fell DM4.50, to DM389.30 and DM3.60 respectively, BASF losing DM2.30 at DM327. PARIS finished below its highs after a delayed, but strong start, the CAC-40 index closing 20.27 higher at 2,186.23. Turnover was thin at FFr2.07bn. The market had little time to react to initial issues but it marked its satisfaction with the stake-holding deal involving LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group, Christian Dior and Guerlain, the French fragrance house. LVMH rose FFr15 to FFr944 and Dior by FFr12.60 to FFr425. In the same general area, L'Oreal extended its uptrend with a rise of FFr27 to FFr1,262. Meanwhile, Club Mediterannee, the leisure group, had what dealers called a technical bounce, recovering FFr19.90, or 4.8 per cent to FFr433.90 after Friday's 7 per cent drop. The SBF, the French stock exchange association, said yesterday that that work at the weekend to increase the number of connections to its trading network had disrupted the exchange's software, causing delays in the re-booting of the computer system, writes John Ridding in Paris. The disruption was the latest in a series of technical hitches over recent months, resulting from increased demands on the system and a programme of modernisation. The Paris bourse has seen a sharp rise in trading volume, partly because of the French government's privatisation programme, and an increase in the number of connections demanded by stock brokers. AMSTERDAM saw thin trading with many foreign investors hesitant ahead of today's general election. The AEX index rose 0.66 to 413.92. Chemicals continued their rally. DSM put on Fl 1.90 to Fl 140.30 in advance of today's results while Akzo added Fl 2.60 to Fl 226.30 in continued response to last week's better than expected figures. Philips rose Fl 1.10 to Fl 55.40 amid bullish forecasts for first quarter net profits, due tomorrow: analysts expect profits to rise by up to 200 per cent. In contrast, the dollar's weakness left Royal Dutch Fl 4.10 down at Fl 200.20. ZURICH turned higher, with London's closure removing some of the selling pressure which was evident at the end of last week. The SMI index added 31.9 to 2,768.2. Ciba registered rose SFr31 or 3.7 per cent to SFr868. Brown Boveri put on SFr13 to SFr1,303 on news that Asea had won a German power-plant contract in a consortium worth Dollars 330m, of which around Dollars 240m is earmarked for Asea. Rieter, in textile machinery, added SFr50 to SFr1,780 ahead of today's annual news conference. In telecoms, Ascom rose SFr20 to SFr1,330 as it named a new chief financial officer. MADRID, closed for financial news, heard threats of further revelations on the political corruption front. Based on trading in other Spanish bourses, the Ibex 35 index fell 28.64 to 3,492.09. Telefonica reflected mid-morning weakness on Wall Street with a fall of Pta40 to Pta1,790; but the linked banks, Santander and Banesto, escaped the downtrend with rises of Pta80 to Pta5,890, and Pta125 to Pta1,250 respectively. STOCKHOLM was supported by a firmer bond market and the Affarsvarlden index put on 22.4 to 1,499.9. Pharmacia B added SKr5 to SKr118. OSLO fell 1.2 per cent in response to the weak dollar and the all-share index dipped 7.57 to 626.56 in in thin turnover of NKr265m. COPENHAGEN fell 1.1 per cent with trading dominated by profit-taking in the newly-privatised Tele Danmark. The KFX index fell 1.21 to 108.65 in heavy turnover of DKr1.3bn. Tele Danmark, gave up DKr5 to DKrDKr329, compared with the privatisation price of DKr310. TEL AVIV held its ground after a 3.9 per cent increase on Sunday, the Mishtanim index easing a mere 0.32 to 228.77. Sunday's rise of 8.6 points reflected optimism over Israeli peace prospects with the PLO and Syria. ISTANBUL fell another 6 per cent after a drop of 18.3 per cent last week, the composite index closing 903.83 lower at 14,192.85. The focus of investors' fears moved away from last Friday's suspension of eight brokerage houses, and into uncertainties about the general direction of money markets.

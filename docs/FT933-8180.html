Under the new arrangement, Pacific Dunlop will hold a 51 per cent interest in a new joint venture which will take over and expand a licensing agreement held by the company for Adidas products since 1974. Mr Philip Bass, Pacific Dunlop managing director, said yesterday the new joint venture would significantly improve competitiveness for the Adidas business. 'The joint venture will allow the Australian business to source independently key products specifically for the Australian market which currently are not in Adidas Germany's international range,' he said.</p>

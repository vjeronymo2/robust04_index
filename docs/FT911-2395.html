			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tories braced for West Midlands losses - The battles for local authorities in the Black Country and beyond CONSERVATIVES are on the defensive in the West Midlands as campaigning for the local elections enters its final few days. Labour is confident enough to expect greater control of its urban heartlands and gains in rural Conservative bastions. More than 1,220 seats are being contested in 42 district authorities throughout Gloucestershire, Hereford and Worcester, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and the metropolitan districts of the West Midlands. The whole of the council is up for election in 18 authorities. In the remainder, including the six authorities of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation and Coventry, one third of the council seats is being contested. In these 42 authorities, Labour has control in 15 authorities and the Conservatives in seven. Independents predominate in five - Cotswold, Leominster, Oswestry, North Shropshire and South Shropshire - and the Liberal Democrats in one, Hereford. There are 14 authorities where no party has overall control. Labour has control over roughly two thirds of the regional population. Political analysts will examine any shifts in this pattern of control for the general election implications. The West Midlands is one of the regions where Labour has to pick up more seats to have any hope of winning the general election. But shifts either way will be difficult to assess. Labour has consistently polled more heavily in the local elections of the region than in the parliamentary elections. In Worcester, for example, Labour gained local authority control 11 years ago, but has not held the parliamentary seat since the Second World War. Local elections are often used for protest votes against the party in power at national level: the region's 1987 local election results suggested a Labour gain of about seven seats at parliamentary level. But no such gain was made at the general election five weeks after the local polls. Throughout the region, the Conservatives gained 41 local authority seats in 1987. These seats are up for election on May 2. The Conservative object will be simply to hold on, but analysis of the possibilities, council by council, suggests that more than 45 seats could be lost, nearly half of them in the Birmingham-Black Country area. The most striking loss is likely to be in Birmingham, controled by Labour for the past seven years, where estimates of Conservative decline range from seven to 14 seats. Sir Richard Knowles, the Labour leader, said: 'Odds on we shall win seven seats, possibly 10.' Councillor Reg Hales, the minority Conservative leader, countered: 'We will do better than many expect.' But the authority of most symbolic significance is probably Solihull, the last metropolitan authority controled by the Conservatives. The Conservative MP of this prosperous suburb has a majority of 21,786. However, the Conservatives may not be able to fend off a strong challenge. A probable loss of two of the 10 Conservative seats under contest could put the Conservatives into a minority on the council without giving Labour a clear majority. One of the few councils where the Conservatives have a chance of winning control is Wychavon in Hereford and Worcester. That is due to a substantial local campaigning effort and dents to the Tory whip. However, the role of Independents in the region, particularly important in Gloucestershire and Shropshire, has become a difficulty for the Tories. Where Independents do not control a council, they tend to support the Tories. But their numbers have dwindled as local politics have become more polarised between the larger parties. This year the polarisation, the local political argument, swirls round the two pillars of the poll tax and the provision of local services. Conservatives in the West Midlands were dismayed at the speed with which Labour muddied the impact of the Government's promised reduction for 1991-92 of a Pounds 140 reduction. They have been perturbed at the spectacle of Conservative authorities arguing with the national Government about finance - Warwickshire County Council on its poll tax capping and Solihull on its standard spending assessment, for example. Lack of unity is damaging. Here then is a source of weakness for the Conservatives. The announcement of the council tax has made little difference. It is too remote to restore the damage caused by the disarray. 'The Government is not helping us locally,' said Mr Hales. Hence the campaigning stress on local interpretation of the national Conservative line that Labour councils are wasteful and inefficient. As an example, Mr Hales argued that the Birmingham City Council takes part in enterprising initiatives, like the building of the International Convention Centre, but gets wrong the basic issues like housing, care of the elderly, street cleanliness and so on. When the polls close on May 2, it is not likely that many West Midlands authorities will be under different control. There are the possible changes in Solihull and Wychavon. But Labour is entertaining hopes of extending its power outside the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation and urban centres like Redditch, The Wrekin, Tamworth, Nuneaton &amp; Bedworth, and Potteries towns into rural Wyre Forest and the mixed area of East Staffordshire. In Wyre Forest, where 14 of the the council's 42 seats are part of the election, and where no party now has overall control, Labour has 16 seats against 10 Conservatives, 13 Liberal Democrats and three Independents. All of the 46 seats in East Staffordshire are being contested: Labour and Conservative both hold 22, and the balance is held by the Liberal Democrats.</p>

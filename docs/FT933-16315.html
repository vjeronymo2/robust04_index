			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / EC help on machine tools sought Leaders of Europe's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.6bn) machine tool industry - parts of which are suffering their worst-ever recession - are seeking help from the European Commission to stave off competition from Japan and the US, reports Andrew Baxter. Cecimo, the umbrella body for 12 European machine tool associations, has submitted a paper on a possible industrial policy for the sector to the Commission's DG III division, which covers internal market and industrial policy issues. The document, due to be unveiled in September, represents the first attempt to create what Cecimo calls 'a genuine unified European machine tool sector and not 12 countries looking at their own navel'.</p>

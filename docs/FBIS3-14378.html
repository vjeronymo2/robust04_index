			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuwait [as received], 27 Mar (MENA)--Shaykh Sabah  al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, has praised the stand of the Egyptian leadership,  Government, and people in support of Arab nations' causes and  Egypt's responsibilities in this respect, especially its  honorable and historic stand on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.    At a news conference held at the Arab League this evening on  the sidelines of the Arab League Council meetings, he said Egypt  rejected Iraqi aggression and launched the first formula of Arab  legitimacy rejecting aggression and occupation. He added that  Egypt's stand took shape in an effective participation in  efforts to eliminate the effects of aggression.    He expressed his belief that the Security Council will not  lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq as long as Iraq continues to  disrespect Kuwait's independence and sovereignty, refuses to  implement Security Council Resolution 833, refuses to repatriate  Kuwaiti and other detainees, and refuses to return all property  and compensate those affected by the aggression.    He said: We are all suffering because of the Iraqi people's  suffering but we must emphasize that the one responsible for the  continuation of this suffering is Iraq, which rejects  international resolutions, particularly Security Council  Resolutions 706 and 712, which provide food and medicine for the  Iraqi people.    He added that Iraq is still threatening security and  stability in the Gulf region and is far from fully implementing  all articles of the Security Council resolutions on its  aggression against Kuwait. He went on to say that Iraq  procrastinates and is selective about these resolutions and is  pursuing its repressive measures against its people.    Replying to a question on Kuwaiti detainees held in Iraq, he  said the detainees' files that were forwarded to the  International Red Cross were full and complete but Iraqi  authorities did not allow the Red Cross to visit Iraq and search  for the detainees. He turned down an Iraqi proposal to form a  popular committee from the Gulf countries to visit Iraq for a  fact-finding mission on the detainees.    He said Kuwait has done a great deal for Arab solidarity and  it is not happy with the Arab world's current fractured  situation. But, he added, the Kuwaiti people find it difficult  to accept reconciliation with Iraq unless it implements all  Security Council resolutions.    He noted that he intends to visit the Arab Maghreb countries  soon to improve ties with them. He stressed Kuwait's identity  and its Arab affiliation despite joint military maneuvers with  Western countries.    He said Kuwait will sign a security accord with Russia as  part of its efforts to sign security accords with the Security  Council's permanent members.    The Kuwaiti foreign minister said his country has extended  development aid for the Iraqi people in the north and south and  affirmed that Kuwait does not favor the partition of Iraq. He  said he has good ties with the Iraqi opposition but stressed  that this does not mean an alliance with the opposition to  overthrow the Iraqi regime.    He noted that Kuwait has lifted the boycott in the second  and  third degrees on companies that deal with Israel but affirmed  that Kuwait will not lift the first-degree, direct boycott of  Israel until after Israeli forces have withdrawn from the  occupied Arab territories. He said his country is not prepared  to host Israelis in the framework of the Middle East  multilateral peace talks.    Answering a question on the demarcation of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti  border, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said the territory that was  given to Kuwait by the UN agreement did not result in the  addition of a single inch of Iraqi land to Kuwait and, thus,  Iraq lost nothing because this territory was originally Kuwaiti.    [In an earlier Cairo-datelined report of the news  conference,  Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1538 GMT on 27 March added: "Shaykh  Sabah al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, announced that his country will host a conference of  the Damascus Declaration countries in June."]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Army and the Rwandan  Government forces held an informal joint meeting under the  auspices of UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] at the  Meridien Hotel, Kigali, on 15 April 1994 to explore the  possibility of holding further negotiations between the two  forces to discuss the cessation of hostilities and the  restoration of peace to the country. The military leadership of  the Rwandan Government forces has reportedly now responded to  the conditions for negotiation which are advanced by the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF]. Whereas the RPF appreciates that there  are significant sections of the Rwandan Government forces who  detest the atrocities which have been committed over the iast  two weeks by Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development [MRND] and its allies, the conduct of the Rwandan  Government forces during the current national crisis leaves a  lot to be desired. [passage omitted]    The RPF regrets that the response of the Rwandan Government  forces to the above conditions, which are entirely reasonable,  has been disappointing. The Rwandan Government forces have only  accepted two terms. First, they promised to start apprehending  the people who have been involved in the conduct of the  violence. Second, they agree to the conduct of joint patrols  with RPF for the pacification of the country. The Rwandan  Government forces have rejected outright calls by RPF for the  disbanding of the Presidential Guard and the so-called  provisional government, both of which are largely responsible  for the atrocities which have been committed. The RPF finds the  attitude of the Rwandan Government forces not only unacceptable,  but most disturbing. [passage omitted]    The RPF cannot and shall not agree to negotiate peace with  the Rwandan Government forces while that gang of war criminals  (?represented by) the provisional government still enjoys the  recognition of the Rwandan Government forces. [passage omitted]  In view of the foregoing [word indistinct] the RPF wishes to  reaffirm the following. One, the RPF reaffirms its strong  resolve to fight and destroy the MRND and Coalition for the  Defense of the Republic regime of murderers that is responsible  for the unprecedented genocide and destruction our country has  been subjected to. Two, the RPF further reaffirms its  commitment and patriotic obligation to continue its mission of  liberating all Rwandan people who are still under the threat of  genocide and calls upon all the citizens of our country who are  still outside the [word indistinct] areas so far liberated by  RPF, to stand up in unity and to resist the murderers while they  await rescue by the RPF.

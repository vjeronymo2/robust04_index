			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Drobkov: "Washington Shows </F> Leadership"]    [Text] Washington, 5 Jan -- In a few days' time Bill  Clinton sets off on his first "presidential" tour of Europe. On  Saturday 8 January he flies from Washington to Brussels. There  the head of the U.S. Administration will attend the NATO Council  winter session and meet with the leaders of the European Union.  On 11 January the U.S. President is to meet with the leaders of  Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in Prague. From 12  through 15 January Bill Clinton makes his first official visit  to Russia, and then to Belarus. Then he goes to Geneva, to meet  with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad.    Such a busy program for the U.S. President's European tour  would appear to be intended to demonstrate an active U.S.  foreign policy and Washington's leadership following the end of  the Cold War. At the same time Clinton intends to "pay his  respects" to Europe, whose problems, obviously, were pushed into  the background by domestic political concerns during the first  year of his presidency.    Brussels is intended to be the main area of U.S. foreign  policy efforts during the visit. There Clinton will try not  only to "revive NATO" but also to persuade his bloc allies to  accept the U.S. vision of the future development of the  situation in Europe and, indeed, in the world as a whole.    An important part of this vision is the "Partnership for  Peace" doctrine, proclaimed a few weeks ago. The purpose of  this doctrine is to steer the desire of a number of East  European states to become full members of NATO as soon as  possible in the direction the U.S. wants. While voicing support  for these aspirations, the United States and most of its bloc  partners are in fact not particularly enthusiastic about them.    The point is that, having lost their main potential enemy in  the shape of the USSR, Washington and NATO are concerned about  preserving the former "combat character and spirit" of this  organization -- which the "dilution of NATO" by former members  of the Warsaw Pact would not help at all. Moreover, there are  fears in NATO that new members would bring to the bloc the  chronic disputes and problems of Europe, which have come to the  surface in the most obvious fashion in the course of the  Yugoslav crisis and the endless war in Bosnia.    Finally, Washington and the other NATO capitals obviously do  not want to "tease the Russian bear" needlessly. Indeed, the  bloc's acceptance of Moscow's former allies might in fact be  interpreted as a step intended to establish a new "cordon  sanitaire" around it. The "partnership for peace" is devised in  such a way that "no new lines are pursued in Europe," U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Oxman said.    It was no accident that, at a recent Washington news  conference, senior administration spokesmen tried to demonstrate  when pressed by East European journalists that it is not in  their countries' interests to be trying too overtly to isolate  Russia and that the "success of the Russian reforms" is an  absolutely essential condition of the success of the process of  reforms in their own countries.    But the calls for the bloc's doors to be flung open as soon  as possible to new members -- former enemies -- are not  diminishing. They have grown particularly loud, THE CHRISTIAN  SCIENCE MONITOR notes, since the recent elections in Russia,  which most local observers see as a defeat for the "Yeltsin  reformers" and a victory for "nationalist, procommunist forces."  And the Russian president's proposal on jointly guaranteeing  with NATO the security of the East European countries appears to  have aroused more suspicion than support.    The other day Polish President Lech Walesa even said that  the West runs the risk of bringing about the revival of the  Soviet bloc and the return of communist regimes in East Europe  unless it takes bold steps to incorporate a number of former  Warsaw Pact allies into NATO. It would be a "tragedy," the  Polish president said, if the 10 January meeting of state and  government heads in Brussels did not adopt a precise schedule  for the admission of East European countries to the bloc.    In this situation the need for NATO to devise a common  response to the East European governments' aspirations is  particularly urgent. And to all appearances, the U.S. President  is prepared to pull out all the stops to persuade his bloc  allies to accept the U.S. way of solving this problem --  Washington's "Partnership for Peace" doctrine. But the problem  is that this doctrine has not yet been fully formulated in an  integrated and clear form.    Its general provisions could be described in a nutshell as  follows: It offers the East European countries and the new  independent states, as the former Soviet republics, including  Russia, are sometimes called here, not simultaneous and proud  entry but a stage-by-stage and somewhat humiliating process of  "creeping" into NATO. First the door will be opened just enough  to let in those that are "furthest advanced along the path of  reforms." Then, others can be admitted to the select band of  NATO members as they reach "democratic adulthood." No  exceptions or allowances will be made for anyone -- they will  all have to go through a long and and as yet vague process of  adaptation.    At the first stage the NATO countries will have to  obligingly  agree to participate in joint maneuvers as "aspiring" members.  This could be followed by closer cooperation in the security  sphere. And only then, some observers believe, would it be  possible to start talks on the particular form of NATO  membership. At any stage those wishing to be admitted to the  closed Atlantic club could face "elimination" if its original  participants arrive at the conclusion that one of the new faces  is not sufficiently "dedicated to democracy" or is delaying  market reforms.    According to THE WASHINGTON POST, the U.S. State Department  has already started an "intense diplomatic campaign to persuade  skeptical East European governments to accept the evolutionary  plans for NATO expansion, rather than seek immediate  membership..." The main targets of the State Department's  "attack" are Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, which are  knocking at the bloc's door.    If these countries will not be persuaded by the United  States  and resolutely reject the "partnership" they are being offered,  it could undermine the U.S. enterprise at the 10 January NATO  summit, even if the bloc allies themselves approve it. Anxious  local observers and even some "senior administration  representatives," who traditionally wish to remain anonymous,  are currently warning of this.    On the eve of Clinton's visit Madeleine Albright, U.S.  representative to the United Nations, and John Shalikashvili,  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are going to see the East  Europeans in order to prepare them properly to take on board the  U.S. plan. According to Anthony Lake, adviser to the president  for national security affairs, the purpose of their trip will be  to dispel fears that the Washington "partnership" is intended to  delay the entry of new members into NATO, just to please the  Russian opposition. In fact, Lake tried to show, it will lead  in a evolutionary way to the "expansion of NATO," but not at the  expense of a revival of an East-West split in Europe...    So Bill Clnton's European tour, which begins very soon, does  not promise to be easy. In a changing world U.S. claims to  leadership need to be constantly confirmed by specific actions  or new ideas capable of captivating allies and partners. The  new administration does not have too many of these in its  foreign policy baggage at the moment.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Procedural Status <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 21, 1992, the ASC received a letter of December 16, 1992, from CNMI's Governor requesting a one-year waiver, from January 1 through December 31, 1993, of the requirement to use certified or licensed real estate appraisers within CNMI. Because of the immediacy of the January 1, 1993 implementation date of Title XI and the facts represented in the Governor's letter, the ASC, on December 31, 1992, issued an order both granting CNMI emergency interim temporary waiver relief and soliciting public comment on the request. The interim order was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 6, 1993 at 58 FR 551. No comments were received, and the ASC approved the issuance of the Relief Order on February 17, 1993. The next day, the Chairman of the FFIEC, pursuant to delegated authority, concurred in the ASC's determination, and the Relief Order was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 24, 1993. The ASC found that a scarcity of State certified and licensed appraisers existed on CNMI and that significant delays in obtaining the services of such appraisers were being experienced. Accordingly, the ASC ordered temporary waiver relief for CNMI for the period of February 22, 1993, through February 28, 1994, subject to three conditions described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period of temporary waiver relief, the federally regulated lenders specified in Section 1120 of Title XI, 12 U.S.C. 3349, could use appraisers who are not licensed or certified so long as appraisals are performed in a manner that is consistent with the appraisal regulations, requirements, guidelines and standards of the appropriate Federal financial institutions regulatory agency, as defined in section 1122(6) of Title XI, 12 U.S.C. 3350(6). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Compliance With the Relief Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CNMI, through its Board of Professional Licensing (``Board''), has fully complied with the three conditions of the Relief Order. Specifically, CNMI has taken appropriate steps during the temporary waiver period to alleviate the scarcity of State certified and licensed appraisers in CNMI and the significant delays in obtaining the services of those appraisers and has provided the ASC the three required monitoring reports on a timely basis. In addition, CNMI undertook to notify the ASC promptly of any circumstances that might adversely affect CNMI's compliance with the Relief Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to CNMI's monitoring reports and other contacts between the ASC and the Board, the Board contracted with a firm on March 26, 1993, to provide appropriate prelicensure/certification education meeting Appraiser Qualification Board standards to persons desiring to become CNMI licensed or certified real estate appraisers. As of January 12, 1994, the Board reported that it has issued credentials to two licensed appraisers, one certified residential appraiser and six certified general appraisers, and eight more persons have become qualified to take the next-scheduled Certified General Real Estate Appraiser Examination. CNMI's Board also reported that it has requested the same firm to submit a proposal to offer appropriate continuing education courses to CNMI licensed or certified appraisers. In short, CNMI believes that a scarcity of certified or licensed appraisers leading to significant delays in the performance of appraisals in connection with federally related transactions no longer exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of the foregoing, the ASC finds that a scarcity of certified or licensed appraisers leading to significant delays in the performance of appraisals in connection with federally related transactions no longer exists on CNMI. The ASC requests comment on this finding for a 30 calendar day period and orders the termination of temporary waiver relief to be effective on a final basis 21 calendar days after the close of the comment period, absent further ASC action in the interim. The ASC also orders an extension of the original February 28, 1994 termination date to coincide with the final date of temporary waiver termination as determined under this Order. Thereafter, federally regulated lenders will be required to use real estate appraisers who are temporarily or permanently licensed or certified by CNMI to perform appraisals in connection with federally related transactions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 10, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Diana L.

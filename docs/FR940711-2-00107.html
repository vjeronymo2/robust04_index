After the hearing, SSA had to issue a written decision to the individual (and his/her representative, if any) specifying the findings of fact and conclusions in support of the decision to approve or deny waiver and advising of the individual's right to appeal the decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the court order, SSA began to issue overpayment notices containing all of the aforementioned information and to offer pre-recoupment hearings to all class members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 20, 1979, the Supreme Court held in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Califano v. Yamasaki,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 442 U.S. 682 (1979), that individuals who filed a written request for waiver were entitled to the opportunity for a pre-recoupment oral hearing, but those who requested only reconsideration were not so entitled. Thereafter, SSA applied its revised overpayment notice and pre-recoupment hearing procedures to all individuals who are determined to be overpaid under the title II or Black Lung programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 31, 1981, the court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Buffington, et al. v. Schweiker,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash.) required SSA to automatically schedule pre-recoupment hearings for persons whose request for waiver of overpayment recovery could not be approved after initial paper review. On February 10, 1983, the court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Buffington, et al. v. Schweiker,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash.) approved procedures developed by SSA in response to the 1981 decree whereby pre-recoupment hearings would be automatically scheduled provided that the scheduling would be in writing. The scheduling letter had to contain all the necessary information about the date, time, and place of the hearing; the procedure for reviewing the file prior to the hearing; the procedure for seeking a change in the scheduled date, time, or place; and all other information necessary to fully inform the claimant about the pre-recoupment hearing. SSA began to automatically schedule pre-recoupment hearings in writing in April 1983.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its order of October 19, 1987, the court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Buffington, et al. v. Bowen,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No. 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash.) approved SSA's plan to transfer waiver decisionmaking authority from the processing centers to the field offices for Retirement and Survivors Insurance overpayments. SSA implemented this change in July 1988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Policy Interpretation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Overpayment Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the court decisions, when an overpayment is discovered, the person is immediately notified. The notice includes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The overpayment amount and how and when it occurred;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A request for full, immediate refund, unless the overpayment can be withheld from the next month's benefit;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The proposed adjustment of benefits if refund is not received within 30 days after the date of the notice and adjustment of benefits is available;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An explanation of the availability of a different rate of withholding when full withholding is proposed, installment payments when refund is requested and adjustment is not currently available, and/or cross-program recovery when refund is requested and the person is receiving another type of benefit from SSA (cross-program recovery is not available to residents of New York and Pennsylvania);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An explanation of the right to request waiver of recovery and the automatic scheduling of a folder review and pre-recoupment hearing (commonly referred to as a personal conference) if a request for waiver cannot be approved after initial paper review;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Instructions about the availability of forms for requesting reconsideration and waiver;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An explanation that if the person does not request waiver or reconsideration within 30 days of the date of the overpayment notice, recovery of the overpayment will begin;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An explanation of the right to request reconsideration of the overpayment determination;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A statement that the local SSA office will help him/her to complete and submit forms for appeal; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An explanation that the person receiving the notice should notify SSA promptly if reconsideration, waiver, a lesser rate of withholding, repayment by installments, or cross-program adjustment is wanted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Form SSA&hyph;3105  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Form SSA&hyph;3105 (Important Information About Your Appeal and Waiver Rights) is included with each overpayment notice. The SSA&hyph;3105 further explains the pre-recoupment review process and contains a tear-off form which the person may complete and return to SSA if he/she wants reconsideration and/or waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Delaying Recovery of the Overpayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure meaningful opportunity to contest the correctness of an overpayment determination and/or establish entitlement to waiver, the date on which full refund is due and, if appropriate, the date on which adjustment will begin must be at least 30 days after the date of the overpayment notice. If the individual responds within 30 days after the date of the overpayment notice, SSA must take action to ensure that benefit payments are not interrupted. If the 30-day period cannot be assured, SSA must postpone any proposed recoupment for a longer period. Anytime waiver is requested, SSA stops recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mexican worries hit Lloyds Bank shares were a clear feature with Lloyds, hit by peso weakness, standing out against the general upward trend among the clearers. Out of step with the rest of the clearing banks in what looks to be the traditional rally ahead of the 1994 results season, Lloyds shed 8 to 558p in 2.8m turnover as the problems of the Mexican economy and currency continued to hog the financial headlines. Lloyds' connection with Mexico is not easy to define but among the UK banks it is easily the most exposed to peso concern. Around a fifth of pre-tax profits arise in Latin America, and the bank has sizeable Brazilian associate, Banco Multiplic. However, speculation that the US government may intervene in support of the peso underpinned the feeling among analysts that the market had over-reacted. In marked contrast, Barclays and NatWest added a penny to 615p and 517p respectively while Royal Bank of Scotland advanced 6 to 401p and Bank of Scotland gained 4 to 214p. Among merchant banks, SG Warburg came in for a renewed spurt on the back of a reviving takeover speculation, closing 9 higher at 693p, having touched 700 1/2 p at one stage during the day. Technical trading was cited as the main reason for the advance in theme park operator Euro Disney, which jumped 18 to 141p, to make it one of the day's biggest gains in percentage terms, as traders reporting a short position in the stock. A hefty 3.8m was dealt in the shares in Paris where it is also quoted. Dealers attributed the demand in France to comments by the chairman, Mr Philippe Bourgignon, who said figures for the first quarter to December showed a 'significant' rise on a year earlier. Mr Nigel Reed, a close observer of Euro Disney suggested the rise was around 2.5 per cent and predicted a 12.5 per cent increase for the year to September 1995. However, he reiterated his negative stance on the stock saying, 'We believe this stock is still considerably overvalued.' The post Christmas bounce for crude prices duly washed over into oil stocks  -but only just. BP was the most active counter with the shares up a penny at 431p in 4m turnover while Shell gained 7 to 704p and Burmah added 6 to 805p. Brent Blend climbed back above Dollars 16 in London yesterday in response to Tuesday's rally for crude prices in New York. But dealers said there was still no shortage of bearish stock levels stories in the sector, courtesy of the continuing run of unseasonally mild European weather. Strong selling of pharmaceuticals issues in New York on general profit-taking reversed the early gains in London seen in the first half of the session. Wellcome was in demand early in the day. Its US subsidiary has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to market Lamictal, an anti-epileptic drug and Navelbine, which is used in the treatment of advanced lung cancer. The shares initially firmed 2 before retreating to finish 2 down at 703p, on the US selling. Glaxo relinquished 9 to 664p, while SmithKline 'A' was unchanged at 466p. The same selling also weakened ICI which left the shares trailing 7 at 763p. Hopes of further bids among the regional electricity companies continued to drive several stocks in the sector sharply forward. South West added 9 to 874p, while Yorkshire jumped 18 to 707p. Seeboard was also in demand and the shares finished 15 ahead at 477p. Bid target Northern appreciated 4 to 1010p, and its bidder Trafalgar House edged a penny forward to 75p, in good business of 7.2m Optimism over trading during the festive season brought a cheer to several retailing stocks. Boots put on 9 to 506p while Body Shop improved 9 to 191p. Marks &amp; Spencer was 3 better at 398p. Electrical goods retailer Dixons hardened 4 to 192p. Telecommunications stocks continued to attract attention with both BT and Cable and Wireless gained ground in what for the first working day after the Christmas break was healthy volume. BT rose to 2 1/2 to 384 1/2 p and C&amp;W put on 5 to 390p with the two shares combined turnover topping 5m. Mobile phones group Vodafone put on 2 1/2 to 211p on hopes that the all-important December quarter new subscriber figures (due next week) will make bullish reading. Other statistics, Page 13</p>

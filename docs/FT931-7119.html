			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Hungary toll-road decision TRANSROUTE, the French toll-road operator, yesterday emerged ahead in the bidding to finance, build and operate Hungary's first private-sector motorway project. Hungarian Euro-Expressway, a consortium led by Transroute Internationale, won the tender for a Dollars 210m (Pounds 147.8m) extension of the M1 motorway to the Austrian and Slovak borders, the Budapest authorities announced yesterday. Also participating in the consortium are Banque Nationale de Paris, the French bank, Strabag, the construction group, and OKHB and OTP, two Hungarian banks. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the London-based institution aiding eastern Europe, has also agreed to support the venture in a letter of intent concluded with Budapest. The Hungarian government is limiting its contribution to Ft1bn (Pounds 8.4m) for the acquisition of land along the route. Hungary has an ambitious Dollars 3bn programme to build two bridges across the Danube and nearly 600km of new motorway. Three consortiums have already been shortlisted for a 130km extension costing Dollars 460m (at 1992 prices) to the M5 south-eastern motorway down to the Serbian and Romanian borders. The bidders include the two finalists for the M1 tender and another group led by Bouygues, the French construction company.</p>

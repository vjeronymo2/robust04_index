			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola net advances 20% STEADY volume growth in North America and other developed soft drink markets helped push up net income at Coca-Cola. The soft drinks group lifted income by 20 per cent to Dollars 678m in the second quarter, or 52 cents a share, compared with Dollars 565m, or 43 cents a share, in the same period last year. Sales rose by 10 per cent to Dollars 3.9bn. The group's gross trading margin moved ahead by one percentage point, to 24.5 per cent, as operating cost growth was held in check. Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman and chief executive, said that the 'increasingly accelerating volume growth' of the last three quarters augured well for the future. Newer markets for the world's biggest-selling soft drink showed strong growth, with a 28 per cent jump in volume in China and 35 per cent in Nigeria. Such markets remain small in comparison to overall sales, though, with the US accounting for about half of the total. 'In emerging markets like China, Indonesia and east central Europe, we have only scratched the surface of the consumption potential of huge population centres,' said Mr Goizueta. Unit case shipments inside North America grew by 5 per cent, with volume in gallon shipments growing at the same pace. Unit case shipments elsewhere in the world moved ahead by 7 per cent, and gallon shipments by 4 per cent. The company's shares slipped Dollars  1/4 to close at 44 5/8 in New York yesterday.</p>

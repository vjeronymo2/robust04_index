Is that what your  talks were about?    Stanislav Shushkevich: To start with, I'm very pleased that  that meeting has taken place. It seems to me we were talking in  an atmosphere of mutual trust. I was very pleased with the  attention the Russian president gave to the problems of Belarus  and with his understanding of them.    As for the concrete results of the meeting, we paid  practically no attention to minor tactical problems. We talked  about comprehensive long-term cooperation.    There are urgent matters, of course, and we did give  consideration to them. But there are also matters that need  serious preparation. We paid attention to those too.    What I consider to be the main result is that we agreed that  there is a need for a new treaty between Belarus and Russia. I  think it's obvious to everyone that some points of the treaty of  December 18, 1990, which is still in effect and which was signed  when the Soviet Union was still in existence, don't seem too  serious nowadays. What we need is a document that would provide  a clear and accurate legal basis for comprehensive interaction  between our two countries, help them achieve stabilization and  make their development more dynamic.    Corr.: Do you have in mind military and political  cooperation?    S.S.: Certainly. We discussed the current withdrawal of  strategic nuclear forces from Belarus to Russia and the  possibility of speeding up that process. We also gave detailed  consideration to the latest initiative of the United States and  European nations, known as "partnership for the sake of peace."  And we talked about the participation of Belarus in the  collective security system [of the CIS] as well.    I will first of all say a few words about the latter  problem.  President Yeltsin understands our position, namely that we  cannot fully participate in that system, because the syndrome of  the Great Patriotic War (of 1941-45) and the Afghan syndrome are  particularly painful for us. May I remind you that in both wars  Belarus suffered greater per capita losses than any other  republic of the former Soviet Union.    Boris Yeltsin and I agreed that Belarus mustn't ensure its  own security at the expense of any other state and therefore  decided that Belarus would be gradually incorporated into the  collective security system. By such gradual incorporation,  which would make it possible to solve the problem painlessly,  without giving rise to a confrontation within Belarus, I mean  that we have not yet ratified the Treaty on Collective Security.  We plan to ratify it with some reservations. Our diplomats  should try to make it clear to our partners in the CIS that  those reservations are not a whim on our part but reflect the  actual state of affairs. When Russia realizes that, it will be  easier to bring it home to other signatories to the treaty.    Now, as regards rumors that we have plans to join NATO, we  have never, under no circumstances, expressed any desire to join  NATO, and have never even hinted at that.    As for the withdrawal of strategic nuclear forces to Russia,  we stated once again that everything is going on in conformity  to the former agreements. We are working on a detailed schedule  for it and a detailed treaty on it between our defense  ministries. Belarus is making no direct or indirect conditions  for it. We are deeply satisfied that our position has been  given a good reception in the world. It is not ourselves but  Russia and the United States that have proposed that, when  fissile materials are assigned for civilian use, the part of  their cost which is proportional to the amount of those  materials remaining on Belarusian territory be paid to Belarus  in hard currency.    The only reservation we'd like to make is that, although all  of us would like the nuclear weapons to be taken away as soon as  possible, we may get into trouble if we are in too much of a  hurry to get it done. So we'll make sure that all necessary  safety measures are taken.    Corr.: The peace policy of Belarus is likely to affect the  nature of its armed forces too. However, today Belarus has more  military officers "per capita" than any other former Soviet  republic. How is that problem being solved?    S.S.: That's a very painful and complicated process. We'd  like to have what is, to all intents, a national army. We are  patiently dealing with that task, taking into consideration the  needs and sentiments of both the officers serving in Belarus and  ethnic Belarusians doing military service outside the country  and wishing to return home.    I don't think cutting down the number of officers by decree  is an acceptable way to speed up the creation of a national  army. It's much more in our interest to get something done  without throwing them out and leaving them totally neglected and  embittered.    Yes, it is a complicated process, I must repeat, but it's  under control. We have a special parliamentary commission (the  Commission on Defense and National Security headed by parliament  presidium member Mechislav Grib) that is in charge of it and  pays extremely close attention to it.    Corr.: Did you discuss with the Russian president the  possibility of assistance to Belarus in the protection of its  borders?    S.S.: I did. The point is that, if we wish to have a single  customs area, -which is our aim under our earlier agreements, -  Russia must have guarantees that Belarus doesn't provide a  loophole for bending Russian laws and customs regulations.  First of all, we must take care of our borders with Lithuania  and Latvia (the Polish border is well under control). By the  way, that would be much easier for Russia to do than look after  the Russian-Belarusian border, which is much longer.    Corr.: What are the other priorities that you think Belarus  should have in its cooperation with Russia?    S.S.: Belarus and Russia must have uniform price policies.  Agreement on many points can be reached at the level of  enterprises, without any government intervention. I think final  documents will be basically ready by the end of this month, when  (Russian Prime Minister) Viktor Chernomyrdin comes to Belarus to  sign them.    Corr.: Is Chernomyrdin mainly coming to make a joint  statement with the Belarusian leadership on the unification of  the monetary systems of the two countries, as has been reported?    S.S.: What needs to be done is not to make statements but to  sign a package of documents. If such documents are signed -  there should be six or seven of them - the unification you have  mentioned will materialize. It would be fairly naive to expect  the two monetary systems to be unified instantly.    See the next issue of Presidential Bulletin for the end of  the interview, where Shushkevich speaks about the forthcoming  visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Minsk and the CIS's  development prospects.</p>

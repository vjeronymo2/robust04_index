			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Ulster Tories warn PM over peace initiative Senior Northern Ireland Tories have warned Mr John Major that he may 'destroy himself, the party and the union' by pursuing the peace initiative. In a letter to about 1,000 prominent Conservatives including the prime minister, Mr Leonard Fee, the senior unpaid Tory in the province, claimed Mr Major could 'destroy us all' by allowing himself to be enticed by 'media-hype, Irish blarney' and 'honeyed words'. His warning emerged as the government moved to reassure Unionists on the Major-Reynolds initiative by signalling that it may decide to give the go-ahead for a Northern Ireland parliamentary select committee within the next month. Under current plans, clearance for the committee could be given as a gesture of reassurance to Unionists if London succeeds in agreeing a joint declaration with Dublin to persuade the IRA to give up its campaign of violence. It is thought that a government undertaking to set up a body which has been long sought by Unionists would make them less likely to reject text that emerges from the Major-Reynolds process. An early decision to press ahead with the committee would risk antagonising nationalists, however. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, warned this week that such a move could endanger the Ulster talks process. London and Dublin are voicing mounting confidence that a joint declaration can be agreed before Christmas. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday gave cabinet ministers their first briefing on last Friday's Dublin meeting between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds. In his letter to fellow Tories, Mr Fee, chairman of the party's voluntary wing in Ulster, said: 'If the government agrees to any form of devolved legislative government for Northern Ireland, it will be ensuring the break-up of the United Kingdom. 'The impression is given that 'talks' are designed to produce a solution which will appease the IRA. We do not see how this can be done without going back on the guarantees about Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom  -nothing less would satisfy the IRA.' He said last night that the letter - which he cleared with the Conservative Northern Ireland area council which he chairs - had produced favourable responses from a 'significant' number of Tory MPs. There was further reassurance for Unionists last night when Mr Andrew Hunter, the pro-Unionist MP for Basingstoke, beat Mr Peter Temple-Morris, MP for Leominster, for the chairmanship of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee. In Dublin, a spokesman for the Irish government said it was prepared to make a written commitment to downgrade its territorial claim to Northern Ireland to an 'aspiration' as part of an overall settlement package.

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRL WOUNDED AT DISNEYLAND IS DOING WELL  </P> <P> An 8-year-old girl was reported to be in good condition Monday after being  struck at Disneyland by a bullet that had apparently been fired from a nearby  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Nayeli Diana Placentia is expected to be hospitalized several days for a wound  to her lower back. The Downey girl was hit by a large-caliber round on Sunday  while riding the Disneyland Railroad in the Fantasyland section of the theme  park.  </P> <P> "She's alert and awake. She's doing real, real good," said Fran Tardiff, a  spokeswoman for UCI Medical Center in Orange. "She's a good, quiet little girl  and very cooperative, very pleasant." Anaheim police said Monday that they  believe that the bullet was fired from outside the park, apparently into the  air.  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said the angle of the bullet's trajectory  shows that it originated from the north to northwest, where Ball Road and West  Street are located. But, he added, investigators may never know exactly where  it came from because there is a heavy concentration of homes, hotels, motels  and other businesses in that direction.  </P> <P> Residents and police said Monday that it is not uncommon in that area for guns  to be fired into the air, particularly on holidays.  </P> <P> "It sounds like firecrackers sometimes," said 15-year-old Efren Meraz, who  lives on Michelle Drive behind the Disneyland Hotel. "There's a lot of gangs  here, and they shoot guns in the air and in the ground."  </P> <P> Hedgpeth said a bullet can travel upward as far as a mile, causing injury or  even death when it plummets to the ground.  </P> <P> Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said the train carrying Nayeli, her parents, Jose  and Carmen Ramirez, and some other family members was pulling to a stop at  Videopolis station shortly after 6 p.m. Sunday when she complained of a pain in  her back. The station -- one of four along the rail route -- is near the "It's  a Small World" attraction on the northern perimeter of the 80-acre park. The  family had been riding in the last row of the last passenger car, Roth said.  </P> <P> After the girl's father told the ride operator that his daughter was  complaining of pain in her back, a Disneyland nurse was summoned. The nurse  noticed Nayeli Placentia was bleeding, Roth said, and park officials rushed her  to Western Medical Center in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Doctors discovered Nayeli had been struck by a bullet, and she was transferred  immediately to the trauma center at UCI Medical Center. The bullet was  extracted during a 90-minute surgery.  </P> <P> The Disneyland Railroad was temporarily closed and the passenger car inspected.  It was then that officials discovered a bullet hole in the red and white canvas  roof.  </P> <P> The ride reopened the same evening, and on Monday the canopy was replaced, Roth  said. Park officials questioned passengers on the train, but none reported  hearing a gunshot.  </P> <P> Roth said Disneyland has offered to assist in Nayeli's medical bills.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we feel bad about their experience," Roth said. "It was a totally  freakish accident. It (the bullet) could have landed anywhere. The poor child  just happened to be there." Roth said this was the first incident involving a  park patron being struck by a stray bullet, although there have been two  homicides in Disneyland's 35-year history. A man was fatally stabbed during an  argument in 1984, and another man was shot to death in the Disneyland parking  lot in 1987.  </P> <P> Staff writer Michael Ashcraft contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Mixed signals on the wages front: John Gapper examines the changing climate of pay bargaining in Britain All is not well at Gates Rubber Company in Dumfries. The recession in Britain has depressed sales of Wellington boots and carpet underlay. Workers at the plant started an overtime ban last week after the company delayed April pay negotiations until at least July. 'They have had a lot of good years from us, and they should stick with us in the bad times,' says Mr George McGauchie, president of the GMB general union branch. The discord at Gates is a symptom of the sudden change in the UK pay climate. The uniformity of private sector deals at the end of last year has fractured under the pressures of recession, combined with entry to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Many companies are offering less than the 'going rate' of between 9 and 10 per cent. Pay has been frozen in troubled industries: Trusthouse Forte's hotels, the Guardian newspaper, road haulage companies, and International Business Machines. This change of mood has prompted some hope that reforms of the British labour market in the 1980s have enabled it to respond more rapidly to economic shocks. Confederation of British Industry leaders believe companies have responded to their call to break the link between pay deals and the rate of inflation; ministers have spoken with approval of pay freezes. The CBI believes it has detected a distinct change of behaviour among pay bargainers this year. Manufacturing deals in its pay databank averaged 8.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with 8.9 in the last quarter of 1990. 'With inflation turning down and order books much thinner, the downward pressures on pay have been growing rapidly,' says Mr Robbie Gilbert, the CBI's deputy director of employment affairs. Some unions are feeling a chiller wind. The Amalgamated Engineering Union represents many of the skilled manual workers who did well out of the overheating of the British labour market in the late 1980s. Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, says most settlements reported to the union in the past few week have been about 7 or 8 per cent. 'Once unemployment rises, pay aspirations are overtaken by fears of job loss. That's the incomes policy we've always lived with,' he says. Some managers have grown both more confident about containing pay, and more afraid of the consequences for profitability of not doing so. About 5 per cent of West Midlands engineering companies had managed to freeze pay without provoking industrial action, in the last sounding taken by the Engineering Employers' Federation. 'People have got the message that the economy is not well. They might rattle sabres a bit, but they are not going to go over the top,' says Mr Cedric Thomas, the regional EEF director. As constraints on raising prices have grown because of the recession, companies have looked for ways of offsetting pay increases by other reductions in labour costs. Retailers have cut working hours, and manufacturing companies have tried to raise productivity. W H Smith, the retail chain, raised the wages of 10,000 staff by 8.3 per cent in February; at the same time it agreed a temporary 4 per cent cut in working hours to keep the overall pay bill increase down to 4.3 per cent during the recession. There has also been evidence of the discretionary element in pay through individual merit rises being curtailed. Woolworth ended pay rises for staff completing training courses last month. Together with hours cuts and a fall in overtime working, this has already sharply cut the customary 'drift' in earnings above the level of pay settlements. The example of W H Smith could be followed elsewhere, leading to a national trend for earnings' rises to be below basic pay settlements. But despite these signs that some employers are changing their pay strategy markedly, there are indications that parts of the British labour market are behaving much the same as ever. Pay bargaining early this year is remarkably similar to that 10 years ago during the last recession. The Incomes Data Services (IDS) pay research group reported in January 1981 that most deals were dropping to between 5 and 10 per cent as inflation fell. Four West Midlands engineering companies had imposed pay pauses; pay talks had been delayed for four months at another rubber processing plant, Avon Rubber in Melksham. Mr Alastair Hatchett of lDS says pay settlements so far this year show no decisive break with the past. Deals have been spread over a wider range but at a uniformly lower level. Most during February and March were at more than 9 per cent, although the proportion worth above 10 per cent fell to less than a third. There are still high pay deals in the public sector, in the retail sector and even in manufacturing where companies are negotiating changes in working practices. The public sector is still catching up with the surge of private sector pay in the past two years as comparability deals - based on private sector rises  -take effect. Although health service groups covered by pay bargaining are being offered settlements of about 7.9 per cent, there have been rises of up to 14.6 per cent for National Health Service ancillaries. Pay offers to more than 300,000 civil servants provide for rises of between 7.6 and 7.8 per cent from April 1 in a month when inflation is expected to fall to below 7 per cent. A second form of pay lag can be seen in the private retail sector, where companies are still settling at high levels because of job evaluation studies carried out to protect companies from equal pay claims from women staff. This is proving expensive for many employers. The supermarket chain Tesco agreed a pay deal worth between 13 and 14 per cent in February; rises of up to 17.7 per cent were given to the female-dominated jobs of sales assistant and till operator. This is one reason why the pay clampdown has been less pronounced in the service sector than in manufacturing this year. Mr Bill Connor, deputy general-secretary of the shopworkers' union Usdaw, is less daunted by the recession than Mr Laird. 'I would not say we are ecstatic, but we are quietly pleased at the level of settlements so far this year,' he says. Although deals have been worse outside food retailing, he says the union is 'not disheartened yet'. Nor have manufacturing companies abandoned the 1980s habit of giving big pay rises in return for changes in working practices which will raise productivity. Imperial Chemical Industries last month offered its 23,000 manual workers a 12 per cent rise in basic pay over two years for agreeing flexible working; Lever Brothers, the detergents subsidiary of Unilever, has offered workers a 12 per cent rise in exchange for wide-ranging changes in working practices. Perhaps the biggest uncertainty raised by the holding down of pay in the private sector is the pressures it will create for the future. The staging of pay rises to reduce the overall wages bill this year will in turn add to next year's costs. Michelin offered workers at its Stoke-on-Trent tyre plant an 11 per cent rise last month after imposing a pay pause at the start of the year. Similar pay clampdowns in the last recession led inexorably to catch-up rises later on. All this suggests that economic pressures may have fractured many of the conventional approaches to pay bargaining of the 1980s without establishing a coherent reform. Some workers have been forced to accept lower wage rises by fears of unemployment and cost pressures on companies. They are likely to be storing up demands for the future. Other employees are emerging from recession with relatively little difficulty because their employers are profitable or their skills are still rare. The test for employers such as Gates Rubber Company may come later this year if recession eases as inflation falls. The demands of exchange rate stability inside the EMS suggests wage increases must stabilise at below 5 per cent. If the engine of wage growth in the British economy has settled into a lower gear after this year's shocks, they may do so. If the engine has only stalled for a time, there will be another acceleration to face.</p>

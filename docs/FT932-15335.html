			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Letter: Another Islamic bank in Europe Sir, John Gapper's article 'UK acts against Islamic bank' (April 1) begins: 'London-based Albaraka International Bank, the only Islamic bank in Europe. . .' In fact there is in Copenhagen an entirely separate bank run on Islamic principles - the A/S Islamic Bank International of Denmark - which I was visiting just last month.

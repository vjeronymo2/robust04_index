			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian prime minister has proposed that Russia  and Israel cooperate on military and defense issues. In a  meeting between the prime ministers of both countries this  morning, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin denied  reports that Russia is going to sell arms to Syria. IDF Radio's  correspondent Qobi Meydan reports from Moscow:    [Begin recording] [Meydan] Israeli sources described the  meeting between the Russian and Israeli prime ministers as good,  even excellent. The highlight of this meeting was Russian Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin's proposal for military and defense  cooperation with Israel. At the same time, Mr. Chernomyrdin  denied that Russia is about to sell arms to Syria. When the  issue came up, the Russian prime minister, after denying such  reports, turned to Rabin and suggested that Israel purchase  weapons from the Russians. Rabin, for his part, raised some  additional issues.    [Rabin] I raised several issues in the hope that Russia,  which is currently resuming its activity as cosponsor [last word  in English] of the negotiations, will help us reach agreements  first with the Palestinians and Syria -- which of course are the  two key issues -- and then with Jordan and Lebanon. We also  hope that Russia will use its connections with Iran, Syria, and  other Arab countries to create an atmosphere conducive to peace.    [Meydan] Viktor Chernomyrdin said that Russia will remain an  active mediator in the Middle East peace process, just as it has  been active in other areas of conflict, such as Yugoslavia. The  two men also discussed the recent tension surrounding Russia's  uncoordinated involvement in the peace process. Both sides  preferred to withhold comment on this.    As for economic issues, a series of agreements, from  agriculture to culture and science, were signed at the meeting.  The trade agreement between Russia and Israel has still not  been signed. The Russians are pressing to sign the trade  agreement in the course of Rabin's visit, perhaps by tomorrow.  Experts are currently at work formulating the agreement. The  problem is Israel's fears of Russia flooding the local market  with cheap products. Prime Minister Rabin, who realized how  important this is to the Russian officials, instructed the  Israeli team to step up its efforts to find an acceptable  formulation that will allow the agreement to be signed.    At the Jewish Agency building in Moscow, Rabin met with  Russian immigrants due to fly to Israel tonight. He also met  with a group of Hebrew teachers from various CIS republics.  Rabin told everyone that despite all the difficulties, their  place is in Israel. [end recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1005 GMT on 25 April,  in  a report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz, adds that "a  high-level Russian delegation, including several government  ministers, left for Syria this morning in order to discuss  future arms deals; however, Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin  categorically promised his guest Yitzhaq Rabin that it had been  authorized to discuss only the sale of spare parts for arms  Syria already possesses and not arms deals for new weapons."  The report adds that "Rabin told his host that Ron Arad is  being held either by Iran or by an Iranian element in Lebanon"  and that "Chernomyrdin promised that Russia will do everything  in its power to come up with information on this matter.  Another issue discussed was the sale of a Russian power plant  to Iran. The Russian prime minister promised that the plant  would supply only electric power and plays no part in Iran's  attempts to attain nuclear capability." Qol Yisra'el notes that  "the Russians continue to support sanctions against Iraq, a fact  that was also welcomed by the Israeli delegation."]</p>

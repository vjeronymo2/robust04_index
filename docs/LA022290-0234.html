			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> THATCHER LUNCHES WITH OLD FOE  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher put aside old political wounds and went to a  lunch honoring former Prime Minister Edward Heath, whom she defeated for the  Conservative Party leadership 15 years ago.  </P> <P> Heath's bitterness has never waned. He refused to serve under Thatcher and has  kept up steady criticism of her policies.  </P> <P> But he welcomed her in the Savoy Hotel Wednesday, and they chatted amiably  among more than 500 guests marking Heath's 40 years in the House of Commons.  </P> <P> Heath said he was "very touched" that Thatcher had found the time to be there.  But he found his old self quickly enough, criticizing the government for  shuffling its feet on the reunification of Germany.  </P></p>

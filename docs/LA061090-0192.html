			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOE PAYING U.S. LOBBYIST $800,000  </P> <P> Liberian President Samuel K. Doe, his capital under siege by rebel soldiers,  has retained a Washington lobbyist for $800,000 to represent his interests  here.  </P> <P> Doe hired Van Kloberg &amp; Associates starting June 1. The firm's owner,  Edward van Kloberg, flew to Monrovia last week to finalize the deal, a  spokesman said.  </P> <P> "Doe doesn't need public relations right now, obviously," spokesman Mike Hogan  said. But Liberia's embassy in Washington has been shut down since the fighting  intensified in recent weeks, and Doe needed someone to represent him here.  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Guinness's stout-hearted revolution Four years after its launch, canned Draught Guinness is firmly established as the most successful new product introduced in the UK beer industry for more than a decade. More than 250m cans - fitted with the widget that gives the stout a taste and appearance close to that of a bar-room pint - have been sold since 1989. This month, Sweden became the 51st country to import the product. It is a bestseller in markets from the US to Hong Kong. In the UK, Guinness's innovation has not only been good for the company, it has revolutionised the take-home beer market. The difficulty of replicating the characteristics of draught ale and stout in bottles or cans helped lager achieve even greater dominance of the take-home sector - where it accounts for nearly two-thirds of volume - than of pub beer sales. The Guinness in-can system, which won a Queen's Award for Technology in 1991, has changed that. Work on the project began in the mid-1980s when the company revived the image of its draught stout to make it more appealing to younger pub-goers. 'We thought how wonderful it would be if we could also make it more appealing to take-home drinkers,' says Brendan O'Neill, managing director of Guinness Brewing Worldwide. 'Being a brewer which does not own pubs is a great incentive to innovation.' More than 100 methods were tested. The researchers even tried pouring the beer through nylon stockings and from a can with a spout lined with sandpaper. Five years and Pounds 5m later, they found the answer: a plastic chamber, with a minute hole, fixed at the bottom of the can. During filling, some beer is forced into the chamber under pressure. When the can is opened the beer surges out, creating the bubbles that form the creamy head. Guinness discovered that the system worked equally well in a can of ale  - and promptly launched its own brand of canned draught bitter. Other national brewers rushed to develop their versions of the Guinness widget. Whitbread, having failed to persuade Guinness to license its system, developed its own system for canned Boddington's bitter and Murphy's Irish Stout. It has recently been extended to Flowers and Castle Eden ales and to Marston's Pedigree bitter. Courage has launched its variation on the theme in canned draught John Smith's bitter, backing it with a Pounds 6m campaign. Carlsberg-Tetley has now launched canned Tetley bitter in the north of England. The new canned beers - priced at least 20 per cent above the original packaged products - have given a further fillip to the take-home trade, already growing fast as drinking habits change under such influences as the drink-driving laws, ageing population and increasing home entertainment facilities. Whitbread estimates the new draught-in-can stout and ale brands now account for 14 per cent per cent of take-home beer sales by volume and 22 per cent by value. Their share of the sector is expected to double by 1966. Guinness has demonstrated its confidence in the growth of the market for its stout by investing Pounds 30m in canning lines at Dundalk, Ireland and Runcorn, near Liverpool, where the facilities will be capable of producing 2m cans daily.</p>

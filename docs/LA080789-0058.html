			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MAHAFFEY GETS FIRST WIN SINCE 1986  </P> <P> John Mahaffey shot a six-under-par 65 Sunday to win his first PGA event in  three years by rallying to take the Federal Express St. Jude tournament at  Memphis, Tenn.  </P> <P> The victory was the 10th of Mahaffey's PGA career but his first since the 1986  Tournament Players Championship.  </P> <P> "It's been a long time since I had won and I think I had become complacent," he  said. "When I went out there today I wanted to be as aggressive as I could."  </P> <P> Mahaffey, who trailed third-round leaders Bob Gilder and Bernhard Langer by  three shots entering the final round, took the lead for good with a 25-foot  birdie putt on the 15th hole and padded his lead with another birdie on No. 17.  He finished at 12-under-par 272 and earned $180,000.  </P> <P> "He (Mahaffey) played well," Gilder said. "He went out and won the tournament."  </P> <P> Gilder, the last player with a chance to catch Mahaffey, bogeyed the last two  holes and fell into a four-way tie with Langer, Hubert Green and Bob Tway at  275.  </P> <P> Green tied Doug Tewell's course record with a 63 despite bogeys on the last two  holes. Tway had a 69 and Langer shot a par 71.  </P> <P> Mahaffey went ahead to stay on No. 15 when he made a 25-foot birdie putt to  move to 11-under, then added a 15-footer on No. 17 and parred the final hole  for his 65.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel ended a four-year winless streak by making 18 consecutive pars for  a 71 and a four-stroke victory over Sherri Turner in the Greater Washington  Open at Potomac, Md.  </P> <P> Daniel earned $45,000 to move past Pat Bradley and into third place on the  LPGA's earnings list this year. She took a four-shot lead into the final round  and never faltered in finishing at eight-under-par 205 for 54 holes.  </P> <P> The last time Daniel had 18 consecutive pars, in 1985, was also the last time  she won an LPGA event.  </P> <P> "It was the same type of tournament," she said. "I had a lead going into the  final round and nobody charged. It was just a matter of me hitting fairways,  hitting greens and making pars."  </P> <P> Turner came out of the pack to finish second with birdies on three of the last  four holes for a 65, the best round of the day.  </P> <P> Jane Geddes shot a final-round 68 to win the British Women's Open at Ferndown,  England, by two strokes, becoming only the third player to win both the United  States and British national championships.  </P> <P> Tom Shaw sank a 2 1/2-foot par putt on the 18th hole to win the U.S. West  Showdown tournament at Jeremy Ranch, Utah, for his first victory on the PGA  Senior Tour.  </P></p>

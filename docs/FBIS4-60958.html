			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Razgulyayev report: "Askar Akayev Talks Beautifully"] </F>   [Text] Bishkek -- The April session of the Kirghiz  [Kyrgyz] parliament began in traditional fashion with the  question of the early resignation of a group of deputies. Once  again it involved Russian deputies and once again it was "in  connection with their emigration from the republic." This time  some very well-known people are leaving Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan].  They include A. Yezhov, who had headed the major  "Yuzhpolimetall" Association, V. Sergeyev, chief physician at  the Osh Oblast Hospital....    President A. Akayev often says that the main reasons for  emigration by the nonnative population are economic. That is  probably so. But this clearly does not apply to V. Sergeyev,  much less to A. Yezhov. The session, of course, did not hear  from them or go into the reasons for their departure. It simply  rubber-stamped the proposed resolution. But in the lobbies this  latest emigration gave rise to a lot of discussion. And very  heated discussion at that.    The fact is that, on the initiative of President A. Akayev  himself, a package of documents was recently drawn up aimed at  halting this process which has already considerably damaged the  young state. It includes proposals on the creation of joint  ventures with Russia and interstate investment funds. There are  also some draft documents on the full functioning of the Russian  language and on a balanced cadre policy. Everything seems  correct. But, on the other hand, it is no secret that in real  life all non-Kirghiz continue to be pushed out of leading  positions and are being discriminated against in commerce and  the financial sphere.    And here is one last fact. V. Verbkin, deputy leader of the  president's press service, has tendered his resignation "in the  light of persistent suggestions that I quit." He was one of the  last non-Kirghiz on the upper floors of the "White House." He  has spent his whole life here, his love for his homeland knows  no bounds, and he even has a Kirghiz wife. As far as V.  Verbkin's professional qualities are concerned, he was one of  the organizers of the president's election campaign. He is  rightly considered to be a "walking encyclopedia" on all aspects  of the republic's political life.    The process of elbowing out non-Kirghiz has already gone so  far that, for instance, nobody even attempted to explain to V.  Verbkin the reasons for his dismissal. "Let him go..." has been  the indifferent comment on the decision.</p>

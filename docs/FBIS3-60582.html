			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Vitaliy Yakovlev, deputy chief </F> of staff of the Russian Defense Ministry's Main Directorate, by  Aleksandr Zhilin, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's military commentator, in  the "Expert Appraisal" column: "The Winged Chernobyls"]    [Text] More than 600 aircraft-based cruise missiles are  located on Ukraine's territory. And although at present they  have no flight missions, specialists believe that combat use of  such missiles is quite possible. For this to happen it is  enough for strategic bombers to deliver them to an enemy's  territory and carry out emergency dropping. There will be no  "classic" nuclear explosion but the radioactive pollution of the  territory will be almost the same as with one. The probability  of such a dangerous course of events is discussed by Major  General Vitaliy Yakovlev, deputy chief of staff of the Russian  Defense Ministry's Main Directorate, in a talk with MOSKOVSKIYE  NOVOSTI's correspondent.    [Zhilin] There has been much controversy over the Ukrainian  nuclear charges. What can you say about this as a specialist?    [Yakovlev] Nothing reassuring. Today there are  approximately 2,000 nuclear charges in Ukraine. Their technical  condition can no longer be called satisfactory. Their warrantee  service life is not more than six years, and some it is already  running out. This calls for constant attention by maintenance  and service personnel. In particular it is necessary to replace  the obsolete components with new ones, which Ukraine does not  have.    [Zhilin] But the Ukrainian nuclear warheads are serviced by  Russian specialists.    [Yakovlev] Were serviced. After the Ukrainian parliament  legitimized its ownership of the nuclear weapons and its defense  minister issued orders to place the so-called S-type  installations under his control, the Russian Defense Ministry  lost the possibility to monitor the condition of the nuclear  ammunition. There are no more Russian military units there. In  other words, Russia can no longer be responsible for nuclear  security on Ukraine's territory, while the latter for its part  is incapable of ensuring nuclear security in handling these  charges.    [Zhilin] What specific dangers does this involve?    [Yakovlev] Even the chief designers will not answer this  question accurately. Nuclear charges whose service life has  expired may not be safe to dismantle. Neither scientific  research nor practical tests have been conducted on this count.  No one could even expect such circumstances to arise.    In the current year designers and our specialists have  visited a nuclear ammunition depot in Pervomaysk. The warheads  there have begun to "run a high temperature." The reason is  violation of the storage conditions. In particular there were  eight times as many warheads in the storage as is allowed by the  rules. The chief designers in their report insisted that all  them be urgently sent for destruction. But the Ukrainian side  did not agree. It should be noted here that the rules for  storing nuclear weapons are being breached not only in  Pervomaysk.    [Zhilin] If the expired service life makes the dismantling  of nuclear warheads so dangerous, why then should Russia do it?    [Yakovlev] This is exactly what we have been talking about  with our Ukrainian colleagues. If all the agreements on  destroying the Ukrainian nuclear weapons concluded in Massandra  are thwarted and the guaranteed service life expires, it is not  ruled out that Russian enterprises may refuse to process the  warheads.    [Zhilin] Does Russia supply components to replace the old  ones on Ukrainian nuclear warheads?    [Yakovlev] Russia will supply them if Ukraine strictly  adheres to the Massandra agreements.    [Zhilin] Can Ukraine use the nuclear forces for military  purposes?    [Yakovlev] Last May part of the strategic bombers and also  nuclear technical units operating approximately 600 air-based  strategic nuclear charges swore the Ukrainian oath of  allegiance. This means that Ukraine became potentially capable  of using air nuclear weapons. True, to this end it has to  resolve a number of technical problems. But as radiological  weapons these charges can be used already now.    [Zhilin] What is the way out then?    [Yakovlev] There is only one: observance of the Massandra  agreements. The Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy is  ready to dismantle all the nuclear charges stationed in Ukraine  within 24 months.    [Zhilin] Can a situation arise wherein the nuclear warhead  will "go" from Ukraine's territory to other countries?    [Yakovlev] I would like to stress once again that Russia  does not control the condition and maintenance of these charges.  In other words, should this happen, we may not even know about  it. These are dangerous games fraught with a terrible disaster.  I am saying this not as a politician but as a specialist on  nuclear weapons.</p>

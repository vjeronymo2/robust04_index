			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (2): The picture is changing - Mexican Perspective / Emigration The helicopter of the US immigration patrol is hovering above, its bright lights illuminating the farmland below. About 30-40 Mexicans - including about 10 women and a couple of teenagers - are getting ready to jump. Leaning against the new eight-foot corrugated fence that separates the Mexican city of Tijuana from the US is Mr Jorge Sanchez, 30, a mechanic from Guadalajara. He is the sort of worker the Mexican government says will stay south of Rio Grande were the North American Free Trade Agreement passed, and more jobs created in Mexico. But opponents of Nafta, and many academics, suggest that Nafta will encourage even more Mexicans to cross the border. Just as migration has increased since Mexico opened its country to trade in recent years, many economists point out that the free trade agreement will expose Mexico's remaining protected and inefficient sectors to competition - most notably agriculture, but also manufacturing - and could put hundreds of thousands of more labourers out of work. Mr Sweder van Wijnbergen, former chief Mexico economist at the World bank, and Mr Santiago Levy, now a senior official in Mexico's trade ministry, calculated in a recent paper that freeing maize prices could force some 700,000 Mexican corn farmers out of work. Mr Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimates that the treaty may increase Mexican emigration to the US by 600,000. Mr Wane Cornelius, director of the Centre for Mexico-US Studies at the University of California, San Diego, takes a more sanguine view of the effects of Nafta on immigration, reckoning such studies exaggerate the dependence of rural workers on income from selling maize. He says that in the longer run immigration may fall when Nafta reduces the wage gap between Mexico and the US and creates jobs for displaced farmers in Mexican cities. But with wages in Mexico about one eighth of those in the US, this is sure to take a long time. What is certain is that immigration is not falling by significant amounts despite the US recession last year and more border patrol agents, fences, and other mechanisms to reduce illegal immigration. Last fiscal year, the Border Patrol apprehended 1,140,574 illegal migrants, compared with 1,077,511 in 1991. Such figures overstate the number of migrants trying to cross the border, given that the typical illegal worker will attempt to cross three or four times before succeeding. But according to the Colegio de la Frontera, a leading research centre for immigration, the flow of immigrants trying to cross into the US has remained unchanged recently, at about 300,000 a year. What has changed is the type of immigrant. While the vision of the wetback crossing the Rio Grande to look for work as a tomato picker was always exaggerated, surveys now show that most immigrants work in service, construction or light manufacturing sectors rather than in agriculture; most have left jobs in Mexico; stay more than a year in the US; and, increasingly, most are female. Mr Sanchez, for example, is relatively educated, having stayed at school until 17. He comes from a large city, rather than the countryside and he intends to work in a Los Angeles factory or restaurant, rather than pick oranges. He has also brought his wife. Mexico, which has traditionally seen migration as an escape valve for those unemployed, is now losing some of its more productive workers. Because these workers stay longer in the US, and therefore often take their families with them, they are less likely to send so much money back to Mexico, an important source of external finance for the country. For the US, while immigration is becoming spread through different sectors of the economy, it remains concentrated in certain parts of the country. One half of the immigrants go to California. Mr Cornelius says that the shift from a single, male, temporary, migrant to the longer-staying migrant family 'will increase the effects of the Mexican immigration population on housing, schools, and health-care systems in localities that attract large numbers'. As immigrants stay longer, their presence, he says, has raised racial tensions in some communities. The change in Mexican migration has numerous causes. The demand for cheap labour has shifted in the US, with agricultural needs being overtaken by household work, construction and light manufacturing. According to a survey by Mr Cornelius of migrants from three rural villages, just 21 per cent worked in agriculture in 1988-89, down from 55 per cent in 1976. It has also become more expensive to cross the border than in the past, meaning that very poor Mexicans cannot afford the trip. Mr Jorge Bustamente, head of the Colegio de la Frontera, reckons it costs about Dollars 200 to reach the border from the interior of Mexico - excluding the implicit cost of lost working days. Because of increased border patrol vigilance, it takes on average three or four attempts before a successful crossing is made, from one or two attempts a few years back. The increased difficulty in crossing the border encourages immigrants to stay longer in the US, so as to recoup their fixed costs of travel. An illegal immigrant now stays an average 1.5 years in the US, up from the traditional period of four or five months. The US Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 has also played its part. The act legalised some 3m illegal immigrants - most of them Mexican - and encouraged them to bring their wives and family from Mexico. Partly as a result some half of the Mexican immigrants who settle in the US are now women. The act penalises employers who hire workers without legal papers. Rather than deter immigration, this has led to a thriving market in forged papers, still further increasing the cost of immigration. The necessary working papers can cost another Dollars 200-Dollars 300.</p>

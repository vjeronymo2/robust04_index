			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Chinese investors take to the streets TENS of thousands of stock speculators yesterday rampaged through China's southern city of Shenzhen to denounce alleged corruption over share allocations, witnesses said, Reuter reports from Shenzhen. In some of the worst violence to hit China's brief but turbulent flirtation with stock market capitalism, protestors chanting 'down with corruption' kicked and beat plain-clothes police, set a van ablaze and overturned several vehicles. Near-hysteria has gripped the industrial city, which borders Hong Kong, since up to a million potential capitalists invaded Shenzhen at the weekend trying to buy share application forms. Egged on by official media reports of ordinary Chinese making fortunes in stock trading, vast numbers of investors have tried to cash in on both soaring markets. Allegations in Shenzhen of official corruption abounded. 'We're angry,' said one protestor. 'Police used their power to get their relatives into the best places in the queues.' Riot police fired at least 10 teargas shells in one part of the city, which is a showcase for China's reform drive, to try to control the crowd. In another area few police were visible and demonstrators chased off a group of about 10 officers watching helplessly from the edge of seeking a highway. Shenzhen, a booming city at the forefront of China's drive to modernise, has come to symbolise the economic reforms of Deng Xiaopeng, the senior leader. But the sale of forms, which entitled investors to apply for shares to be issued on the Shenzhen stock market in the 1992-93 financial year, degenerated into turmoil at the weekend. Police reported one person was crushed to death in Sunday's mayhem, although the authorities later denied anyone had been killed or seriously injured in the stampede for forms. Thousands of investors failed to get any forms, even though 5m were officially on sale and by yesterday evening trouble had begun. Police shouted over loud-hailers that more forms would go on sale today but few demonstrators believed them. At least six vehicles were overturned including a police car while protestors set a van on fire. China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen have had a turbulent history since they reopened officially in 1990 and last year respectively under China's free-market reforms. Shanghai trading has been marked by several stampedes, while two men were murdered earlier this year in Shenzhen as gangsters fought over positions in queues of share buyers. Shenzhen authorities later launched a series of swoops to arrest hundreds of gangsters in the special economic zone. Analysts say it is vital for the authorities to restore order on the markets. With backing from Deng Xiaoping, the senior leader who visited Shenzhen early this year, stock markets have flourished in recent months and prices have soared. The analysts also say any such disorder gives hardline conservatives in the leadership ammunition in their fight against reform and they note even Deng said the markets should be closed down if they proved a failure.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Arts: Jilted John's comeback - Off the Wall AROUND midnight tonight, the Perrier Pick of the Edinburgh Fringe Award will be presented to one knocked-out comedy performer. Whoever wins will collect Pounds 2,000, a London showcase - and the inside track to a television series. The Perrier is a useful filter, reducing more than 500 Fringe productions to five must-see acts (although this year's show list is more 'I might as well pop in' rather than 'Give me a ticket or I'll kill you'). The list contains two traditional stand-ups - Jo Brand and Mark Thomas, who both are appearing in the Assembly Rooms. Brand is a balls-breaker whose self-deprecating view of herself is nothing compared with her disdain of men. She reduces them to quivering wimps. Thomas is a cross between Ben Elton and last year's winner, Frank Skinner. He is not as maniacally right-on as Elton, or as agreeably filthy as Skinner. I found him too self-satisfied for words; he relished his 'this will shock you' routine too much. I can't see the winner in these two. Steve Coogan and John Thomson are combining their talents at the Gilded Balloon. Both have agreeable caricatures, especially the student-hating drunk of Coogan. Thomson is totally original as Bernard Manning's alter ego, Bernard Right-On. All the familiar dirty jokes have clean, happy, wholesome endings  -weird, but it works. The outsider is Bruce Morton, who is more a conversationalist than a wit. He digresses at the Rifle Lodge about the Seven Deadly Sins. It is rather like sitting next to a diverting character at dinner, agreeable rather than transfixing. Morton is probably too minimalist to win, but his show has charm. Which leaves John Shuttleworth at The Pleasance. Shuttleworth is a dreadful northern comedian, the kind you might find on a Monday night in the least popular club in Batley. He dedicates his dire songs to his wife, Betty, and sings off-key. He could win the Perrier because he is really Graham Fellows, who knows how successful you can be with rubbish. In 1978, he had a hit in his previous persona, Jilted John. HERITAGE minister David Mellor was quick to realise that looking after the arts and sport enabled him to spend the summer swanning around Europe. This took him from the Barcelona Olympics to the Salzburg and Bayreuth festivals, with the fig-leaf that he was actually working. Hence the quickness of the media to dub him the Minister of Fun. Now, though, his busman's holiday must come to an end. There are some serious decisions awaiting him on his desk. The most pressing is the fate of Pitchford Hall in Shropshire, the most famous timber-framed manor house in the country. Christie's has already published the catalogue for the auction of the contents next month and, while a rescue package for the whole estate has been assembled, it has to be approved by Mellor. Basically, the family has agreed to accept a knock-down price of Pounds 1.8m. plus a tax douceur on the contents. The National Heritage Fund would dip into its kitty to buy Pitchford and its contents and English Heritage would then maintain it (or, rather, try to find a private tenant who would pay for the upkeep and repair bills). This is a much cheaper scheme than the earlier National Trust proposal to take on the house if the government supplied the cash for the endowment. The new chairman of the National Heritage Fund, Lord Rothschild, sees it as a fitting start to his stewardship. So does the new chairman of English Heritage, Jocelyn Stevens, who seems to be continuing the expansionist line of his predecessor, Lord Montagu, and taking on properties which previously would have gone to the Trust. But Mrs Oliver Colthurst, owner of Pitchford, wants to know now. Unless Mellor approves the rescue plan in the next few days, the auction of the furniture will proceed (the pictures, which offer an unrivalled run of family portraits, may be held back because of their undoubted heritage importance). But Pitchford in its entirety would be lost for ever. Not only Mrs Colthurst wants a decision. The Heritage Fund needs one just as badly because there is a sudden - and even more pressing - candidate for its limited funds. Buxton Crescent, in that fine old Georgian spa town in Derbyshire, is in an advanced state of decay. It has been abandoned by its owners: indeed, its actual ownership is in doubt. The Fund sees the preservation of this 18th century masterpiece as almost a test case for its existence. But it would need to act now, taking with it the local council and, presumably, English Heritage. Only Mellor could underpin the hefty financial price of preserving Buxton Crescent. His presence is doubly needed.</p>

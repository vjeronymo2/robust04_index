			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Kohl sees party fall behind in opinion poll GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl received a further blow to his political prestige at the weekend when the unfavourable result of an opinion poll prompted opposition calls for an early election. The poll by the Emnid institute, published in Der Spiegel, the weekly news magazine, indicated that if a general election had been held on Sunday, the ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) would have received only 38 per cent of the votes, 6 points less than in December's first all-German vote. The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) improved sharply from 34 per cent to 40 per cent. Mr Hans-Jochen Vogel, the SPD's chairman, said Mr Kohl should call a new election to end internal government squabbling and deal with the problems in east Germany. Germany's current account fell further into deficit in March, mainly through payments to finance the Gulf war. The DM5.3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) deficit was the largest ever for one month. It compared with one of DM1.5bn in February this year and a surplus of DM10.4bn in March, 1990. The surplus totalled DM2.8bn, against DM2.6bn in February and DM13.8bn in March last year. Exports were down by 13 per cent and imports 5.4 per cent higher.</p>

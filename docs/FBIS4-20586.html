			<p>Rhombohedral   Boron Nitride (rBN)   <F P=102> 43070061Q Tokyo ISBB'93 in English Aug 93 p 79--FOR OFFICIAL  USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070061Q </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ISBB'93 </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Tadao Sato, National </F> Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials]    [Text] Boron nitride (BN) having a graphite-like layer  structure usually crystallizes into hexagonal form (hBN) with a  two-layered stacking sequence AA'AA'. Another BN with  three-layered sequence ABCABC like rhombohedral graphite  (rhombohedral boron nitride, rBN) has been known to be produced  in coexistence with hBN under particular synthetic conditions.  It has been found that the rBN structure was formed due to an  effect of monovalent anions in such systems, and the synthetic  method of pure rBN was established based on these  findings.[.sup]1[/] In the present study, it will be shown  that the effect of anions on the formation of rBN decreases  systematically in an anion series, to offer an evidence of our  proposed mechanism of rBN formation.  <H5>  Experiment </H5>   An 1:1.1 (mol) mixture of sodium tetrahydroborate  (NaBH[.sub]4[/]) and ammonium chloride (NH[.sub]4[/]Cl)  was heated at 600C in N[.sub]2[/] for 10 minutes, washed  with water and methanol to remove coproduced NaCl after it had  cooled down. The BN precursor thus obtained was mixed with a  series of anions in the forms of NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaI, and KCN,  respectively, and heated at 900C and 1000C for 10  hours in N[.sub]2[/]. The recovered samples were examined by  X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and IR  and Raman spectroscopy after they were treated with water to  remove salts.  <H5>  Results </H5>   The precursor was composed of BN containing traces of NaCl,  and obtained in 80% yield. It showed a typical diffraction  pattern of turbostratic structure with broad 00l, and  10 peaks. The structure of the precursor was changed to rBN  after it was heated with KCN, NaF or NaCl. The rBN peaks, 101 at  42.6 (2_th_ CuK_a_) and 012 at 45.5 other than  00l peaks relating to interlayer distances were  clearly observed. The intensity and sharpness of these peaks  decreased according to the above order of the three salts.  Traces of those peaks were observed in the sample treated with  NaBr, and could not in the case of Ani.    It is concluded that the catalytic power to produce rBN  decreases according to the order of the following anion series:  CN, F, Cl, Br, I. The series coincides, with the well-known  order of coordination strength of anions, and the fact strongly  supports the formation mechanism of rBN based on the  coordination of anions.

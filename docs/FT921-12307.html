			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Getting in style with Pay and File The most significant change in decades to the way UK companies pay tax will take place next year when the Inland Revenue introduces the Pay and File system for assessing and collecting corporation tax. The likely starting date for the new system is September 30, which may appear a long way off but companies should start preparing now. Pay and File will have tighter time constraints than the present system, and will be accompanied by costly fines, according to Paul Morris, senior tax partner at accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn. Under the new system companies must pay their estimated tax within nine months of the end of the accounting period and file returns within 12 months of that date. There will be no scope to defer settlement, as now, and there will be no need to wait for the inspector's assessment. The penalties start modestly but for tax returns which are between six and 12 months late the penalty is Pounds 200 and 10 per cent of the unpaid tax. Returns which are more than 12 months late will incur a higher penalty still. There is no need for the Revenue to prove fraud or negligence. Since few companies will know their exact liability for tax nine months after the end of the accounting period the Revenue will charge interest on underpayments and pay interest on overpayments. The new scheme should reduce the large sums which the taxman is at present unable to collect because the company has appealed. Subsidiaries of larger groups will be able to set their tax liability against losses made elsewhere within the group. Claims against tax must be made within two years of the end of the claiming company's accounting period or before its tax liabilities have been agreed, if this is later. Companies most likely to be adversely affected by these changes are those which are poor at collecting tax information or which require a great deal of manual effort to get their numbers together. Companies should start preparing now to upgrade their systems to take account of the new tax regime, says Paul James, a director of BDO Consulting. He recommends: Do your tax calculations once only. At present many companies do their sums quickly for the purposes of the audit and then recalculate the numbers more carefully for tax purposes. Plan to have 95 per cent of the information you need ready in the first four months after your year end, so you can plan your tax strategy. Over the next four months complete the collection of information and finalise your strategy in time to pay the tax by the nine-month deadline. Complete your calculations and file your computation with the taxman by the 12-month deadline. Useful reading: Pay and File Special Briefing 73. BDO Tel. 071 489 6074. Three pages; Free.

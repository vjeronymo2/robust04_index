			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Ex-Soviet bloc attracts Dollars 42bn: Large-scale energy projects boost western investment in the east FOREIGN investors committed more than Dollars 42bn (Pounds 27.2bn) to more than 1,700 projects in the 28 countries of the former Soviet empire in the 18 months up to the end of March 1993, according to figures compiled by East European Investment magazine. The figures, based on data compiled from 160 publications, include outright acquisitions, investment pledges made as part of privatisation deals and investment in greenfield projects. However, they do not distinguish between actual capital flows and associated investment commitments. Largely for this reason, Russia emerges as the biggest recipient of foreign investment, accounting for Dollars 10.56bn, more than 25 per cent of the total, spread over 402 investment deals, including 106 greenfield projects and 285 joint ventures. The bulk of such deals are concentrated in a relatively small number of energy-related projects involving large-scale investment over many years. Such flows are only likely to materialise when Russia can give investors the legal and proprietorial rights they demand before committing funds. The strong showing of Kazakhstan, which has soared to second place in the investment league table with Dollars 9.12bn pledged or committed, also reflects the weighting in favour of big projects like the Dollars 6bn-plus gas exploration and transport project led by British Gas and Agip of Italy, and the large-scale Chevron oil involvement in the Tenghiz oil field. The distorting effect on the figures of such projects is shown most clearly in the case of Azerbaijan, which has announced only seven foreign investment projects, all joint ventures, with a total investment outlay of Dollars 2.56bn. Elsewhere, the biggest share, and by the far the greatest number of investment deals of all kinds, is concentrated in the former communist states of central Europe. Poland has emerged as the most popular target for investment, with 162 deals over the last 18 months totalling Dollars 5.56bn in foreign equity disbursements and commitments. It is followed by Hungary, which retains its title as the economy which has attracted most foreign capital per capita. In the last 18 months, 334 investment deals involving Dollars 3.16bn were recorded. The Czech Republic continued to attract more than 90 per cent of total foreign investment drawn to the now divided Czechoslovakia. It attracted Dollars 1.4bn compared with the Dollars 191m which was attracted to Slovakia over this period. Heavy involvement by US energy, transport and consumer goods corporations continues to put the US at the head of the investor country league. US-based corporations committed Dollars 13.6bn to 469 projects, followed by Italy, where Fiat's Dollars 2bn commitment to Poland and Agip's JV with British Gas in Kazakhstan boosted the total to Dollars 7.8bn.

Papinin; place and date not given]    [Text] Defense Minister Oscar Camilion has admitted that  the incidents in Santiago del Estero Province were due to the  fact that the province's intelligence services lacked adequate  information.    In an interview with LA NACION, he also denied that he had  said that Shining Path was active in that province.    Camilion described President Carlos Menem's 12 January  meeting at the Olivos residence with civilian and military  officials responsible for the country's internal and external  security as "a preventive measure."    According to the minister, no reports were submitted, and  for  the most part, the discussion concerned the need to hone the  work of the services by synchronizing them and making them work  at full capacity because there are continental and national  difficulties that can be taken advantage of by activists.    Camilion indicated that the president understands that  up-to-date information must always be at hand in order to  prevent social outbursts and thus be on the alert to prevent a  major calamity if an outburst does occur.    He admitted that there are rumors that foreign subversive  agents had been in the country, but there is no strong evidence  that this happened.    The minister denied that Peruvian subversive agents had been  active in Santiago del Estero.    "The difficult situations that have been caused by the  reform  are well exploited by the activists and misfits who exist in the  world and who mobilize with drastic measures those who wish to  express their discontent peacefully."    He stressed that in Olivos the president pulled the  intelligence services out of their lethargy and urged them to  work in coordination, "and, that was all that happened and no  one should be alarmed, because what has happened in Mexico has  no relation to what happened in Santiago del Estero, where the  situation took a serious turn due to the passiveness of the  policemen, who had not yet been paid their salaries."    The following are the main parts of the conversation:    [Papini] What is the role of the Armed Forces in collecting  information?    [Camilion] You know that the Defense Law does not allow them  to carry out intelligence activities within the country. Their  field is information about the external situation. Currently we  have a very real situation, which was discussed at Olivos, in  which drug traffic originates abroad and then enters our  country. This is where matters become somewhat confusing.    On the other hand, the Internal Security Law establishes  that  the Armed Forces can be asked to carry out actions within the  country if the security forces are overrun.    The Armed Forces did participate in the Santiago del Estero  incident. The Air Force and Navy used their planes to transport  members of the Federal and Border Police Forces.    [Papini] Moving on to another topic, do you agree that  Argentine military men should help remove the mines from the  Malvinas Islands?    [Camilion] No. The fact that Argentine soldiers would help  remove the mines from the Malvinas was never discussed. The  country offered to make an economic contribution in removing the  mines as an act of good will because those mines are harming the  civilian population. The offer was made in accordance with the  Madrid Protocol, which condemns the use of those artifacts by  the belligerent parties.    [Papini] Will you do anything to prevent the promotion of  the naval officers who have been objected to by some political  sectors?    [Camilion] No, in no way. The matter is now in the hands of  the Senate.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UKRAINIAN CATHOLICS REGAIN CATHEDRAL  </P> <P> St. George's Cathedral in Lvov has been returned to Ukrainian Catholics after  being used by the Russian Orthodox Church for more than 40 years, according to  an announcement by Ukrainian Catholic officials in Rome.  </P> <P> The announcement from the temporary see in Rome of the Archeparchy of Lvov said  the transfer of the cathedral was authorized April 6 by a 124-6 vote of the  newly elected city council of Lvov.  </P> <P> It said the Orthodox Church was told to vacate the cathedral and its entire  complex of buildings by last Thursday and to relocate to the Latin-rite Church  of St. Nicholas in Lvov.  </P> <P> "This is a joyous day for the Ukrainian Catholic Church," said Cardinal  Myroslav Lubachivsky, who has headed the worldwide Ukrainian Catholic community  from Rome since 1985. "Our prayers have been answered, and we thank God for his  mercy upon our people."  </P> <P> The Cathedral of St. George was built between 1744 and 1770 on the site of an  earlier church. The bell of the older church, which was cast in 1341 and is the  oldest in the Ukraine, remains in the cathedral's bell tower.  </P> <P> The Ukrainian Catholic Church, also known as the Uniate Church, was forcibly  disbanded under Stalin in 1946. Last October, Ukrainian Catholics took over the  Transfiguration Cathedral in Lvov in what Russian Orthodox leaders said was a  violent seizure, but Ukrainian Catholics described it as a change that was  agreed upon by the cathedral congregation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> QUAYLE HAILS U.S. WWII SOLDIERS  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle hailed America's World War II soldiers today as  heroes who laid the groundwork for European unity, but some veterans boycotted  a ceremony because of Quayle's military record.  </P> <P> In remarks to about two dozen members of the American Legion of Paris, the vice  president praised Dwight D. Eisenhower's vision of world peace.  </P> <P> "Eisenhower foresaw that the Europe that existed in his time must change to  reflect the fundamental principles that these heroes fought for, principles  that the United States and France have shared for some 200 years," he said.  </P> <P> But one of the legionnaires present said that several people in his 750-member  organization declined to attend the ceremony at the American Embassy because  they believed that Quayle avoided combat duty during the Vietnam War by joining  the Indiana National Guard.  </P> <P> "That bothers some of the members," said a Vietnam veteran who asked not to be  identified.  </P></p>

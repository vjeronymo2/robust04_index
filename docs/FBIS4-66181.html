			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondents Yang Gongcheng (2799 0501 2052) </F> and Ou Shijin (2962 0013 6855): "Masses of All Nationalities in  Xinjiang Support the Army With Absolute Sincerity; Comfort  Border Posts. No Stability and No Prosperity But For the PLA"]    [Text] On lunar New Year's eve, Wang Dengming, a soldier  stationed in Xinjiang, sustained severe injuries while valiantly  trying to control a scared horse in the county seat of Bachu  County. Gulishahan, a woman teacher of Uygur nationality in the  county nationalities middle school, flagged down a vehicle to  take him to the hospital where she removed her watch and gold  ring as collateral for the hospital admittance fee and gave  Young Wang a 300 ml blood transfusion. According to a briefing  from the Xinjiang Military Region Mass Work Department, moving  deeds in support of the army like Gulishanhan's are too numerous  to cite among the minority nationality masses in Xinjiang.    "Without the PLA, Xinjiang would not be stable or  prosperous." All nationalities in Xinjiang personally feel the  importance and role of the people's army. Enthusiasm for loving  the country and supporting the armed forces is at an all-time  high. A large number of minority nationality peasants and  herdsmen, who became rich first in recent years, have used  various means to express their feelings of gratitude to kindred  soldiers. Yakufu, a Uygur individual entrepreneur in Urumqi City  whom the army helped escape from poverty to become wealthy,  enthusiastically provided the army with premium quality service  when the first "support-the-army" restaurant opened in the  autonomous region's capital. Thanks to his instigation,  "support-the-army travel agencies," "support-the-army shops,"  and "support-the-army" bus stations spread very quickly  throughout the urban area, becoming a major feature of the  frontier city's "twin supports." Ten years ago, Uygur  nationality peasant Kawuzi had been rescued by officers and men  of the garrison army in Pishan County when struggling with  outlaws. Afterward, he used pear, peach, apple, and grape  nursery stock that he himself had cultivated to build an orchard  for their unit, and he looked after it for them. During the past  several years, a "support-the-army service team" voluntarily  organized by minority nationality people has been active in  cities and towns and farming and pastoral areas north and south  of the Tian Shan, enthusiastically eliminating worries and  solving difficulties for the garrison forces. At New Year's time  in 1994, when garrison forces in Kuqa, Usu, and Turpan conducted  winter bivouac training, wherever they went, they were warmly  received by the masses of all nationalities.    In the Xinjiang Military Region, guard duty is grueling and  stremuous. Realizing that border patrols travel great distances,  and that the terrain is steep and the climate ugly, the local  minority peoples have set up "troop quartering places" in their  yurts where they accept free of charge officers and men who trek  long distances on patrol. At border defense stations like  Hongshanzui, which is a "lonely island in a snowy sea," and  Hongqilafu, which is a "forbidden zone for life" after heavy  snows block the mountains each year, the local minority peoples  use horse-drawn sledges to deliver newspapers, magazines, and  mail to officers and men, and to pick up and send officers and  men up and down the mountains. Many herdsmen deliver to sentry  posts vegetables, grain and meat that they have stored in their  own homes.</p>

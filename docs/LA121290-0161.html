			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TRAINER FINED IN STEROID CASE  </P> <P> Trainer Mohammed Moubarak was fined a record $15,600 today by British racing  authorities who said six of his thoroughbreds were given anabolic steroids.  </P> <P> The Jockey Club said it believes that the drugs were administered by assistant  trainer Ahmed Kobeissi without Moubarak's knowledge.  </P> <P> A lawyer for Moubarak said Kobeissi acquired a medication called Equipoise from  the United States, believing it to be a harmless "pick-me-up," and injected  horses with it in April.  </P> <P> "Colleagues in America told him everyone there used it and that it was  perfectly legal," lawyer Matthew McCloy told the Jockey Club's disciplinary  commission.  </P> <P> Post-race urine tests between May and July found the six Moubarak horses to  contain boldenone, a synthetic anabolic steroid.  </P> <P> The Jockey Club also fined Kobeissi $3,900 and barred him for a year.  </P></p>

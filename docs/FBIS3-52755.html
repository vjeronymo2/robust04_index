[Velayati] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. His Excellency President Saparmurad Niyazov has  come here on the basis of the invitation of our president, and  he has reciprocated the recent visit of our president to  Turkmenistan. He and his entourage stayed here for five days.  During their stay here they have made very good discussions  with their Iranian counterparts in different ministries and in  different committees. At the end of his trip we had signed  eleven documents. Three of these documents were signed by [the]  two presidents. I think after the signing of these documents  many facilities have been provided for the expansioning of  relations between our two countries.    [Correspondent] As you know, Afghanistan is now facing a  very critical situation. What are the measures and stances  taken by Iran towards the on-going Afghan crisis?    [Velayati] This is [a] very unfortunate situation. You know  the people of Afghanistan since the very beginning after the  occupation of that country by the former Soviet forces, they  have tried a lot to expel the former Soviet forces and they have  succeeded. So the first part of their struggle was very  successful. But, unfortunately, after the victory of the Islamic  revolution in Afghanistan they have started fighting against  each other. We as the Islamic Republic of Iran are against any  kind of internal conflict. We don't support any party against  another party. What we have done till now is bringing all  factions together and trying to make a peaceful settlement among  all these factions which are fighting against each other. We  deeply believe that any kind of internal conflict is against the  interest of the people of Afghanistan.    [Reporter] Iran has decided to resume diplomatic relations  with South Africa. On what basis has this decision been made  and how long the normalization of ties will continue?    [Velayati] You know this decision was made last night in the  Cabinet meeting, and we have been instructed by the government  to prepare the ground for resumption of relations with South  Africa. After the recent important developments we could witness  in South Africa and on the basis of the request of the head of  important groups there, ANC [African National Congress] and EAC  [Ease African Community], and specifically Mr. Mandela has asked  us to resume our relations, and Muslim groups in South Africa  also have asked us. So we think that as a first step we have to  resume our economic relations with South Africa, and after the  elections, which will be held in, before the end of April, after  the end of that elections we think that the time will be right  for the resumption of the political relations.    [Reporter] Thank you very much, sir.    [Velayati] You are welcome.</p>

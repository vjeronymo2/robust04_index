			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Albert Fisher It could almost be the old days at Albert Fisher. An ambitious management with a strategic plan buys a US company with a patchy earnings record for a little cash and a large deferred payment. Since Fisher suffered second degree burns playing with that particular box of matches, it is surprising that the new management is prepared to give it another whirl. Nor is it encouraging to hear the acquisition described as earnings enhancing, calculated on the initial payment only. Fisher's balance sheet is not particularly stretched, so the full price could have been paid now. On the other hand the company will have to refinance its convertible shares this year, pushing gearing over 30 per cent. Presumably a rights issue is ruled out at the current rating, so perhaps Fisher simply wants to stay flexible. Yet if it is to finance its ambitions to graduate from commodity apples to sliced salads it cannot do so on the never never. The proposition that commodity risk can be taken out of the business by going up market was always questionable. If it is to be tried, at least the bet should be paid for in advance.</p>

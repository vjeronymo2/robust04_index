			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Space agency lands ice cream deal CHINA'S satellite launch and tracking control agency today fires itself into a new business orbit: selling ice-cream. While keeping one commercial eye on outer space, the agency has for some time been tracking the advance of western consumer lifestyles into China. It has already diversified into such down-to-earth activities as running hotels and restaurants. Now it has formed a joint venture with Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, to treat the Chinese to the delights of Baskin-Robbins ice cream. The world's biggest ice cream chain today opens for business in Beijing where Allied-Lyons is investing Dollars 1m in four stores. Mr Tony Hales, Allied's chief executive, will perform the opening ceremony according to Chinese custom. Baskin-Robbins - recently voted 'America's Favorite Sweets Chain' for the 10th time - does not plan to commemorate the event by adding another exotic flavour to its roster of 650 recipes, though Neil Armstrong's moon landing in 1969 was celebrated with Lunar Cheesecake. China is the 48th country in which Baskin-Robbins has landed since then  - and the Chinese will have to be content, for the time being at least, with the usual daily menu of 31 flavours to be found in any of the 3,600 shops worldwide. These include the 'sinfully rich' Kahlua 'n Cream, Jamoca Almond Fudge, and Daiquiri Ice. It would not be surprising, however, if Beijing's customers were also given a taste of Red Bean ice-cream that has been so successful in Korea, or the Green Tea flavour that has gone down so well in Japan. Allied's market research has shown that the usual aversion of the Chinese to milk and other dairy products does not extend to ice cream. The group also expects to benefit from the laws which restrict Chinese families to one child. 'It tends to make parents very indulgent.' If the stores succeed - and Allied is investing a lot of effort in staff training to establish a service culture - the group plans to build an ice cream factory in Beijing, capable of producing 2m gallons a year.</p>

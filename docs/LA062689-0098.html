			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SALES OF EXISTING HOMES FALL 5.6%  </P> <P> Despite falling mortgage rates, sales of existing homes dropped 5.6% in May to  their lowest level in 16 months, the National Assn. of Realtors reported today.  </P> <P> The real estate trade group said existing single-family homes were sold at a  seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.21 million units last month. The previous  low was 3.2 million units in January, 1988.  </P> <P> The drop in May followed sales of 3.4 million units in both March and April,  down 2% from February. The May resale rate was off 11.3% from the rate a year  earlier.  </P> <P> The weakness in sales this year has been attributed to rising home mortgage  rates, reflecting efforts by the Federal Reserve to fight inflationary  pressures by tightening the supply of credit.  </P> <P> The Fed has been easing its grip on credit recently. Fixed-rate mortgages have  fallen from a high of 11.22% in March to 10.48% at the end of May, according to  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  </P></p>

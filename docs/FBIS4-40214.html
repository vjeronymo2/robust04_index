			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol -- The press service of the president and  the Government of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye made a  statement concerning the negotiating process with Moldova on the  political status for Pridnestrovye. For the first time, as Mr.  Smirnov, the president of the Moldavian Republic of  Pridnestrovye, stressed, we saw a sincere desire of the Republic  [of] Moldova to settle long existing problems.    Apart from the main document, some other agreements were  signed. The agreement between the National Bank of Moldova and  the central bank of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye, the  protocol of intentions on the social order, fighting against  crime and other documents. The sides, in particular, decided to  start the negotiating process without delay and preliminary  conditions on all the questions the sides are interested in, to  remove all the obstacles that block normal economical, social  and cultural relations, provide to [as heard] their restoration  and development, normalize business, trade, and financial  relations for mutual benefit in interest of the entire  population.    The sides came to the conclusion that it was necessary to  determine the political and legal status of Pridnestrovye -- a  step by step program of creating and carrying on political and  legal relations on division of powers between [the] sides and a  transitional period for realization of mutual agreements on  every concrete direction of activity. Finally, on the necessity  of creation of the system with mutual guarantees, including  international ones in order to fulfill the reached agreements  completely and unconditionally. [sentence as heard]    More than a month has passed. However, attempts of the  leadership of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye to speed  up the (?status) activity, face once again a (?solid) blockade  which we know pretty well. The president of the Republic of  Moldova, Mircea Snegur, actually evades further development of  the negotiating process, specifying no reasons of such a  behavior to the leadership of Pridnestrovye.    Relations between Abkhazia and Georgia, other hot regions,  have now more and more good prospects on the way proposed and  adopted by Russia. Agreements signed by Russia and Tatarstan  may also be a kind of pattern for further work. It is being  proposed to borrow from the experience of relations between  Crimea and Ukraine. However, they reject the accumulated  experience in reference to our region. Relations between the  Republic of Moldova and Pridnestrovye are being frozen  artificially again.    The position of the leadership of the Moldavian Republic of  Pridnestrovye remains the same. Only peaceful and negotiating  activity can settle all the problems. Besides, we don't see any  reasons for the artificial delay of the settlement of vital  problems and coordinating the determination of the status for  Pridnestrovye with the problems of Gagauzia. Expressing his  concern about the nonfulfillment of the signed statement and the  number of documents, the president of the Moldavian Republic of  Pridnestrovye, Igor Smirnov, addressed Russia's resident  plenipotentiary envoy to Pridnestrovye, (Vasiv), with the  request to use all his influence on the president of the  Republic of Moldova, Mircea Snegur, in order to speed up the  negotiating process and the realization of the signed document.</p>

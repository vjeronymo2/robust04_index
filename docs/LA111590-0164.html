			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TOOLS TO FACE REALITY'  </P> <P> To help emigrants from Los Angeles take root in Israel, the Los Angeles Jewish  Federation operates the Aliyah Demonstration Project, which provides  prospective immigrants with what project director Arnold Bender calls "tools to  face reality."  </P> <P> Though American Jews may initially feel at home in the Jewish state, Bender  emphasizes that Israel's culture is very different from America's.  </P> <P> "No one knows 'I Love Lucy' or the Dodgers," he said. "You don't know what the  blue line painted on the curb means when you want to park. You don't know the  network in your professional field, or how to go about signing up for a  driver's license and a bank account. All the systems are different -- and in  another language to boot."  </P> <P> Bender strongly recommends that prospective immigrants make exploratory trips  to Israel to investigate job and housing markets, and that they work on Hebrew  language skills before going. In addition, he says, they should give serious  thought to how their children are likely to fare in a new land. Couples should  make sure they are in accord on the move and the reasons for making it, he  adds.  </P> <P> "People don't want to face the complexities," Bender lamented.  </P> <P> On the other end of the Aliyah pipeline, the federation's Jerusalem office  provides various services to new immigrants -- social programs and reunions to  help them build a network, counseling services in collaboration with the Assn.  of Americans and Canadians in Israel and no-interest and low-interest loans to  assist with emergencies and mortgages.  </P> <P> Immigration from Los Angeles -- and from all of North America -- has dropped  significantly in recent years, according to Bender and other Aliyah  professionals. They attribute the decline to a number of factors, including  Israel's troubled economy, continuing regional conflict and the Arab uprising  on the West Bank, as well as a tendency among American Jews today to regard  Israel in less idealistic terms than they did, say, 20 years ago.  </P> <P> Last year, Bender said, 110 Jews, including children, emigrated from Los  Angeles to Israel. That was down from 177 in 1985. DAVID MARGOLIS  </P></p>

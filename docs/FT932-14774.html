			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally after jobs data prompts setback AFTER losing ground in early trading on news of a bigger-than-expected decline in weekly jobless claims, US Treasury prices rallied on the news that President Clinton is willing to make compromises over his economic plans. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 105 3/16 , yielding 6.717 per cent, the lowest since the Treasury began issuing 30-years in the early 1970s. At the short end, the two-year note was little changed, up  1/32 at 100 7/32 to yield 3.741 per cent. Prices weakened early on after the Labor department announced that claims for state unemployment insurance fell 38,000 during the first full week of April. Analysts had been looking for a decline of somewhere between 9,000 and 15,000, so the announcement prompted a rapid, if not particularly substantial, sell-off. Treasuries recovered their lost ground later in the day, however, on news of the president's willingness to compromise on his plans to help the economy. Fixed-income investors had worried that the Clinton stimulus package might lead to an overheated economy, and rising inflation. SPANISH government bonds gained about a quarter of a point, shrugging off unfavourable comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president. Mr Schlesinger was reported as saying that if high interest rates cannot support the weaker currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism, a devaluation may be the only solution. 'The weaker currencies, in particular, are more prone to inflationary expectations and must, therefore, offer higher interest rates to avoid coming under greater pressure,' Mr Schlesinger said. 'But if the tensions become too strong, only a devaluation of their own currencies may be of help, as has happened with respect to a number of currencies between September 1992 and February 1993.' Dealers interpreted the comments as a reference to the peseta which has come under pressure since Spain called an early election. The currency weakened slightly yesterday despite intervention by the Bank of Spain. The bond market edged up with the Meff futures contract rising from 85.88 to 86.11. GERMAN government bonds slipped lower, with much of the selling concentrated in the five-year area. Dealers said market participants expect the Bundesbank to continue with its policy of allowing small cuts in interest rates. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, warned that fast rate cuts could damage investor faith in the Bundesbank's anti-inflation policy. In addition, the market expects to see further supply next week with a new Treuhand bond issue. Dealers expect between DM6bn and DM10bn of 10-year bonds to be issued. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 96.24, rose to a high of 96.47 and ended the day at around 96.21. TRADING in UK government bonds was volatile yesterday, and prices ended lower or unchanged on a combination of supply and economic factors. After a strong start, gilt prices fell back quite sharply. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 106.15, rose to a high of 106.31, and then fell back to 106.05 before ending at 106.10. Dealers said few investors wanted to buy before the release of today's inflation figures. In addition, the market expects the Bank of England to announce plans for its next gilt auction this afternoon, with the five-to-seven year maturities seen as a likely area for new issuance. However, some dealers have suggested that the Bank may choose to auction a 10-year stock next. JAPANESE government bonds closed lower, having traded in a relatively narrow range yesterday. The benchmark No 145 issue opened with a yield of 4.195 per cent and traded in a range of 4.19 - 4.265 per cent before ending at 4.22 per cent. The June futures contract ended at 108.61, compared with its previous close of 108.63. The yen continued to strengthen against the dollar yesterday, prompted by a Washington Post report that prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa favours allowing the yen to rise further.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for Afghanistan's president announced in  Kabul on Sunday [19 June] that Mr. Rabbani is neither thinking  of continuing to work as the president, nor he is thinking of  resigning. He is rather thinking that a legal authority would  be found to take a decision on the future presidency of  Afghanistan. The term of office of Borhaboddin Rabbani, as the  president, and Golboddin Hekmatyar, as the prime minister,  should end in less than 10 days' time, on the basis of decisions  made by the Islamabad and Jalalabad meetings.    At the same time a member of the mediation team from the  southwestern sector of Afghanistan, Dr. Shams, whose objective  is to resolve the country's crisis through peaceful means, said  today that this team has carried out the second round of its  mediatory talks with Rabbani and Hekmatyar on Saturday and  Sunday, and it has been agreed the two sides' representatives  should begin direct talks from Monday. He expressed the hope  that during the first round of talks between the representatives  of Afghanistan's president and prime minister, the time of  cease-fire and the time of opening the routes leading to Kabul  would be determined and declared.    Dr. Shams said: Almost all the leaders of Afghanistan's  jihad  groups have announced that they will take part at the  consultative and decision-taking session of Herat; and it is  very much hoped that peace would be established in Afghanistan.</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Danes lower rates THE DANISH central bank yesterday lowered its discount and deposit rates by  1/4 percentage point to 6 3/4 per cent, writes Conner Middelmann. The move is expected to be followed today by a  1/4 point cut in the certificate of deposit rate to 7 1/2 per cent. If so, the CD rate will have eased by 3 1/2 percentage points since August 2, when the fluctuation bands for most currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism were widened to 15 per cent. The Danish krone has been the weakest currency in the EMS grid for some time. However, among Europe's central banks the Danish central bank has been among the most aggressive in taking advantage of the wider bands to ease interest rates independently of the Bundesbank, and analysts say the process is likely to continue amid high unem-ployment, a sluggish economy and a relatively stable currency. In Germany, operators are getting geared up for another drop in the rate for securities repurchase agreements at today's allocation of 15-day variable-rate repos. According to a survey of German money dealers by market analysis firm MMS International, most traders are calling for a drop in the repo rate of some 8 basis points to 6.30 per cent. Fairly comfort-able liquidity conditions and expected drains from tax payments this week should roughly balance each other out, so that only a very small addition to liquidity is seen, according to MMS's analysts. However, most traders do not expect the Bundesbank's central bank council to cut leading interest rates at its meeting on Thursday. Instead they expect further reductions in the bank's discount and Lombard rates in December. The December three-month Euromark futures contract on Liffe ended at 93.92, up 0.03 point from Friday. In France, the central bank left money market rates unchanged at its latest round of securities repurchase agreements, as expected. The Pibor futures contract ended at 93.55, up 0.01 point from Friday. UK money market conditions were stable ahead of Wed-nesday's retail price and sales data. 'Wednesday is a bit of a watershed - it will set the tone for the run-up to the Budget,' said a London money dealer. He added that market hopes for a substantial rate cut accompanying the November 30 Budget were waning.</p>

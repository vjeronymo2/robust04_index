			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian </F> Serbs, by unidentified correspondent; place not given; Karadzic  and the correspondent speak in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded]    [Text] Speaking at a news conference today, Radovan  Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, said that the  decision on whether NATO will bomb us or not does not depend on  the Serbian side. The Srpska republic will tomorrow issue an  official statement on the NATO ultimatum. This is what Karadzic  told the British (WTN) Agency:    [Correspondent] Do you envisage handing over any more heavy  weapons to the United Nations or are you going to leave them  where they are, albeit under UN control?    [Karadzic] We are going to make some combinations. We are  probably going to give something over and to regroup something  in order to make it possible for the United Nations to have  efficient control. We also want reciprocity from the Muslim  side.    [Correspondent] Do you think we are now closer to an  agreement?    [Karadzic] Well, I think we may be closer since the United  States has interfered. The United States cannot afford to  interfere and not to come and help peace to be reached. The  United States and Russia will probably have the last word, but  probably in line with a plan by the European Union. In any  case, we are ready for peace, we are ready to give over some  territories that we control, and even some traditionally Serbian  territories, but we are not going to go much below 64 percent of  the private property that we possess. For peace and in the  name of peace we are going to give something, but not everything.    [Correspondent] Do you think that air strikes are now more  or less likely?    [Karadzic] Air strikes have always been realistic. We have  always taken them seriously, not because of other people's  behavior, but because of NATO's internal needs. NATO is  experiencing a deep crisis just as the Western alliance is.  They are showing their muscle and in our case they are also  trying to scare Russia. They are doing things that are going  simply to interrupt and destroy the NATO alliance. The NATO  alliance is not needed in this war. NATO resembles a giant who  has no feeling for reality. It will try to destroy somebody,  but will destroy itself this time. If there are any air  strikes, many NATO nations are going to distance themselves from  this moral catastrophe. Then they are going to become  completely divided.</p>

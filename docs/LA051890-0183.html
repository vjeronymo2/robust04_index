			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PANAMA-NICARAGUA AID STALLED  </P> <P> House and Senate negotiators failed today to agree on a long-awaited spending  bill granting $720 million in emergency aid for Panama and Nicaragua, adding to  delays that have prompted anger at the White House.  </P> <P> President Bush requested the foreign aid months ago and he stepped up his  campaign for the money this week with a public call for the Congress to delay  its planned Memorial Day holiday if the bill is not finished.  </P> <P> Members of a conference working out the differences between the House and  Senate supplemental spending bills have agreed on all new spending in the  legislation. They were to have completed their agreement today by specifying  the defense cuts that will offset the non-mandatory spending in the bill.  </P></p>

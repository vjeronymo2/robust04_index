			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Regulators bar two from audits TWO CERTIFIED accountants were barred from conducting audit work during the first six months of the new self-regulatory mechanisms established by the government last year, it emerged yesterday. Officials at the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants have restricted the practising certificate of two members since audit regulation work began last October. The figures emerge in the first submission to the Department of Trade and Industry on audit regulation until the end of March, during which 94 visits took place among the 3,000 certified accountants registered to conduct audits. Separately, the joint monitoring unit, which scrutinises auditors registered with the three Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in Scotland and in Ireland, has made no disqualifications. Its more up-to-date figures show the unit has refused to register as auditors 1,108 accountants from the 10,509 who had applied until last week. The unit has carried out 44 visits to determine whether to register accountants as auditors, and 80 visits to those already registered. That includes 13 in response to complaints and 49 that were routine. It has pledged to visit all the 163 auditors of listed companies every five years.</p>

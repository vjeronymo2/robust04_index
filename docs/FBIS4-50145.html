			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- The suspicious issues  surrounding the March 31 killing of 24 Taiwan tourists on Lake  Qiandao in Zhejiang Province remain unanswered by mainland  authorities.    Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] Deputy Secretary General  Hsu Hui-you, who led a delegation of criminal investigators and  relatives of the Taiwan victims on a fact-finding trip to the  mainland, gave a press briefing at Chiang Kai-shek International  Airport upon his return to Taiwan.    The mainland still was trying to "cover up something" about  the tragedy, though it did make great efforts to arrange the  trip, Hsu said.    The ill-fated Taiwan tourists and eight mainland guides and  crew members were robbed and burned to death in a lower cabin of  the pleasure boat on which they were touring the lake in  Zhejiang Province,    Beijing originally claimed the tragedy was "accidental," and  then, after strong questioning by relatives of the Taiwan  victims, said "sabotage" could not be ruled out.    Reporters, especially those from Taiwan, were barred from  covering the news and relatives of the Taiwan victims who rushed  to the crime scene, were confined to a hotel.    Beijing finally arrested four suspects for their involvement  in the incident after furious Taiwan citizens launched a boycott  of mainland tourism and Taipei suspended cultural and economic  exchanges with the mainland.    During the past week, Hsu and his delegation visited the  lake  and boat, and met with mainland investigators to ask them to  clear up the suspicions remaining about the incident, such as  the numbers of suspects, their identity, the weapons they used,  how they committed the crime and the process of investigation.    The delegation was barred from interviewing the four  suspects  and examining the reports of the autopsies which were performed  on the victims.    The mainland authorities, while refusing to respond to the  questions, criticized Taipei for trying to "politicize" the  incident by creating dubious points to obstruct cross-strait  relations.    Expressing his dissatisfaction with Beijing's handling of  the  incident, Hsu said that he and his delegation did not go to the  mainland with their eyes closed to "endorse" what Beijing said  were the facts of the incident.</p>

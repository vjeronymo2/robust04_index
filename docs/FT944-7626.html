			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Action plan for mobile phones An action plan urging rapid and widespread liberalisation of mobile telecommunications was yesterday sent by the European Commission to the European parliament and the council of ministers. After a five-month public consultation with telephone companies, industry organisations and individuals, the Commission has concluded that EU competition rules should apply fully to the mobile sector, that a code of conduct should be developed for service providers and that they should be granted full access to the market. The plan also highlights the need to promote the availability of frequencies and numbers and to promote special programmes that will support emerging mobile technologies. Europe's mobile telecoms sector is already fairly deregulated with only a handful of member states continuing to maintain a monopolistic hold over operators. The commission has already taken action against individual member states requiring them, under competition rules, to license at least a second operator. Italy, Ireland and Belgium have not yet complied. The commission is to propose that all remaining exclusive and special rights in the mobile sector be abolished as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lang is caught in the crossfire WHEN Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, embarked a few months ago on an election strategy aimed at splitting the Labour vote in Scotland, he was always the most likely person to be shot down in the crossfire. Yesterday's opinion poll in his own Galloway constituency, putting him seven points behind his Scottish National party opponent, gave the first detailed evidence that this may indeed be the case. It was a sign that April 9 could be a catastrophe for the Scottish Tories to match the one in June 1987, when they lost 11 seats. Two other Tories fighting strong challenges from the SNP in rural constituencies could also be doomed: Mr Bill Walker, with a majority of 5,000 in Tayside North, and Sir Nicholas Fairbairn with 5,600 in Perth and Kinross. With Labour snapping at the Tories' heels in Ayr and Stirling, the Scottish Conservatives could lose five of the nine seats they still hold in Scotland, which elects 72 MPs. Mr Lang had to try to make the best of the Tories' wretched hand in campaigning for the party in Scotland. He knew many Scots simply wanted to get the Conservatives out after 13 years in which they have ruled Scotland with a dwindling minority of MPs. The Tories had ignored majority Scottish opinion on most issues, imposed the poll tax a year earlier than south of the border and became seen as the English party, especially because of their rejection of a devolved Scottish parliament. Mr Lang, who has not been an inspiring secretary of state, realised it was too late for any plausible last-minute conversion to devolution - which anyway was anathema to half his party. He gambled that by presenting the constitutional debate as a straight choice between the status quo and independence he would split the anti-Tory vote, as well as rally support for the union. For weeks up to the election was called he said little against the SNP but rubbished Labour and its plan for a devolved parliament. Since then the Tories have attacked all parties. So far the balance sheet contains more red ink than black. The SNP has about 27 per cent support in Scottish polls, at which it can win the three Tory rural seats but not make big gains from Labour. Support for the union has not moved decisively upwards, and backing for the Tory party has been static at about 22 per cent. Yet gloom is not universal. 'My campaign is going excellently,' said Mr Struan Stevenson, the Tory candidate for Edinburgh South, who is fighting to overturn Mr Nigel Griffiths' 1,800 majority for Labour in 1987. He says Mr Neil Kinnock has replaced Mrs Margaret Thatcher as a hate figure; the Liberal Democrats, who as the Alliance won 22 per cent of the vote last time, have collapsed; and the SNP is making inroads into Labour's vote among young people in the housing schemes. In Stirling, Mr Michael Forsyth, the Scottish education minister and a strong Thatcherite, is defending a majority of 548. His campaign is 'running on oiled wheels', according to a senior party official. He is relying on the SNP taking votes from Labour. With the Liberal Democrats doing poorly in the Scottish opinion polls (two polls have put support for them at below 10 per cent) some Tories believe they can unseat Mr Menzies Campbell in Fife North-East (majority 1,447). 'It's incredibly difficult to predict any of the results where we stand to win,' says a senior party figure, 'because each is a four-horse race in a marginal. But you're making a mistake if you think only in terms of the seats we will probably lose.' But while Mr Stevenson says he had volunteers turning up in their wellies at 7.30am yesterday to canvass in the rain, a bleak picture comes from a Tory worker in a Labour safe seat in industrial Fife. 'Usually in elections people swarm in offering to help,' she says. 'This time they're just not interested. We haven't got enough people for canvassing, we just mail out leaflets. Our appeal for contributions to our fighting fund produced virtually nothing, even from companies. It's terribly depressing.'</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / A man with 'petrol in his veins' Mr Ferdinand Piech is a man with 'petrol in his veins', as Die Zeit, the weekly German newspaper, put it. Eccentric and, by all accounts, prickly, he is a brilliant engineer who has steered VW's Audi subsidiary into a period of rising profits with robust, well-styled models at the upper end of the market. At a time when the VW group is struggling to curb costs against ever tougher foreign competition, especially from Japan, the choice of Mr Piech against the smoother, more communicative, higher profile Mr Daniel Goeudevert, VW board member, indicates a willingness to tackle the unpleasant work with renewed energy. This will include extensive job cuts, especially at VW's high-cost German plants. As both industry and labour representatives on the supervisory board backed Mr Piech's appointment, recognition of the scale of VW's problems obviously goes deep. In spite of his long career in the car industry, Mr Piech, 54, a keen skier, jogger, and - of course - fast driver, does not fit the mould of the average German car manager. He is extremely rich - his fortune is based on his stake in Porsche, the luxury sports car company, and in the Salzburg-based Porsche family company, whose activities run from car importing to banking and hotels. But he has proved that wealth can also go hand-in-hand with ambition and innovation. His grandfather was the legendary Ferdinand Porsche, who designed the VW Beetle car - the foundation of the company's post-war success - as well as the first sports car under the Porsche name. Mr Piech has carried on in this tradition. As an engineer, he was involved in the trailbreaking Audi Quattro sports car, the use of galvanised steel to prevent rust, and breakthroughs in aerodynamics. Yet this is not to say that Audi is one long success story. It has never really recovered in the US from the sales slump caused by allegations of unsafe acceleration, though it was cleared of these. Nor is Audi likely to escape the impact of the cost and labour cuts threatening the German car industry. Even rivals such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW have made aggressive noises to their workforce. Mr Piech certainly does not look like the man to shirk a disagreeable task, however uncomfortable it makes his managers and workers.</p>

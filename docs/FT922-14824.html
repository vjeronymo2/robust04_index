			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Leading Article: The City holds its breath IT HAS been a grim week in the City of London. The FT-SE 100 Index has lost more than 65 points and gilt-edged have continued to weaken. Sterling took a late dive yesterday and has lost more than 2 pfennigs on the week. There is no glummer place in Britain than the City, as Labour apparently strengthens its position in the closing stages of the election campaign. But to what extent does the Square Mile's gloom reflect a genuine reaction to national economic prospects under Labour, as opposed to the personal anxieties of City practitioners over the sharply increased personal tax burden that would await them under a Labour administration? Taking the country as a whole, the impact of the proposed redistribution of taxes will be a matter of minuses and pluses. But in the south-east of England the losers will predominate, and nowhere will this be more true than in the City of London. Heavily-mortgaged City workers face a double threat to their capital as well as their income, because the cut in take home pay may well be compounded by further weakness in the already battered London and Home Counties housing market. The tax argument can, of course, be taken rather further than its personal impact. The financial markets have become much more international over the 13 years since Labour was last in power. Heavy volumes of foreign equities are traded on the Stock Exchange's SEAQ International market. There are big markets in international bonds, for which the City is the leading European trading centre. London is the largest global centre for foreign exchange trading. In order to participate in these dynamic markets, many international companies and individuals have come to London. There is a danger that high levels of personal taxation will persuade them that they might be better off elsewhere. Fat cats A squeeze on the City fat cats will not arouse much sympathy in, say, the north-east or in Scotland. Londoners have enjoyed rich times under successive Conservative governments: they scarcely noticed the recession of the early 1980s. And there is a respectable, if flawed, argument for saying that an overdeveloped international financial centre may have damaging effects on the domestic economy if it draws too many talented people and too much capital away from home markets. Labour does not appear to have an anti-City policy as such. Indeed, its manifesto argues that the future European Central Bank should have its headquarters in Britain. But it does not appear to have considered whether foreign institutions can be attracted to a country which charges - at 59 per cent - one of the highest marginal rates of income tax in Europe. In the 1970s, it is true, nominal tax rates were even higher, but they were quite easily avoided. Large tax allowances were available on mortgage interest and pension contributions. Perks such as company cars were highly tax-efficient. And foreigners enjoyed a special tax regime: only half their income was taxed in the UK. The Conservatives subsequently cut the top rates, but they also capped or axed most of the tax breaks, including the foreigner's exemption. Labour's increased rate will therefore bite very hard indeed. Financial regulation Technology has advanced tremendously too. Computers can communicate almost instantaneously between different centres. International financial services groups can quite easily relocate people and functions according to shifts in relative costs. Nor does London have quite the regulatory advantages that it enjoyed in the 1960s and 1970s. Then, centres like Frankfurt and Paris were inward-looking and quite hostile to international operators. London seized the opportunities. Now Paris has become aggressively international and Germany is touting the concept of Finanzplatz Deutschland. All the EC centres are coming within a harmonised framework of financial regulation. In recent years, governments have found it hard to impose taxes on international financial markets. Germany had to withdraw legislation on bond withholding tax and the UK was forced to climb down on the rate of stamp duty it attempted to impose on American Depositary Receipts. Governments also need to be mindful of the international implications of personal tax rates. The potential tax revenues may be alluring, but they will prove to be a moving target. It would be bad enough for a Labour administration to attempt to downsize the City of London for reasons of deliberate policy: for it to take the risk of crippling Europe's premier financial centre thoughtlessly would be absurd. In practice, a Labour chancellor might well have to offer tax concessions to foreigners in order to prevent high-paid financial practitioners from drifting away to Frankfurt, Paris, or New York. It may be hard for immobile British politicians to comprehend, but levying high taxes on practitioners in international financial markets may be one thing, collecting them quite another.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 11 (AFP)--Two soldiers were killed and  several wounded in an attack early Sunday by a "Greek terrorist  commando" on an Albanian army centre near the border, Albanian  television reported citing an official communique. It said six  or seven people "armed with automatic rifles" and wearing Greek  military uniforms had crossed the border near Peshkepia in the  southern district of Gjirokastra.    Quoting a law and order ministry communique, it said that at  02:30 a.m. the Greeks had entered an army recruit training  centre four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the border. Two of the  attackers killed soldier Arben Gjini, 20, while the others went  into a dormitory and opened fire on the sleeping soldiers. An  officer, Fatmi Shehu, was killed and three other soldiers were  badly wounded. Several other men sustained minor wounded.    One of the attackers spoke Albanian but with the accent of  the Greek minority concentrated in the south of the country, the  communique said.    The commando escaped and fled back to Greece. All the  evidence pointed to they having come from Greece, the communique  said.    The Albanian foreign ministry protested at what it called a  "criminal act premeditated by Greek special forces". It said  the Greek government "must bear responsibility" for the attack.  Sunday's incident was the most serious in recent years between  Albania and Greece whose disagreement centres on the fate of the  Greek Orthodox Christian minority in Albania.    In July, Greece expelled around 20,000 Albanian workers  following the expulsion by Tirana of an Orthodox priest alleged  to have advocated unification of ethnic Greeksin southern  Albania with Greece. About 200,000 Albanians are believed to be  living illegally in Greece.    Meanwhile in Athens the Northern Epirus Liberation Front  (Malvi) claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement to  the ELEVTHEROTIPIA newspaper published Monday. The group said  it had been forced into the attack by the "criminal indifference  of the Greek state" towards the plight of the Greek minority in  Albania.    Northern Epirus is the Greek nationalist name for the  southern region where most of Albania's Greek minority is  concentrated.    The statement condemned the "conspiracy of silence which had  condemned to fatalism our nationality question and our brothers  in Northern Epirus." The attack was an attempt to transform the  "catastrophic situation" of the Greek minority that had led to  Malvi's creation, the statement said.    According to Athens some 400,000 ethnic Greeks live in  Albania, but Tirana puts the figure at 60,000.</p>

The Stuttgart telecommunications  equipment manufacturer Alcatel SEL, a subsidiary of Alcatel,  recorded a drop in turnover of 11 percent, from 6.3 billion  German marks [DM] to DM5.6 billion, in fiscal year 1993. In  addition to the general weakness of the economy, the company  sees the continuous drop in prices as one of the reasons for the  loss. The people in Stuttgart want to form two new companies and  close down a production unit to lower costs and increase  efficiency.    In the words of chairman of the board, Gerhard Zeidler, the  overall economic situation is also reflected in the number of  Alcatel SEL of order entries. In comparison with the previous  year, with a volume of DM5 billion, the people in Stuttgart  received 20 percent fewer orders and had an order volume of  DM4.8 billion at the end of 1993.    The German part of the company managed to earn a surplus of  DM107.2 million in 1993, while only the year before it made a  profit of DM160.1 million. According to Zeidler, this deficit is  essentially attributable to the negative effects of volume and  prices. Despite the general drop in turnover of 10 percent among  suppliers of communications hardware, at Alcatel they do not  want to get into the booming operator market, since a  confrontational course with current customers is to be avoided.  However, Alcatel will also further participate in the operation  of the networks, as in Kazakhstan, if the carriers so desire.    To be sure, Zeidler does not expect his company to grow  again  in 1994, but he does hope to keep it at its 1993 level. As for  the future, the chairman of the board wants to develop new lines  of business, such as interactive television, corporate networks,  and traffic management.    To lower costs and increase efficiency, Zeidler plans to  concentrate telephone exchange and broadcasting technology at  the plants in Gunzenhausen, Arnstadt, and Rochlitz and to close  down the production unit in Stuttgart. The state capital, the  chairman of the board said, "will continue to be the biggest  plant, but with a new commercial focus." In Zeidler's words,  "software and services should have a future" in the Swabian  metropolis.    Furthermore, the company management plans to set up two  companies. The mobile communications product department is  supposed to be converted into a company by as early as 1 July  1994. The detachment of the company's office communications  department is scheduled for 1 January 1995. Zeidler has high  hopes that these measures will concentrate authorizations to  make decisions and produce better cooperation in the  international Alcatel combine.    As a consequence of the reorganization and the concentration  of production, the company wants to eliminate another 1,500 jobs  by the end of 1995. About 600 jobs will be affected by the cuts  at the Stuttgart plant, which at present provides about 900 jobs.</p>

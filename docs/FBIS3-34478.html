In a statement released in Beirut, the movement said: We  affirm that we have no connection, either closely or distantly,  with the assassination of the first secretary [as heard] of the  Jordanian Embassy in Lebanon.    The FRC statement asserted its confidence in the Lebanese  judiciary and its integrity. The statement accused various  agencies and parties of being behind this well-devised scenario,  as the FRC statement put it.</p>

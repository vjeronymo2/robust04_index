			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Management: The need for a survival strategy - The challenges facing Japan's computer industry Western consultants and business academics are forever advising European and US companies to learn from the likes of Komatsu and Honda, NEC and Futijsu. They argue that Japanese companies are masters of the art of visionary leadership and creative strategy. Not so, according to an article* by Mochio Umeda, a senior consultant with Arthur D Little in Japan. At least in the computer industry, Japanese management is incapable of articulating a clear vision or providing leadership in the style of a US chief executive, he claims. As a result, the Japanese computer industry is facing its most serious challenge in three decades. Leaders capable of visualising new markets and products are a company's most important competitive asset, he argues. 'For Japanese companies to succeed in the computer industry, they will have to achieve this type of profound vision. This will require significant changes in the style of management practised in Japan.' Japanese management, he says, will have to give up 'its parochialism, its perverse egalitarianism, its in-group orientation and its tendency to suppress individuality and creativity'. Umeda warns that Japanese manufacturers can no longer avoid the technological trends and commercial pressures which have wrought havoc among the large western computer companies. He says that unless Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC and others are prepared to change their corporate culture, their survival could be in question. The industry is today still suffering the effects of Japan's recession. Less than four years ago, however, it was in vibrant good health. This was partly the result of a delicate blend of financial support and market protection orchestrated by the government, Umeda argues. Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi were able to build a strong and profitable home market for their mainframes, while NEC secured half the market for PCs through proprietary designs that ran special Japanese software. A consequence, however, has been that Japan lags behind the west by some years in data processing technology. It has still to come to terms with 'downsizing', where expensive mainframes are replaced by networks of smaller, cheaper machines of equivalent power. It has to decide whether to adopt industry standard operating software and it has to decide a strategy for personal computing. Umeda lists several factors which he says will result in the Japanese electronics industry sliding into crisis in the mid 1990s. First, he says the changes in data processing witnessed in the west are irreversible and that Japanese companies will inevitably follow their western equivalents in downsizing, in moving to client-server computing and to industry standard systems. 'What will happen when Japan shifts to the new culture?' Umeda queries. 'Sales of centralised processing systems will stop growing and the old-line manufacturers will see their profitability erode dramatically.' US manufacturers have reacted by restructuring on a grand scale. Umeda says Japanese companies cannot make the necessary decisions fast enough. 'They are ill-suited to the computer business which is a place of rapid change in technology, customer identity and industry structure.' He complains that Japan lacks the culture to nurture US-style venture capital businesses and has failed to create any of the important computer technologies. Umeda fails to mention, however, the alliances many have formed with western companies: Fujitsu with ICL of the UK and Amdahl of the US, NEC with Groupe Bull of France, Hitachi with Comparex. Provided they take the threat seriously, these alliances provide them with working models of ways of surviving in the new computer industry. *Failing to change: the plight of the Japanese Computer Industry.

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL VOLUNTEENS WILL GET TO WORK ALONGSIDE NURSES  </P> <P> High school students who want to work alongside nurses and other medical  professionals are being sought by the Downey Community Hospital Volunteen  organization.  </P> <P> In the past, according to Volunteen President Carrie Francisco, a senior at  Warren High School, teen-age volunteers were limited to running errands and to  staffing the reception desk. Now they will work with staff members in the  laboratory and emergency room and in the obstetrics, dietary, physical therapy  and orthopedic departments.  </P> <P> The young volunteers will not provide patient care, but they will be assigned  chores that are helpful to hospital staff members, said Dari Caldwell,  assistant administrator for nursing services. Interested youths ages 14 to 18  can telephone the hospital at 904-5033.  </P></p>

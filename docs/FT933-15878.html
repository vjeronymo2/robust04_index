			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Mexico City puts its property money where its slums are:  An ambitious real estate development ON THE western outskirts of Mexico City lies Latin America's largest and most ambitious real estate project. What a few years ago were slums, strip mines and rubbish dumps are soon to be sparkling corporate offices of some of Mexico's best-known companies - Televisa, Banca Serfin, Bimbo, and the subsidiaries of Goodyear, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard and Mercedes-Benz. The Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn, 2,100-acre Santa Fe project, just outside the city's most exclusive residential neighbourhoods, is the brainchild of the Mexico City government. Once the poorest and most dangerous part of Mexico City, it is now the most striking symbol of what is fast becoming a property boom in one of the world's largest cities. After a decade of stagnation, Mexican developers are putting up new office blocks throughout the city - in the financial district, in the fashionable western part of the city and in the south, along the ring road. According to Softec, a consultancy, some 575,892 sq m of top quality 'AAA' office space is under construction, more than the existing stock of such space. The growth has been fuelled by optimism about Mexico's economic prospects and the shortage of quality space. A sharp reduction in interest rates from 50 per cent or more a few years ago to less than 20 per cent has also enabled developers to raise the necessary finance. Construction, from accounting for less than 2 per cent of total bank loans, now represents more than 8 per cent. Mr Juan Enriquez Cabot, the city official in charge of the Santa Fe project, says: 'If we do not change this city from a manufacturing to service centre, there will not be enough jobs and the informal economy will take over. We have no option but to grow.' Mexico City needs to create 100,000 jobs a year just to absorb new entrants into the labour force. But the boom is already raising fears of a bust, and vacancy rates have started to climb from about 1.2 per cent in 1991, to 7.6 per cent last year. 'We have passed the peak,' says Dionosio Sanchez, an executive with the Sare group, one of Mexico's biggest property developers. 'The first thing we are going to see now is a reduction in prices.' Since 1988, Mexico City's top quality office rents have risen from an average of Dollars 20 a sq m to Dollars 40 last year - making them as much as double as, say, the equivalent in Los Angeles. But Mr Sanchez says rents have stabilised this year, and expects them to fall by 10 per cent or more in two years. With the economy growing by just 2.6 per cent last year - much slower than optimistic developers hoped - demand has failed to keep up with supply. 'Just about all developers are betting the North American Free Trade Agreement will be passed,' says Mr Sanchez 'and demand for quality space will grow.' If the agreement is scuttled, he says, some developers could be in difficulty. The Santa Fe project is the largest of the score of office block developments. Managed by the city government, it has already received some Dollars 2bn of private-sector investment, and another Dollars 8bn is expected over the next six to eight years. By the end of the year stage one will be complete, and Latin America's largest shopping centre, of some 200,000 sq m, and 10 state-of-the art corporate offices will be open. Elsewhere the city has given the green light to five new giant five-star hotels, including a 55-storey Ritz Carlton hotel and office block that will be Mexico City's tallest building. The state trade bank is helping to finance the Dollars 100m refurbishment of the huge but unoccupied World Trade Centre, which was started in the 1960s to be ready for the 1968 Olympics but was never completed. The construction boom is not uncontroversial. Mexico City accounts for some 37 per cent of Mexico's gross domestic product and suffers from some of the world's worst pollution, houses the country's oldest and most inefficient industrial stock and is running precariously short of water. Mr Homero Aridjis, a poet and environmentalist who has just written a novel on the future of Mexico City, says: 'It doesn't matter whether people work in industries, on the street or in universities, they all pollute. What we need is decentralisation and a stabilisation of population.'</p>

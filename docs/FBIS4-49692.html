			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- Two motions on  amendments to two regulations governing army building have been  submitted to the Seventh Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress [NPC] Standing Committee today for deliberation and  approval. One is a draft amendment to the Regulations on the  Military Service of Active-Duty Officers of the Chinese People's  Liberation Army [PLA], proposed by Premier Li Peng and the  Central Military Commission chairman Jiang Zemin; and the other  is a draft amendment to the Regulations on Military Rank of the  Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army proposed by the  Central Military Commission chairman Jiang Zemin.    The proposal made by Li Peng and Jiang Zemin on amendment of  the active-duty officer's military service regulations says:  With the constant progress in reform and construction of the  country and the army, some new circumstances and new problems  have emerged with respect to the building of the PLA's officer  corps. The modernization of the PLA in the new period  necessitates higher standards for the officer corps. So, some  articles in the "Regulations" are no longer adequate to meet the  needs of new circumstances and new tasks, and it is necessary to  make some amendment, supplement and improvement.    The proposal made by Jiang Zemin on amendment of the  military  rank regulations says: With further progress in reform and  construction of the country and the army and with the smooth  substitution of younger officers for the older ones in PLA's  officer corps, particularly among high-ranking officers, some  stipulations in the regulations are no longer in complete  conformity with the reality of the officer corps, and some  contradictions and problems happen during the course of their  implementation. So, an amendment is necessary.    At the request of the State Council and the Central Military  Commission, Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission  and director of the General Political Department, made an  explanation on the two proposed draft amendments. On the draft  amendment to the active-duty officer's military service  regulations, Yu Yongbo said: The regulations were adopted by the  Third Session of the Seventh NPC Standing Committee on 5  September 1988 and were put in force on 1 January 1989. The  guiding principle for the proposed amendment is based on Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period and  on relevant instructions of the Party Central Committee and the  Central Military Commission. It proceeds from the PLA's  reality, properly draws on the experience of foreign armies and  our local governments, and aims at making the leading bodies and  the officer corps become more revolutionary, younger in average  age, better educated, and professionally more competent. It is  designed to make the "Regulations" more conducive to maintaining  a stable officer corps, to arousing enthusiasm among the vast  number of officers, to the healthy growth of outstanding young  officers, and to normal substitution of younger officers for the  older ones in the leading bodies.    Yu Yongbo explained questions concerning the power of  officer's job assignments and removal, procedures for officer's  job assignments and removal, the age limits for active-duty  officers on various levels of posts, officer's pay scale, and  removal of officers from active duty status.    On the proposed amendment to the military rank regulations,  Yu Yongbo said: Since they were put in force on 1 July 1987,  the regulations have played an important role in perfecting the  army cadres' work system, arousing enthusiasm among the vast  number of officers, enhancing the PLA's cohesion capability, and  promoting the revolutionization, modernization and  regularization of the PLA. The guiding principle for the  proposed amendment is based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought  on army building in the new period, as well as on the realities  of our country and our army. Aimed at longterm army building,  the proposed amendment is designed to meet the needs of modern  army command and management, improve the officer's military rank  system, specify more clearly officer's responsibility, harmonize  the command relations, enhance the sense of honor and sense of  responsibility among officers, arouse their enthusiasm, and  promote the building of the officer corps in an all-round way.    Yu Yongbo also answered questions in connection with the  proposed amendment. They included questions regarding officer's  military ranks, the T/O [table of organization] military ranks  for chairman and vice chairmen of the Central Military  Commission, the T/O military ranks for various job posts held by  members of the Central Military Commission, the T/O military  ranks for various job posts of military, political and logistic  officers, the T/O military ranks for various job posts held by  specialized and technical officers, the waiting period for  promotion from second lieutenant to first lieutenant, and the  authority to approve promotion of officers in military rank.</p>

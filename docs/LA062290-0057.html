			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> HARBOR VILLAGE SUIT SETTLEMENT PROPOSED  </P> <P> Ventura Port District commissioners have approved a proposed settlement that  would resolve a multimillion-dollar lawsuit with creditors who helped finance  the construction of Harbor Village in the Ventura Harbor.  </P> <P> Harbor Village, a commercial and entertainment center, was completed in 1982  and was financed in part by a $9.5-million bond issue.  </P> <P> But four years later the developer, Ocean Services Corp. of Ventura, went  bankrupt, leaving the harbor district liable for $6.5 million in bond payments  plus interest.  </P> <P> Bank of America, the creditors' trustee, filed a lawsuit against the district  to recover its losses.  </P> <P> Ventura Harbor General Manager Richard Parsons said Thursday that the terms of  the settlement are not being disclosed because the district's creditors have  yet to accept the agreement proposal. The settlement also must be approved by  the Ventura Superior Court, where a trial is scheduled to begin Monday.  </P> <P> Parsons said that under the proposed agreement, the district would lease the  village to Beauchamp Enterprises of Newport Beach and use the lease money to  pay its creditors an undisclosed sum.  </P> <P> Parsons said the district recognizes a $7-million debt, but the bank is asking  for $10 million.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, the settlement we're proposing is much closer to their figure  than it is to ours," he said.

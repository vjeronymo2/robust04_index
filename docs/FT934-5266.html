			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (21): Be streetwise: take the long view THE STREETWISE INVESTOR by Charles L. Fahy Probus Pounds 21.50 198 pages Charles Fahy, the host of the Texas TV show Money Talks and one of America's most successful stockbrokers, has written a concise, down-to-earth, investment guide. The Streetwise Investor (a Fortune book club selection) is perfect for all those forty-somethings trying to figure out their savings and retirement schemes. Fahy's basic premise is that people should buy stocks and hold on to them. 'I have a simple formula for those who want to get rich,' he writes. 'First, earn enough money to be able to save some. With that money, buy stocks. Second, don't sell or trade stocks unless you are a real pro - and you probably aren't - so just leave them alone. Continue buying stocks and 20 years out, you will be rich.' Investors flunk this simple programme, says Mr Fahy, because 'human nature' makes us want to get rid of stocks as soon as they fail to perform well. Fahy tells us to diversify, distrust financial forecasts, and to use Single Premium Deferred Annuities (SPDAs), 'the single smartest, safest, and easiest accumulation investment product.' He cites evidence to support this and offers tips on choosing investment advisers and protecting money once it is earned. One problem with the book: Fahy hates bonds and spends two chapters assailing them. But surely bonds, which have outperformed equities this year, have a place in any sensible portfolio? Fahy's antipathy is okay if you're as rich as he is, but would you really want your pension manager to put everything into stocks? Still, if you follow the eight-step plan on page 178, you stand to earn a lot more than the Pounds 21.50 cover price.</p>

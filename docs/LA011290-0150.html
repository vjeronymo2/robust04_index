			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> CHURCH GETS BREAK ON DAY-CARE WALL  </P> <P> The city Planning Commission voted to give a child-care program at Lutheran  Church of the Master a six-month reprieve from a requirement that it build a  block wall to protect neighbors.  </P> <P> The commission voted Monday to allow a trial period to determine whether a  chain-link fence would provide adequate security and privacy for neighbors of  the church at 1601 W. La Habra Blvd.  </P> <P> The commission had previously ordered the church to build a 6-foot-high block  wall.  </P> <P> "We're a nonprofit corporation," said church spokesman Howard Koch. "We have a  small congregation. We're just not in a position to afford a block wall."  </P> <P> Day-care director Mary Ann Borders also told the commission there is a shortage  of day care for preschoolers in the community. The day-care program began  operating at the end of November and serves 27 children.  </P> <P> Commissioners David Cheverton and Charles Taylor agreed. Taylor suggested that  the center be allowed six months to prove its contention that the chain-link  fence would provide adequate protection for the neighbors.  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company: Cigarette wars hit American Brands' income AMERICAN Brands, the US tobacco and consumer goods group, has emerged as another victim of the cigarette price war as it reported a slump in third-quarter net income to Dollars 85m from Dollars 202.7m in the same period last year, writes Richard Tomkins. Price cutting in the domestic market led its American Tobacco subsidiary to turn in an operating loss of Dollars 35m for the quarter, including exceptional charges of Dollars 60m for writedowns of stock values and restructuring, the company said. Exchange rate movements on overseas earnings, particularly sterling, wiped Dollars 52m off net income. Third-quarter turnover fell to Dollars 3.3bn from Dollars 3.77bn, but the company said the figure would have been 1 per cent higher without the impact of exchange rate movements. Net income per share fell to 42 cents from 95 cents. Net income for the nine months to September was Dollars 282.4m, against Dollars 650.5m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Kresimir Zubak, president of the </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, at the session of the Constituent  Assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation in Sarajevo on 31  May -- live]    [Text] [Zubak] Ladies and gentlemen, deputies of the  Constituent Assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation,  esteemed guests, (?members of the) Presidency. As tacit laws,  that is, good traditions require, I have taken the floor to  thank you for your trust, and to express -- as is usual in such  circumstances -- a few thoughts on our current situation and the  assignments that are before us. We, Croats and Bosniak-Muslims,  as constituent nations -- including other citizens -- have  decided to reconstruct Bosnia-Herzegovina into a state entity --  the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- based on the absolute  equality of our peoples, and have given the third, the Serbian  people, the chance to join us, so that we can build it [the  Federation] -- observing the highest standard of human rights  and liberties -- into a democratic community with the highest  standards known to civilization. Before establishing this, I  would venture to say ideal, community, as our mutual political  goal, we have today taken a significant step forward. Many  [such steps] shall follow, which, due to the still fresh wounds  inflicted by our sensless conflicts, will always put to the test  our will and readiness to attain the goal that we have set  ourselves. Owing to this, we need to remind ourselves  constantly that, due to our inability to recognize in our  differences our mutual interests and goals, we have used the  language of arms instead of using the language of mutual  deference and tolerance in an attempt to accommodate these  differences. The most tragic thing is that, even though we are  all victims, irresponsible individuals and groups -- [words  indistinct] means and methods -- that could have easily led to  our identification with the aggressor [who attacked] our  peoples. We have, thank God, transcended this situation. I  have stressed this because I am convinced that we have matured  through this painful experince, and that the second sentence of  our Constitution -- the rejection of the violence of war -- will  be a lasting element in our mutual relations. All our problems,  all conflicts of interest, have to be solved through political  means in the institutions of the Federation in accordance with  the procedures and ways established by the Constitution and the  regulations that we shall adopt.    Our peoples are political partners that need to coordinate  their rights, interests, and needs, at the same time fully  respecting the right [passage indistinct]. [Words indistinct]  established our mutual goal and determined the way to achieving  it, we must in advance be aware that we shall sometimes meet  with deadlocks on this way. This is normal and commonplace in  all democratic countries and we must be prepared for such  situations. Once this happens to us, we should not give in to  doubts about one another. Instead of riding a wave of  enthusiasm, we must be sober and patient in building our  relations, taking into acount [word indistinct], and we need to  see the community in which we have lived together for centuries  and in which we must continue living, as a state entity in which  our differences will be established. [sentence as heard] The  fervor of brotherhood and unity has unfortunately led us to  violence. Therefore, in place of fervor, which is the mother of  both [word indistinct] and imporovizations, I am more inclined  toward a gradual and patient building of the foundations and the  framework of our community, because the transitional period is  -- at least, this is the way I see it -- a period during which  we need to lay the foundations of our state community.  Immediately and from this moment on, we must think about mutual  forgiveness. Ladies and gentlemen, you have electd as president  of the Federation a man who has never had aspirations to do any  work involving politics. By (?following) my conscience, I have,  from the beginning, joined the just, defensive war of my people,  at the same time attempting to contribute to the affirmation of  its rights and [word indistinct]. At the same time, I have never  believed that any rights and interests could or should be  greater than the rights and interests of the other peoples with  whom we live in our mutual homeland of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  During this transitional period -- owing more to circumstances  than my wish -- I have to perform the duties that are of a  higher political (?nature). I do not know how good a solution  this is, that a political amateur should be assuming such  significant duties, particularly since I am trying to coordinate  my thoughts, words, and deeds, which people claim is not a  desirable quality in political spheres. To many this may sound  stereotypical, cordial, and therefore not entirely convincing,  but I do not know any other way of saying this; you can rest  assured that I will carry out the duties of president of the  Federation in the transitional period in accordance with the  adopted Constitution -- conscientiously and responsibly -- and  in the interest of our peoples and citizens. Thank you.</p>

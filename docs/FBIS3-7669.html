He said none of the refugees had been forced home against  their will.    The deputy commander said the refugees had been moved to a  site in Ban Saptali after their representatives asked the task  force not to push them into returning from where they had come.    "We had to relocate them to a safe area for humanitarian  reasons," he told some 40 reporters on a tour of Ban Phakkat and  Ban Saptali organised by the Supreme Command headquarters.    "It would have been forceful repatriation if we pushed them  back in the same direction from where they had come."    About 25,000 Cambodians took refuge along the border near  Ban  Phakkat in Pong Namron District when Phnom Penh forces seized  the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin last week.    Rear Admiral Thirat said the refugees had all been  repatriated last Saturday after he received an order from the  Government to push them back to Cambodia.    He said the task force commander Vice Admiral Manat  Pinkunabut, met with representatives of the refugees last Friday  where he was asked to repatriate them to a safe area within at  least 10 kilometres of Ban Phakkat.    The deputy commander said Ban Saptali about 20 kilometres  north of Ban Phakkat had been selected as the repatriation site  as about 400 Cambodians lived in the area.    The Cambodians had volunteered to be relocated to Ban  Saptali.    He said the allegation that authorities had been guilty of  inhuman acts while conducting the repatriation was unfounded.    "We did not force them to Ban Saptali. They volunteered to  go there. It is the safest site. This is not inhumanity."    Rear Admiral Thirat said local authorities had to provide  aid  to refugees for humanitarian reasons which "does not mean we are  supporting either side."</p>

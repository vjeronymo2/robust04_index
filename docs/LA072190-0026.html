			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GANG MEMBER PLEADS GUILTY IN TEEN'S SLAYING  </P> <P> One of three gang members who participated in the beating and fatal shooting of  16-year-old Jimmie Torrez III pleaded guilty Friday to first-degree murder in  the Aug. 27 slaying.  </P> <P> The killing produced an outpouring of community concern over increased gang  activity in San Fernando. A candlelight vigil attended by 300 was held in  memory of Torrez, who was attacked after falling off his motorcycle while  trying to escape the gang members.  </P> <P> Albert Martinez, 21, also pleaded guilty to a recently enacted state law that  makes membership in a street gang a crime. It was one of the first such  convictions in Los Angeles County, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison said.  </P> <P> On July 3, an accomplice of Martinez's, Manuel Madrigal, 23, became the first  defendant convicted by a Los Angeles County jury under the street gang law,  which went into effect last year, Nison said. Madrigal also was convicted of  first-degree murder in the killing of Torrez and faces 26 years to life in  prison when he is sentenced Monday.  </P> <P> Martinez faces 27 years to life in prison when he is sentenced Aug. 23, Nison  said.  </P> <P> The third defendant in the killing, Robert Flores, 24, of Pacoima, pleaded  guilty May 30 to voluntary manslaughter and is scheduled to be sentenced July  27. He is expected to receive the maximum 12-year prison term, Nison said.  </P> <P> Martinez and Madrigal beat Torrez after the boy fell off a motorcycle they had  been chasing on a San Fernando street, Nison said. But it was Martinez who  retrieved a .22-caliber assault rifle from the trunk of his car moments after  the beating and shot the wounded Torrez once in the head and five times in the  chest, Nison said. Flores was with the other two but may not have participated  in the killing, authorities said.  </P> <P> The men mistakenly thought Torrez had killed a member of a gang with which they  were associated, police said.  </P></p>

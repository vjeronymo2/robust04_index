			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek, "Choice," under the </F> rubric "Of Current Interest": "The Strategy and Tactics of the  Nomenklatura in the Forthcoming Elections"]    [Text] The nature of electoral legislation has been of  priority significance for the nomenklatura in the past and  present alike. A law on elections is a law on power. When the  democrats sat down at the quasi-negotiating table with  Durdynets, Kotsyuba, and Novitskiy, they should have understood  that the "party of power" would adhere to the agreements  previously reached between the blocs of "democrats" and  "nondemocrats" only as long as they pertained to secondary  aspects. Meanwhile, power is of the essence.    On the whole, all the "amendments and additions" in which  the  adopted law differs from the draft pursue just one objective: to  stay in power. Five real mechanisms have been envisioned to  accomplish this:    1. Reelection of the powers that be for new terms and the  "sneaking in" of new people who are "ours."    2. An opportunity to manipulate the votes of the electorate.    3. A consistent antiparty tenor.    4. The mechanism of financing the elections.    5. The creation of an appropriate informational environment.  <H3>  The Reelection of the Powers That Be for New Terms and the  "Sneaking In" of New People Who Are "Ours" </H3>   The first conclusion is: The law has been "manufactured" to  favor not even the nomenklatura as such, but just one of its  groups, namely--the group of the speaker of the parliament.  Article 14 of the draft provided that "the deputy chairman and  nine members of the commission shall be appointed by the  president of Ukraine" to the Central Electoral Commission,  whereas the law (Article 15) says that "the Central Electoral  Commission consisting of the chairman, two deputy chairmen, a  secretary, and 11 members of the commission shall be confirmed  by the Supreme Council of Ukraine upon presentation by the  chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine." The situation is  unique: In essence, Ukraine is the only state in the world in  which the executive authorities themselves conduct the election  of the executive authorities, and actually--the parliamentary  majority, which strives to rob not only the parties and the  press but also "competitors" from the opposite group of the  nomenklatura of as much influence on the conduct of the  elections as possible.    To a considerable degree, the vain attempts of the  nomenklatura to create legislation are focused on a search for a  secure way out of the trap into which it has driven itself by  passing the decision on the "professional character" of the  parliament. It automatically follows from the above that, from  the moment the new parliament is elected, neither the directors,  nor the kolkhoz chairmen, nor the generals, nor the  administrators of the mass media will be able to "shake loose"  state subsidies, at least not directly while holding at the same  time positions as managers of establishments in the national  economy and as members of parliament. However, the nomenklatura  cannot yield the parliamentary "battlefield" in the struggle for  state funds; therefore, the issue of the need to have "one of  our own" in parliament arises.    Let us imagine the logic of behavior of a common "worker"  (soldier, kolkhoz peasant) in a situation in which his immediate  commander (director, kolkhoz chairman) does not quit his job at  a certain point before the elections, but merely proclaims his  obligation to resign in the event he is elected a people's  deputy. If we disregard the touching desire of the current  community of people's deputies to protect their director  colleagues or their people against the threat of losing their  positions in the case of an election fiasco, the goal of this  "innovation" in the law becomes more transparent: It is hard to  imagine that any "worker" will have the slightest desire to  openly come out against the director-candidate at a conference  of the labor collective: In the event the manager is not elected  a deputy, he will resume his professional duties but, rest  assured, with an excellent recollection of who precisely  interfered with his occupying the "sweet" seat of a deputy. The  revenge scenario is completely up to the director's imagination:  He controls leave pay and days off, duty assignments and  vouchers, sick pay, and apartment waiting lists.  <H5>  "Our Man in the Parliament": The Legend of a Labor Collective </H5>   The so-called "labor collective" (TK) claims the role of the  "horse" that must carry the nomenklatura people between the rock  and the hard place--the desire to receive credit and lack of  opportunity for direct representation in the parliament.  Incidentally, this notion is without parallel in any legislation  of the democratic world in whose labor laws employers, hired  workers, and trade unions are very clearly separated. It is a  thankless endeavor to roll them into one.    How is it that the notion of "labor collective" has migrated  from the Ukrainian post-Soviet labor legislation into electoral  legislation? If it were not enough that the Law on Elections  does not define the labor collective, even the definitions that  are found in three other laws provide either an ideologized or a  purely production-oriented definition of the labor  collective--the "Constitution" ("an element of the political  system of the country," "a community of people who are free of  exploitation"), the Code of Labor Law ("all citizens taking part  in the operation of an enterprise on the basis of a labor  contract, bargain, or agreement"), and the Law on Enterprises  ("the collective of any enterprise, regardless of form of  ownership and number of employees"). Not one of the laws assigns  a political and legal role to the labor collective. The  demagogic argument that "a person at the place of employment  knows better who will protect his interests" is called upon to  conceal the real role assigned by the nomenklatura to the labor  collective--to manipulate the interests of production in favor  of political interests, and then not even its own political  interests, but those of the management.    The Law on Elections (Article 23, Point 7) also envisions a  specific mechanism for manipulating the will of the labor  collective. In particular, "when a candidate for deputy is  nominated by a labor collective, a petition shall be signed on  behalf of the collective by an individual so authorized by a  meeting or a conference." It is not noted how many members of  the labor collective must be present at the meeting and what  particulars should be recorded in the minutes of the  conference--that is, everything that is indicated in the Law on  Political Parties and everything that distinguishes the latter  favorably from the election law. Once again, at issue is the  fact that the nomenklatura has simplified the procedure for  nominating its candidate as much as possible rather than the  antiparty tenor of the election law.  <H3>  Methods for Manipulating the Votes and the Production of  "Dead Souls" </H3>   Chapters regulating the operation of precinct electoral  commission have undergone the most amendments and additions,  which have wiped out the potential democratic nature of the law.  This is not surprising: Ultimately, it is in specific precincts  that victory or defeat in an election is decided.    The introduction of the so-called voter card on a pattern  used in France was one of the most important aspects of the  voting procedure proposed in the draft which would prevent abuse  of votes. The card was supposed to be numbered; one-half of it  was to be traded in for a ballot, and the second half was to be  retained by the voter, which hampers potential trickery  considerably. In the law (Article 40), the voter card magically  turned into the "ballot" for the receipt of which a citizen  signs before voting. However, no mechanism is envisioned which  would subsequently obstruct the replacing of one ballot with  another.    A second opportunity to manipulate votes is built into  Article 41 of the law. Article 42 of the draft regulates in  detail the early voting procedure. If a voter changes the  location "of his sojourn during the period between the  production of the lists of voters for public familiarization and  the election day," "the precinct electoral commission shall, at  the request of the voter and upon the presentation of a passport  or another document certifying his identity and the voter card  (invitation), issue a ballot for which the voter shall sign on  the voter roll, and shall mark the date of voting, ...the ballot  filled out by the voting person shall be placed by him in a  ballot box sealed with lead or wax, ...the ballot box shall be  kept by the precinct electoral commission and opened on the  general election day." In the law, we see in Article 41 only  that "if a voter changes the location of his sojourn during the  period between the production of the lists of voters for public  familiarization and the election day, he may vote early." The  absence of clear-cut regulations on procedures for early voting  in the law suggests the thought that a "loophole" is also  envisioned here. There is nothing standing in the way of a few  hundred nonexistent voters--"dead souls"--voting "early," and  there is no mechanism that would make such voting impossible.    Possible abuses of the votes of servicemen should be placed  in a category by themselves. Thus, the provision on the  opportunity for servicemen in compulsory service to vote at the  location of their permanent residence or conscription which was  envisioned by the draft was "dropped" from the law. Instead,  Article 20 "Voter Rolls and Procedures for Drawing Them Up,"  which regulates drawing up the rolls of voter-servicemen, says  that "on 26 February the commanders of military units must bring  voter rolls to election precincts." However, it was providently  "forgotten" that a military unit (that is, regiment-level or  higher) is itself an election precinct and, consequently, the  commanders should bring these lists to themselves. If we "tie"  this to restrictions on conducting propaganda in military units,  which the law also envisions, it will become clear that most  likely no effective control at all will be exercised over the  real number of voter-soldiers and the freedom of the expression  of their will.    It is possible to manipulate the votes of the electorate not  only by using "early voters," "four-month voters," and the  military. If this turns out to be insufficient, the nomenklatura  may use another method which Article 42 "Vote Counting at  Polling Places" suggests is possible. Point 6 of the article  says the minutes of vote counting shall be compiled in  triplicate: One copy shall be sent to the district electoral  commission, another shall remain at the polling station, and the  third shall be displayed for public inspection. Under the  circumstances, Western experts consider possible a recurrence of  the so-called "Romanian scenario" whereby the first sheet is  stolen, the second damaged, and the third forged. That is to  say, three copies of the minutes are clearly not enough.  However, "if they light up the stars, then someone needs it that  way...." This is vividly confirmed by the fact that proposals to  draw up five copies of the minutes, two of which would be kept  by representatives of the public designated by consensus, did  not gain the support of the majority in the Supreme Council.  <H5>  The Mechanism of Financing the Elections </H5>   It is common knowledge that financing "governs" elections.  Obviously, this issue could not escape the attention of the  nomenklatura. The law (Article 36, Point 4) specifies that the  size of the proprietary electoral fund of a candidate for deputy  should not exceed 10 times the minimum salary. It is clear that  it is impossible to conduct elections with this kind of money;  the authors of the draft also understood this. For this reason,  a total of 15 points were "built into" the draft, of which the  parliamentary majority kept only eight. For the most part, norms  that were supposed to prevent abuses during the election  campaign were omitted: It was proposed to set the size of the  proprietary fund at 500 minimum wages (an amount with which one  could at least try to accomplish something); there was a  mechanism for the rejection by a candidate of nonmonetary  "presents" that compromise him, for example, paper for printing  propaganda materials. A restriction was set forth on the  transfer of funds from legal entities and individuals. However,  the majority did not pass these wordings, most likely striving  to achieve a double objective: to use the money of state  enterprises in the election campaign themselves, and to create a  situation in which democrats whose search for independent  sources of financing immediately became illegal could be  compromised. To be sure, the requirement that data on financing  be released 20 days after the elections remains, but will it be  possible to verify such data? Besides, will this verification  make sense given that its results cannot influence recognition  or nonrecognition of deputy powers?    Since it is clear that in terms of the number of those  willing to taste the bread of deputy per capita Ukraine is  coming to rank among the first in the world, due financing for  the election campaign will become one of the crucial factors of  election victories.  <H5>  Creation of an Appropriate Informational Environment </H5>   Responsibility for informing the public about the course of  the elections fully devolves on the electoral commissions, that  is, on Plyushch's people. Thus, it is envisioned that a  candidate's electoral platform must be published in the local  state mass media. However, nothing stands in the way of  publishing the platform of one candidate, say, on 1 February,  and that of his competitor--on 24 March, that is, three days  before the elections. A scenario is also possible whereby the  centralized printing of propaganda materials 20 days before the  elections in the amount of 2,000 copies per candidate turns from  an apparent benefit into the opposite. This may happen if  someone makes a mistake in the last name of the candidate,  inserts the wrong picture, or confuses something else. The law  does not even mention whether it is mandatory to have the  materials printed again at the expense of the state and how  quickly this should be done.    The fact that the parliamentary majority has not passed  something mandatory for the nonstate mass media, too, is perhaps  due to the parliamentary majority still not believing in the  reality of private newspapers and TV and radio broadcasting  companies influencing the population, rather than to the fact  that the state has learned to understand the difference between  private and state property (let us recall the situation  involving commercial banks).    However, noteworthy "homework" may also be found in the  chapters on the operation of the mass media. Thus, Article 18 of  the draft, "Organization of Work of the Electoral Commissions"  says that "all meetings of electoral commissions are held  publicly." The provision concerning all "publicity" was dropped  from Article 17 of the law. Instead, "the mandatory notification  of all members of the electoral commission about the time and  location of a meeting" is ordained, but nothing is said about  "mandatory notifications" for journalists, representatives of  political parties, and foreign observers. It is not ruled out  that they will simply "forget" to notify some disloyal  journalists.    That the parliament will operate on a professional basis is  the most surprising point under the circumstances from among  everything enumerated. Nothing stood in the way of the already  mentioned directors using an "inseparable bond with the masses"  as an argument in favor of the need for a people's deputy to  work in production, as they have done in the case of nominating  candidates from labor collectives.    However, rumors about the number of supporters for combining  the art of kitchen maid (on the principal job) with that of  member of parliament (during time off from the principal job)  increasing catastrophically in the Supreme Council may yet come  true in some masterpieces from the electoral kitchen, which we  are eagerly awaiting.</p>

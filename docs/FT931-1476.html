			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cheap birds shave off Pounds 10m at B Matthews PRE-TAX profits at Bernard Matthews, the poultry processor, fell by 75 per cent in 1992 as low-priced imports from the US and Europe and falling demand in the UK market for whole turkeys hit the Norfolk-based company hard. Profits in the 53 weeks to January 3 were Pounds 3.33m, compared with Pounds 13.2m in the previous 52 weeks. Turnover was down from Pounds 148.4m to Pounds 144.2m. Mr Bernard Matthews, chairman, said profits from value-added processed turkey products had risen. These account for about 80 per cent of turnover. Losses in the company's whole bird and commodity meats business had caused the overall reversal. He said the added competitiveness as a result of sterling's devaluation had led to some improvement so far this year. Demand was also up, but prices were still extremely low. Meanwhile, Mr Matthews announced his company's second venture into continental Europe, through the Pounds 2.7m cash acquisition of a 90 per cent share in Sarvari Baromfiipari, a Hungarian producer of turkey, chicken, goose and duck meat. Sarvari, with net assets last June of Pounds 12.3m, serves the Hungarian, Swiss and Austrian markets. Mr Matthews said his company saw development in central Europe as a strategic opportunity for expansion. Bernard Matthews is also engaged in a big push to establish its processed products in France. A television advertising campaign began 10 days ago. Mr Matthews said it was too early to judge the impact. Earnings per share were 1.64p (6.95p). The final dividend is 1.25p, making a halved total of 2.25p.</p>

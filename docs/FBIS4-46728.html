			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Zamir Shibzukhov, member of the </F> Kabardino-Balkar Republic [KBR] Parliament Soviet of the  Republic Commission on Legislation, Law and Order, Security and  Human Rights, conducted by the KBR Parliament Press Center: "In  the KBR Parliament: One Decree... Was Not Enough To Resolve the  Issue of Limiting KBR Residence Permits"]    [Text] As already reported by the press, the joint  session of the houses of the KBR Parliament will continue on 20  April 1994. On the deputies' agenda is consideration, among  other matter, of the issue of a temporary suspension of  residence permit issuance in the KBR. As you are aware, this  matter was previously discussed by the KBR Supreme Soviet, which  by a decree issued on 30 August 1990 temporarily suspended the  issuance of permanent residence permits in the KBR. It was in  connection that this that the KBR Parliament is now taking up  the issue again. This was the subject of our interview with  Zamir Shibzukhov, a member of the KBR Parliament Soviet of the  Republic's Commission on Legislation, Law and Order, Security  and Human Rights.    [Shibzukhov] Yes, the Supreme Soviet did in fact issue its  decree, and that decree has not yet expired, no one has repealed  it, and it remains in effect. Furthermore, the KBR Council of  Ministers, and later the Cabinet of Ministers, have issued a  number of directives and decrees in compliance with that decree.  A number of orders in connection with this also exist within the  Ministry of Internal Affairs system, which issues residence  permits to citizens.    The Supreme Soviet was forced to make the decision in  question due to our republic's overpopulation and acute problems  with housing, food and other social issues. The primary purpose  of the decree was to restrict unregulated migration into the  republic.    [Press Center] And have we succeeded in eliminating the  problem?    [Shibzukhov] Unfortunately not. Plus new problems have  emerged that are equally difficult. Our republic has become a  border area of the Russian Federation, an area located in  immediate proximity to regions of interethnic conflict. There  has been a sharp upsurge in the crime rate, and interethnic  problems are on the rise.    [Press Center] Insofar as I am aware, the influx of migrants  is not decreasing, is it?    [Shibzukhov] Despite the measures taken, the influx of  residents into our republic has only been restricted  insignificantly. Population density in this republic is eight  times higher than the average for Russia as a whole. According  to statistics from the State Committee for Statistics and the  KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs, 7,519 people took up residence  in the republic in 1993, or 2,028 more than in 1992. Recently,  and particularly within the past year, various individuals have  resided here without registering by evading current statutes.  Those individuals now number several thousand. They generally  accomplish this by acquiring houses or apartments by various  means.    [Press Center] A decree by our highest legislative body did  not help. Why not?    [Shibzukhov] The main purpose of that Supreme Soviet decree  was not accomplished. Furthermore, the lack of a clear-cut,  well-planned and well-organized mechanism for implementation of  the decree resulted in various abuses by local bureaucrats and  allowed many officials to feed at the trough. As proof allow me  to cite just one fact. According to Ministry of Internal Affairs  information, a total of 2,194 people were illegally issued  residence permits in our republic in 1993 alone.    I think that what I have said makes it quite clear why the  Parliament has taken up this issue once again.    [Press Center] What is going to be done now?    [Shibzukhov] The commission on legislation, law and order,  security and human rights in both houses of Parliament have been  instructed to prepare specific proposals in regard to this  matter. We have prepared those proposals in the form of a draft  decree. The deputies will have the final say. The proposals  pertain, once again, to restrictions on residence permits and  expropriation of houses and apartments. The Parliament should  establish clear-cut control over the mechanisms by which this  decree is implemented.    I can already see your next question coming: how legal are  these restrictions? Yes, it should be noted that some deputies  have pointed out that the new Constitution of the Russian  Federation, and along with it the KBR Constitution, proclaim the  freedom to relocate and choose one's place of residence. On that  point I would like to comment that no specific legal act  forbidding the issuance of residence permits has ever been  adopted. On the contrary, residence permits and restrictions on  them exist throughout the Russian Federation. Furthermore, the  measures we are proposing are purely temporary in nature.    [Press Center] Well, we can only hope that this time the  decision made by our highest legislative body will be more  effective.</p>

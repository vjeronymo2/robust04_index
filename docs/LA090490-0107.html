			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARABS SAY ROLE IS DEFENSIVE ONLY, REJECT TOUGH TALK  </P> <P> Arab troops in Saudi Arabia have no charter to join any offensive action to  liberate Kuwait, and some Arab officials fear that tough talk in the United  States and the Persian Gulf about ending Saddam Hussein's reign in Iraq has  hampered recent efforts to achieve a diplomatic resolution, a leading Arab  diplomat said Monday.  </P> <P> "It's a very dangerous situation. All the ingredients for explosion are there.  Anybody, any incident, could start a war now, and if this is started, nobody  knows how it will end," said the official, who, along with other diplomats from  Arab and Muslim countries, spoke on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> The diplomats emphasized that the role of the Arab and Islamic multinational  force now in Saudi Arabia is limited to defending that country's territory. The  senior official said that the only circumstance under which Arab troops would  enter Kuwait would be as "a peacekeeping force, to replace the Iraqi forces,  but not to fight them."  </P> <P> Egypt, Morocco, Syria and Pakistan have all sent troops to join a 10,000-man  permanent force from six Persian Gulf nations currently deployed near Saudi  Arabia's northern border with Kuwait and Iraq. Additional troops from  Bangladesh are scheduled to arrive soon.  </P> <P> The Arabic forces report to Saudi military commanders, and one Arab diplomat  helping oversee their operation said that any attempt to use them in connection  with an American offensive against Iraq or Kuwait "would not be in conformity  with their mission."  </P> <P> "This is a very serious thing, and it would be against the agreement that is  now in place," he said, adding that the present terms of deployment are both  political and pragmatic. "With the small amount of our force, it will serve a  much more useful purpose if we are left to a defensive role in Saudi Arabia,"  he said.  </P> <P> In Baghdad on Monday, the ruling party newspaper Thawra belittled a pledge by  the Saudi defense minister that American forces would not mount an invasion of  Kuwait from Saudi soil.  </P> <P> The Saudis could not control the Americans, the Baath Socialist Party organ  charged, referring to Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz's remark at a Saturday press  conference. "It is the Pentagon and not the slave Sultan that decides the tasks  of these forces," it said.  </P> <P> Arab officials said efforts to achieve a diplomatic resolution are under way in  Jordan, Libya and most recently, Algeria and other North African countries, but  one official says they have been hampered by statements from U.S., Saudi and  other officials declaring that Hussein must be removed from the helm in Iraq if  there is to be any long-term stability in the region.  </P> <P> "This is very dangerous. We should abstain from threatening Saddam Hussein  personally. If somebody is cornered from all circles, he will not compromise.  He will fight. There must be an escape route, a way out," the official  observed.  </P> <P> "If he thinks that time is in his favor, the process of peaceful settlement  could start to work, as long as he is convinced that the goal is not his neck.  If he is convinced the Americans are here for that, then there is no formula  for a peaceful solution. Then war is imminent."  </P> <P> In Paris, the foreign ministers of five Arab League nations ended a two-day  meeting by adopting a working document -- its contents were kept secret -- to  be relayed to the leaders of Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia  for further consideration.  </P> <P> The ministers' closed-door discussions were believed to have included seeking  an "Arab solution" to Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. A source close to the  discussions said Monday there was a "broad convergence of views."  </P> <P> The five North African countries took opposing sides at the Arab League vote  last month in Cairo on whether to support sending troops to the multinational  peacekeeping force. Morocco voted in favor of sending troops, Libya against and  Algeria and Mauritania abstained. Tunisia boycotted the meeting.  </P> <P> Most of the Arab diplomats who spoke in Saudi Arabia said they could not  discuss the precise number of Arab and other Islamic troops currently deployed  or on their way to the region. The overall present deployment is thought to be  less than 20,000, counting the 10,000-strong Peninsula Shield force from the  Persian Gulf countries. A U.S. official said the arrival of new Arab and  Islamic troops has in some cases been delayed by Saudi Arabia's temporary  inability to accommodate them.  </P> <P> "Some of these Arab troops that arrived came with nothing but the clothes on  their backs . . . and it's a fantastic expense and strain on the Saudi  logistics system to support those people," the official said.  </P> <P> Saudi officials may in some cases be trying not to appear overly eager to  welcome large numbers of new Arab troops in an attempt to hold down the cost  they will eventually have to pay for them, he said.  </P> <P> "It's not just that the Saudis want Arab troops but that the Arab troops think  they'll get paid. There's a certain amount of bargaining going on . . . and at  some point, even Saudi money is not infinite."  </P> <P> Financial arrangements with most of the Arab and Islamic countries have not  been disclosed, and in most cases have yet to be fully resolved.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia's King Fahd recently announced that the kingdom is donating $100  million to Egypt to help "lessen the suffering" of Egyptian workers in Iraq and  Kuwait displaced by the crisis, and U.S. officials said this week that they  plan to forgive Egypt's $7.1 billion military debt, an action that had been  under discussion even before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Egyptian soldiers have been arriving equipped with combat gear, rifles,  ammunition, electrical generators and other equipment but have been dependent  on the Saudis primarily for tents and catering. A recent tour of a Moroccan  troop site showed that many of the troops had no tents and were outfitted in  sandals.  </P> <P> Most Arab and Islamic diplomats vigorously denied that financial compensation  or the promise of jobs for their nationals in Saudi Arabia played any role in  the decision to send troops.  </P> <P> "We have a deep, deep emotional commitment to Saudi Arabia, the site of the two  holy shrines (of Islam), that goes much deeper than just workers," said one  official.  </P></p>

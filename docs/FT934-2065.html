			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Eight die in Sarajevo attack Eight people were killed and 10 were wounded in a heavy mortar and artillery attack on central Sarajevo yesterday, the latest in a series of relatively isolated but deadly attacks on the besieged Bosnian capital, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. Doctors at Kosevo hospital, the main casualty centre, said five women and three men were killed when two mortar rounds landed near the Drvenija bridge and near the barracks of the Egyptian United Nations brigade. A Bosnian soldier was killed by a sniper in the Vogosca district. The latest fighting has forced UN peacekeepers to close the airport, which is under their control. Fierce fighting was also reported in central Bosnia. According to Croatian radio, Moslem troops launched a heavy artillery and mortar attack on Croat positions around Zepce. The radio said the Moslem side used two helicopters to drop explosive devices on Croat positions, in violation of a UN no-fly zone over the whole of former Yugoslavia. The radio also reported that special units of the 3rd Corps of the Moslem-led government army, including some foreign Mujahideen, fired more than 100 shells at the Zepce area in central Bosnia. To the east of the Bosnian capital Serbs were reported by government-controlled Sarajevo radio to have attacked two Moslem enclaves that are supposed to be UN 'safe areas'. The radio said four people had been killed and two wounded over the past few days in artillery attacks on Gorazde, south-east of Sarajevo, and five people were wounded by shelling in Srebrenica, north-east of the capital. Meanwhile, the UN said yesterday that it had agreed to let Bosnian Serb police escort aid convoys through Serb-held areas to avert delays.</p>

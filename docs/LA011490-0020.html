			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: CRYING FOR A DREAM BY RICHARD ERDOES (BEAR &amp; CO.:  $24.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Austrian-born ethnographer Richard Erdoes presents a celebration of the rituals  of the Great Plains and Southwestern Amerindian tribes that stresses their  belief in the sacredness of the Earth and the unity of all life.  </P> <P> His exceptional color photographs supplement descriptions of rites from  19th-Century and contemporary sources. The resulting book offers a welcome  counter to the popular images of Indians as either bloodthirsty savages in B  Westerns or idealized noble red warriors. The inhabitants of an increasingly  threatened planet have much to learn from the Indians' reverence for the Earth  and its creatures.  </P></p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Deputies shun Tatarstan treaty Russian deputies yesterday refused to vote on the treaty signed between the Russian government and the leadership of the autonomous republic of Tatarstan, voicinggrowing concern that the agreement cedes too much power to the republic. Mr Genady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist Party, said yesterday that deputies refused to vote because six separate agreements, including details of fiscal and other relations between the two sides, had not been published. Mr Fyodor Shelov-Kovedayev, a former first deputy foreign minister and leading member of Russia's Choice, said that the agreement could lead to a 'break-up of the federation'. In the main treaty, which has been published, the issue of the Tatarstan constitution - which describes the republic as a sovereign state and which was declared incompatible with the previous Russian constitution by the then constitutional court - has been dropped. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, minister for regions and nationalities and one of the main negotiators of the reaty, admitted that the Tatar parliament would be unlikely to amend or revoke their constitution in the near future. The treaty is also ambiguous about who has the right to levy taxes and on what they are to be spent. Mr Shakhrai said that the original demand of Tatarstan to have a 'one channel' tax system under which it would decide which if any taxes to remit to the centre had been squashed - but it is not clear with what it has been replaced. The treaty also explicitly allows Tatars who do not wish to serve in the Russian army to opt out in return for performing some other service specified by the Tatar authorities - a large concession in a country where compulsory service is widely resented and evaded.</p>

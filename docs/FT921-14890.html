			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Ports in disarray THE SAGA of the trust ports has turned into one of the most bizarre in the short history of Britain's privatisation programme. What should have been a routine and uncontroversial sell-off has turned into an embarrassing debacle; and the government has only itself to blame. The roots of the government's disarray lie in the ports' unusual status. Run by independent, self-governing local trusts set up under acts of parliament, they had no owner. This raised doubts about the government's right either to force their sale to the private sector or to take a share in the proceeds. In legislating to overcome this problem, the government embarked on an unsatisfactory fudge at every juncture. Privatisation was to be voluntary, the government said; but it was to be compulsory for the 15 biggest ports. The trustees themselves were to choose how their ports were to be sold and to whom, but only subject to the government's approval. Management-employee buy-outs were deemed to be desirable, but only up to an ill-defined point. The proceeds of the sales were to go to the ports, but since that would mean anyone buying a port would get all their money back, the government decided to take 50 cent for itself. With the privatisation of the first trust port to come forward - Tees &amp; Hartlepool - the chickens have come home to roost. The trustees' decision to award the port neither to the highest bidder nor the buy-out team has brought confusion, anger, and the threat of a judicial review from one of the losing bidders. The response of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, has been to say that he is 'minded' to accept the trustees' decision; meanwhile other ports have imposed an information black-out on the bidding procedure in an attempt to prevent similar embarrassments. This is no way to privatise the ports. However well-intentioned the government's motives in seeking to involve local interests in the sales, the trustees have no experience in such matters and could conceivably be presented with conflicts of interest because of their local connections. The insertion of this unnecessary layer into the decision-making process has simply served to obfuscate it. If the privatisation of the trust ports is to command public support, it must not only be fair, but be seen to be fair. Mr Rifkind should insist on a public auction of the trust ports, with the Department of Transport acting as referee. Any requirements as to employee ownership or the future development of the port could be made preconditions of the bid. Better a U-turn in favour of fair play now than more unseemly farragos such as the one over Tees &amp; Hartlepool.</p>

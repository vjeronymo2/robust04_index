			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Partial privatisation for Slovenian textile factory Beti Metlika, a Slovenian textile factory, expects to start its privatisation in November, said Mr Miroslav Stimac, its chief executive, Reuter reports from Ljubljana. The factory, which is estimated to be worth about DM33m, will sell about 30 per cent of its shares to employees and 30 per cent to other Slovenian citizens. The remaining 40 per cent of the shares will be transferred to state-run funds. Beti Metlika is still in 100 per cent social ownership and the privatisation process has been held up by resolving allocations of shares to people whose property was nationalised after the second world war. It has now been decided that they will receive between 2 and 3 per cent of the shares. Beti will send its privatisation proposal to the Slovenian Privatisation Agency at the end of this month. The company exports 80 per cent of its production, mainly to Germany, Austria, Italy, Netherlands, France and Sweden and makes clothes, underwear and swimsuits. Turnover rose to T5.14bn (Dollars 43m) in 1993 from T4.96bn in 1992 and pre-tax profits to T148.1m from T3.7m a year earlier.</p>

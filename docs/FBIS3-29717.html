"We demand an apology  from the US government over the involvement of its two  diplomatic staff in the crime of drug trafficking," said members  of the group, which claims to belong to the Front for Indonesian  Youths Saviour.    One leader, haranguing the crowd through a megaphone, said  the United States was influencing Indonesian youth with what he  called a destructive culture, was unfair towards the Muslim  world and was always forcing its interests on others. "America,  out... America, AIDS ...America, narcotics ..." the crowd  alternately yelled, as well as calling for the hanging of the  two embassy staff. The crowd, which according to police  estimates numbered 2,000 people, delivered a statement to the US  Embassy. The embassy's spokesman was not available for comment.    The demonstration leader also blamed the unrealization of  the  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATO) threat to launch an  airstrike on Serbian positions in Bosnia on pressures from  Washington. Washington, he said, was also trying to pressure  Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-populated nation, to open  ties with Israel. [passage omitted]    Reading out parts of the statement handed to the embassy,  they also accused US diplomats [of] "contempt for Indonesian  laws," for sending two embassy staff members, accused last month  of drug trafficking, to the United States last week. The  embassy has said the men would be court martialled in the United  States.    The demonstrators demanded that the two Americans,  identified  as Joseph Bryner and Michael Karajin, be returned to Indonesia  for trial and that the embassy apologize for their conduct. The  two, one holding diplomatic immunity, were among four foreigners  and two Indonesian nabbed by the police here for their alleged  involvement in the trade of a dangerous drug, known as Ecstasy.    The group, also said Washington needs to be fair and honest  in viewing the rise of Islam and its followers and avoid the  influence of the Jewish lobby when determining its foreign  policy.

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BLACK BOX HOPES TO RAISE $98 MILLION WITH OFFERINGS  </P> <P> Black Box Inc. in Simi Valley said it plans to raise about $98 million with an  initial public offering of 4.5 million common shares and an offering of $35  million in subordinated debentures, a type of debt security.  </P> <P> Black Box is the parent company of Micom Communications, which makes devices  that enable computers to share information, and Black Box Corp., a mail-order  business for data communications products.  </P> <P> Black Box Inc. was taken private as part of a $334-million leveraged buyout of  the former Micom Systems in 1988 by the New York investment firm Odyssey  Partners.  </P> <P> The company plans to use the proposed offerings' proceeds to help fund a  recapitalization plan, which includes buying back a portion of the company's  existing debt, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  </P> <P> The common shares registered with the SEC would represent about 58% of Black  Box's stock after the offering, and are expected to sell for between $12 and  $14 a share, the filing said.  </P> <P> Black Box also said its private exchange offer for $110 million of subordinated  debt ended Wednesday. It said $100 million, or about 91% of the notes offered,  were exchanged.  </P></p>

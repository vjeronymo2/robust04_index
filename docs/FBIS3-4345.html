			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 26 (XINHUA) -- The British Hong  Kong Government, by supporting amendments to the law governing  indigenous inheritance right in the New Territories, contravenes  the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, said a  Hong Kong-based Chinese official.    Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong  Kong branch, made the remarks Friday [25 March] in response to  reporters' questions about the amendment to the New Territories  Land (Exemption) Bill, which was proposed by a legislator and  supported by the Hong Kong Government.    Since the law amendment is an important matter straddling  the  1997 handover, Zhu said, consultations between China and Britain  are necessary according to the Sino-British Joint Declaration.    As for the traditional interests and rights of the New  Territories inhabitants, Zhu said the Basic Law of the future  special administrative regions has specific stipulations.    Article 40 of the Basic Law says that "the lawful  traditional  rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the `New  Territories' shall be protected by the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region."    Article 122 says that "in the case of old schedule lots,  village lots, small houses and similar rural holdings, where the  property was on 30 June 1984 held by, or, in the case of small  houses granted after that date, where the property is granted  to, a lessee descended through the male line from a person who  was in 1898 a resident of an established village in Hong Kong,  the previous rent shall remain unchanged so long as the property  is held by that lessee or by one of his lawful successors in the  male line."    Zhu pointed out that the Legislative Council, an advisory  body of the Hong Kong British authorities, has no right to make  law amendment.    He criticized some people for trying to cause divisions and  confrontation among the Hong Kong people and sabotage social  stability in the territory by taking advantage of the amendment.</p>

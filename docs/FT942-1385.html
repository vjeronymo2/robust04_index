			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Portable message from the heart A portable heart monitor developed by Colby Medical, a small UK company, will make it possible for family doctors and health clubs to screen large numbers of people for signs of heart disease. The Colby 1907, powered by rechargeable batteries, gives a wide range of electrocardiogram and other respiratory and heart readings, similar to those from an ECG machine at a specialist clinic. Readings can be downloaded to a personal computer or sent by telephone to a specialist for a second opinion. The cost to the end-user is under Pounds 1,000. Colby Medical: UK, 0277 811171</p>

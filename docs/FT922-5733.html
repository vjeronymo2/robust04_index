			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Air freight value up sharply THE VALUE of UK international air freight grew by two thirds between 1980 and 1990 to Pounds 43.7bn a year, the Department of Transport said yesterday. It accounted for almost a fifth of UK international trade. Scheduled airlines increased their grip on the market, and three quarters of international air freight - compared with half in 1980 - was carried on scheduled passenger services. London's airports handled 90 per cent of UK international air freight in 1990 - little changed since 1980. The percentage handled at Heathrow fell from 70 per cent to 62 per cent, however, while other London airports increased from 19 per cent to 26 per cent. In 1990, UK international air trade made up less than 0.5 per cent of total UK international trade by weight. UK airlines have lost ground in recent years. Their share of freight lifted and landed was about 40 per cent in 1990 against 43 per cent in 1980. Air trade with the US accounted for the highest percentage of total air trade in 1990. Air trade with the Far East jumped threefold while that with the rest of the EC rose by only 3 per cent between 1980 and 1990, with Germany accounting for the biggest EC proportion in 1990. United Kingdom Airfreight 1980-1990. HMSO. Pounds 13.</p>

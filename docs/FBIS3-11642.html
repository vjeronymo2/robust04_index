			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chilean President Eduardo Frei by </F> correspondent William Waack in Santiago; date not given]    [Text] [Waack] Chileans agree on three points: continuation  of the economic model, political democracy, and the search for  social justice. Is your only task now to fulfill those points?    [Frei] My first task is to continue this process. For the  first time since 1915 there is continuity in the government in  Chile. This is a sign of stability and support for the previous  administration. By supporting my presidential candidacy for the  coalition (the coalition of government parties made up mainly of  Christian Democrats and Socialists) Chileans were judging an  administration. The people judge a successful administration by  electing a new government from the same group. This is very  important for Chile, and defines my task. That is why I have  been saying that my proposal is continuity and change at the  same time. Continuity because we will maintain the economic  policy, with the necessary corrections to fight poverty,  concentrating on political stability.    [Waack] What will the changes be?    [Frei] This government has a different task. The Aylwin  administration replaced an authoritarian regime that had lasted  17 years. My program wants to solve the concrete problems of  people. That is my emphasis.    [Waack] You have been talking about modernizing the Chilean  Government, and you just asked your close aides to declare their  assets, which will be compared with the assets when they leave  the government. Are you concerned with corruption and the  ineffectiveness of the state system?    [Frei] One of the main problems we have in Latin America is  the gigantic state apparatus. In a modern democracy we want to  further delegate decisions to the people. They should resolve  their problems by themselves, while the state is opening more  room and creating more opportunities. This is how the issues of  honesty and administrative ability are handled. Fortunately in  Chile, as a nation, we did not have generalized corruption in  the public administration. But there are some signs of that  evil. We are part of the world, and this is a world problem.  From the first day, however, I would like to make clear signs  of administrative honesty. Politics become discredited  especially when the sense of ethics is lost. There are other  basic values to be defended: the family's sense of public  service, and the sense of our national identity. We don't want  to build a society based only on consumerism.    [Waack] Do you believe Chile is becoming the first South  American country to no longer be considered underdeveloped?    [Frei] That would be a great aspiration. We are making a  great effort, but there is still a long way to go. World  experience shows that the countries capable of defeating  underdevelopment did so by maintaining long-term economic and  social policies for more than 20 years. And this is what we are  doing here in Chile.    [Waack] Is Chile defeating the vicious circle of poverty and  misery?    [Frei] We are on the way, but we have not yet succeeded.  When Aylwin was inaugurated, about 40 percent of the population  lived in poverty and misery. Now the figure is about 27  percent. Continuing the policy we are carrying out, I believe  we will eliminate extreme misery within six years.    [Waack] Are you saying that Chile will be the first Latin  American country to fully pay its social debt?    [Frei] We are working on it. My government's priority is to  eliminate poverty. This purpose will be clearly noticeable in  the decisions I will make during the first months of my  administration. The country will feel the difference. But it is  not only a government task, it is the entire country's  responsibility. We will invite entrepreneurs, workers, and  public servants to participate. It is a national goal much more  than a government objective.    [Waack] Chile wants to join NAFTA. Are you concerned about  Brazil's economic instability and the fact that Brazil is Latin  America's largest country?    [Frei] Chile is prepared to negotiate a free trade agreement  with the United States and to participate in NAFTA because the  country has made a very great effort to correct all its  macroeconomic indicators. We should understand that if we fail  to achieve Latin American integration soon, we will not be able  to compete with larger world conglomerates such as the Pacific  group, the European Union, or NAFTA. We, Latin Americans, must  unite in order to be able to compete with these conglomerates.  We must align our economies, and in this respect I think  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic policies are very  positive. We must converge our monetary, fiscal, customs, and  ecological policies. That will permit us to advance in the  integration process.    [Waack] Are you thinking of some kind of understanding or  concrete steps to promote this type of integration with Brazil?    [Frei] I have been following Brazilian political situation,  particularly Cardoso's career. I know him personally. Fernando  Henrique lived in Chile for four years. He made many friends.  He is a very respected political figure. This is why I care  about his economic stabilization plan so much, and I wish him  all the luck possible.    [Waack] Did you know that Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso  is considered a virtual candidate for the presidency?    [Frei] I am perfectly aware of that. It would be very good  if he becomes president. Fernando Henrique is a man of great  vision. We could easily understand one other on a number of  matters. An understanding with him would be very easy.    [Waack] Many people say that the person who is truly  responsible for Chile's present stability is General Augusto  Pinochet. Do you agree with that?    [Frei] I think we must depersonalize those aspects. The  whole of society participated in the effort. It was an effort  made by political parties and workers who understood what was  important and relevant at certain moments. It was also an  effort on the part of entrepreneurs, who trusted in the country  and invested there. Last year we had the highest rate of  savings and investment. The Armed Forces also participated in  this effort. They understood that once a democratic government  was elected they had to return to their barracks and to their  constitutional role. All actors, therefore, contributed to the  stability we enjoy today.    [Waack] Gen. Pinochet will continue to be a very important  figure in Chile, just as he has been during the past 21 years.  Will you be able to ignore him?    [Frei] I think... [pauses] I mean, it is not a matter of  ignoring anyone. It is a matter of respecting the reality in  which we are living. Our political situation is characterized  by respect for the institutional system and the legal path we  chose in 1989 to discuss democratic questions. We are changing  the system from within. One of our tasks is to recover the  president's prerogative to name the Armed Forces commander, who  according to the Constitution currently in effect will stay in  his post until 1977. The president must have the responsibility  to appoint Armed Forces commanders, which has always been the  case in Chile in the past -- just as it is established in all  democratic countries in the world. This does not depend on  individuals, preferences, or personal opinion. It is a matter  of principle.    [Waack] Is your first political goal aimed at amending the  Constitution to allow you to appoint the military commanders,  and change the system for the election of members of the  Constitutional Court and the organization of the National  Security Council?    [Frei] I do not think we have different goals. The main, and  most important, objective is that right from the beginning we  are going to focus our attention on the peoples' real problems,  that is, the crisis affecting the education and health systems.  We are going to tackle the poverty problem that still affects a  large percentage of our population. The people must feel that  we, politicians, are concerned about their daily problems.  Simultaneously there is a pending constitutional issue to be  solved in Chile. It refers to the mechanism used to appoint the  members of the Constitutional Court and the National Security  Council (the current method favors the opposition). I do not  think the current method to appoint the Constitutional Court  members is democratic. I am not against a court of this type,  which exists in every country. The problem is the method used  to elect the Constitutional Court. The same goes for the  National Security Council that was elected under the previous  administration.    [Waack] What about the military?    [Frei] Those amendments to the Constitution will have to be  made within the framework of a nationwide agreement, and not  only through an agreement between the political parties and the  government. We are going to negotiate in a responsible manner  with the opposition, without taking into account the year 1997,  which is when the mandate of the designated senators expires.  We want to make these changes, and are seeking a political  balance to do so.    [Waack] Aren't you worried about the fact that your  predecessor was unable to solve the military issue?    [Frei] We can't say that President Patricio Aylwin did not  solve that problem. This is, undoubtedly, a pending issue, but  compared to the situation in 1989 the current situation is quite  different. The Armed Forces respect the civilian power. The  day after I was elected president, several authorities came to  congratulate me. Among the representatives of the most varied  sectors there were also the military commanders. They thus  respect the elected and legally established civilian government,  which, in turn, respects the professional role of the Armed  Forces.    [Waack] Do you feel comfortable with the idea of having to  coexist with a former dictator who still feels himself the judge  of national issues?    [Frei] When you are elected president of the Republic you  must focus your attention on the real problems that exist.  Those real problems are what are important, not one's personal  choices. There is a Chilean reality that must be respected.  That is what is real. But in my opinion, the president of the  Republic must recover his power, as in any part of the world, to  appoint the military commanders. This problem does not depend  on this or the other person. It is a matter of principles, and I  stick to that principle.    [Waack] Do you think that there are still pockets within  the security forces that are out of your control, such as in the  case of the Brazilian psychologist who was arrested and tortured  in a Santiago police station?    [Frei] I do not want to specifically refer to that case,  because I did not follow nor am I aware of the legal procedures  followed, but it is quite clear that it was a security problem,  because she was involved with a terrorist group. A state of law  prevails in Chile now. Therefore, if a person is arrested only  the courts can decide whether or not that person is guilty of a  crime. Neither the government nor the policy, only the courts.    [Waack] Your father governed Chile 30 years ago. Have you  ever felt you were his political heir?    [Frei] No, definitely not. I feel very comfortable saying  that. I have never in my life planned to become my father's  political heir. His political heritage must be understood in  the broadest sense of the word. He founded the Christian  Democratic Party in Chile and, in that sense, gave us a  reference framework of values and ideas which we have always  followed. This is the path I am treading now, but I definitely  do not feel myself to be his political heir. There are many  Chileans who worked with him, belonged to his government, and  can legitimately feel themselves to be his political heirs. I  obviously carry his name with great pride.    [Waack] Chileans seem to be fond of traditional names, of  political dynasties. Doesn't this seem a paradox in a society  that many consider politicized?    [Frei] Well, there are many sons of presidents who never  engaged in politics nor became president. There are also sons  of well-known intellectuals or scientists who took other paths.  I undoubtedly benefit from the great popularity my father's  government enjoyed, but the people judge me for what I am doing  today and not for what my father did 40 years ago. Chileans are  interested in the future, and not the past.    [Waack] You started your career as a politician rather late  in life. Was it a personal decision, or did circumstances get  you involved in politics?    [Frei] As a famous Spanish poet said, men are always subject  to circumstances. My decision was a personal decision. I  accompanied my father during many years in campaigns, when I was  young, but my decision to drop my work and engage in politics  was entirely personal, and was made after my father had died.    [Waack] Your election is interpreted as the end of an  important generation of politicians, of those who personally  experienced the 1973 military coup. Do you feel you are closing  an era in Chile?    [Frei] I don't think so. But there is an importance change  in generation. Many of the ministers and secretaries who are  going to accompany me are but 40 years of age or less. They  were at school or in the university in 1973.    [Waack] Will discussions regarding human rights, which have  steered politics over the past two decades, also end in Chile?    [Frei] Discussions regarding human rights will never end.  Respect for human rights is a basic value of modern societies,  and this is why it is a subject that can never be dropped. All  cases of human rights violations have been brought before the  courts, which is experiencing a crisis and must be reorganized,  as the opposition itself admits. But the cases that are still  being heard in court are still pending, that is a fact.</p>

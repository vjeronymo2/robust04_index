			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Magnetic Materials in the red Magnetic Materials Group, the USM-quoted company which last year fought off a Pounds 9.9m bid from the acquisitive TT Group, plunged into the red during the first half as restructuring costs and recession eroded profits, writes Peggy Hollinger. Mr Brian Morris, who took over as chairman in July, said the group's first interim loss was due to a sharp decline in the order book. He added, however, that orders since January were one third higher than last year at Pounds 4.5m. Pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.82m, after exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds 1.23m, compared with profits of Pounds 220,000. The result was further depressed by interest charges of Pounds 168,000, compared with gains of Pounds 50,000, due to the costs of fighting TT's bid. Turnover for the six months to December 31 fell from Pounds 7.34m to Pounds 6.82m. Losses per share were 10.1p (earnings of 0.8p). The interim dividend is reduced to 0.6p (0.9p).</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS;  </P> <P> YOUNG VENEZUELAN MISSES L.A. DRAW, BUT HAS PROMISING FUTURE  </P> <P> Since this is his first visit to Los Angeles, Venezuelan Nicolas Pereira, 18,  has made an itinerary.  </P> <P> "A couple of bars, a couple of beaches," Pereira said.  </P> <P> Pereira turns 19 Tuesday and, though he still can't legally buy a drink, he  will have plenty of time to roam the city.  </P> <P> Pereira lost to Martin Barba, 6-3, 6-3, Saturday, failing to qualify for the  $425,000 Volvo/Los Angeles tournament that begins Monday at the L.A. Tennis  Center.  </P> <P> His professional career has yet to reap many rewards, but Pereira remains a  promising player.  </P> <P> The 1988 world junior champion, Pereira won the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S.  Open junior titles, the first to win all three since Stefan Edberg in 1983.  Edberg has gone on to win three Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon.  </P> <P> Pereira is finding success in the pros vastly more difficult than in the  juniors, but he has some daunting weapons -- 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds with a  deadly serve-and-volley game.  </P> <P> He took No. 1-ranked Ivan Lendl to five sets in the first round at Wimbledon,  but lost. Pereira also lost in the first round at the U.S. Open, to Danie  Visser.  </P> <P> Pereira's best results in his first year as a pro are reaching the  quarterfinals at Tokyo and Montreal. His ranking, which he hopes to break into  the 50s next year, is No. 101.  </P> <P> "I am trying to keep everything together so I can get that one break," Pereira  said. "I need to be more consistent, to keep the momentum up in a game and to  learn to take the chances, to stay consistent in my head," he said.  </P> <P> For instance?  </P> <P> "I might play a week, then take a week off and when I come back to play, my  mind just flies away," he said.  </P> <P> He admires the classic serve-and-volley style of Boris Becker, Yannick Noah and  John McEnroe, but also the fluid baseline grace of Mats Wilander.  </P> <P> "You can find something interesting and useful in every tennis player," Pereira  said.  </P> <P> Pereira, who started playing at age 6, has been coached by Colon Nunez for  years. Pereira usually packs a guitar with him when he travels, but he left it  at home this trip.  </P> <P> And Nunez, Pereira's constant companion, is not with him either. This makes it  more difficult for Pereira, but he has learned to expect it that way.  </P> <P> "It's so hard out here because all the players are so good," he said. "It seems  like whatever you do, it's not enough. You don't have everything so sure. Not  everybody can win every tournament, though. Whoever has the mental edge.  </P> <P> "It takes a lot more than just tennis to win."  </P> <P> The new buzzword in tennis? After the U.S. Open, it's two words: muscle cramps.  Painful leg muscle cramps, a heat disorder caused by loss of fluid and  dehydration, affected Steffi Graf, Jimmy Connors and Jay Berger during their  matches.  </P> <P> Berger, in fact, had to default his quarterfinal match to Aaron Krickstein  because he could not go on in the fourth set because of leg cramps. Graf feared  she would lose her semifinal to Gabriela Sabatini because of thigh cramps and  Connors nearly quit in his quarterfinal against Andre Agassi.  </P> <P> Why did all this happen?  </P> <P> "No. 1, it was hot," said Beverly Hills physician Eli Ginzburg, a tennis player  himself, who watched the cramps attack at the Open with interest. Ginzburg  suggested that besides drinking lots of liquid, there is another way to help.  </P> <P> "I think it's always important to stretch leg muscles before the match,"  Ginzburg said.  </P> <P> Playing in hot and humid weather and on the Open's heat-absorbing artificial  surface was a powerful combination. Gary Wadler, the tournament physician, said  that heat illness is common at the Open but might have seemed more prevalent  this year because seeded players were involved.  </P> <P> Wadler said he believes the key to avoiding heat illness and the muscle cramps  that follow is simply to drink fluid before a match.  </P> <P> "The importance of taking fluids in advance of a match cannot be  overemphasized," Wadler said. "I think the events of last week underscore how  important that is."  </P> <P> Whether tension or anxiety help bring on cramps has not been established,  Wadler said.  </P> <P> From 37-year-old Jimmy Connors about publicity: "If I don't win, I don't want  to see my name in there just out of sensitivity toward me."  </P> <P> Dennis Ralston, 47, will coach French tennis star Yannick Noah full time.  </P> <P> Noah said during the U.S. Open that Ralston had agreed to coach him, but he did  not say to what extent. Noah reached the quarterfinals and lost to eventual  champion Boris Becker, but his ranking improved nine spots to No. 14.  </P> <P> Ralston, a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, said the time was  right for such a job because his children are grown and his wife would travel  with him. Before Ralston began coaching him at the Open, Noah's ranking dropped  to No. 23, his worst in 10 years.  </P> <P> One of the most interesting sidelights of the women's U.S. Open final was what  Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova said about each other afterward. The  conversation was conducted through the media, because Navratilova revealed that  she and Graf do not talk to each other.  </P> <P> It was a soft-core fight. Navratilova started the mud rolling when she  questioned Graf's stoicism on court.  </P> <P> "She doesn't show anything," Navratilova said. "I just hope she enjoys it. . .  . I don't get any sense of emotion when she's playing. I'm sure that she's  feeling something.  </P> <P> "I don't know what she feels. I don't really speak to her that much, rather she  doesn't speak to me. I don't have any idea what's going on in her mind or her  heart."  </P> <P> Then Navratilova outlined Graf's conversation practices.  </P> <P> "She doesn't talk to anybody, really," Navratilova said. "She sort of runs in  the locker room, changes real quick and doesn't talk to anybody. One player in  the locker room was saying 'Come on, Steffi, smile.' She just ran out."  </P> <P> OK, that's one version. Graf has another way of looking at it: Martina 32,  Steffi 20.  </P> <P> "I have friends (in the locker room)," Graf said. "I search for them in my age  group and who I would have a good time talking to."  </P> <P> Graf also insisted that if she didn't enjoy playing tennis she wouldn't do it  and if that doesn't show, well, too bad.  </P> <P> And as for not speaking with Navratilova, Graf had a comeback prepared: "She  doesn't talk to me, either."  </P></p>

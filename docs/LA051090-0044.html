			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> CHAIR LEGS BROKEN IN REMOVAL FROM OLD THEATER  </P> <P> The battle to save the historic Whittier Theatre has shifted from preserving  its entirety to saving its best parts. In that effort, the most recent point of  contention is the theater's seats, which have appeared unceremoniously in a lot  on the building's west side.  </P> <P> The seats' forcible removal from the auditorium snapped many of the legs off,  said David Dickerson, the attorney whose legal motions delayed the historic  theater's demolition. He said the seats should have been preserved in  accordance with the guidelines of the environmental impact report for the site.  </P> <P> Gary Kovacic, the developer's attorney and spokesman, said property owner Peter  Doerkin was making every effort to comply with demolition guidelines and that  Doerkin would sell pieces of the 1929 structure to interested parties at cost.  </P> <P> As soon as Friday, representatives of the property's owner may lead interested  parties on a walk-through of the historic theater. The purpose will be to  specify pieces of the 61-year-old structure that collectors wish to be  preserved from the wrecking ball.  </P></p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Canada The Toronto market closed little changed after quiet trading, having failed to sustain the good rally sparked by Friday's US gross domestic product report. Declines in North American bond markets yesterday morning helped to stifle enthusiasm and the TSE 300 composite index ended just 3.03 points firmer at 4,291.65. Rising issues narrowly led declines by 415 to 354 after volume of 55.6m shares. The golds group had a mixed day, posting a tiny rise in spite of a fall in the New York spot price for gold of USDollars 3.70 to USDollars 383.75 an ounce. The group was buoyed by American Barrick, which gained CDollars  5/8 at CDollars 32 1/4 after reporting generally solid third-quarter earnings figures.</p>

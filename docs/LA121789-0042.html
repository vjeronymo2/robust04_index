			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIMAS OKS DIVISION OF RETIREMENT HOME PROPERTY  </P> <P> American Retirement Villas has been granted permission by the City Council to  divide its 18-acre lot near Cinnamon Creek into eight- and 10-acre parcels,  making development of the larger lot possible.  </P> <P> Mayor Terry Dipple did not vote on the matter Tuesday because he has business  ties with developer Brian Barbuto, who is buying the 10-acre parcel.  </P> <P> A given of the plan was that the existing seven-story retirement home at the  site would continue operating, as it will do now on the eight-acre lot.  </P> <P> Community Development Director Larry Stevens said Barbuto is seeking a General  Plan amendment to change the lot designation from office/professional to  residential and hopes to build 41 single-family homes on the 10-acre parcel.  </P> <P> The council had rejected a request to split the property into five- and 13-acre  parcels in October after neighbors' protests that a five-acre lot was  inadequate to accommodate the retirement home, a two-story administration  building, and parking.  </P></p>

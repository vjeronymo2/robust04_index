			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Panama agrees to take Cedras Panama yesterday agreed to take in Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras, the leader of Haiti's military coup who relinquished power on Monday. He was expected in Panama last night just three days before the scheduled return of exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. A senior Panamanian official said: 'We received a faxed letter this afternoon from President Aristide asking Panama to accept Cedras and we have agreed.' All day yesterday, US military forces mounted guard on the home of the ousted general as removal vans loaded with his possessions headed towards aircraft awaiting him at the capital city's airport. A US embassy spokesman said that the chief coup strategist, General Pillipe Biamby, was likely to accompany his colleague into exile. Gen Cedras's departure follows the collapse of the government led by de facto president Emile Jonassaint, who left the presidential palace on Tuesday. All of Mr Jonassaint's ministers also abandoned their offices, and US troops peacefully secured 15 different government buildings. Inside the presidential palace, US security officers and Mr Aristide's transition team began initial preparations to receive the legitimate president when he arrives on Saturday.</p>

"What he is saying is a serious threat to peace. The  reason people are calling for the SAP in our areas is to try to  bring peace and stability there," said northern Natal ANC  Secretary Senzo Mchunu.    The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] decided last month  to request the SAP to immediately provide security to residents  in four northern Natal areas where KwaZulu Police [KZP] had  apparently been unable to quell violance.    But Mr Buthelezi said in a statement on Tuesday that such a  move, taken without the formal cooperation of, and in  consultation with the KZP, would be regarded as an invasion.  "The KwaZulu government will therefore not hold itself  responsible for the consequences which may ensue should such an  invasion take place in areas under the jurisdiction of the KZP.    "And nor will the KwaZulu government be held accountable for  anything that takes place outside formal arrangements and  co-operation with the KwaZulu government," said Mr Buthelezi in  a statement.    In reaction, ANC southern Natal chairman Jeff Radebe said:  "It is a declaration of war. He (Mr Buthelezi) knows that, even  legally speaking, he is standing on shaky ground. "By law, the  SAP is entitled to police anywhere in South Africa, including in  self- governing territories."    Mr Radebe's response followed a report submitted to the TEC  by the SAP in Natal which stated that in terms of the  Self-Governing Territories Constitution Act (No 21 of 1971) a  legislative assembly had no power to make laws concerning SAP  presence in KwaZulu. The SAP report provided clarity on its  right to police KwaZulu where there have been constant claims of  KZP bias and hit squads.    Commenting on Mr Buthelezi's statement, Midlands ANC  chairman  Harry Gwala said no one, particularly the Zulu people, wanted  confrontation. The KZP had no hope of succeeding in resisting  SAP policing in KwaZulu, he said.    Mr Buthelezi's statements came as the Transitional Executive  Council was scheduled to discuss SAP deployment in KwaZulu.    Mr Radebe and Mr Mchunu claimed the IFP president's  statements "prove beyond doubt he is against stability and  peace. We call on the TEC to ignore his statements".</p>

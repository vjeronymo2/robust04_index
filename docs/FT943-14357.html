			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / No questioning for Claes Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, will not have to appear before the country's highest court for questioning over a financial scandal, following a vote in the Belgian parliament yesterday. The parliament voted to question former deputy prime minister Mr Guy Coeme in the investigation. It is alleged that a research company, Inusop, which conducted opinion polls for the government, channelled taxpayers' money to political parties in the late 1980s. The vote followed a report by a parliamentary commission which said there was enough evidence to justify Mr Coeme going before the court, but said there were insufficient grounds for Mr Claes to appear.</p>

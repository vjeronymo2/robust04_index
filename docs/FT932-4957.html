			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / More skilled, flexible and satisfied than we think we are: A survey that highlights structural changes in the workplace and dispels a few misconceptions CONTRARY to popular belief, Britain's workers have adapted to change in a positive way. They are more skilled and educated in the use of new technology than ever before. Training provided by employers is more intensive and longer, and most employees describe it as beneficial. These are among the findings of the Employment in Britain survey published today, which provides a graphic portrait of what has been happening in the country's workplaces over the past five years. Since 1988 Britain has gone through profound structural change in response to the twin pressures of technological innovation and global competitiveness. The survey argues: 'Training has emerged as a major issue for employees ranking alongside security, pay and supervision.' Responsive to change, Britain's workers are mostly content with their jobs. A large majority of the survey sample are 'highly satisfied' not just with the friendliness of their colleagues but also with the opportunity to use their abilities. Just over half have a 'high level of satisfaction' with their supervisors. However, fewer than half of workers are highly satisfied with their promotion prospects, the ability and efficiency of their management, their job security and the number of hours they work. Assembly-line workers had the lowest level of job satisfaction, followed by those working with machines and monitoring equipment. Workers who deal primarily with people scored the most job satisfaction. Low job satisfaction combines with what the survey describes as a 'sharp increase in the pressures at work' over the past five years. 'There has been an intensification of work effort - employees have been required to assume greater responsibility in their work and quality standards have become more demanding,' it says. The survey also reveals a growth in job insecurity since 1988, particularly among professionals, managers and skilled manual workers. This finding underlines how Britain's recession has made an impact across a wide range of occupational groups. Men also feel more insecure in their jobs than women. At the same time the commitment to work remains fairly strong in Britain. Just over two thirds of workers would prefer to have a job even if there were no financial necessity for them to do so. Nor does there appear to be much antagonism between workers and their employers. The old 'them' and 'us' divide that used to scar so much of workplace relations seems virtually to have disappeared. Now as many as two thirds of workers say they believe their values and those of the organisations they work for are 'very similar', even if only 9 per cent 'agreed strongly' with that suggestion. On the other hand, British workers are not committed to working for any particular company. Less than a third said they would turn down a job with more pay in order to stay with their current employer. The survey comments: 'It seems clear that British employers have still a great distance to go to build a work force with a high level of organisational commitment.' The survey suggests that most British workers do not like to work long hours  -possibly indicating that the recent European Community directive on working hours would be more welcome to British workers than it is to the UK government. The overwhelming preference was for between 16 and 30 hours a week. Only 2 per cent of men and 0.1 per cent of women would want to work more than a 40-hour week. But the pressures on women to work have increased dramatically. In 1980 less than a quarter of women said they were worried about money but by last year that figure had risen to 38 per cent. In 1980 only 37 per cent of women said they worked to pay for necessities like food, rent or a mortgage; last year that had risen to 53 per cent. 'It is the increased importance of women's work for meeting housing costs that explains the greater sense of financial pressure,' the survey says. The survey finds that worker participation remains relatively low. Fifty-two per cent of workers are in organisations where they feel that their influence is low, 30 per cent where worker influence is medium and 18 per cent where it is high. Very few British workers have 'a significant say over changes in their immediate work environment', the survey says. 'As a result a high proportion of employees are dissatisfied with their existing level of influence.' It is true, though, that nearly three quarters believe they have a 'great deal of influence over the amount of work they put in and the quality of their work', and well over half added they had a 'great deal of influence over deciding how they were to do their task'. In recent years workers have gained greater influence over the amount and pace of the work they do, but the survey found that only a third of workers in industry felt they had any substantial influence over decisions that could result in changes in their work. The survey suggests that workers want to increase their influence more widely. Nearly half thought they should have more say in decisions affecting their working lives. Dissatisfaction was pronounced among supervisors and technicians, skilled manual workers, managers and professionals. Further findings will be published next year from the survey which the authors - Mr Duncan Gallie of Nuffield College, Oxford, and Mr Michael White at the Policy Studies Institute - intend as the first of many. The overall picture suggests that Britain's employment scene was much more dynamic and innovative in the late 1980s than many observers believed. It looks like profound restructuring was taking place in the labour market among compared with earlier periods. The trouble is that similar developments may have been going on longer and more radically among our main competitors. But as the survey points out, only the US and Sweden have carried out employment surveys comparable to the British one. Until other European Community countries investigate their labour markets in similar detail it will remain hard to make credible international comparisons.

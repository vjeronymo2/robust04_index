			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: LIVING NEW YORK STORIES, WITH A PERSONAL SEQUEL  </P> <P> By 4 p.m. that cold day in Manhattan, my brisk walk had slowed to a trudge. My  mind was crammed with sights and sounds; my shoes were crammed with toes.  </P> <P> A small sign beckoned me into the Viand Coffee Shop on Madison Avenue near  61st. I sat at the counter.  </P> <P> "Coffee -- black," I said. It sounded less an order than a plea.  </P> <P> "And?" asked the young Greek, with a gesture to a large glass case. Inside were  chocolate cakes, carrot cakes and swirls of pastry. Whole cantaloupes rested  near a bowl of white goop.  </P> <P> "Try the rice pudding," he went on, since I seemed unable to speak. "It's good  for you."  </P> <P> "Just coffee," I said.  </P> <P> After a couple of sips I began to perk up. I realized that I was a bit hungry.  </P> <P> "I've changed my mind," I heard myself say. "I will try the rice pudding."  </P> <P> "You won't regret it," said the dark-eyed lad, as he spooned it into a tall  sherbet dish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Tasty Treat  </P> <P> He was right. The dessert was cold, fresh, sweet -- with hints of brown sugar,  perhaps, and a trace of lemon.  </P> <P> I did not tell him how long it had been since I had tasted rice pudding,  because this might have been my first. Rice pudding was something like rhubarb  or sweetbreads, which I had avoided by instinct.  </P> <P> As I thanked him and stood to leave, I realized that once again I had been  treated with kindness in New York City. Just as I had mastered my wary  Manhattan mode -- walk fast, avoid eye contact, press purse into ribs -- a  native had shown compassion. How disconcerting.  </P> <P> My step was livelier as I hastened up Madison Avenue toward my hotel. It would  be pleasant to stretch out before going to dinner and the opera. I saw a  grocery store and veered in to buy milk, a favorite bedtime drink. Brown bag in  hand, I marched on.  </P> <P> At 72nd and Madison I succumbed to the hearth-and-home spell of Ralph Lauren's  old mansion of a store. It is fragrant with leather and wood shavings, cashmere  and fine tobacco. A fireplace crackles near the entrance. It's a place to curl  up for the winter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shirt Shopping  </P> <P> Instead, I talked cotton shirts with Sean, a clerk not long out of Texas. He  showed me half a dozen striped models that might appeal to my 15 1/2-34 friend.  He invited me to put my parcels in a handsome upholstered chair. Since one held  a quart of milk, I placed them on the floor.  </P> <P> New shirts in hand, I returned to my hotel and let my thoughts drift to the  Metropolitan Opera and "La Boheme." Placido Domingo was singing that night.  Fiamma Izzo D'Amico would be Mimi.  </P> <P> Shortly before curtain time an usher unlocked the door of our box. We were the  first to arrive. It was a splendid perch from which to observe the excitement  in the grand hall. And then the door opened again.  </P> <P> "Hi," a man said. "We're Sid and Hermione. This your first time?"  </P> <P> "We've been to the Met before," I replied. "But we've never sat in a box."  </P> <P> "You'll love it," Sid said. "Whatta view. Right, honey?"  </P> <P> "Yeah," said Hermione. "When the chandeliers go up to the ceiling it's like  'Phantom of the Opera' in reverse. Want a lemon drop?"  </P> <P> She pulled a tin from her purse and passed it around. I remembered the  admonition in the program: "Next to talking, the most serious offense to  auditorium peace is to open cellophane-wrapped candies."  </P> <P> The program suggested opening throat-soothers between acts or musical  selections, or, if you're caught off-guard, open them swiftly. "Trying to be  quiet by opening wrappers slowly only prolongs the torture for everyone around  you," it concluded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More to the Box  </P> <P> Then a white-haired couple arrived, completing our box. They nodded, settled  into the front chairs and pulled out opera glasses.  </P> <P> Hermione offered them lemon drops. Sid told us about a pal of his who had gone  to a rehearsal of the New York Philharmonic that week:  </P> <P> "He was about to open the door on the Broadway side when a guy reaches out from  behind and opens it for him. He turned around and it was Zubin Mehta. 'Wow,' he  said, 'wait till I tell my friends that Zubin Mehta opened a door for me.'  </P> <P> "So the maestro smiles, reaches out and holds open the second door.  </P> <P> " 'Tell them he did it twice,' Mehta said."  </P> <P> Sid and Hermione laughed. The lights dimmed. The conductor lifted his baton for  "La Boheme."  </P> <P> And I found myself thinking of tailgate parties.  </P></p>

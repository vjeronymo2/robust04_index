			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Shell warns on oil price outlook: Full-year profits of Pounds 3.2bn - Fall in fourth quarter / Chemicals loss doubles Oil prices are likely to remain at depressed levels for much of this year, according to Royal Dutch Shell, which yesterday announced a sharp decline in fourth-quarter results. Profits on a replacement cost basis, excluding the effects of inventory changes, were down 18 per cent to Pounds 776m. Part of the fall was caused by weak oil prices, restructuring charges and losses on chemicals also took their toll. Mr John Jennings, chairman of Shell Transport and Trading, said the average oil price last year was Dollars 17 a barrel, or less than Dollars 10 in 1980 prices. Since then it had fallen to around Dollars 13.50. 'It is very hard to see the price moving significantly outside the present trading range for some time,' he warned. Shell expected the growth in demand for oil to rise 1 1/2 to 2 per cent this year, but there was little sign that Opec would cut production. The full-year result came to Pounds 3.23bn, just 3 per cent up on the previous year's Pounds 3.12bn. Income before taxation amounted to Pounds 5.8bn on sales of Pounds 84bn. The bulk of earnings came from exploration and production which made Pounds 2bn, up from Pounds 1.86bn. But the trend was downwards towards the end of the year because of the falling oil price, although rising gas sales partly offset this. There was much stronger growth in downstream activities, such as refining and marketing, where earnings were up 55 per cent at Pounds 1.99bn thanks largely to higher refining margins, particularly in Asia. The big disappointment was chemicals which made an annual loss of Pounds 409m, almost double the previous year's deficit. 'This segment of our business continues to face extremely difficult trading conditions,' said Mr Jennings. However, he pointed out that the US chemicals business managed to get back into profit, and the underlying operating result of the segment had flattened out. 'One is tempted to hope that the worst is behind us,' he added. Shell has been applying drastic measures to its chemicals division: staffing has been cut by up to 30 per cent and several plants have been closed. The metals division was also hit by low prices, losing Pounds 95m, but coal returned to the black with a profit of Pounds 32m. Mr Jennings stressed that the group remained 'enormously strong and well placed to take advantage of opportunities'. He pointed out that the underlying result, stripped of special items and currency effects, showed a sharp upturn. Although cautious about recovery prospects in the OECD countries, the group was encouraged by trends in Latin America and Asia. Production of oil and gas would rise as new projects came on stream. Shell is proposing a final dividend of 13.8p, bringing the total to 24p, an increase of 9.6 per cent. Royal Dutch is raising its total dividend by 1.8 per cent to Fl 8.60. The result disappointed the market. Shell shares fell 23p to 699p, and Royal Dutch Fl 5.7 to Fl 202.7. Mr John Toalster, an analyst with Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, said Shell was out of favour, but the result showed the group's financial strength and resilience to oil price movements.

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: No need to fear 'deadly diesels' - Motoring / Stuart Marshall looks at research that counters recent scare stories over emissions There have been a lot of scare stories lately about diesel exhaust emissions. You must have seen the headlines: 'Deadly diesel: new evidence of killer in the air' and 'Diesel kills, experts claim.' The one common denominator of these stories is that they are heavy on sensation but remarkably light on facts. Some quote the results of studies in a few US cities - where, incidentally, there are few diesel cars - and extrapolate them to Britain. The studies suggest more people die from heart disease on days when atmospheric pollution is high. They probably do. If you are old and ill, breathing in more than the normal amount of urban filth is likely to hasten the inevitable end. Some of this summer's pollution stories could make you think that diesel vehicles were the only source of all this pollution. And I am the first to admit that clapped-out lorries, aged buses and ill-used delivery vans spew out disgraceful amounts of black diesel smoke. Their owners seemingly are untroubled by the police, who appear strangely reluctant to proceed against them. Of course, diesel cars make their own very modest contribution. Any kind of internal combustion engine puts a certain amount of muck into the air. But it is modest, for two reasons. One is that diesel cars are still out-numbered heavily by petrol-engined cars. The second is that a modern diesel car's engine can be inherently cleaner than a petrol engine fitted with a catalytic converter to clean up its exhaust emissions. Who says so? No, not me - despite being an admitted enthusiast who has run nothing but diesel cars as his own personal transport for more than 15 years  -but Ricardo Consulting Engineers of Shoreham, West Sussex, a world renowned automotive engineering think-tank and development laboratory. Ricardo has just published Automotive Diesel Engines and the Future*, an independent and unbiased technical view on their emissions. Modestly, Ricardo says it hopes the paper will provide a useful contribution to the debate on the likely impact of diesel-powered vehicles on air quality. I am sure it will. But what it really does is demolish some of the tabloid fantasies with a barrage of hard facts. The paper notes that although emission controls (that is, exhaust catalysers) started on petrol-engined cars in California in 1966, diesel car emissions began to receive serious attention only in the 1980s. Even so, a study by Ricardo for Mercedes-Benz revealed that a car diesel engine without the simplest kind of catalyser produced fewer 'air toxics' (exhaust emissions) than a petrol engine with an elaborate catalyser. And that a catalyser-equipped diesel (as many now are) was more than twice as clean overall as a catalyser-equipped petrol engine. Ricardo says air toxins emitted by petrol-engined cars tend to be dominated by benzene - a known human carcinogen - whereas diesel engines produce hardly any. Besides which, a lot also gets into the atmosphere every time a petrol car is refuelled - but not when a diesel is tanked up. In essence, Ricardo's conclusions are that: Diesels offer excellent fuel economy - up to 40 per cent better in the urban cycle than petrol engines of the same power. Their exhausts are much cleaner under cold operating conditions and they do not give off evaporative emissions of hydrocarbons. Over the next few years, replacing old and environmentally unfriendly buses and lorries with modern, low-emission vehicles will benefit urban air quality markedly. Even though relatively little effort has gone into curbing diesel emissions so far, much has been achieved. Further large reductions can be expected as technical improvements go into production. All future diesels have a potential for very low smoke emissions. *Martin Love of Ricardo has a few copies of the paper for seriously interested bodies. Call him on 0273-455611.</p>

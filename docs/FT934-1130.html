			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Observer: Lines crossed It may be the season of goodwill but Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Michael Portillo, chief secretary of the Treasury, still seem no closer to settling their inter-departmental row over the issue of angling licences. Portillo is blocking a move by the prezza to allow post offices to sell licences to the nation's anglers because he doesn't think a state monopoly should be allowed to undercut the private sector tackle shops which sell the licences alongside rods, nets and maggots. A furious Hezza has responded by telling the cabinet's rising star to get his hook 'off my line'. Portillo is prepared to negotiate. If Hezza's department drops its opposition to privatisation of the post office, then Portillo will happily accept a liberalisation of the market in angling licences. Cheeky.</p>

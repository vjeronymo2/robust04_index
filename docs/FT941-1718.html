			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Political Notebook: 'Bash-a-Kraut' school of politics When Baroness Thatcher raged about Europe, it was invariably a sign of weakness. The argument was running against her and she needed an outlet for her frustration. Nothing has changed. Mr John Major's newly-discovered Gaullism is a synthetic affair. He has chosen to fight Britain's partners over voting rights in an enlarged European Union because his position is weak, not because it is strong. That was the judgment of the Tory Euro-sceptics who applauded his tirade this week against Brussels and of the enthusiasts for Europe who warned that the party may be on the verge of another civil war. Mr Major has decided he needs the support of the Tory right - the group he courted then abandoned when they had secured his succession to No 10 - if he is to survive the summer. The parallels with last autumn are unmistakable. Then Mr Major launched his ill-fated back-to-basics initiative in order to rebuild bridges with his ideological enemies. Now the prime minister who promised to put Britain at the heart of Europe is picking a fight with the nation's continental partners. The European elections in June will be fought on a nationalist platform. One rightwing minister suggested 'Britain for the British' as an appropriate campaign slogan. Mr Major appears genuinely determined not to give way over the size of the blocking minority. He has no qualms about relying on socialist Spain as his only ally. Mr Douglas Hurd, whose public manner suggests that he finds the prime minister's rhetoric distasteful, cannot now accept any formula which looks like a retreat. Mr Major claims the bulk of his party is behind him. It is certainly true that opinion on the back benches has hardened since the stand was taken on defending the misnamed 'British veto'. Demoralised Tory MPs see in the battle with Johnny Foreigner a chance of easy headlines. They are encouraged that a leader more typically swept along by events is ready for once to back up tough words with tough action. Many Conservatives swallowed the rhetoric used by Messrs Major and Hurd to sell them the Maastricht Treaty. That accord, they were told, marked the end of the road for Europe's centralists. The nation state would return centre-stage. Mr Hurd, who once more accurately described the treaty as 'an honourable draw', never believed his own propaganda. But it is now too late for the foreign secretary to admit that. The long-sought entry to the European Union of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria cannot therefore be seen to dilute the government's power to block unpalatable decisions. There is a similar mood among Tory party activists, many of whom are said by pro-European MPs to belong to the When-in-doubt-bash-a-Kraut school of politics. Then there is the cabinet. It has a large pro-European majority. Mr Michael Heseltine may have given a Euro-sceptic edge to his recent public pronouncements, but within government he has continued to argue the European case on almost every issue of substance. The combative Mr Kenneth Clarke likes picking fights with Brussels - just as he used to do with local authorities and trade unions - but his fundamental commitment is not in doubt. On this issue though both Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine appear ready to see Mr Major fight to the end. It is no accident that they would lead the betting for the succession in any leadership crisis later in the year. What is less certain is how the pro-Europeans will respond if Mr Major steps over the brink. If enlargement of the Union is seriously delayed. The enthusiasts on the back benches have so far allowed the sceptics to make the running. Now they are threatening to resume hostilities. There might be a happier ending to the present row. Mr Hurd is working hard on a number of possible compromises which would preserve the substance of the British suggestion. Much work is being done on a proposal which would hold the blocking minority to 23 votes for contentious social issues while increasing it to 27 for less controversial directives. Mr Major would offer such a deal as a guarantee that Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht social chapter could not be circumvented. The Tory back benches would cheer him for a day or two. The election posters would declare that here was a leader who battled for Britain. But Mr Major would not win respect. He is by instinct a Tory of the centre-left. He is a pro-European. Many of his natural supporters are now ready to desert him in any leadership crisis. If it comes to that he will find no refuge with his new-found friends on the right.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Number of foreign banks in London exceeds 500 The number of foreign banks in London topped 500 for the first time last year, enhancing the capital's status as Europe's most significant financial centre. According to a survey by Noel Alexander Associates, a consultancy which specialises in financial statistics, the 15 foreign banks that disappeared from London - either through leaving or through mergers and takeovers - were more than offset by the 35 which arrived. There are 514 foreign banks in London. The survey, which is published each year, reflects the changes to international banking in London, with much of the activity coming from eastern Europe and Asia. Two of the new banks that opened were from Russia; two from the Czech republic; one from former Yugoslavia, and one from Slovenia. Two were from China, three from Hong Kong and one from Thailand. Six of the 15 banks which disappeared did so as a result of mergers and takeovers. Western European banks accounted for five of these, with the remaining one being the takeover of the Canadian Royal Trust Bank by Royal Bank of Canada. Seven of the nine banks that actually left were from western Europe. Last year also saw the first increase in the number of US banks in London since 1982, as four US banks opened in the City. Even so, this only takes the total back to its 1991 level of 49, which itself was lower than every year since 1971. The number of Japanese banks also rose again slightly, after a drop of two in 1992, to reach 54 in total. Noel Alexander says that London has a higher number of foreign banks than any other city, including New York and Tokyo. New Foreign Bank Offices in London.

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A THOUGHTFUL WAY TO MATURE;  </P> <P> THE PLATO SOCIETY KEEPS RETIREES ALIVE, ALERT AND STIMULATED  </P> <P> Francis Meyers, retired businessman and active musician, believes that people  die fromthe top down. Let the mind rot and the body goes to pot; keep the brain  clicking and theheart will go on ticking.  </P> <P> And by his calculations, the shortest distance between retirement and the  cemetery runsstraight through Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Meyers made his discovery not long after he sold his jewelry-manufacturing  business and began making the rounds of retirement clubs. Too often, he found  that activities were limited to card-playing in the clubhouse, spiced with  trips to the Nevada gambling city.  </P> <P> Then, 10 years ago, when things were looking as bleak as the Arabian desert,  Meyers stumbled across a green and sparkling oasis. He saw a newspaper story  about a group being formed by UCLA Extension which promised to turn dubious  leisure into mental reinvigoration.  </P> <P> The Plato Society, he learned, was designed for people like him, people who  remained curious about the world, who wanted to explore topics they hadn't had  time for while careers and families consumed their waking hours.  </P> <P> The society -- its name is an acronym for Perpetual Learning and Teaching  Organization, not the ancient Greek philosopher -- proposed that its retired  and semi-retired members would be "students, teachers, staff, volunteers and  alumni" in a self-supporting, cooperative learning venture. Its chief  enterprise would be study-discussion groups exploring subjects chosen by its  members.  </P> <P> "I made a beeline for the phone that day and I've been here ever since," says  Meyers, recalling events at the society's headquarters in Westwood. "I was  interested in everything. I didn't care what the subject was, I was going to  learn something."  </P> <P> A decade later, Meyers' prescription for a fruitful life includes studying  plate tectonics, the philosophy of science and, currently, the legacy of  Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis.  </P> <P> But Meyers' belief that the society has been a lifesaver is more than  theoretical. He credits his involvement in the group with helping him survive a  heart bypass operation in 1984, the year he was the society's president.  </P> <P> Today, Meyers sums up his philosophy of life this way: "An active mind and an  active interest and a desire that you've got to find out something -- you  haven't got time to die."  </P> <P> Granted, Meyers may be somewhat atypical. A professional musician before World  War II, he still plays violin once a week with a chamber music group and  indulges his passion for books, finding particular joy in haunting secondhand  bookstores. He also has thrown himself into helping develop education programs  for older people throughout the Western states.  </P> <P> But his story is only one example of the positive effects Plato has had on the  lives of its members according to Adriane Lorin, the society's staff  coordinator.  </P> <P> After a series of bouts with cancer, one member in his 80s told Lorin that he  had about given up on life. At this crucial juncture, he continued, "I  remembered Plato and I knew that I had to come back." Adds Lorin, "And by God  he is."  </P> <P> While increasing longevity is not the purpose of Plato -- or a scientifically  proved fact about the group -- it may show why the society evokes fierce  loyalty among its members who are celebrating its 10th anniversary.  </P> <P> Even without this possible added benefit, Plato's students clearly relish the  stimulation of their courses.  </P> <P> Take that class on Freud. At 10 o'clock on a gray morning, the members gathered  in a windowless room in a nondescript building in Westwood, armed with books,  paper, pens, experience and enthusiasm. The cheerfulness of the group belied  its purpose, exploring the recesses of the mind, following the trails of  explorers who first visited the dark places where emotions rise to overwhelm  reason.  </P> <P> This day, it was Sam Rowe's turn to lead the class -- as each member does  sooner or later. His subject was Alfred Adler, Freud's onetime disciple who  split from his mentor to propound his own theories.  </P> <P> Rowe, 75 and a retired professor from USC, apologized for being somewhat  under-prepared. But that said, he launched into a brief history of Adler's life  and thought. An hour into the discussion, class members were thumbing through  books or delving into their own memories to come up with comments on the  psychiatrist's views of childhood and how it shapes adults.  </P> <P> The society itself is continually being reshaped by its members. Initially  limited to 100 members, the current limit is 375, a number that still causes  some debate. The society is supposed to remain small enough to be cozy but also  must collect enough in fees to pay for its activities.  </P> <P> Members pay $375 annually for the society's classes, special lectures, field  trips and other functions, including extracurricular study groups that meet in  members' homes. Members must be at least 50 years old and have at least 20  years experience in the working world.  </P> <P> Topics for seminars are chosen by group members who vote on a list of  suggestions compiled by a committee. Topics have ranged from "The Mayan Age of  Splendor" to energy options. Current classes include the novels of Jane Austen  and the history of the American Revolution.  </P> <P> Well before interest in the Civil War was renewed by the recent PBS television  series, the Plato Society had fought the War Between the States several times,  Lorin notes.  </P> <P> As its membership has expanded, the group's ambitions also have broadened, says  President William Carter, 66, a former development and investment banker who  has been a member for seven years.  </P> <P> Among other things, Carter expects that Plato Society branches will be founded  in Los Angeles County in the next decade. One such spinoff already exists at  Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> Carter, whose principal interests are European history and World War II, says  that groups like Plato are part of the "gray wave of the future" that will be  created to meet the needs of an aging but active population in the United  States.  </P> <P> Plato's core, however, continues to be its seminars, lasting from seven to 14  weeks with each class meeting two hours a week. Class size generally is limited  to 15 people with one person serving as coordinator. Each participant is  expected to study and deliver a lecture on an aspect of the subject.  </P> <P> Lorin concedes that this doesn't turn out to be everyone's cup of tea. Although  all potential members are interviewed by other members to determine their  interests, she says this informal screening doesn't always work.  </P> <P> "There are people who have gotten into Plato who should never have gotten into  Plato," she says, adding that most of them quit.  </P> <P> Despite the occasional bad match, the society stresses a kind of  egalitarianism. New members aren't asked what they did or how much education  they have. Rather the emphasis is on what new members want to learn.  </P> <P> "What we like to tell people who are joining Plato is take a study group in  something about which you know nothing because you can learn the most that  way," Lorin said.  </P> <P> Indeed, Meyers seems to relish most the thoroughly unpragmatic nature of Plato.  "What we're having here is the purest form of education, learning for the sake  of learning," he says. "No exams, no grades, no degrees. None of that. Just  sheer interest in the subject."  </P></p>

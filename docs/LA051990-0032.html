			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ANGELS CAMP;  </P> <P> SUPERFROGS FALL SHORT OF MARK  </P> <P> Bigger is not necessarily better when it comes to frog jumping. A gang of giant  African superfrogs leaped and lunged into the second day of the 62nd annual  Calaveras County Fair and Jumping Frog Jubilee Friday without coming close to  breaking the distance record set by an ordinary American bullfrog.  </P> <P> "We didn't break the record and, yes, I'm disappointed," said Seattle animal  importer Andy Koffman, who claims the frogs can cover more than 30 feet in a  single bound. But Koffman remains optimistic that his African frogs will stop  flopping and start hopping in time for Sunday's championship. Representatives  from the Guinness Book of World Records will be on hand in the tiny Gold Rush  town to watch the green giants try to smash the fair's record, set in 1986 by  Rosie the Ribiter, a born-in-the-U.S.A. bullfrog that jumped 21 feet, 5 3/4  inches.  </P></p>

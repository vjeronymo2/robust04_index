			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chi Yen-ling (4764 1693 7117): "Everywhere Can </F> Be Heard the Sound of Dogs Barking"]    [Text] [Excerpts] [passage omitted]    Taiwan is a society in which "following the wind" is very  popular. Everyone like a swarm of bees says the same things and  does the same things. Chien Ming-ching [4675 2494 2529], speaker  of the Taiwan provincial parliament describes this phenomenon as  "dog culture [gou de wenhua]." One dog barks and the pack of  dogs follows. When it barks, it is very lively, but when it  finishes barking, it is as if nothing had happened and nothing  has changed.    Dog Culture Can Be Seen Everywhere    This "dog culture" is expressed especially clearly in  politics. A year ago, on the issue of participation in the  United Nations they barked throughout Taiwan to form a group.  From Taipei they barked all the way to the front door of the  United Nations. It was as if there were no other issue but this  on earth. But who knows when, the "United Nations fever"  suddenly dropped from the boiling point to the freezing point.  Now one no longer hears anyone talking feverishly about the  United Nations issue.    Recently the popular "southern orientation" topic was  exactly  the same. Since President Lee Teng-hui vacationed in three ASEAN  countries, throughout the country with neat and uniform actions  they have concentrated on "looking south." Government units have  worked overtime to study and evaluate; the enterprise sector has  gone south to investigate nonstop; and the news sector every day  has reports of "southern orientation" news. It appears that the  future of Taiwan's economy, trade, and foreign affairs can only  begin to be ensured by "southern orientation."    Another complication of "southern orientation fever" is  "presidential foreign visit fever." Lee Teng-hui had just  returned from Bangkok when the topics of whether or not in the  near future he could visit the United States, visit Japan, visit  France, visit Germany, visit Fiji, visit Central and South  America were brought out one after the other for great and  special speculation. Taiwan's officials every day were chased by  reporters and asked these questions that still did not have a  trace of evidence. They could only grin and bear it. But foreign  government officials, legislators, and scholars also were  tediously harangued with, "Would your country agree to a visit  from President Lee Teng-hui?" a question "of no interest." It  appears a little ridiculous and comical.    Another example is such "major national issues" as the vice  president serving concurrently as president of the Judicial Yuan  and the speaker of the assembly, whether or not the Taipei  municipal Number Seven Park Kuan-yin [Goddess of Mercy] statue  should be removed, and in the Legislative Yuan generally how  many questions and how many answers the form of interpellation  should take. These fully manifest "dog culture" characteristics.  No one asks if the matter is true or false and no one cares if  it is important or not. Someone need only start to ramble on a  topic and the other people follow with all their might, rambling  until they are talked out and tried of talking, and everything  calms down again. But everything remains as before. The boat  goes through the water without a trace. In all the world  probably only Taiwan can arrive at this state of mind!    Concentrated Fever, Concentrated Incapacity    From the perspective of social psychology, "concentrating on  following the wind" is the phenomenon of a sick society. Whether  we should participate in the United Nations, whether we should  plan a southern-oriented policy, and whether the president  should leave the country on visits are all matters that we can  talk about and should talk about and can do and should do. But  once the whole nation "dog fashion" is engaged on a grand scale,  it becomes "United Nations fever," "southern orientation fever,"  and "foreign visit fever." Any issue ultimately should have only  three minutes of fever. In a society that often has  "concentrated fever" and "concentrated stupor" in dealing with  national affairs will have difficulty avoiding the resulting  "concentrated incapacity."    With the Year of the Dog beginning, the dog people precisely  can greatly practice their belief in the year that is named for  them. The "doggy culture" is bound to shine even more. In the  next year, we will amend the constitution and we will select the  governor and mayors, and we can expect that in the political  arena the excited noise of barking will be heard from all sides.  The "dog" people are lucky. The people who do not belong to the  dogs can only seek their own greater luck in the midst of the  barking!</p>

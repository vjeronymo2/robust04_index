			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Gambian pledge on democracy Gambia's new leaders pledged yesterday to name a democratic government as soon as possible following their weekend coup and partially lifted a dusk-to-dawn curfew, Reuter reports from Banjul. 'We will never introduce dictatorship in this country because the average Gambian is being nurtured with democracy,' Lieutenant Edward Singhatey, 25, a member of the five-man ruling military council, said. Ousted president Sir Dawda Jawara arrived in Senegal on Sunday evening with about 40 relatives and officials and was granted political asylum on humanitarian grounds. In Banjul, diplomats said people were going to work normally on Monday but the airport and land borders were still closed. Officials said the curfew had been relaxed to midnight to 6 am instead of 7 pm to 7 am</p>

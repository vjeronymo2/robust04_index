			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Battle brewing over London radio A battle is brewing in the London radio market following the news that four new commercial stations will come on air in the capital next year, including a women's talk station, a Christian radio service and two rock music stations. The Radio Authority yesterday announced that it was also renewing the two licences for the AM and FM popular music stations run by Capital Radio, which may face fierce competition for its audience and advertising revenue from the new rock stations run by the Virgin and Chrysalis entertainment groups. Mr Richard Eyre, Capital's managing director, said: 'Life is certainly going to become more competitive. But we're looking forward to the fight.' All four music stations have slightly different formats. Capital will continue its youth-oriented AM service and 'golden oldie' Capital Gold station. Chrysalis aims to attract a female audience for Crystal FM with 'soft rock' music from Phil Collins and Elton John. Virgin will target a young, male audience by adding London talk shows to the 'hard rock' music already played on its Virgin 1215 station. Mr Richard Huntingford, chief executive of Chrysalis Radio, said he was confident Crystal FM could carve out its own niche and that the new stations would bring new advertising revenue into London radio. Observers in the advertising industry were sceptical, however, that the expanded London radio business could be financed entirely by new revenue. Mr Adam Crozier, executive media director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the UK advertising agency, said: 'There's certainly scope to attract new money. There may well be some redistribution of old money. It'll be up to each station to compete on the quality of their output and marketing.' Some radio executives privately criticised the Radio Authority which, they said, had not fulfilled its statutory obligation to encourage diversity. 'There's been a clear change of policy,' said one. 'I don't think anyone expected there to be four music stations in Greater London when they did their business plans.'</p>

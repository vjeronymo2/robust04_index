			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Many auditors are 'unsatisfactory' ALMOST two thirds of the auditors monitored by the Association of Authorised Public Accountants were judged unsatisfactory last year, a report on audit regulation showed yesterday. Of the 49 visits to 554 registered auditors in the 12 months to last September, the regulators judged seven 'unacceptable', 25 'not satisfactory', 13 'reasonable' and only four 'satisfactory'. The findings come in the first audit regulation report submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry by the association, which represents 1,100 individuals authorised to conduct audits and not covered by the two other authorised audit registration bodies. Most of its members are older accountants who qualified before company legislation enshrined the certified and chartered accountants' professional bodies as the primary regulatory bodies for those conducting audits. As with the report on Chartered Association of Certified Accountants auditors earlier this week, the high number of unsatisfactory scores reflected a failure to maintain formal recording of reporting procedures rather than the quality of audit work conducted, the report says. However, three firms or individuals have had their registration withdrawn during the year, while a further seven are under investigation. From 634 applications received for audit registration during the first year 554 were accepted and 35 were rejected. A further 35 applications were withdrawn by the applicants. There were 18 complaints during the year, including four concerning excessive fees, five on standards of accounting and four on lateness in dealing with clients' affairs. The association's council said it was confident that the new audit inspection regime would cause standards to 'radically improve', because firms were taking positive steps to improve their procedures. The costs of monitoring and audit regulation - which are sub-contracted to the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants - were Pounds 85,000 last year, while development costs in previous years were about Pounds 90,000. The association achieved its target for the number of visits to members during the year and expects to visit each registered auditor once every five years. The accountancy profession's joint disciplinary scheme yesterday defended its decision to take no further action in connection with the affairs of Alexander Howden, Minet and WMD Underwriting Agencies. The scheme launched an inquiry in 1991 after references to 10 individual accountants in a 1990 Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report and a 1985 report for the Committee of Lloyd's. Sir Anthony Wilson, chairman of the scheme's executive committee, said that a decision to proceed might have contravened 'the rules of natural justice'. His comments come after criticism of the scheme's decision in three reports issued last week to take no further action against any of the 10 members mentioned. The decision means that the scheme must absorb more than Pounds 100,000 already spent in legal costs, which will be contributed by its members, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, and the Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and of Scotland.</p>

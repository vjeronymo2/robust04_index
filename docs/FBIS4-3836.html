			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Make Efforts To Resolve </F> Contradictions--Strengthen and Improve Ideological and Political  Work in Enterprises"]    [Text] The Eighth Annual Session of the Chinese Workers  and Staff Ideological and Political Work Society analyzed the  current situation in enterprise ideological and political work,  summarized and exchanged experiences, and set forth the tasks  ahead. This will play a positive role in further strengthening  and improving enterprise ideological and political work.    On the whole, enterprise ideological and political work has  been strengthened. Thanks to their awareness, positive  attitude, and forceful measures, some enterprises have done a  good job in this field and have scored marked achievements.  However, there are some localities and enterprises which still  lag behind in ideological and political work and have failed to  meet the developing needs of reform, opening up, and the  modernization program. This state of affairs must change.    We are promoting economic structural reform amid the swift  operation of the national economy this year and are attaining  rapid growth in the national economy amid the speedy process of  switching systems. Hence, we are faced with a large number of  contradictions and difficult problems. Different understandings  of specific reform and construction issues is quite natural.  When reform has reached a crucial stage, it gives rise to  confused and complicated thinking and creates difficulties for  ideological and political work. For this reason, ideological  and political work is indispensable and well worth doing.  Enterprises constitute an essential factor in the market, while  workers are an important factor in enterprises. While  strengthening and improving ideological and political work in  the new situation, the most important thing is to proceed from  the reality of workers' thinking, straighten out ideological  problems, resolve contradictions, arouse all positive factors,  turn negative factors into positive ones, and guide the  enthusiasm of the broad ranks of workers to running the  enterprise well and fighting for the supreme objective.    To straighten out ideological problems and resolve  contradictions, the fundamental thing is to arm the broad ranks  of workers with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line and policies, and to improve the ideological and political  qualities of cadres and the masses. We should continue to  publicize and study volume three of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" and the Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee. In propaganda work, we should give  explanations in connection with practice to allow everyone to  understand the meaning rather than repeat or copy what books  say. Theory is fundamental. Only when we seek unity of thinking  theoretically, in line and in terms of major principles and  policies, can the ideological problems be readily resolved.    It is man's social being which determines his thinking. The  limitations of man's social being are inevitably reflected in  his thinking. Therefore, talking frequently about the  situation, the overall situation, achievements and experiences,  and difficulties and problems should be essential contents of  ideological and political work. Through publicity on the  current situation, we should enable the broad ranks of workers  to have a correct understanding of the major economic structural  reform plans introduced this year and have confidence in the  policies and measures adopted by the government to stabilize the  market and prices and dispel their misgivings. Through such  education, we should also encourage them to keep the overall  situation in mind, correctly understand the interest relations  between the individual and the collective, between the part and  the whole, and between the immediate and the long-term; stress  idealism, discipline, unity, and the overall situation; and  understand the reform, support the reform, and resolutely plunge  themselves into the reform.    Showing concern for the well-being of the masses,  attentively listening to their voices, and resolving  difficulties for them are indispensable in straightening out  ideological problems and minimizing contradictions. Our  ideological and political work should be focused on propaganda.  But this is not enough. Ideological and political work should  be closely connected with the people's daily lives. Comrade Mao  Zedong once said: If you want the masses to support the  revolutionary war, you should show concern for their well-being.  When we want the masses to support our reform today, we should  also show concern for their well-being. Some workers' incomes  have dropped because of the poor performance of enterprises.  What should be done? Some enterprises are at the verge of  bankruptcy and the workers are worried about their future? How  should this problem be resolved? Because of poor social order  in some localities, the masses lack a sense of security. How  should we put an end to this state of affairs? With a high  sense of responsibility to the people, enterprise leaders and  leading local cadres should make strenuous efforts to resolve  all of these problems, which are closely related to the  interests of the masses, particularly "rice bags" and "vegetable  baskets."    Leading cadres should set an example, be strict with  themselves, keep themselves free of corruption, change their  style, overcome bureaucracy and formalism, and resolutely fight  against negative and corrupt practices. This will be of great  significance to straightening out ideological problems and  resolving contradictions. We should realize that the broad ranks  of workers have the overall situation in mind. They have shown  understanding of the difficulties and problems encountered in  the course of reform. They do not care much about their limited  benefits and making some temporary sacrifices for a period of  time. But they cannot bear the attitude of a handful of leading  cadres, who put on airs but who show no interest in the  well-being of the masses. They cannot tolerate certain leading  cadres, who, taking advantage of reform, abuse their power and  office and seek private gain at public expense. To straighten  out such ideological problems and resolve contradictions, fine  sounding words will be to no avail. The only effective method  is to take practical action to fight corruption, run a clean  administration, and change work style.    Strengthening and improving ideological and political work  is  the job of political work departments and workers, as well as  the whole party. Besides state enterprises, township,  neighborhood, the three kinds of foreign-funded, and private  enterprises all need enhanced and improved ideological and  political work. Enterprise ideological and political work  constitutes an important component of modern enterprise  management. Numerous facts have proved that wise and successful  enterprise leaders are those who pay great attention to  ideological and political work and who are good at doing such  work. How to do well enterprise ideological and political work  in the new situation is a big and meaningful new topic. So long  as we rouse ourselves, boldly make explorations, and think and  do more to straighten out ideological problems and resolve  contradictions at this crucial stage of reform, we will  certainly be able to win the battle of ideological and political  work and create more favorable conditions for "seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability."</p>

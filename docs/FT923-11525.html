			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome As the Wellcome share offer draws to a close today, its promoters might reflect that their timing could have been a good deal worse. Since the bulk of the proceeds are to be reinvested in equities, all that really matters is that the shares should be sold at a high price relative to the market. Since flotation, Wellcome's price has tripled in relative terms. Despite its recent weakness, it is still higher against the market than at any time outside the past 8 months. Given that, it is in the Wellcome Trust's interest as a buyer of equities that the market should be as low as possible. As any actuary at a life company will tell you, the point about bombed-out markets is that they offer inflation-proofed income on the cheap. The only real question for the Trust is therefore how many shares to sell. The criteria were set out yesterday with admirable clarity. The minimum price has been set at 800p as a warning to short sellers, thus setting the maximum discount to yesterday's close at only 3.6 per cent. Thereafter, the guiding principle in setting the price and quantity is that there should be no discount in the after-market. For a seller which will end up with well over a third of the equity, that seems a sensible precaution. From a buyer's viewpoint, the immediate question is whether the sale process has driven the price below the level which might naturally be expected from such a huge increase in the free float. If not, a discount of 1-2 per cent scarcely seems enough in today's volatile markets to justify a change in stance towards the stock. Perhaps fund managers should also ask themselves the following: if it is such a good deal for the Trust to switch out of Wellcome into general equities, where is the attraction in doing the reverse?</p>

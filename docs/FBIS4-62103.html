			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, 11 May -- The presidential press service  published a statement today in the newspaper SLOVO KYRGYZSTAN  [WORD FROM KYRGYZSTAN] in which it tried to evaluate the  political, economic, and social situation in the Republic. The  document emphasizes that the current government has not dealt  with the tasks of taxation and budget replenishment.  Administration of the budget is practically uncontrolled.  People are becoming more impoverished, resulting in an  oversupply of goods. Every fourth enterprise is losing money,  and, at the same time, not a single one has been declared  bankrupt.    The major stabilizing factor of the sociopolitical situation  is the slow down in the inflation rate, says the statement. It  protects a wide range of the population with fixed incomes from  falling standards of living. This also creates conditions for  attracting investment to production. The president is now  taking urgent steps aimed at improving the situation.    At the same time, contractual relations related to  preferential financing of economic and social reforms with  international financial organizations are on the brink of  breakdown.    In light of the lowered living standards of working people,  the government's policy, aimed at slowing down the settlement of  the issue on developing gold mines and attracting foreign  investment on a mutually beneficial basis, seems to be  illogical. Incidentally, President Askar Akayev and deputies of  the regional soviet of (?Karakol) will examine issues of the  government's policy with regard to the Kumtor gold mine today.    The statement ends with the words: "We are building a  democratic state that is capable of implementing laws for the  benefit of our people. This is our decision and we are not  deviating from this path."</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC to lift livestock import ban THE EUROPEAN Community intends to lift its one-month ban on imports of livestock and dairy products from central and eastern Europe after a foot-and-mouth scare in Italy, Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, confirmed yesterday. The ban will be lifted progressively, subject to the eastern Europeans agreeing to tighter controls on export certificates. The EC also wants a 14-day quarantine on live animals so they can be given blood tests. The EC move aims to defuse an embarrassing dispute with 18 central and eastern European countries, some of whom denounced the original trade ban as a restoration of the Iron Curtain. Mr Steichen said in Strasbourg that the new code of conduct would require national veterinary authorities to attach number export certificates to East European livestock, so they could subsequently be traced. The EC's and Austria's one-month ban on meat and dairy products imposed earlier this month provoked a furious protest from central and eastern European countries who said there was no sign of foot-and-mouth disease infecting their animals. Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic imposed tit-for-tat bans, while Slovakia barred the transit of EC livestock. Some affected countries denounced the EC ban as an excuse to protect community agricultural producers. The foot-and-mouth scare began after an outbreak of the disease was discovered in Italy and later traced to Croatia, a transit point for goods and produce entering the EC.</p>

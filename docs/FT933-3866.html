			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK and Irish governments re-affirm commitment THE UK and Irish governments yesterday re-affirmed their commitment to resuming inter-party dialogue on the future of Northern Ireland, Alison Smith writes. A joint statement after a three-hour meeting of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference in London said that the two administrations 'underlined the urgency and importance of the search for political agreement'. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, admitted that there had been little progress in breaking the stalemate that ended the talks late last year, but insisted there were grounds for encouragement in contacts that had been maintained with political parties in Northern Ireland over the past few months. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, emphasised that both governments saw the resumption of talks as the priority, refusing to be drawn on Irish interest in the possible appointment of a US 'peace envoy' in Belfast. Mr Michael Ancram, a Northern Ireland minister, said that all sides agreed that a political settlement had to be reached. He will be pursuing private discussions with the Northern Ireland parties to try to find a way forward for the talks.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPROAR OVER SCALING DOWN;  </P> <P> ZONING PLAN SPARKS HOMEOWNER FURY IN MONTEREY PARK  </P> <P> Condominiums surround the two-bedroom, stucco house with brown trim where Tina  Martin lives.  </P> <P> Hers is one of the last, single-family houses on a street of condominiums.  </P> <P> If she sold the modest house today, along with the small, two-bedroom apartment  that occupies most of her back yard, she estimates the sale could easily bring  her more than $200,000, about 10 times the amount she originally paid in 1966.  </P> <P> And if the property were developed as a condominium site, she says that the  land might be worth close to $1 million. "What we want is top value for our  property," said the 58-year-old teacher of practical nursing. "I don't think  that's unreasonable."  </P> <P> But, contrary to the view of a real estate consultant hired by the city, Martin  fears that implementation of widespread, controversial zoning changes in  Monterey Park will end any grand dreams of turning the property into a gold  mine for her retirement.  </P> <P> Now zoned for multifamily housing, Martin's property on Orange Avenue would be  restricted for use as single-family housing under a proposal being considered  by city officials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Congested Areas  </P> <P> The possible scaling-down of the zoning is being studied for more than 400  acres scattered across the city's most congested areas, principally in the  northeast sector of the 7 1/2-square-mile city. Sixty percent of the city is  now zoned for single-family housing and another 19% for apartments and  condominiums.  </P> <P> A temporary ban already exists on construction of apartments and condominiums,  under rules unanimously enacted last May by the City Council. The council's  five members continue to reiterate their pledges to correct problems with  sewers, schools and streets overburdened from rapid growth in the last decade.  The building moratorium was imposed while city planners and officials study  whether it would help reduce the zoning on individual residential properties in  the northeast neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, angry residents such as Martin have come out against down-zoning,  saying it will create economic havoc for homeowners. Their view is supported by  two former mayors, Cam Briglio and Howard Fry, whose own residences could be  zoned single-family.  </P> <P> "I have agonized over the zoning problems, day after day," said Fry, who was  politically active for 17 years. "But this down-grading . . . will cost me or  my sons and daughters upwards of $20,000," if his house is sold.  </P> <P> Briglio, addressing the Planning Commission recently, said: "I hope the city  has got a lot of money, because I'll take (it) to court."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Strike a Balance'  </P> <P> No one, not even Mayor Barry L. Hatch, who initially tried to push for  revamping the residential zoning for the entire city, seems to believe the  zoning density will be lowered on all the properties under consideration.  </P> <P> "We have to strike a balance," said Councilwoman Judy Chu.  </P> <P> Still, she and other city leaders say there is a mandate to curb growth in the  city of 63,500 residents. "We know for a fact that traffic is a bear," Hatch  says. "So are sewers and problems with water. Our schools are packed."  Eventually, residents will be able to vote on any zoning changes the council  may decide to enact. A referendum approved in 1987 required that changing the  zoning on more than one acre necessitates a vote by the community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lengthy Review  </P> <P> The vote probably will occur in June or July, city officials say, but only  after the council holds a hearing on the issue either later this month or next.  The Planning Commission has made a review, including two full days of visits by  commissioners looking at the properties and three public meetings on the  subject.  </P> <P> Indicative of the sweeping nature of the land areas involved, three of the  planning commissioners -- Ken Fong, Joseph Rubin and Verne Heitman -- and two  council members -- Hatch and Patricia Reichenberger, are disqualified from  voting on any changes.  </P> <P> The California Fair Political Practices Commission, after an inquiry last year  by city officials, ruled that these city leaders' residences fell within areas  under consideration or are in close proximity.  </P> <P> Two planning commissioners and three council members are the only ones who can  vote in public meetings on any possible changes.  </P> <P> "The whole thing has been a strange experience," said Planning Commission  Chairwoman Patricia Chin, who, along with commissioner Stephen Tan, last month  made the decisions on what to recommend to the council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intense Debate  </P> <P> They could agree only on reducing the zoning on 13.3 acres. The two disagreed  on whether the council should consider scaling-down another 54 acres.  </P> <P> Still, the city officials who can't vote aren't barred from making their views  heard, and last month's Planning Commission meeting reflected the intensity of  the debate.  </P> <P> Although disqualified from voting, Fong addressed the meeting from the floor,  saying, "The quality of life has gone down."  </P> <P> Fong said that because of a job change he is moving to Sacramento. But he said  that down-zoning will solve problems of congestion. "Families are tired of  condos," he said. "They want to live in a residential community. That's the  future trend in Monterey Park: more single-family residences."  </P> <P> But in the meeting that didn't end until 3:30 a.m., most of the more than 30  speakers spoke against proposals that would have permitted only single-family  residences on properties where now condominiums and apartments could be built.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Depleted Nest Eggs  </P> <P> Young adults who still live with their parents worried about what would happen  if they lived in a duplex on property that eventually would be restricted to  only single-family housing.  </P> <P> Widows and widowers complained that their real estate nest egg might be  depleted if their properties were zoned single-family instead of  multiple-family.  </P> <P> People who own triplexes worried over what would happen in the case of a fire.  If the city rezoned the property to single-family and there was a fire, they  asked, what would happen if an insurance company were to limit the settlement  to replace a single-family unit?  </P> <P> And one man complained that permitting only a single-family residence on his  property would destroy his plans to sell the land as a condominium site and use  the profits to retire to Montana, where he wants to set up a bee colony.  </P> <P> "I stand to lose over $200,000," said Michael Agnew, who has the bee colony  plans.  </P> <P> "It's strictly economic," said another resident. "You're taking money out of my  pocket, and I don't like it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apartment Limits  </P> <P> Yet Los Angeles real estate consultants from Kotin, Regan &amp; Mouchly Inc.  said that residential property values wouldn't decline if the zoning were  changed from multiple-family to single-family.  </P> <P> The main conclusion, still being hotly debated, is that in most cases land  zoned as single-family "appears to be the highest-valued" use, according to the  consultants' report. This situation exists, the consultants said, because of  the limits on the number of units that can now be placed on land zoned for  apartments or condominiums.  </P> <P> So a house on a 7,000- to 12,000-square-foot lot might be worth about $200,000,  the consultants said, regardless of whether it is zoned for single-family or  multiple units. The value of the land alone on lots that size, if the property  were zoned R-3 (the rating that allows for the highest density of apartment  units), probably would range between $124,000 to $210,000, the report said.  </P> <P> The report generally supports the theory of Hatch and others who say the  single-family house will be the king of real estate in a residential community  like Monterey Park, with little undeveloped land so close to downtown Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Hatch and other city leaders have not focused on the issue of affordability for  first-time home buyers who might be able to buy condominiums rather than a  house. Nonetheless, he believes the city has no shortage of condominiums. And,  he said, developers want to build more. "We've got developers and the saliva is  foaming on the sides of their mouths."  </P> <P> But residents at the Planning Commission hearing said they were worried about  what would happen to property with, for example, duplexes, triples or  four-plexes that might be zoned for single-family property. "People are going  to let that land rot and go downhill," said William Henry Hutchinson of East  Mabel Avenue.  </P> <P> One issue troubling residents such as Tina Martin centers on what will happen  if their property is rezoned and the apartments on their property become  illegal.  </P> <P> Planning Director M. Margo Wheeler said the city has the right to order  property owners to demolish any additional units on property zoned as  single-family. She noted there would be a 20- to 25-year grace period.  </P></p>

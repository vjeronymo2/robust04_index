			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Motoyasu Matsumoto, New York] </F>   [Text] Honda Motor has decided to produce passenger cars in  Mexico. Honda already has plants in the United States and  Canada, and will be the first Japanese motor vehicle maker with  production centers in all three countries, coming under the  cognizance of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  which went into effect in January 1994. In proceeding with its  plant in Mexico, Honda was most concerned about the reaction  from the United States and Canada. Although economic borders  have been deemphasized by NAFTA, national boundaries still exist  in a strict political sense. The events that transpired prior to  the announcement of Honda's plans remind Japanese firms of these  routine realities.    The ceremony to sign the agreement for construction of the  passenger car plant was held in the afternoon of 9 May (early  morning on the 10th, Japan time) at the Mexican presidential  office. Honda was represented at the ceremony by Vice President  Hidemune Munekuni and Managing Director Takakazu Amemiya  stationed in the United States as well as Deputy Secretary of  Commerce and Industry Ugarte of Mexico. The press conference  that was to be held by the Honda representatives after the  ceremony was canceled because the latter had run behind  schedule, but the Mexican side displayed a pervasive welcoming  mood.    According to the plans, Honda will build a passenger car  plant adjacent to its motorcycle plant located on the outskirts  of Guadalajara, the second-largest city in Mexico. The project  is valued at $50 million and will commence in July of this year.  Production of the midsized "Accords" will start in November 1995  at an annual production rate of 15,000 units a year, earmarked  for sale in Mexico. In the future, production will be increased  to 30,000 units a year to provide for exports to Central and  South America.    From the Mexican Government's perspective, Honda's plans  will  provide 500 jobs and a source for earning foreign currency. They  will also have a major impact on the development of parts  industries. It can be said that it is only logical that the  government welcomes Honda's new plant. However, Honda itself was  more concerned with the reaction from the United States and  Canada.    During the NAFTA debate of last fall, a heated exchange of  views took place in the U.S. Congress. Congressmen opposed to  NAFTA used Japan as the primary basis for their position,  arguing, "NAFTA will benefit only Japanese businesses, which  will take advantage of the low labor rates in their Mexican  plants to wage an export offensive on the United States."    In the end, NAFTA passed both houses of Congress with the  majority in favor of the bill in both chambers. However, many  congressmen who were opposed to NAFTA were perennially critical  of Japanese cars and benefited from political support from the  United Auto Workers (UAW). Honda's opening of an automobile  plant in Mexico could influence U.S. congressional hardliners on  Japan and have a subtle effect on the course of the Japan-U.S.  trade talks.    Honda had perceived the existence of the above-discussed  atmosphere and has taken a cautionary stance from early on as  reflected in Vice President Munekuni's statement, "Even if Honda  decides to open an automotive plant in Mexico, it will have  nothing to do with NAFTA." The recent announcement of the plant  opening did not contain any reference to NAFTA. Additionally,  the announcement included the statement, "There are no plans to  export to the United States or Canada." This one statement runs  the risk of limiting Honda in the future if the political or  economic situation should undergo changes in the future.  However, Honda felt it was necessary to send a message of its  intentions to U.S. congressional and UAW sources even though it  was aware of that risk.    Potential problems also lurked in Canada. Honda's Plant No.  1  and Plant No. 2 in Ohio have a combined annual capacity of  500,000 vehicles, while its Canadian plant has a capacity of  only 100,000 units, which is far from the break-even point of  200,000 units. Canadian Government sources expressed concern,  saying, "We hope you have no intent of closing the Canadian  plant after opening the Mexican plant."    Honda responded to such concerns. On 4 May, it announced  that  "Civics" produced at the Canadian plant would be exported to  Taiwan and Brazil. The timing of the announcement was superb as  it was made five days before the news release on the Mexican  plant. The number of exports will total only about 1,000 units  during the year, but the announcement served to appease the  Canadian government. Designating the Mexican plant for  production of the midsized Accord rather than the small Civic  was an action taken to distinguish the Mexican plant from the  Canadian plant, which specializes in production of the Civic.    Honda had initiated its feasibility study for the Mexican  plant in 1992, before the debate on NAFTA assumed serious  proportions. Mexico's laws prohibit the import and sales of  vehicles made by manufacturers that do not operate plants in  that country. The foremost objective of opening a plant in  Mexico was to establish the basis for participating in the  Mexican automotive market, which has a promising future.  Notwithstanding, Honda needed to recognize the political  consideration with respect to the United States and Canada.    The implementation of NAFTA unified the U.S., Canadian, and  Mexican markets and lowered economic barriers. Tariffs  applicable to the automotive sector were either abolished or  reduced. The change provided for a significant expansion of  options available to private businesses that seek globalization  of their activities.    However, NAFTA also has the effect of allowing immediate  expansion of Mexican business activities in the U.S. and  Canadian markets. Thus, it is only logical that the U.S. and  Canadian Governments show concern about movements by  Mexican-based Japanese businesses. Lowering of national economic  barriers has resulted in the "extension" of political influence  beyond national borders. Honda officials admit, "If NAFTA did  not exist, we would not have to exercise so much concern about  U.S. and Canadian positions."    Honda is a pacesetter for globalization of Japanese  businesses. Despite its posture in that respect, Honda has been  forced to exercise a higher degree of political sensitivity than  that of the past. Japanese businesses are plagued by an ironic  phenomenon wherein the lowering of economic barriers has been  replaced by the need to exercise strong awareness of political  barriers.</p>

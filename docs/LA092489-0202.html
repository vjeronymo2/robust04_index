			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SACKS ON THE DECLINE AS OFFENSES ADJUST TO BIG NFL LINEBACKERS  </P> <P> The quarterback deftly drops back in the pocket, sees the strong safety  cheating toward the line of scrimmage and automatically scans the right side  for his tight end. Just as the arm is cocked to throw, the powerful outside  linebacker breaks into the clear, closes quickly and ...  </P> <P> ... The quarterback flips the ball easily to the tight end, who has only one  defender to beat. It's a 14-yard gain and the outside linebacker, two steps  from gory glory, can only tap the quarterback on the shoulder pads in  frustration.  </P> <P> The sack of the quarterback, perhaps the single most exciting play in football  that doesn't involve the end zone, is becoming an increasingly rare phenomenon.  It isn't in danger of becoming extinct, but if the recent trend continues, the  sack may be headed for the endangered species list.  </P> <P> "In the old days," says New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, referring  to the early 1980s, "I could do anything I wanted. Now, they've got a million  things that get in the way. They're blocking with bigger guys and getting rid  of the ball quicker. Now, it's (difficult) getting to the quarterback."  </P> <P> And it's not just because Taylor has turned 30.  </P> <P> Sacks have dropped steadily since 1985. In the Year of the Bears, quarterbacks  were decked 1,306 times. In 1986, the total was 1,198 and it dropped to 1,106  in 1987; even if the one game lost to the strike had been played, there would  have been a substantial decline in sacks. Last season, quarterbacks were sacked  1,035 times.  </P> <P> This season, the total is 112 through two games, which projects to 896 sacks,  or 32 per team. For comparison purposes, the Giants recorded 59 sacks in their  championship season. The great sack artists, like Taylor, Buffalo's Bruce Smith  and Philadelphia's Reggie White, will continue to reach the quarterback. Less  talented athletes will encounter more resistance.  </P> <P> The common misconception, even among some of the league's coaches, is that  defenses aren't blitzing as much. This doesn't seem to be the case.  </P> <P> "I don't think we're blitzing any less," says Fritz Shurmur, in his eighth  season as the Los Angeles Rams' defensive coordinator. "Actually, we've been in  a more aggressive mode than in the last five years. We're coming after people,  but the sacks aren't there. I think you have to look at the other side.  Offenses are better prepared to handle the blitz."  </P> <P> Let us count the ways:  </P> <P> When Taylor, an unprecedented 6-foot-3, 245-pound combination of size and  speed, arrived in 1981, offenses didn't know how to block him. Running backs,  long the accepted solution to blitzing linebackers, weren't enough. Tight ends  didn't work, either. Teams gradually learned to slide their offensive tackles  toward Taylor.  </P> <P> "LT, Otis Wilson, Andre Tippett ... those guys were murdering the running backs  who were trying to block them," Giants defensive coordinator Bill Belichick  says. "For a while there, quarterbacks were getting hit and coughing up the  ball all the time. Now everybody's got a big outside linebacker and everybody  has bigger people to block them."  </P> <P> In the 1960s and '70s, most quarterbacks took a conventional seven-step drop.  That placed them a comfortable distance from the line of scrimmage and gave  them time to read defenses and wait for receivers to come open. Today's game is  much faster.  </P> <P> "The quarterback can't afford to sit back there any more," says Floyd Peters,  the Minnesota Vikings' defensive coordinator. "They take that dinky three-step  drop. Plus, the quarterback is throwing to a spot, even before the receiver  breaks for the ball. That's hard to defense."  </P> <P> Another reason for declining sacks is the shotgun formation that most teams  employ in long-yardage situations. "That was a big change," Peters says. "If  the guy is under center, you'll go after him a lot more. When he's back in the  shotgun, you show blitz, then back off."  </P> <P> Offenses also use the four-wide receiver set to reduce defenses' tendency to  blitz. Peters doesn't like the increasingly wide-open game and calls it  basketball on grass. Shurmur explains:  </P> <P> "Offenses are spreading it out. They go with four wide receivers and force you  into a (man-to-man coverage) matchup you don't like. When that happens, you're  a little leery. You keep guys in and back up with your free safety or strong  safety.  </P> <P> "Now when you blitz, you know you're going to get a hit on the quarterback, but  you also know he's probably going to get the ball there, too."  </P> <P> Miami quarterback Dan Marino is the model when it comes to avoiding sacks. He  has a lightning release, shrewd judgment and talented receivers. Against the  New England Patriots last Sunday he went unsacked in his 14th consecutive game,  an NFL record. That amounts to 563 pass attempts without a sack.  </P> <P> These factors, plus last year's rule change that gave defenders more latitude  when it came to incidental contact with receivers, has led to fewer pass  rushers and more aggressive secondaries. "They're attacking us in the secondary  now," says Ted Plumb, the Philadelphia Eagles' offensive coordinator.  </P> <P> The result? Pass coverage has come full circle in the NFL, in a  back-to-the-future kind of way.  </P> <P> The Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the NFC title in 1979 with a three-man pass rush  and eight men in coverage. The defense allowed the fewest points, yards and  passing yards that season, supporting an offense that scored only 17 points a  game.  </P> <P> Offenses learned how to pick holes in zones with the extra time a limited rush  allowed. Defenses were forced to adjust. By 1985, the Chicago Bears were  sending seven and eight men after the quarterback. That was when sacks peaked.  </P> <P> Now, as offenses have reacted by adding larger blockers and more of them,  defenses are going for a more subtle approach. They are willing to sacrifice a  running back as a blocker if they can find one matchup they like against a  man-to-man defense. As Chicago Coach Mike Ditka said, "You can get a big play  if you block everybody and beat one guy."  </P> <P> Defenses, in turn, spend more time trying to fool the quarterback than squash  him. "There are different coverages, coverages I haven't seen since I've been  in the league," Giants quarterback Phil Simms says. "Coverages that go back to  the day of George Allen."  </P> <P> As Peters says, "Everybody wants to buy that one mistake. The game still comes  down to third down and you want to make the quarterback make the wrong choice,  if you can. By disguising coverages you can do that. It's the only real choice  we have now."  </P></p>

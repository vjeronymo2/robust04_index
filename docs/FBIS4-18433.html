			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] As the April date for the Panhellenic  Socialist Movement (PASOK) congress approaches, candidacies for  the second slot in the party's hierarchy are "timidly emerging,"  writes Tasos Pappas in the 20 March Athens weekly KIRIAKATIKI  ELEVTHEROTIPIA. No doubt Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will  remain party leader and general secretary Akis Tsokhatzopoulos  will probably be reelected, Pappas comments. Tsokhatzopoulos'  advantages are his familiarity with the party apparatus and the  control he exerts over "critical state-nomarchies-districts"  links with the party. While Tsokhatzopoulos contends Papandreou  favors him, "only time will tell," Pappas observes. While  another candidate, Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, is  "keeping his cards close to his chest," influential PASOK deputy  and trade-unionist D. Piperyias, a long-time friend of Arsenis,  is cited by Pappas as stating in a recent interview that he  prefers the defense minister over other heirs apparent. For his  part, Minister of Industry Kostas Simitis is "steadfastly"  following his modernizing course and recently "inveighed"  against trade unions and party hacks pressuring for additional  hirings of public workers. PASOK luminary Vaso Papandreou is  moving "in the same vital space." While on the surface Minister  of Environment Kostas Laliotis shows indifference to party  developments, he surely entertains his own ambitions and expects  to play the role of "gold reserves," Pappas continues. He goes  on to mention deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros  Pangalos, who has "many friends and sworn enemies," as well as  PASOK luminary Apostolos Kaklamanis, president of the Chamber of  Deputies, and old party members Yiannis Alevras and Yiannis  Kharalambopoulos. Of course, Pappas concludes, the major unknown  elements are Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas and  his followers' stance, as it is generally believed that the  outcome of the race will depend on their moves.    According to Notis Papadhopoulos and Yiannis Politis writing  in the 19 March Athens daily TA NEA, Theodhoros Pangalos is "no  longer hiding his leadership ambitions." His most recent  statements regarding the government's "unrealistic foreign and  economic policies" are perceived as attempting to influence  PASOK congress developments, the authors comment. They point  out, however, that Pangalos always "hastens to correct his  course" by following up with support for the government. The  deputy minister clearly has a personal strategy, which he  believes will bear fruit both at the congress and on a long-term  basis. While his "impulsiveness" may cause temporary  unpleasantness, Pangalos aides are cited as believing it  increases his popularity as a politician "who says it like it  is." Papadhopoulos and Politis cite a recent poll commissioned  by the New Democracy (ND) (no further details) showing Pangalos  as one of the best liked Greek politicians. In contrast, they  note, Pangalos' colleagues are very guarded about his sometimes  "heretical" stance, even if reluctant to state it publicly, the  authors conclude.    Government reaction to Pangalos' criticism of governmental  policies was swift, reports the 19 March TA NEA. Government  spokesman Evangelos Venizelos emphasized the present "specific,  coordinated, and pondered" economic policy and indirectly  accused Pangalos of ignoring Papandreouf's directive requesting  his ministers to refrain from expressing individual views on  important issues. In another development, the 13 March  KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA comments on the "well-known" conflict  between Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and  Pangalos. According to the brief article, while it is clear that  Papandreou sides with the former and has already decided to  dismiss Pangalos, a public announcement will only come "at the  right moment." The 20 March I KATHIMERINI echoes this by  reporting that despite Papandreou's determination to dismiss  Pangalos, he will only do so when the Greek European Union (EU)  presidency ends, to avoid making him a "hero" and turning him  into a potential successor at the PASOK congress.    The 20 March TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS published an interview  with  Pangalos by Petros Evthimiou, in which the alternate minister  advocated the modernization and Europeanization of PASOK and of  society, changes that will begin to take place during the  forthcoming congress. Pangalos also maintained that while the  party should be the state's inspiration and play a critical role  vis-a-vis the government, this should only occur at the top,  through a parallel structure unconnected to the government.  Evthimiou asked Pangalos whether this will be a  "post-Papandreou" congress charged with defining the party's  course if Papandreou moves to the presidency and leaves the  field to party officials. He also linked the question to an  unidentified Pangalos central committee colleague's hope that  the party will not break up in the post-Papandreou era, and that  the PASOK fragments will remain friendly even if it did.  Pangalos replied that the congress will have a unifying  influence in that there will be a synthesis of the various  views, which an overwhelming majority will approve. The  alternate minister then expressed his conviction that "there  will be no second Andreas Papandreou," and that in the future,  the party will have a collective leadership, one of whose  members will be nominated for the prime ministership on a  rotating basis according to the needs of the moment. While this  may be difficult to accept, it constitutes the normal political  life of a modern democratic European country, Pangalos concluded.</p>

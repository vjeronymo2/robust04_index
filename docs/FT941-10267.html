			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Arts: Royal Ballet nurtures its creative talent - Clement Crisp catches 'Dance Bites' at Leicester and finds that excellent intentions have produced admirable results The Royal Ballet has come up with a welcome new development in both touring and creativity. Offered under yet another odd title - what does Dance Bites mean? - the enterprise takes a small group of dancers (27 in all) for short visits to regional theatres, in Leicester, Cambridge, Blackpool, with a repertory containing three new works by company choreographers. Staging, as I saw in Leicester, is simple; forces are limited; and I would hazard that costs have been kept low. Excellent intentions, admirable results. The audience at Tuesday's matinee was enthusiastic, and there was a sense of youthful verve about the performance, of creative talent being sensibly nurtured - not chucked in the deep-end at Covent Garden, but trying ideas on a smaller and less redoubtable scale. The intimacy of means, the frankness of contact with a public in a medium-sized theatre (Leicester offered fine sight-lines), also helped to 'humanise' the idea of the Royal Ballet, away from the inevitable pomposities of an Opera House. The public's only complaint might be about the barmy titles in the programme - Desirable Hostilities, Caught Dance, Herman Schmerman are more like cryptic crossword clues than aids to understanding. William Tuckett and Matthew Hart, the company's aspirant creators, have produced short works. Tuckett's Desirable Hostilities uses five of Bach's preludes from the 48 as a ground on which two men (Matthew Trent, Alastair Marriott) and two women (Rachael Whitbread, Violeta Gaston) spar, contemplate their own navels, and behave with that provocative and uneasy manner which has been patented for the dance-stage by William Forsythe. There is a suspicion that they have been rather badly brought up, but the writing is fluent, and the solos for the men, who have more searching choreography than the women, are intriguing, hinting at youthful angst and uncertainty. The cast are in black and the girls might sue over their dreary mini-leotards. Matthew Hart's Caught Dance is a duet for Leanne Benjamin and Jose Manuel Carreno. The score is Lutoslawski's Dance Preludes, whose Polish folksiness Hart rejects. Instead, we seem to be watching a courtship between exotic creatures: Yoland Sonnabend's black and red leotards make the dancers look like Amazonian beetles or birds. I suspected the lurking presence of cameras and David Attenborough for yet another nature programme about copulation in the jungle, but the choreography is well made, Leanne Benjamin is a triumphant predator, and Hart's originality shows fascinatingly through the conventions of the partnering, and in the ingenuities of Carreno's solos. The most elaborate work in the programme is Ashley Page's new Renard. This has always been an awkward cuss of a score, almost too firmly shaped by Stravinsky in theatrical manner for choreography. The succinct narrative, like the music and the sung text, is locked into Russian folk traditions, and there have been few danced realisations. Page has seen its potential as a stage picture, as he did with his Soldier's Tale for Rambert, and he has turned to the same designer, Bruce McLean. So we have a vivid, bright setting: a green structure - cock and hens on a platform raised above the stage, with a descending ramp - a magenta sky, and bold costumes. The red fox has a jokey hair-brush as a hat. The Cock, in black, has a red penis appliqued on his costume. The hens have chic little red hats to suggest their crests. It is very jolly, and the action, in simple dance terms, is clear - it is not a piece that will permit much other than faux-naif capers. It is well danced - Jonathan Cope as the Fox; Peter Abegglen as the Cock; Adam Cooper as the Goat; Stuart Cassidy as the Cat, with six hens - and well sung and played under Lionel Friend. The rest of the programme brought Monotones 2 - somewhat less serene than heretofore, and demonstrating that its cast of three really need the expanse of an opera house stage if Ashton's patterns are to breathe  - and William Forsythe's Herman Schmerman, without which I have decided I can very happily do, and did on this occasion. This Dance Bites tour is sponsored by the Audrey Sacher Charitable Trust and the Friends of Covent Garden. It can be seen at the Corn Exchange, Cambridge, on February 10, 11, 12; at the Grand Theatre Blackpool on February 14, 15</p>

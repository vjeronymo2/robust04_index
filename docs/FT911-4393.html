			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: American citrus producers set up network CITRUS producing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the US, yesterday set up an inter-regional network to promote the exchange of expertise and information to improve citrus production. The 23 countries aim to conduct joint research programmes in areas such as pest control, the development of disease-resistant strains and the climatic adaptation of different varieties of citrus. They will also circulate information on plantings, harvests, exports and world demand which they hope will guide producers in their marketing and investment decisions. The network was formed at a meeting in Santiago sponsored by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Mr Kerry Mulherin, deputy director of FAO's commodities and trade division, believes there are signs that surpluses are emerging in the production of certain citrus fruits. 'Expansion plans could aggravate the situation,' says Mr Mulherin, 'which is why it is so important to have up-to-date information to allow countries to assess their production strategies.' The network will compile a list of experts to help countries improve techniques in plant propagation, production methods, disease control and post-harvest handling. FAO says the network 'could effectively use the limited manpower and finances available to address critical unsolved problems of citrus production in the region'. The countries in the network produce more than half of the world's annual citrus production of some 65m tonnes. They are also responsible for 24 per cent of worldwide fresh citrus exports and 70 per cent of processed exports. The members are adamant that the group will not be a precursor to a trade pact. Mr Mulherin said: 'We want to encourage co-operation at the technical level, which is far easier to achieve than at the trade level. 'The general mood in the world today is not in favour of trade cartels.' The Brazil delegation, however, argued that the group should tackle trade barriers within and outside the region. 'The US imposes Dollars 540 (Pounds 301) of taxes and tariffs on every tonne of Brazilian citrus juice that reaches Florida,' said Mr Jose Carlos Goncalves, president of the Association of Brazilian Fruit Juice Industries. 'This amounts to 58 per cent of the fob value of citrus juice before it leaves the port of Santos.' Mr Goncalves added that the European Community slaps a 19 per cent tariff on Brazilian citrus exports. As the world's biggest citrus exporter, Brazil will be co-ordinating the network's economic and trade groups. Mr Goncalves says Brazil intends to work towards opening new markets and reducing tariff barriers. The US, with the greatest expertise in citrus production, will co-ordinate the network's research and technology transfer.</p>

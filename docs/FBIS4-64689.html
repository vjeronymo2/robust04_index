			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] In light of the anniversary of the 25  April 1974 revolution, the Lisbon weekly VISAO published the  results of a 1994 Marktest poll (no further information) on the  Portuguese people's view of the revolution and its goals,  comparing it with the results obtained in a similar 1984 poll.    In 1984, 33.4 percent of the respondents thought they had  realized their personal goals, while 67.3 percent think so  today. While 28.1 percent thought then that they had realized  their professional goals, the percentage has increased to 57.2  percent. In 1984, 20.7 percent thought their economic situation  had improved, but 56.2 percent presently think so.    Portugal's course since the revolution was assessed as  follows:     -  Improvement in freedom of expression: 82.5 percent in  1984, 88.4 percent in 1994.    -  Improvement in Portugal's world  image: 49.2 percent in 1984, 82.2 percent in 1994.    -  Improvement  in economic development: 22.5 percent in 1984, 73.6 percent in  1994.    -  Improvement in social stability: 24.0 percent in 1984,  65.1 percent in 1994.    -  Improvement in Portugal's political  independence: 35.2 percent in 1984, 62.7 percent in  1994.    -  Improvement in family stability: 21.5 percent in 1984,  58.2 percent in 1994.    -  Improvement in prospects for the young:  26.4 percent in 1984, 55.3 percent in 1994.    -  Improvement in  Portugal's economic independence: 15.4 percent in 1984, 55.0  percent in 1994.    The following developments were assessed negatively:     -  Public morality: 49.7 percent in 1984, 45.9 percent in  1994.    -  Ease in obtaining employment: 77.3 percent in 1984, 69.4  percent in 1994.    -  Course of criminality: 66.4 percent in 1984,  76.4 percent in 1994.    -  Influence of drugs: 73.4 percent in 1984,  84.0 percent in 1994.    Respondents were also asked how they view the revolution's  nationalizations. In 1984, 52.9 percent agreed with them, versus  37.9 percent today. Those who did not agree in 1984 (32.5  percent) increased to 49.3 percent, while 14.7 percent and 12.8  percent had no opinion in 1984 and 1994 respectively.    The 1994 poll also asked respondents how they view European  integration. A large majority (72.3 percent) agree with it,  while 14.9 percent do not, and 12.8 percent have no opinion.  However, results showed that the public would have preferred  that a referendum take place: 76.1 percent said so and 13.0  percent disagreed, while 10.9 percent had no opinion.</p>

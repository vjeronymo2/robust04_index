			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQI MISSILE TEST CAUGHT U.S. COMPLETELY OFF GUARD;  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS: SOME OFFICIALS THOUGHT WAR WAS ABOUT TO ERUPT. INCIDENT RAISES  QUESTIONS ABOUT INTELLIGENCE EFFORTS.  </P> <P> The launching of three medium-range Iraqi missiles in what turned out to be a  test caught American intelligence agencies so completely by surprise early this  month that some U.S. officials feared war was about to erupt in the Persian  Gulf.  </P> <P> And the failure of America's sophisticated satellite system to detect what was  afoot until the first missile had been in flight for six minutes and was only  one minute from impact raises serious questions about how much warning time  U.S. forces would have in the event of a real attack.  </P> <P> Officials previously had believed that Iraq could not carry out the several  hours of fueling and other prelaunch preparations needed for such missile  firings without detection by U.S. satellites and other sensors -- ostensibly in  time for an American counter-strike before the Iraqi weapons could lift off.  </P> <P> In the test, however, the Iraqis completed all the preparations and even the  first launch without being discovered.  </P> <P> Some experts say privately that the incident -- first reported by the Financial  Times of London and confirmed by U.S. officials -- represents a significant  intelligence failure. While some Pentagon and Administration officials dispute  that assessment, one Administration official admitted the firings "gave us  pause."  </P> <P> "We had no advanced warning," he said.  </P> <P> The Dec. 2 missile launches were a surprise even though Iraq had openly warned  airliners to keep out of its airspace after midnight the night before.  </P> <P> Baghdad gave no reason, but on the strength of the warning, Israeli pilots were  reportedly ordered to be in their cockpits, ready to strike back if Israel were  attacked during the period. U.S. aircraft were also at a very high state of  readiness and would apparently have retaliated if the missiles had been  directed at U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> "A lot of people were in their cockpits ready to go," a senior U.S. official  said.  </P> <P> British and other allied forces were on high alert too, according to European  reports.  </P> <P> But no one knew what the Iraqis were planning, and indications are that  American intelligence was surprised not only by the launches but also by both  the launching point and the direction in which the missiles were fired.  </P> <P> The nearness of war was seemingly confirmed this week by the chief U.S.  diplomat in Baghdad, Joseph C. Wilson IV. He received an urgent telephone call  the morning of Dec. 2 from the State Department in Washington, he said,  informing him that "the balloon is going up -- this is no drill."  </P> <P> The warning apparently was flashed to Wilson soon after the launch of the first  missile was detected.  </P> <P> Though many details of what happened remain unclear, it is known that the three  missiles were fired at half-hour intervals, beginning at 4 a.m., from a site  near Basra, in southeastern Iraq. They traveled westward more than 400 miles,  toward Israel, but fell in a remote part of Iraqi territory.  </P> <P> Iraq has a variety of missiles with different capabilities. If missiles of the  type used in the test had been fired southward, they had sufficient range to  hit U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. If launched from the western part of Iraq,  instead of from a point near Basra, they could have reached Jerusalem and Tel  Aviv.  </P> <P> Officials said they believe the missiles tested, thought to be so-called Abbas  weapons with a range of 500 miles, have relatively poor accuracy and relatively  small payload capacity. If equipped with chemical warheads, however, officials  said they could have caused considerable casualties.  </P> <P> U.S. officials, by terming the firings a "test," suggested the missiles were  not production models deployed to troops in significant quantities.  </P> <P> In addition, they emphasized that the missiles were launched from near Basra,  "rather than from where people were looking and alert to," as one official  said, "and they were not aimed in the threat direction."  </P> <P> The implication is that U.S. attention was focused on two identified Iraqi  missile sites, located at airfields called H-2 and H-3 in the western part of  the country, where Iraq's longer-range missiles are believed to be kept.  </P> <P> But Seth Carus of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who follows  Mideast weapons developments, said it was "odd" that U.S. intelligence sensors  were not also trained on the Basra area, from which shorter-range missiles  could be fired against U.S. forces to the south.  </P> <P> Normally, the anticipated trajectories of hostile missiles are programmed into  the sensors to alert U.S. forces automatically to any incoming weapon. Some  analysts suggest that southern trajectories from Basra were programmed into the  sensors, as were western trajectories from H-2 and H-3, but not westerly paths  from Basra.  </P> <P> Another important issue, Carus said, is whether the missiles tested were a new  and improved version of known Iraqi weapons. If the accuracy and payload  capacity of the longer-range missiles were significantly better, the threat to  Israel, Saudi Arabia and U.S.-led forces would become markedly greater.  </P> <P> Iraq reportedly has more than 200 missiles of four types, all of them either  Soviet-made or modified versions of Soviet weapon. The four are code-named  Frog, Scud-B, Hussein and Abbas.  </P> <P> Frogs have a range of about 50 miles, Scud-Bs about 220 miles, Husseins 400  miles and Abbases 500 miles. How many of each type Iraq has is not known, but  the latter two missiles are believed to number fewer than 50.  </P> <P> The Hussein and Abbas are modified versions of the Scud-B, which can hit within  about half a mile of its target carrying a payload of about half a ton. The  Iraqi versions have much poorer characteristics; they are accurate to within  only one to three miles of their aim point, according to a report by the U.S.  Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Payloads may be as low as 300 pounds at  maximum range.  </P> <P> This means that, if used with chemical warheads at maximum range, at least a  dozen missiles would have to be fired -- and at nearly the same time -- to  produce lethal concentrations of a nerve agent, for example.  </P> <P> Carus has calculated that to kill half the people in an area of about one-third  of a square mile would require 28,000 pounds of the nerve agent Tabun, which  the Iraqis are known to possess, if it were spread on the ground.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ALASKA NATIVES LIABLE FOR 'WASTE'  </P> <P> A federal appeals court ruled today that Alaska natives, normally exempt from a  moratorium on killing rare marine mammals, may be criminally prosecuted if  their killing of the animals is found "wasteful."  </P> <P> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholds the constitutionality of  a provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act regulating wasteful killing of  marine mammals by Indians, Aleuts or Eskimos.  </P> <P> The law established a moratorium on taking or importing marine mammals or  products made from the animals except for the making of authentic native  handicrafts and clothing or meat sold for subsistence living in Alaskan  villages.  </P> <P> The law prohibits native Alaskans from wasting substantial portions of a marine  mammal that was killed.  </P></p>

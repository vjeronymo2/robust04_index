			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK is unaware that name of competitive game has changed Sir, With reference to Robert Barro's Personal View (November 1), as a German businessman who has lived and worked in the UK for more than 25 years, I have to agree with shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown's view on 'endogenous growth', rather than chancellor Kenneth Clarke's. The reasons are simple: First, 'hands-on' government in industrial policy, export support, regional aid, research and development projects, training and skill developments, etc, is happening in all the countries Britain is competing against - at a significant rate. Second, the very nature of the Anglo-Saxon model, with its focus on short-term profit maximisation, makes it harder for UK companies to compete against their long-term, market share-oriented Asian and Continental European competitors. In other words, the UK is severely handicapped in two ways by hanging on to the theory of pure non-interventionist capitalism - without having noticed that half the world (the successful half) has changed the rules of the game. Whether this is plain ignorance or an ideological trap is irrelevant. The result has been a steady decline of UK manufacturing industries over 25 years - and there is no improvement in sight.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general these criteria were considered collectively. However, EPA believes that for most companies, implementation of an alternative, whether it be a drop-in replacement or a complete overhaul of the production process, often entails significant cost and time constraints. EPA recognizes that companies need lead time in establishing a labeling program or installing an alternative technology where companies have chosen to switch from a class I substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a substitute in order to comply with the regulations. Companies that have not implemented a substitute are required to label their products until they have implemented a substitute. Therefore, where a company's early efforts to replace its uses of controlled substances are prevented through  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> unavoidable <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  obstacles beyond its control, such as a required Federal review or permit program, or where a substitute requires additional development through testing due to unknown or unavoidable impediments, EPA has placed greater weight on such circumstances in developing its determinations, because the ability of a company to switch to an alternative is seriously hampered by circumstances outside of its control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA emphasizes that its process of evaluating a company's request for exemption from the labeling requirements is a different review process from the essential use exemption authorized by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (the Parties) and could well reach different conclusions. Under the Montreal Protocol process, member countries can put forth nominations for essential use exemptions that would allow for continued production of ozone-depleting substances after the production phaseout, to be used in an application for which there are no suitable substitutes. The Parties receive and review these applications individually and may decide to grant particular exemption requests. If the Parties agree that a particular applications is essential, additional production of an ozone-depleting substance will be authorized for that particular application after the phaseout has taken effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 20, 1993 (58 FR 29410), requesting essential use nominations for CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and HBFCs by July 19, 1993. The Agency requested nominations for essential uses of halons on February 12, 1993 (58 FR 6788). Companies nominated their specific applications of a controlled substance to receive an exemption from the production and consumption phaseout schedule. These nominations are reviewed first by EPA and then by the Montreal Protocol Parties. The Parties recognized the need for such exemptions because of the accelerated phaseout dates. Exemptions, if any, will be granted at the Sixth Meeting of the Parties, which may be held as early as June 1994. Nominations for halon essential uses will be considered earlier since halons are subject to an even more rapid phaseout schedule. Nominations for essential uses will continue to be considered each year at subsequent meetings of the Parties; thus, companies will have additional opportunities to request an essential use exemption in the future. The process will entail a rigorous international review process, which is described in Decision IV/25 of the Fourth Meeting of the Protocol. Therefore, if a company requests a temporary exemption from the labeling requirements through &sect;82.120 of the labeling regulations, and also wishes to request an exemption for use of controlled substances beyond the phaseout date, the company must separately nominate its use for an essential use exemption to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Petitions for Exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today, EPA proposes to accept two petitions. The first petition, submitted by the Upjohn Company (Upjohn), contends that Upjohn has a substitute for its use of CFC&hyph;12 as a sterilant; however, a review and evaluation period is required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before the alternative can be approved and then implemented. The company therefore contends that a substitute is not potentially available until the FDA review is completed. EPA is proposing to grant this exemption until August 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other petition, submitted by the E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. (DuPont), is classified as confidential business information and thus, EPA cannot disclose the name of its product. (Dupont has produced a petition containing nonconfidential information that has been placed into the docket). This product, which consists of certain fine synthetic fibers, uses CFC&hyph;11 as a basic process solvent in the fiber manufacturing process. Although Dupont has identified a possible substitute, it must develop, implement and test a major process change to replace the existing manufacturing facilities. Therefore, Dupont contends that a substitute is not potentially available until this process has been identified and current facilities have been successfully modified to ensure that this alternative can in fact be accommodated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

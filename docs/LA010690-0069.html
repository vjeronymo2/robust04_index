			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHER'S EARLY LEAD HOLDS UP;  </P> <P> SENIOR GOLF: HE HAS A TWO-STROKE ADVANTAGE OVER RODRIGUEZ. NOBODY ELSE IN  20-MAN FIELD IS UNDER PAR.  </P> <P> George Archer is one old-time golfer who is happy teeing off early in the  morning.  </P> <P> Archer and his playing partner, Chi Chi Rodriguez, were the seventh pair to tee  off Friday for the second round of the MONY Tournament of Champions at La Costa  Country Club.  </P> <P> Archer shot a 69, three under par, over the 7,022-yard course for a two-shot  lead at the halfway point of the senior division of the tournament. After 36  holes, Archer is at 142, two under par. Rodriguez had a 71 for a 144 total. The  other 18 players from the 50-and-older tour were over par.  </P> <P> "If it's not too cold and you don't have to lead off, it is an advantage for us  to go first," said Archer, playing in only his sixth senior event. "Up and down  the coast they are using greens with poa annua grass. It is fine for greens,  except that a footprint will remain on the green until they cut it again. By  late in the day, there are a lot of footprints and putting is much more  difficult. Also, here the wind comes up after noon, so that's another reason  we're lucky to tee off early."  </P> <P> Archer had the hot putter early, sinking birdie putts of 20, 25, 10 and eight  feet on the front nine to post a 32. The putter didn't work as well on the back  side and he had all pars except the 450-yard 10th, the toughest par-four on the  course.  </P> <P> Trying to get within rage for a long iron to the green, Archer pushed his drive  into the rough. On the next shot his backswing was restricted by a tree and he  pulled the ball into the deep rough on the left, just short of the water. He  chipped long and missed a 20-footer par putt.  </P> <P> "I think a 69 on this course is very good," Archer said. "It's the longest  course we play. It's difficult for us, but the regular tour players don't think  it's tough. They play tougher courses.  </P> <P> "I am really enjoying myself on this tour. I was told it was fun and it is.  Everybody's smiling. We all can't be comics like Chi Chi, but we have a good  time. It's great to play with Chi Chi. But I was disappointed today. He had the  crowd going and I gave him some good lines and he didn't use them."  </P> <P> Rodriguez birdied the last two holes to provide the first challenge for Archer  after he had built a four-shot lead. He said that for the seniors, par is 75.  </P> <P> "That's why a bogey doesn't hurt," he said. "If you just keep parring, you'll  do all right.  </P> <P> "I think this is a good idea. It lets everybody know that the young guys are  the best golfers. That's why they're on the big tour. Sometimes, playing  shorter courses, guys finish 14 or 15 under. They get the idea they're as good  as the youngsters. This tournament shows we're not."  </P> <P> Rodriguez also explained the difference between old-timers and the current crop  of pros.  </P> <P> "Most of us were caddies," he said. "Our goal was to become the pro at a course  like this. These serious kids' goal is to own the course."  </P> <P> Rodriguez said his desire to be No. 1 on the Senior Tour has been rekindled. He  said he is a person in control of his life. Just to prove it he stops smoking  every Dec. 15.  </P> <P> "This year I discovered a way to avoid withdrawal," he said. "I went down to  the ocean and stuck my head in the water every morning. The salt water has all  these minerals that are good for you. They got in back of my eyes and cleared  out all the nicotine."  </P> <P> Also in contention at 145 are Al Geiberger, who had a 71 Saturday, Bruce  Crampton and Bobby Nichols, the co-leader after the first round.  </P> <P> Crampton has played 34 holes at three under but a double bogey each day has  cramped his style. Thursday, his first shot stayed up in a tree and he wound up  with a double bogey. And Friday, the fifth hole foiled him. He hit a ball into  a gully, an unplayable lie, and wound up with a six.  </P> <P> With 36 holes to play, contention runs deep. There are 12 golfers within six  shots of Archer. Defending champion Miller Barber is one of them. He had a  Rodriguez par -- a 75 -- and is five back at 147.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'MR. MAGOO BANDIT' SOUGHT IN WESTLAKE BANK ROBBERY  </P> <P> A bank robbery in Westlake Village this week was the work of the "Mr. Magoo  Bandit," who is suspected of robbing a dozen banks in the South Bay and Orange  County, sheriff's deputies said Thursday.  </P> <P> The bandit -- nicknamed after the nearsighted cartoon character because he  wears thick glasses -- robbed the Coast Savings bank in the 32100 block of West  Agoura Road shortly after it opened at 9 a.m. Wednesday, said Lt. Frank Woodall  of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Robbery Division.  </P> <P> The suspect handed a teller a note demanding money after showing her a handgun  concealed in a brown leather bag, Woodall said. He escaped a few minutes later  with $4,400 in cash, authorities said. No shots were fired.  </P> <P> The man's description matched that of a robber responsible for 11 holdups in  the South Bay area and one in Anaheim between March 28 and April 4, FBI  spokesman Fred Reagan said. Seven of the South Bay-area banks were robbed  within a 24-hour period, Reagan said.  </P> <P> "We feel fairly strongly " that the same man is responsible for all 13  robberies, Reagan said.  </P> <P> The suspect, believed to be in his early 30s, was described as white, with  light brown hair, about 6 feet tall and weighing about 175 pounds. His face is  marked with small scars, probably from acne, authorities said. He was last seen  wearing a light green T-shirt and brown slacks.  </P></p>

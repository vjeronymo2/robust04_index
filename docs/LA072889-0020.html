			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER RAIL LINES  </P> <P> Los Angeles Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky is dead wrong to oppose a cost-effective  and efficient passenger light rail line along Exposition Boulevard.  </P> <P> While problems such as traffic congestion on streets and freeways and pollution  throughout the region beg for solutions from our political leaders, this  elected official prefers the most expensive alternative available, a subway  under Wilshire Boulevard from Los Angeles to Santa Monica.  </P> <P> The "Wilshire Alternative" is no solution.  </P> <P> When will we elect officials who will galvanize regional consensus on solutions  rather than polarize parochial views into regional paralysis?  </P> <P> WILLIAM P. BURROUGHS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

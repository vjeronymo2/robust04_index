			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Izumi Oshima; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 14 </F> April Morning Edition]    [Text] Paris -- Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata left Japan on 13 April aboard an exclusive  government plane for Morocco via Paris, to sign a final Uruguay  Round accord at ministerial talks. Speaking with a group of  Japanese reporters aboard the plane about prospects for the  political situation, Foreign Minister Hata said: "The ruling  parties are now working on coordinating their opinions in an  effort to keep their coalition framework intact. I think they  will soon complete their policy coordination and choose a  candidate to succeed Prime Minister Hosokawa." In this way, the  foreign minister predicted that a candidate to succeed Hosokawa  as prime minister would be chosen early next week.    The foreign minister has been mentioned as the most likely  candidate to succeed Hosokawa as prime minister. Asked by a  reporter to comment on this, Hata stated: "I have heard about  it, but I would like to refrain from mentioning the name of the  person to become prime minister." Touching on talks with U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor scheduled to be held on 15  April, the foreign minister said: "I intend to tell him that a  change of government in Japan should not set back Japan-U.S.  relations," and he added: "It is a matter of course for me to  call on him to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks after a new government is inaugurated in Japan."</p>

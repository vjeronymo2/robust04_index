			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Gamova: "Language Test in Moldavia </F> [Moldova] Deferred"]    [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- Russian-speaking specialists  fearful of crossing the threshold of enterprises and  organizations because of their inadequate knowledge of the state  language can now work with equanimity: The Republic's  parliament has postponed the language proficiency test until 1  January 1997. The members of the Agrarian Party and specialists  who had promised during the election campaign to modify the law  on the functioning of languages have kept the word given by  parliament.    Unlike the members of the Moldavian People's Front, who try  to exploit this law to carry out ethnic cleansing, the new  authorities have abolished the Moldavian-language proficiency  exam for those already working. As all business correspondence  and technical documentation is already translated into the state  language, knowledge of it remains a sine qua non. But no one is  going to be dismissed for paucity of vocabulary. Parliament has  ordered the government to draw up a new Moldavian-language  instruction program, recognizing that the previous ones were  extremely complicated. The range of people to be tested will  also be specified, but this will be done regardless of the  categories of specialists who fall within it. The examination  will be mandatory for the Dniester Region and the southern  regions, where there is a high density of Russians, Ukrainians,  Gagauz, and Bulgarians, only when people are being recruited for  jobs and contracts extended. This has been stipulated by a  special amendment to the Law on the Functioning of Languages  since the determination of the special status of these two  regions.</p>

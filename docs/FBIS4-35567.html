			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rina Matzliah] </F>   [Text] Our correspondent Rina Matzliah has learned the  details of a secret plan drawn up by the settlers in the  territories, under which they will try to take over two points  within the autonomy area in Jericho and hold onto them in an  attempt to foil the arrival of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. Our  correspondent reports from the place where the settlers have  convened:    [Begin Matzliah recording] The heads of the Council of  Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza rented a  particularly large hall for a particularly large convention in  which their protest activities for the coming days are being  presented. Jerusalem and Jericho are the two centers of these  protest activities. In Jericho the settlers plan to take  control of two Jewish points: the Na'aran synagogue which,  contrary to its name, is not located near Kibbutz Na'aran but  rather inside the autonomy area, and the Hasmonean Palace which  is also located inside the autonomy area. The settlers intend  to take control of these two points, to establish facts on the  ground, and to remain there, as was the case with the ancient  synagogue in Jericho.    A large-scale protest is planned for Jerusalem too. The  heads of the council are negotiating with businessmen in  Jerusalem in an attempt to stage a general strike there on the  day Yasir 'Arafat arrives in the area. Most importantly, do not  dare let the PLO leader climb Temple Mount. [end recording]</p>

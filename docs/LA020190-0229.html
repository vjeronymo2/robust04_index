			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PRINCE LOSES CHEF TO JUNK FOOD  </P> <P> Rock star Prince's fondness for macaroni and cheese and canned cake frosting  was too much for his chef, who quit after only a month on the job.  </P> <P> "He eats a lot of junk food.  </P> <P> I have the feeling it's going to catch up with him," Carmen Bonilla of  Minneapolis said Wednesday of the svelte Prince.  </P> <P> Bonilla, 36, a professional chef for 10 years, said she began working for  Prince just before Christmas. Her last day on the job was Wednesday.  </P> <P> "He hasn't had the opportunity to develop his palate," Bonilla said of the  reclusive rock star. "He doesn't eat out very much because he's shy and he  hates the public. . . . He wants the comfort food he grew up on."  </P> <P> That means macaroni and cheese and cake mixes and canned frosting, said  Bonilla, who prefers cooking Mediterranean cuisine. "Basically it was too  restrictive for me as a personal chef," she said.  </P> <P> Although he professes to be a vegetarian, Prince will not eat salads and  vegetables but he will eat chicken, likes fresh fish and "adores" pasta,  Bonilla said.  </P></p>

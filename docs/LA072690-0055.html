			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROHR SIGNS 2ND $1-BILLION CONTRACT FOR ENGINE CASINGS  </P> <P> For the second time this year, Rohr Industries has signed a $1-billion  follow-on contract to supply casings for jet engines for commercial airliners,  the Chula Vista-based firm announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Executives of Rohr said they reached an agreement with European manufacturer  Airbus Industrie to furnish the aerodynamic structures -- known as nacelles --  for 800 aircraft. However, the contract will not immediately boost jobs, a Rohr  spokesman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the agreement, Rohr will design and manufacture nacelle  systems for the CFM56-5A engines that power Airbus A320 airliners and CFM56-5B  engine for the Airbus A321.  </P> <P> With the new contract, Rohr will provide nacelle systems for 1,000 Airbus craft  in all, five times more than the 200 planes originally specified under a 1984  contract.  </P> <P> In March, Rohr signed a $1-billion follow-on contact with International Aero  Engines to provide nacelle systems for McDonnell Douglas MD-90 jetliners.  </P> <P> Airbus is a consortium owned by Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Airbus of West  Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.  The IAE consortium includes Pratt &amp; Whitney of the United States, England's  Rolls-Royce and a group of Japanese companies.  </P> <P> Rohr officials said the close working relationship between their European  program team and the two European manufacturing consortiums was the key to both  agreements.  </P> <P> "This program demonstrates the benefits of bringing together the capabilities  of the international aerospace community. This Europe-oriented program  continues to be successful and mutually beneficial for us and our customers,"  said Don Purdy, vice president of commercial business.  </P> <P> After reporting its first $1-billion sales year in fiscal 1989, Rohr surprised  industry observers by announcing an $11.4-million first-quarter loss in  October. The company blamed more stringent standards in military programs,  which at the time accounted for 25% of Rohr's business.  </P> <P> However, the company has continued to benefit from an unprecedented worldwide  demand for commercial aircraft. Spokesman Roger Renstrom said Rohr's firm order  backlog now stands at $2.6 billion, and the expected backlog represents another  $2 billion.  </P> <P> "Our projections are that the high demand will continue," he said.  </P> <P> Rohr employs 11,400 workers at 10 facilities in the United States and one in  Europe. The company reported $759 million in sales for the first three quarters  of fiscal 1990.  </P></p>

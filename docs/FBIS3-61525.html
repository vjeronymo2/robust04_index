Kreneva, Azov Scientific Research Institute </F> of Fishery Industry, Rostov na Donu; UDC [593.17:574.63](08)(28)]    [Abstract] The widening gap between the rates at which new  contaminants appear the maximum permissible concentrations (PDK)  are developed for them and the impossibility of reliably  extrapolating the experimental observation data to natural  reservoirs made MPCs irrelevant in today's toxicology studies  and called for conducting environmental research at the  biocenosis level. Thus, only standards and forecasts developed  on the basis of studies of natural biocenosis under natural  conditions may be regarded as reliable, especially since the  man-caused factor has become a customary event in such research.  As a result, methods are proposed of establishing MPCs not from  test-tube data but for the specific ecosystem and the pollution  sources which affect it. The proposed system of biological  analysis and monitoring methods was refined in large bodies of  water with a powerful current system, i.e., Ladoga, Onega, and  Baykal lakes. A block diagram of such biological analysis under  complex hydrological conditions is cited, and the contaminated  flow ecosystem dynamics are plotted. The systemic approach used  is divided into three phases. The biological analysis system's  concluding stages involve setting the standards for the  man-caused burden and establishing monitoring and prediction  methods for use in the most severe cases, i.e., large bodies of  water. The system may be simplified considerably for smaller  reservoirs with a less complicated hydrological conditions while  maintaining the principal analysis premises.

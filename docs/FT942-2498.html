			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Travel: A cold night with a camel - Mark Hodson sleeps under the stars in north-west India Our drivers insisted that the opium was for medicinal purposes. The two men were squatting round a camp fire built out of dried camel dung. Darkness was falling over the desert and the cold night closing in. One man crumbled off part of a block of unrefined opium, placed it on his tongue and slurped it down with tea. 'Just to keep me warm for sleeping,' he said. It was getting chilly. At midday, the Thar desert in north-western India can feel like the hottest place on earth. But half-an-hour after the sun set, turning the sky ruby and gold, we were pulling on sweaters and huddling round the flames. A friend and I had hired camels and drivers from a local village chief and we rode for three days while our brains were cooked and our kidneys ground to a pulp by the constant rocking motion. The drivers were Rajput men from small villages dotted near the border with Pakistan. Under bright turbans their skin was dark and their eyes bright. They wore patterned slippers and handlebar moustaches and when they grinned they revealed rows of gleaming teeth. One kept us entertained by singing and chatting incessantly; the other, assigned to me, did not utter a word in three days. Around the camp fire the talkative driver, named Isra, banged out rhythms on an empty plastic water bottle as his friend prepared dinner. There was vegetable masala, dahl and unleavened bread baked in sand beneath the fire. The camels rested nearby, neither sleeping nor lying down, just kneeling in the sand, their front legs tethered. We opened a bottle of hooch bought in one of the villages. It was a kind of murky rum made from sugar cane and oranges and was surprisingly drinkable. When he had eaten, Isra told us some tall stories about gypsy curses and an imprisoned princess. Then he wiped the plates clean in sand and started to make his own supper - both drivers refused any food until the drink was finished. They made up our beds on the dunes - three thick blankets each - and tucked us in. We lay fully-clothed, watching the shooting stars until sleep took us off to dream of lesser things. The cold woke us in time to see the sun rise, and then we heard of the night's drama. One of the camels had chewed through its tether and made a run for it. Isra, who had to jog for an hour before catching it, laughed as he told the story. The camel, now chewing nonchalantly on its breakfast and with fresh rope around its ankles, looked unabashed. The incident might have ended there except that it seemed to inspire a new spirit of rebellion in the other camel, which decided that it had had enough of me. From the start it had been temperamental, the drivers explaining that it was just seven years old and not yet fully broken in. But now it was snorting angrily, and when my driver tugged a little too hard on its reins it turned and spat the fetid green remains of breakfast over its owner's white shirt. The politics of human-camel relations dictate that when the animal spits, negotiations have reached a temporary halt, and we waited a few minutes for it to calm down. Then the driver tried, ever so gently, to coax and cajole it into action, clucking and blowing kisses as if trying to persuade a kitten to come down from a tree. The beast relented, and two hours later we arrived at a group of homesteads where half-a-dozen men were squatting in the sun beside a field of millet. They looked up with opium eyes, the same smiling nonchalant gaze that the camels gave us from beneath their long curling lashes. The men were swallowing opium with tea from white china cups and saucers. 'It is just to stop them feeling the heat,' Isra assured us. Another man appeared from a mud hut carrying his young son. The boy's back was pitted with infected bites. We had no antibiotics, so we handed over a bar of Lux soap for which the father grasped our hands in silent gratitude. My driver's silence, which at first had confounded me, now seemed ideal. As we ambled through the stark landscape, the only sounds came from the creak of the leather saddle and the camel farting and panting. Occasionally we would hear goat bells but otherwise the desert was quiet. In a country as loud as India, this seemed to us almost magical. I was even warming to the camel, whose ungainly appearance - all teeth, neck and knees - had at first put me in mind of a friendly Spielberg monster. Camels can hardly be called intelligent, but their languid gait and the dainty way they pick their way over the sand can pass for elegance. There is no escaping one fact, though: of God's many wonderful creations, they are surely among the most flatulent. At the next village we arranged to buy a chicken from a man who then ran off with our money, promising to deliver the chicken later. We rode for another hour, passing wild peacocks and a herd of gazelle and two girls, their faces covered with bright veils; on their heads were huge water jugs. As buzzards circled overhead, Isra chatted with an old woman herding goats some 20 yards from us. We set up camp on virgin dunes and drank milky cardamon tea as we waited for the chicken man. It was an hour after dark before he arrived with the bird, which was taken behind a cactus and discreetly strangled. The delivery man declared it too late to walk home and invited himself to dinner - a chicken and vegetable curry - before curling up to sleep beside the embers of the fire. If he had felt inclined he could easily have found his way back, for these men know every inch of the desert. On moonless nights such as this, lone camel drivers cross the Pakistani border. They smuggle out silver and bottles of rum, and return with opium and gold. Across India, gold is highly prized and forms the core of every rich girl's dowry. But something strange happened in the history of these remote villages, where the man's family must now supply the dowry. When times are hard, young men may roam the desert for years with only their camel for company, trying to save enough money to tempt a worthy bride. Isra was lucky. Married young, he was now 35 - though he looked 10 years older - with five children. He works for half the year, taking occasional tourists on treks, and in the hot season, when daytime temperatures regularly top 45`C, he stays home to 'make more babies.' On the final day we arrived at a straw shack where a young couple lived with their two small children. In their tiny fenced-off yard were all their possessions: a stove, some rusted tins, plates and cups, one goat. They sat us down, made tea and offered us cigarettes, asking for nothing in return. I gave the man a postcard of London, one of a pile I had taken with me to India, and told him it was a picture of my home town. He stared at it for a while, turning it over in his black creased hands before handing it to his daughter. The girl, who was about four years old, with cropped hair and a snotty nose, looked at it blankly and then walked away, clutching it to her torn T-shirt. As we left, I wondered what they would do with the postcard - pin it to a wall, throw it away, try to sell it - and imagined, in my arrogance, that it might play a small part in that girl's life. Would she wonder about the place that lay beyond the edge of the desert? Would it make her want to go there? In such small ways are lives changed.</p>

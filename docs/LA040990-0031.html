			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : DAVE EDMUNDS' REVUE A SMOKING COMBINATION  </P> <P> Whatever the questionable ethics of a rock show taking place under the glaring  banners of a tobacco company, "Dave Edmunds' Rock &amp; Roll Revue" was  certainly smoking at the Universal Amphitheatre on Friday. The unlikely  grouping of Edmunds, Graham Parker, Dion and the Fabulous Thunderbirds' Kim  Wilson was a salute to the multi-act bills common in the '50s, and by show's  end the combination seemed nothing less than inspired.  </P> <P> Pumped by a nine-piece band -- with Stax guitar legend Steve Cropper playing  with a marvelous incandescence throughout -- the singers worked at their peaks.  Wilson sank his powerful, emotive voice deep into the soul ballad "Wasted  Tears." Parker and Dion each worked the far ends of their catalogues, with an  upbeat Parker reaching back to '76 for "Heat Treatment." Dion drew from his  recent "Yo, Frankie" album and his '50s classics and teamed with Parker and  Edmunds for a disarmingly moving reinterpretation of "Abraham, Martin and  John."  </P> <P> Edmunds more than made up for his moribund shows of recent years with his  charged vocals and snarling guitar work on the hook-crammed "King of Love" and  "Paralyzed."JIM WASHBURN  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The order changes recommended in this decision will require the market administrator of each order to carry out a more comprehensive review and analysis of the data than is required currently. As noted at the hearing, the pooling process will become somewhat more complicated because data submitted will involve not only skim and butterfat pounds, but also pounds of protein and other solids. Thus, it is appropriate to allow the market administrator for the Upper Midwest Order a period of 3 days to compute and announce the producer price differential and the statistical uniform price. By changing the due date for handler reports from the 10th to the 8th, but retaining the 11th as the day the producer price differential and statistical uniform price are to be announced, the pooling process will be better accommodated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of allocation of producer receipts the assumption will be made that the protein and other solids cannot easily be separated from skim milk. The protein and other solids will therefore be allocated proportionately with the skim milk based on the percentage of protein and other solids in the skim milk received from producers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The implementation of this multiple component pricing decision will require several changes in the way handlers pay for milk. Partial payment at the Class III price for the previous month for milk deliveries during the first 15 days of a month was proposed by both NAJ and CMPC. Although no objections to the proposal were expressed, there was no testimony supporting or opposing the proposal. Therefore, there is no basis in the record of the proceeding to make substantive changes in the payment provisions of the orders that provide for partial payments at a significantly different level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the Nebraska-Western Iowa order, the Upper Midwest order, and the Iowa order require partial payments to be based on the prior month's uniform price. Since this component pricing plan does not contain a uniform price, these three orders will be changed to require the partial payments to be made at the ``statistical uniform price'', announced by the market administrator on or before the 14th day of the month for which partial payment is to be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Chicago Regional order will also be changed from the current requirement that the partial payment be based on the lowest class price for the prior month to a partial payment based on the prior month's Class III price. The Eastern South Dakota order does not need to be changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final payment to producers will be determined by the total hundredweight of milk times the producer price differential adjusted by the applicable location adjustment, plus or minus the total hundredweight of milk times the adjustment for somatic cells, plus the pounds of protein times the protein price, plus the pounds of other solids times the other solids price, plus the pounds of butterfat times the butterfat price, minus any authorized deductions currently allowed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Handlers purchasing milk from cooperative pool plants will pay for Class I milk at the Class I differential price plus the pounds of skim milk in Class I at the skim milk price plus the pounds of butterfat at the butterfat price; for Class II milk at the Class II differential price plus the pounds of protein at the protein price, plus the pounds of other solids at the other solids price, plus the pounds of butterfat at the butterfat price; and for Class III milk at the protein pounds times the protein price, plus the pounds of other solids at the other solids price, plus the pounds of butterfat at the butterfat price. All milk purchased will be adjusted by the appropriate somatic cell adjustment. Payment for 9(c) milk will be based on the producer price differential adjusted for location at the plant of receipt and somatic cells, plus the value of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since producers will be receiving payments based on the component levels of their milk, the payroll reports that handlers supply to producers must reflect the basis for such payment. Therefore the handler will be required to supply the producer not only with the information currently supplied, but also: (a) The pounds of butterfat, the pounds of protein, and the pounds of other solids contained in the producer's milk, as well as the producer's average somatic cell count, and (b) the minimum rate that is required for payment for each component and, if a different rate is paid, the effective rate also. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The handler's value of milk will be determined by combining: (a) The pounds of producer milk in Class I times the Class I differential price, (b) the pounds of producer milk in Class II times the Class II differential price, (c) the value of overage, (d) the value of inventory reclassification, (e) the value, at the Class I minus Class III price difference, of other source receipts and receipts from unregulated supply plants allocated to Class I, (g) the value of handler location adjustments, (h) Class III&hyph;A credits, (i) the pounds of skim milk in Class I times the skim milk price, (j) the pounds of protein in Class II and Class III times the protein price, and (k) the pounds of other solids in Class II and Class III times the other solids price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

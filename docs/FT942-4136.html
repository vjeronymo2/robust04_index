			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Companies in Japan see rise in confidence Japanese business confidence improved in May for the first time in five years and is set to brighten further in the coming months, the Bank of Japan said yesterday. The index of manufacturers' sentiment in the bank's Tankan quarterly survey, Japan's most authoritative barometer of the short term economic outlook, rose to -50 in May, from -56 in the previous review in February. Service industries' prospects improved from -47 to -46 over the same period. The index shows the percentage balance between those reporting good and bad conditions. However, the survey indicated that the outlook for recovery was only moderate, triggering a slight decline in the Nikkei index, down by 7.60 points on the day, to 21,395.18, so breaking a spectacular three-day rise. 'We see a bumpy road ahead,' warned Mr Kagehide Kaku, director of the BOJ's research and statistics department. 'The economy is turning round, but the level is still low . . . there is still a large difference between supply and demand,' said Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute. However, yesterday's Tankan was good enough to reduce the likelihood of a drop in the official discount rate, said equity analysts. It will instead reinforce the bank's eagerness to avoid allowing another liquidity driven rise in asset prices like the one that preceded the recession. The survey, of just over 10,000 companies, shows that corporate confidence has merely recovered to nearly the same level as May last year, though it forecasts a further improvement to -42 in September. The result was, unusually, in line with what companies forecast three months ago, rather than below expectations, suggesting that corporate Japan has scaled back hopes in line with economic reality. Encouraging signs include a reduction in inventories of unsold goods held by both producers and wholesalers, thanks to production cuts and a modest recovery in demand. The gap between excess supply and weak demand has narrowed, but prices are still weak, said the bank. The balance of companies reporting excess supply fell to from 55, in the previous survey, to 50. The balance of companies with too many workers fell from 28 to 26 over the same period, a sign of progress in cutting costs. Yet this is still high enough to show that larger job cuts are on the way, said Mr Jim Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. Manufacturers believe turnover will stagnate this year, according to the survey, but that pre-tax profits will rise by 14.9 per cent, thanks to lower raw materials and fixed costs. Service industries forecast a 5.0 per cent profits fall on a small decline in sales. One consequence of the continued excess capacity highlighted in the survey is that companies, overall, plan to reduce fixed investments for the third year running, by 3.7 per cent and 6.3 per cent for manufacturers. This conflicts with a recent Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey showing a rise in capital investment this year. A rising balance of companies, 17 as against 14 in the previous Tankan, reported that banks are being accommodative over lending money, so reducing fears of a credit squeeze. A rising proportion reported that financial conditions were tight, which the bank said mirrors the rise in long term lending rates.</p>

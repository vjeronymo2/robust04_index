			<p>BFN     [Text] Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius will  announce his government's resignation at a session of the Seimas  (republican parliament) next week, he said in the answer to an  Interfax question at a news conference in Vilnius Thursday.    This procedure is defined by the Lithuanian Constitution.  Under it, the parliament is to confirm the government's powers  if more than a half of its composition has been reshuffled.  Otherwise, the government must resign.    This situation emerged following the need to introduce three  new ministers whose offices would be set up in accordance with a  law on government passed by the Seimas.    If Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas asks Slezevicius  to form a new government again, the present composition will  remain as it is and only the three new ministers will be added.  Slezevicius is the chairman of the majority Democratic Labor  Party in the parliament.    This government which has been in power for less than 1.5  years is the sixth since Lithuania regained independence in  March 1990. Over this period, Lithuania has achieved a number of  positive changes such as stabilizing the economy, lower  inflation and higher standard of living.</p>

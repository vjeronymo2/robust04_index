			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A VIGIL IN THE FOREST;  </P> <P> LOS PADRE'S FIRE SPOTTERS MAY FALL VICTIM TO BUDGET  </P> <P> Tom Fusek is one of a dying breed.  </P> <P> From his perch 8,013 feet above sea level -- a tower near the border of Kern  and Ventura counties -- Fusek keeps watch over the rugged ridges of Los Padres  National Forest, scanning the horizon every few minutes, ready to radio  firefighters at the first puffs of smoke.  </P> <P> On a clear day, Fusek's 360-degree view includes the Sierra Nevada foothills,  Bakersfield, Palmdale, the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles and even  Catalina Island. One time, he insists, he saw ships rounding San Pedro -- more  than 85 miles away.  </P> <P> But this summer could be Fusek's last season as a professional fire lookout.  </P> <P> Although still widely used in remote parts of Northern California, the lookouts  have become an endangered species in the state and national forests of Southern  California, phased out by budget cuts, technology, urban sprawl and smog.  </P> <P> "They're getting few and far between," said Don Trammell, district recreation  officer at Los Padres.  </P> <P> Once the backbone of the U.S. Forest Service's fire-fighting network from Kern  County to the Mexican border, lookout towers have been on the decline in  Southern California for more than 20 years. The last towers in the Angeles  National Forest, which covers more than 600,000 acres of Los Angeles County,  were closed about eight years ago.  </P> <P> Lookouts watch over Los Padres from only three of the area's seven remaining  towers -- Fusek's 54-year-old wooden tower at Frazier Mountain, about seven  miles west of Gorman, and two others near Big Sur.  </P> <P> The Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County still operates two of its  seven towers and the San Bernardino National Forest, using volunteers, keeps  three towers open. A fourth tower in San Bernardino was reopened a few weeks  ago -- with a paid lookout -- to stand guard over the forest during the hot,  dry days of September.  </P> <P> Of 65 lookout towers operated by the California Department of Forestry and Fire  Protection, none is located in the 11 southernmost counties of the state.  </P> <P> "The wildlands are getting crowded," explained Karen Terrill, a department  spokeswoman. "And when you've got a subdivision next door there's really no  need for a lookout."  </P> <P> Many fires are first seen by commercial and private pilots, forest officials  said. In recent years, motorists have begun reporting fires by car phone.  </P> <P> It costs up to $10,000 a year to operate the Frazier Mountain tower, and forest  officials said financial considerations may force them to close the lookout  after this fire season.  </P> <P> Fusek conceded that, on some occasions, he has sounded alarms only to be told  some camper or pilot reported the flames first. Even so, the Frazier Mountain  tower and its commanding view can still mean the difference between a small  fire and a devastating blaze, said Jim Smith, a fire management officer in Los  Padres.  </P> <P> For Fusek, the tower is a serene retreat from city life. A tall and lanky  native of North Hollywood who grew sick of traffic, smog and urban blight,  Fusek turned his back on the city after graduating from Cal State Los Angeles  with a geography degree in 1975.  </P> <P> He worked as a welder, a laborer and a fire lookout in Sequoia National Forest  before coming to Frazier Mountain in 1985. He lives in the tower's  64-square-foot room five days a week, on watch from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., before  returning for two days of rest at his home in Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "I'm at peace with the world when coming down after five days," he said. "I  feel more lonely in the big city. There's a difference between loneliness and  solitude."  </P> <P> At Frazier Mountain, the solitude is broken occasionally by a stray hunter or  hiker. The hunters, Fusek said wearily, always ask the same questions: Have you  seen any deer? Where are the deer? Have you seen any bucks?  </P> <P> Yes, he tells them. And that's part of the mountain's appeal. There are deer,  coyotes, birds and, always, that inspiring view.  </P> <P> The tower itself is rather shabby. A boxy wooden structure with peeling Army  green paint, the tower was built in 1936 at Camuesa Peak in Santa Barbara  County and then relocated after a forest fire destroyed the Frazier Mountain  tower in 1952.  </P> <P> It is equipped with a small bunk, a television set, a stove, and a contraption  called the Osborne fire finder, the device Fusek uses to plot the coordinates  of a fire. Taped to the side of the fire finder is a Far Side cartoon of a  lookout, burned to a crisp, surrounded by untouched forest.  </P> <P> Tucked behind the bunk is a small insulated stool Fusek stands on during  electrical storms for protection. The closest lightning strike he ever saw hit  a nearby electrical transformer.  </P> <P> Fusek is supposed to scan the mountains every 15 minutes. But in reality he is  always on guard and, while chatting with visitors recently, now and then  shifted his eyes away to the horizon.  </P> <P> The worst blaze in Fusek's career at Frazier Mountain was the Fishbowls Fire of  1987, named for a campground several miles to the south. It was 11:50 a.m.,  Fusek said, when he casually glanced up and saw a blue-black plume.  </P> <P> After reporting the fire, his work done, all Fusek could do was watch as 5,000  acres were charred. "It's kind of a helpless feeling for me," he said.  </P> <P> There's more to being a lookout than watching the horizon, he said. One must  recognize the slight gradations of color and movement which distinguish a fire  from dust devils or steam rising from a wet road warmed by the sun.  </P> <P> During a recent visit, Smith reminded Fusek of smoke he reported seeing several  days earlier. A helicopter flew over the sight and the spotter decided it was  only steam.  </P> <P> But two days later, a fire broke out in the exact spot, Smith said. The blaze  had been smoldering. Fusek had been right after all. He nodded slightly with  satisfaction.  </P> <P> Fusek admitted later that he has mixed feelings about reporting fires. "To  prove yourself, you want to see a smoke," he said. "But you don't want to see a  big smoke."  </P></p>

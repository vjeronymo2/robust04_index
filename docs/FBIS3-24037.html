Dubovoy: place and date not  given: "Poor-Quality Justice Costing the Government Dearly"]    [Text] The process involved in establishment of the  democratic state of Moldova is inconceivable without  reorganization and perfection of the entire judicial and legal  system. Over the past several years a concept for legal reform  was worked out in the republic, and enforceable enactments were  adopted regulating the transformation processes. The  achievements as well as difficulties that have been encountered  were discussed with our correspondent by Alexei Barbaneagra,  minister of justice of the republic of Moldova.    [Dubovoy] Mister Minister, the draft of a concept for  judicial reform in the republic of Moldova was prepared by the  Ministry of Justice, and you personally were one of its  creators. A draft law on judicial and legal reform was likewise  prepared and submitted to parliament for review, but there are  still no results. What is the reason for that?    [Barbaneagra] The situation is indeed the way you described  it. I am not clear as to the reasons why the draft law on legal  reform in the republic of Moldova was not reviewed by the old  parliament. I believe that the new parliament, realizing the  importance attached to the resolution of this question, will  include it in its agenda.    After all, in our opinion legal reform must serve to  guarantee statehood and democracy and the successful advance of  economic transformations, because of which its earliest possible  adoption is necessary.    Thus far republic legal organs continue performing their  functions relying on laws which, unfortunately, have nothing but  a negative effect on the results of our activity.    [Dubovoy] Another year has passed. What was it like for the  judicial organs of the republic and the Ministry of Justice as a  whole?    [Barbaneagra] Over the past year work at the ministry was  aimed at the elaboration of draft laws and enforceable  enactments, submission of conclusions regarding new laws,  systematization of legislation, and the provision of Moldovan  citizens with necessary legal information.    Last year alone personnel of the ministry prepared and  provided conclusions on 1,160 draft enforceable enactments.  Judicial activity deserves particular attention. Last year the  courts handled 12,005 criminal cases, which is 852 cases more  than in 1992, along with some 30,368 civil cases. Practically  all of them were reviewed. So far, however, we are not satisfied  with the activity of rayon and city district courts as there are  frequent cases of delays in the review of cases which leaves  something to be desired with respect to the case review process  itself.    That is why, for the purpose of improving the skill levels  of  judges the ministry organized probationary training at the  Supreme Court in 1993 for 75 young jurists while more than 80  judges underwent professional re-certification.    Unfortunately judges themselves commit violations of the  law,  because of which 12 judges as well as 18 bailiffs were punished  last year for various infractions.    The physical plant at the courts needs strengthening, it is  necessary to provide them with technical means. Computers, Xerox  machines, and other modern technical facilities--all that so far  is only a dream for us.    [Dubovoy] Alexei Afanasyevich. You stated that the judges  also break the law. In this connection how is the law on  languages being enforced by court personnel?    [Barbaneagra] We are monitoring its enforcement and I am  pleased to note that by comparison with 1989, when not a single  sentence was passed in the state language or a ruling given,  last year the majority of sentences (in 63 percent of the  criminal and 52.2 percent of civil cases) were passed in the  courts of Moldova in the Romanian language. That, in turn, means  that judges are making their contribution to the consolidation  of the law on languages.    [Dubovoy] Recently the Ministry of Justice of the republic  of  Moldova established close ties with international legal organs,  institutes, and the like. Which of the contacts are clearly  promoting the expansion of links between jurists of Moldova and  those of other countries while strengthening legal organs in the  republic. What are some of the initial results of such  collaboration?    [Barbaneagra] There is no doubt that we need such contacts  not only for the exchange of views, but also for close  cooperation with international legal organizations which are  manifesting lively interest in all that is taking place within  the republic of Moldova and are helping us with the elaboration  of enforceable enactments, conducting expert reviews of laws  that have already been adopted, and promoting the integration of  our state in the world legal community. Close ties with  representatives of the European Community, the CSCE Mission, the  European Council, the Association of American Lawyers, the For  Democracy Fund, and with others were established.    Our jurists participated in the work of international  symposiums and conferences on legal issues. On more than one  occasion we received invitations from various international  organizations for us to study judicial systems functioning in  different countries.    Recently personnel from our ministry visited Germany, Italy,  and Switzerland where they studied the operation of law  enforcement organs. Experts from international organizations  favored the extension of aid to specialists of Moldova in the  area of law, and the problem concerning training and retraining  of our personnel is being resolved along with the one pertaining  to the provision of courts of the republic with necessary  technical means. We are striving to expand the sphere of such  contacts and to create all possible premises for fruitful  collaboration with jurists in foreign countries to the benefit  of our republic.    [Dubovoy] An important place in the work of the Ministry of  Justice is occupied by the preparation and conclusion of  international agreements on legal aid and legal relations in the  area of civil, criminal and family law. A few words about how  this area of jurisprudence is faring.    [Barbaneagra] The elaboration of such agreements is a  complicated and a laborious matter. As of today Moldova has  signed agreements on legal aid and legal relations in the area  of civil, criminal, and family law with Russia, Ukraine, Latvia,  and Lithuania. In the very near future such agreements will be  concluded with Georgia and Azerbaijan, as well as other  republics of the former USSR.    As far as legal aid for the population is concerned, as a  result of a significant rise in the cost of legal services of  jurists, the citizens of Moldova are reverting to their services  much less frequently which, for understandable reasons, cannot  help but alert us since that, I am assuming, is also a matter of  state policy.    [Dubovoy] What else is of concern to the minister of  justice?    [Barbaneagra] A rise in the crime rate, a certain  pathological lack of respect for existing laws is disturbing.  Democratic transformations in the republic are being hindered by  delays in the adoption of judicial and legal reforms. The  imperfect nature of the legislation and in certain cases its  absence, makes it impossible to resolve many vitally important  problems of society. One would like to believe that many of  today's problems will be resolved and democratic transformations  in the Republic of Moldova will acquire a firm legal basis.    [Dubovoy] Thank you.</p>

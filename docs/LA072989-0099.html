			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ECONOMY;  </P> <P> PERSONAL INCOME EDGES UP 0.3% IN JUNE  </P> <P> Personal income rose a lackluster 0.3% in June as consumer spending, after  adjusting for inflation, declined for a second straight month, the government  said Friday in a report that renewed recession fears.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said consumer spending, after taking inflation into  account, edged down 0.1% in June following a 0.2% May decline. It marked the  first back-to-back monthly declines in spending since September and October,  1987, a period when consumer confidence was shaken by the stock market crash.  </P> <P> Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity,  has been the driving force behind the record peacetime expansion, now in its  seventh year. But economists are fearful that consumers, worried about their  economic prospects, could begin to cut back sharply on their purchases.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department report said personal income grew a modest 0.3% in June  following an even smaller 0.2% May increase. The gains were the weakest this  year and reflected in part a slowdown in job growth, which has sent the  unemployment rate edging upward.  </P> <P> "The economy, here at midyear, is beginning to flirt with a recession," said  Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. "We are seeing consumers'  spending power being squeezed by higher inflation at the same time that pent-up  demand for big-ticket items is pretty much exhausted."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Predicts Rebound  </P> <P> The government reported Thursday that the overall economy, as measured by the  gross national product, expanded at a sluggish annual rate of 1.7% in the  April-June quarter, the slowest pace in almost three years.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration insists that growth will rebound in the second half of  the year, fueled by lower interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve.  </P> <P> But Sinai said he believes that the sluggish growth will intensify, leading to  rising unemployment in coming months and further weakening consumer confidence.  He predicted that the economy would enter a mild recession either late this  year or early in 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Further Easing'  </P> <P> David Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., said he felt  that the country would be able to skirt through this period of sluggish growth  without a full-fledged downturn, helped in large part by further moves by the  Fed to lower interest rates.  </P> <P> The central bank earlier this week acted for the third time since June to ease  credit. Jones said the rapid pacing of these interest-lowering moves  demonstrated how worried the Fed is about a possible recession.  </P> <P> "The Fed is concerned that some interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy,  such as autos and housing, are still quite weak," Jones said. "This will lead  to further easing on the Fed's part in August."  </P> <P> Before adjusting for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged at an annual  rate of $3.44 trillion in June following a modest 0.3% increase in May.  </P> <P> The key income category of wages and salaries was up 0.5% in June but this was  in part a bounce back after wage income was essentially unchanged in May.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BO IV' TO PLAY IN LOYOLA GYM;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: A SUMMER OF INTENSIVE REHABILITATION HAS KIMBLE READY FOR A  FINAL SEASON. HIS AIM: IMPRESS NBA SCOUTS AND SPARK THE LIONS' HIGH-POWERED  ATTACK.  </P> <P> Like a fictional Philadelphia predecessor -- Rocky -- Bo Kimble returned to his  roots this summer and virtually lived in an inner-city gym, preparing for the  biggest challenge of his career -- a comeback after an injury.  </P> <P> In the first installment of "Bo," the cocky kid from Philly came West with his  high school buddy, Hank Gathers, averaged more than 12 points for USC and made  the Pacific 10 all-freshman team.  </P> <P> But there was no happy ending. Kimble and Gathers left USC when it hired Coach  George Raveling, transferring to Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> "Bo II" got off to a slow start but had a finish worthy of Sylvester Stallone.  After missing much of the first month with a broken kneecap, Kimble came back  and helped the Lions win 28 games, go undefeated in the West Coast Athletic  Conference, upset Wyoming in the NCAA tournament and crack the top 20. Kimble  led the WCAC in scoring in conference games, with 32 and 36 points in the two  showdowns with rival Pepperdine.  </P> <P> But "Bo III" found Kimble up against more adversity, with no one to slap some  sense into him. Kimble slacked off on his knee exercises, and when practice  began last fall, the joint became even more tender.  </P> <P> After hobbling through a few games, Kimble underwent arthroscopic surgery and  missed 13 games. Even though he came back and averaged nearly 17 points -- he  scored 40 against Gonzaga -- he clearly favored the leg and was rarely as  dominant as he had been. In the season finale he made only seven of 23 shots as  Arkansas ousted the Lions from the NCAA tournament in the first round.  </P> <P> This was a story that begged for one more sequel. So, in this corner, at  6-foot-5, weighing 190 pounds, wearing the white trunks with the crimson and  Columbia blue trim -- it's "Bo IV."  </P> <P> Older, wiser and uninjured for perhaps the first time with Loyola, Kimble has  already scripted its finish in his mind.  </P> <P> "I know we're gonna have a great season," he said. "I'm thankful I got another  shot to come back. A lot of guys get hurt, they don't . . . get another chance.  </P> <P> "We have a lot to prove this year. There will be some shockers (upsets) this  year. Now my main focus is for Loyola to win games. I hope to (get drafted) in  the first round. I'm close enough now. If I put together a good year I  shouldn't have a hard time making (the NBA). Eventually I will be playing in  the NBA. My future is very promising. In Philly, they've seen I've been working  on my game. Bo's back -- everyone knows Bo's back."  </P> <P> The comeback trail starts with a heavyweight opponent Wednesday, an  opening-round game in the Preseason National Invitation Tournament at Nevada  Las Vegas. It's a matchup of the two most prolific scoring programs in NCAA  history.  </P> <P> "We want Vegas because they run like us," Kimble said. "I'm excited. Let's see  who runs the most."  </P> <P> In scrimmages and last week's exhibition against the Australian national team,  a multifaceted Kimble has been on display -- not only showing his trademark  high-arching shots from three-point range, but driving inside with authority,  rebounding and passing.  </P> <P> Even more impressive, perhaps, is Kimble's new maturity and serious approach.  Never considered a wallflower, the engaging Kimble described his summer of  discontent.  </P> <P> "I made 500 to 1,000 jump shots every day, three-pointers only. I lifted  weights on my knee. I did upper-body workouts. I hung out at the 12th Street  Gym (in Philadelphia). I was there four to five hours every day unless I had a  game. I was focused. I didn't want to do anything (else). I was a boring  person. People didn't know what came over me."  </P> <P> "Bo did everything he was supposed to this summer; you couldn't ask anything  more," Loyola trainer Chip Schaefer said. "He worked hard. I'm seeing a Bo  Kimble I haven't seen, functioning at a higher level than I've ever seen."  </P> <P> Lion Coach Paul Westhead said: "I can't remember in the last two years seeing  Bo at practice Monday, working on something Tuesday and seeing it better on  Thursday. He's either been injured and out or rehabilitating. Because of  injury, he's always been trying to do his best, knowing he's not fully healthy.  It becomes a situation where you kind of pick and choose, out of fear of  reinjury. He's now back to his more natural approach to the game."  </P> <P> It's not as if Kimble's game has been weak. After teaming with Gathers to win  two Philadelphia city championships at Dobbins Tech, he came to California and  has averaged 16.9 points in three collegiate seasons -- 19.9 at Loyola --  without ever having started more than 18 games. He goes into the season with  1,219 points and has made 107 three-pointers in two seasons at Loyola.  </P> <P> But there's more, says Kimble, more even than Westhead knows.  </P> <P> Kimble led Philadelphia's prestigious Sonny Hill Summer League in scoring this  year, eclipsing consensus All-American Lionel Simmons of LaSalle among others.  He returned to Loyola determined to show an all-around pro-style game, not just  score. If he's drawing defenses, he helps create openings for Jeff Fryer, the  team's other three-point specialist, and Gathers, who gets his points inside.  In one game last season, the trio combined for 106 points.  </P> <P> "Despite his reputation for being a shooter with no conscience, that's not  close to the truth," Westhead said. "He loves to shoot, but he sees things and  makes timely passes. He has that knack. He's not saying, 'I have to get my  shots.' We all recognize he's a very good offensive player.  </P> <P> "We've had a number of ongoing talks . . . about things we need from him -- a  timely amount of rebounds. There's no need to talk about the rainbow jump  shots. An area (where) he can have great impact for us and himself is to show  consistency on the defensive end. In practice, it's the best I've seen him at  both ends. I think some of (his maturity) might be the result of the injury.  He's seen things from a stop position. That may be one of the only pluses."  </P> <P> Kimble said that sitting had indeed been educational.  </P> <P> "It seems like I've been in school longer than I have," he said. "I really  learned a lot sitting on the sideline. I've seen if I could drive, it would  make it better for everyone.  </P> <P> "When I am penetrating to the basket, I'm at my best. The reason I have not  been driving in the past was, I was hurt. Now I'm able to finish off the play.  I make the defense think about me, and that gets Fryer and Hank more shots.  </P> <P> "Everyone's thinking 'Hank, Hank, Hank,' and he deserved it after the year he  had. Now it's time for me to show what I can really do. L.A. and the scouts  will get a chance to see Hank and me at the top of our games. I don't think I  can be stopped. The only person who knows how much more I can give is Hank.  Maybe Coach Westhead has a clue."  </P> <P> Gathers said: "I know nobody has seen Bo at full strength. There's gonna be  some surprises for teams that think they can double- or triple-team me. He's  gonna kill 'em.  </P> <P> "He has a barrage of moves down low. He's actually passing the ball more. Since  ninth grade, I've been on Bo's back to pass more -- he draws defenses. Bo's  gonna do his thing. I've just got to go to the glass. That's what I do anyway."  </P> <P> Fryer concurred.  </P> <P> "(Bo) helps me," he said. "That's one more guy (defenses) have to concentrate  on. That gets me more open shots. He complements my game and I complement his.  There's no fight to get more shots. I'm not worried about being overshadowed. I  want to win games. He makes us a lot better, being 100%."  </P> <P> Kimble said: "I want to get a lot of assists. I'll know when it's time to turn  it on. I think I can score every time I touch the ball. I could be selfish, but  I want it to be fun for all the guys. I want the burden of leadership to fall  on me. If we win games, everything else will take place for my career."  </P> <P> Said Westhead: "His game is nearing its high level everyone expected. The thing  I think he may need is a handful of games. What you have seen of Bo has been,  perhaps, a shadow."  </P> <P> But that's a different movie.  </P></p>

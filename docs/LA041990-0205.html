			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> Open for Business: After two years of delays, Laguna Bank finally received the  last installment on $1.6 million in new capital on April 6. That afternoon, the  rumors started flying.  </P> <P> "We must have had 40 phone calls in the last two weeks asking us whether we've  been closed or sold or whether we were closing our branch and moving to Laguna  Hills," said Donald R. Narup, the bank's president.  </P> <P> Fortunately for the bank, there was no run on deposits, Narup said.  </P> <P> The rumors, believed to be spread by disgruntled former employees, aren't true,  he said. The bank, which has struggled financially for the last few years to  overcome losses caused by bad loans, is starting anew with more capital than  regulators require.  </P></p>

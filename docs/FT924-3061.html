			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Lots of good shots for media FACES blackened, automatic weapons stowed in waterproof kit bags, crack US commandos stormed into Somalia early today and quickly overcame their first major hurdle - reporters and cameramen. Scores of newsmen, tipped off by the US Defence Department where to be and when, lay in waiting when the first Navy special forces or Seals came ashore in motorised kayaks. Since the operation had first been disclosed, there had been fears Somalia's rag-tag militias might attack the troops as they came ashore. It didn't happen. The Seals waded ashore in full view of the American television networks, several of whom screened the event live during prime ratings time. At times, the landing bordered on the farcical. 'Excuse me, you've dropped your watch,' a reporter called after a burly commando as he headed off down the darkened beach to dig a foxhole and lie in wait. The commando did not have to wait very long for something to happen. Soon, about 50 reporters gathered around him with portable television arc lights laying bare his supposedly concealed position. He said nothing. He didn't answer questions. He just squatted in his foxhole and tried not to look embarrassed. Similar scenes were repeated up and down Mogadishu beach as reporters and cameramen sought out others in a vanguard force of 1,800 US marines landing before dawn. It was one of the worst-kept secrets in military history. The US defence department tipped off reporters in Washington that it would take place at the port and airport early today. Shortly before midnight, hordes of journalists converged on the two installations, some stiffened with a little liquor against the possibility of a suicide attack by gunmen. They didn't have to wait very long at Mogadishu's so-called international airport, which is adjacent to the beach. In a sign of the military's concern that the media attention could be disrupting operations, the Pentagon rushed out an advisory after the initial landing, appealing for journalists and cameramen to stay off Mogadishu's beaches. A CBS television spokesman said they also had got a request from the Pentagon not to use camera lights because it was interfering with the troops' night vision equipment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Vasiliy Belchenko, assistant </F> commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the Transcausasus,  by correspondent Vladimir Sarishvili in Tbilisi; date not given:  "They Came for the Sake of Peace"]    [Text] Tbilisi -- To use the currently topical soccer  terminology, you could say that the winning attack of reason on  the once apparently impregnable bastions of the  Georgian-Abkhazian war is unfolding in a "breakaway attack."    The Russian battalions have embarked on a peacekeeping  action  in the conflict zone. Its progress and certain aspects of  Russian-Georgian military cooperation are the subject of your  TRUD correspondent's interview with Major General Vasiliy  Belchenko, assistant commander of the Group of Russian Forces in  the Transcausasus.    "Two battalions have been assigned from the Group of Russian  Forces in the Transcaucasus to carry out this mission," Vasiliy  Fedorovich says. "They will be deployed along the east bank of  the Inguri river, where seven checkpoints and the same number of  observation posts will be set up. Overall leadership of the  peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia will be exercised by Russian  Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev. The  mission, which is to be fulfilled by some 3,000 officers and  men, will involve not only disengagement, but also the  withdrawal and storage of heavy equipment and artillery and the  protection of facilities and main railroads and highways with a  view to safeguarding the passage of refugees and humanitarian  freight.    "Security guarantees have been given at the highest state  level. Railroad communication will be restored very soon, as  Vladislav Ardzinba has said. The bridge over the Inguri by  which the refugees will return will also begin to function in  the next few days. So everything is ready for the process to  begin."    [Sarishvili] Russia is taking on a grave and responsible  mission. What could hamper its implementation?    [Belchenko] For a long time it was impossible to find points  of contact for a reconciliation. We recognize the full  complexity of the role we have assumed. But the Georgian and  Abkhazian sides should also take a very responsible attitude to  the political settlement process. Unfortunately there have been  many examples of local resistance leading to the disruption of  peacekeeping efforts. But in this case there is the firm hope  that, on condition that there is support from the sides, the  action will achieve its goal and the war, which everyone is sick  and tired of, will become a thing of the past.    We wish wholeheartedly for this, because the road through  Abkhazia is a vital road for Russia too. The paralysis of  railroad communications is ruinous for all of us.    [Sarishvili] Let us concentrate on some of the details. It  was reported on television that total mine clearance is not  possible today. What is this -- a display of distrust?    [Belchenko] No, and again no. The point is that the troops  are tasked with going in within a very tight time scale.  Therefore mine clearance will take place first and foremost in  the sectors where checkpoints are to be established and people  are to be stationed. The rest of the territory will be cleared  later.    [Sarishvili] What reaction is envisaged in the event of  armed provocations?    [Belchenko] If a battalion carrying the peacekeeping flag  comes under fire, it will return fire for effect. Russia is  sending its soldiers not to be killed, but to help establish  peace.    [Sarishvili] And if Georgian-Abkhazian fighting flares up  again?    [Belchenko] We are under orders to suppress any seats of  fire, after a warning. But I do not think it will come to that,  since the heavy equipment and artillery is to be withdrawn to a  safe distance.    [Sarishvili] Have the peacekeepers had special training?    [Belchenko] At all events, they are not Spetsnaz  [special-purpose forces]. They are regular servicemen, only  rather better "welded together" and drilled.    [Sarishvili] How will disputes over houses unlawfully seized  by mercenaries in Abkhazia be resolved?    [Belchenko] That question is not within my competence. But  on the basis of the experience of the Tskhinvali region it can  be assumed that the work of restoring justice and sorting out  all the problems will be carried out by mixed commissions under  the protection of the peacekeeping forces.    [Sarishvili] Do you detect any signs of a thaw in  Georgian-Abkhazian relations?    [Belchenko] Judging by Shevardnadze's and Ardzinba's  remarks, there is a sense that contact is becoming a reality.  This is also perceptible in people's mood.    [Sarishvili] Vasiliy Fedorovich, the question of Russian  military bases in Georgia is also on the agenda. On what  principle will they operate?    [Belchenko] Most likely on the basis of compensation. For  instance, as we reduce the numerical strength of our units we  will hand over to Georgia the housing stock, which can be  regarded as a rent in exchange for the use of the territory.    [Sarishvili] A kind of military barter system?    [Belchenko] You could call it that. But the military camps  are just one possible illustration.    [Sarishvili] What do you see as the points of contact of  interests in military cooperation between Georgia and Russia?    [Belchenko] First and foremost, mutual membership of a  system of collective security, which gives us a basis for  mutually beneficial cooperation. Rather than each racking your  brains to invent the bicycle, it is better to make use of the  rich experience of the former Soviet Army. Talk of the  "enslavement" of Georgia and the "imperial ambitions" of Russia  seems to me to be idle or provocative. Colonel General Fedor  Reut, commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the  Transcausasus, invites both the Georgian head of state and the  defense minister to attend any of our measures.    It is in our interests to see Georgia a strong and  prosperous  state. Military cooperation will open up broad economic  prospects. Why lose, for instance, the Batumi uniform factory  with its trained personnel and production base? Why waste money  on transporting goods unnecessarily when everything is already  available? The same could be said of food and raw materials  bases.    In conclusion I would like to mention the thoughtful and  considered stance of head of state E. Shevardnadze. Today he  has chosen, I believe, the only correct path -- that of  rapprochement, which I am sure will be to everyone's benefit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "Half the Russian Government </F> Has Moved Temporarily to Washington"]    [Text] Washington -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin has arrived in Washington to sign agreements which  have already been prepared with the Americans, to try to smooth  over differences in other treaties where possible in one and one  half days of strenuous work, and to give personal encouragement  to the Russian soccer players before their next match.    But there is one more point in the program for his U.S.  visit. At breakfasts and lunches in a narrow circle to which the  press will not even be allowed to come close, the most informed  members of the U.S. Government will listen eagerly to the Moscow  guest's answers in the hope of learning what is actually  happening in Russia.    In a half-hour meeting with President Bill Clinton scheduled  for Thursday Chernomyrdin's assessment of the "current moment"  will take no less time than Russia's application to join the  "seven," Kim Il-song's bomb, or problems of friendship with  NATO. The main thing is the economy. On the eve of Viktor  Chernomyrdin's arrival several respectable newspapers have  published items which say for the first time that it is quite  likely that the Russian recession is close to an end and  Russians will start to live better. It is important for  Chernomyrdin to place the correct emphases, to maintain faith in  the Russian reforms, but to avoid exultation which naturally  makes creditors anxious to get their money back.    This is the third session of the "Chernomyrdin-Gore"  commission, named for its two cochairmen. The U.S. vice  premier's duties are of a strictly protocol nature while our  premier is still the all-Russian head of enterprise. That  reflects the two sides' approaches. The U.S. Administration has  virtually exhausted its potential for giving us money. The  verbal resources with which the administration, to give it its  due, has done everything to attract its businessmen by speaking  highly of Russia's boundless resources, are also on the verge of  depletion. So Washington is interested in a selfless, platonic  exchange. Premier Chernomyrdin, concerned with problems simply  unknown to his partners, is still worried about the eternal  question: What will they give?    They will give what they promised, but no more than there  is.  The administration does not have that much at its disposal:  space, nuclear power, environmental protection. Joint  Russian-U.S. committees and commissions have long been wandering  around all these glades and there is much here which is already  well trodden. Anything new comes hard. A treaty on the use of  the Sakhalin island shelf, the so-called "Sakhalin-2," was  expected. But instead of the treaty there will be a joint  statement whose commercial value may only emerge at some time in  the future. And may not emerge at all.    Actually, the latest helping of treaties on space and  rockets  will be signed. Fierce competition is under way to take part in  the world telecommunications system and our specialists are  rushing to extract as much benefit as possible from the fact  that we still make quite good rockets.    But the agreement on halting plutonium-producing reactors  will very likely not be signed although congratulations on the  subject have been heard since late March. But money is louder  than applause. The Russian side claims that the stopping of the  reactors is in the interests of the world public for which the  public should pay. The United States, guessing by some seventh  sense that it is once again a case of dollars from its budget,  does not object to raising the issue, but says there is no money.    At a preliminary press conference a spokesman for the prime  minister's apparatus noted that "half the government is moving  to the United States." He has in mind the fact that Viktor  Chernomyrdin is accompanied by six leading ministers for whose  transportation a whole two aircraft were required. Russian  soccer fans will probably approve the arrival of both aircraft  in Detroit, where we play Sweden on Friday. It is planned that  Viktor Chernomyrdin who in general does not go to soccer matches  ("because of a lack of time") will on this occasion visit the  locker room and give our professional soccer players additional  encouragement. To judge by their game with Brazil only a  presidential decree will help here.    Actually, Bolivian President Sanchez de Lozada, a  long-standing and passionate fan, did not enter the locker room  on the eve of the first match of the championship in which the  national team he worships was taking part. Either they did not  let him in or he was shy.    As for Premier Chernomyrdin he will go, his staffers report,  to congratulate the players after the match -- if they win. If  they lose the cortege will go straight from the rostrum to the  airport to return to Moscow on Saturday morning.    The Russian premier will spend all the first half of the day  at the Chicago headquarters of General Motors. The Russian  automobile association plans to create capacities for the  production of new passenger vehicles in conjunction with Opel,  General Motors' European junior partner.    Formally the deal is being concluded between private  enterprises and the government leader would seem to have nothing  to do with it. But the Western partners realize how dependent  any Russian enterprises remain on top officials. So his hosts  will await with practical interest V. Chernomyrdin's reaction to  one of the new models. The premier will test its quality in  motion, getting behind the wheel himself.</p>

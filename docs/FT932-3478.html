			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Barclays It is now more than three months since Barclays cut its dividend and promised to find a new chief executive to work alongside Mr Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman. Since then, there has been no news on the chief executive, but the share price has risen by 20 per cent. There is a risk that this recovery will calm the institutions down. They are more inclined to make a fuss when they are losing money, but a responsible role in corporate governance requires a consistent longer-term approach. The installation of a better structure at Barclays is a project worth seeing through. It would be unfair to expect Barclays to rush. The choice is a difficult one but it gets harder as time goes by. Not only would a new chief executive have to work with existing senior managers who may be miffed at the appointment of an outsider. The better Mr Buxton is established as executive chairman, the harder it will be for a new chief executive to carve out a meaningful role - and the greater the risk in accepting the job. If it is not to face the loss of more top executives, Barclays needs a candidate of conspicuously higher calibre than the average senior clearing banker. One answer might be to look for a non-banker, but it would make more sense to appoint such a person as chairman. Sir Peter Walters became chairman at Midland, while Mr Brian Pearse, the hands-on banker, was made chief executive. The task at Barclays might be easier if the bank was made more manageable by splitting it up. BZW, for example, is plenty big enough to stand alone.</p>

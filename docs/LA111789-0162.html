			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OUSTS KEATING, AIDES FROM CONTROL OF 2 LUXURY HOTELS  </P> <P> Federal regulators Thursday ousted Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H.  Keating Jr. and more than two dozen of his associates from management of two  troubled Arizona hotels partly owned by the failed Irvine thrift.  </P> <P> More than 60 regulators, lawyers, federal marshals and locksmiths walked into  the posh Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale and the Crescent Hotel in downtown  Phoenix at 1:30 a.m. to seize control of the lodges.  </P> <P> Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after its parent company filed for  bankruptcy protection. It will cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion to bail out  the insolvent institution, making it the largest thrift failure on record.  </P> <P> Lincoln invested a total of $324 million in the two hotels, which are among its  major problem assets. The government will continue to operate the hotels, along  with Lincoln, until it can find buyers for the assets.  </P> <P> Lincoln, through a subsidiary, owns 55% of the Phoenician, a luxury lodge  nestled at the foot of the Saddleback Mountains, and the Crescent, an upscale  hotel for business executives. The Kuwait Investment Office, an investment  firm, owns the remaining 45%.  </P> <P> Keating had retained control of the hotels even after regulators seized Lincoln  because a contract with the Kuwaiti investors required a 75% vote to change  management. Until Thursday, Keating had been able to keep the Kuwaitis on his  side, thwarting government attempts to remove him.  </P> <P> Regulators had been wooing the foreign investors since April to join with them  in ousting Keating.  </P> <P> In seizing the hotels, regulators threw out as many as 30 employees and  managers, including Keating, his wife and other family members. Others removed  were Michael Kelly and Robert J. Hubbard Jr., general managers of the  Phoenician and the Crescent, respectively. Hubbard also is a son-in-law of  Keating.  </P> <P> Some of the fired executives learned about their dismissals through notes taped  to the doors of their homes at 2 a.m. A handful of people, wearing large brown  and yellow buttons declaring, "I Like Charlie Keating," gathered at the  Phoenician at 3 a.m. to find out why they were let go.  </P> <P> The takeover surprised and angered American Continental officials, said Bradley  J. Boland, another Keating son-in-law and corporate spokesman.  </P> <P> "The Gestapo came in and took over," Boland said. "These guys don't know which  side of the Berlin Wall they're on."  </P> <P> Boland characterized the seizure as "a blatant act of terrorism" on the part of  federal regulators.  </P> <P> "They locked up doors," he said. "They locked up offices. Then they sent an  army out to post severence notices on doors of employees they were firing. They  cut out the major portion of the senior management that ran and made the resort  the most successful resort anywhere in the country. They ruined it today."  </P> <P> Last month, Boland said, the resort's gross revenues were more than $4.3  million, and the Phoenician had become a "magnet" for Arizona's economic  recovery.  </P> <P> Resolution Trust Corp., a new federal agency created to operate failed thrifts,  said it had hired Hans D. Turnovszky to manage the two hotels. Turnovszky is a  25-year veteran of the hotel industry, the agency said.  </P> <P> The hotels were high on the list of risky investments identified by regulators  in their examinations of Lincoln.  </P> <P> Lincoln invested $296 million in the Phoenician. Cost overruns and other  expenses ran so high that federal examiners determined that the resort would  lose money even if it were fully occupied. The resort currently is about 95%  occupied, regulators said.  </P> <P> Built on 130 acres, the Phoenician consists of 474 hotel rooms, 131 cottages, a  22,000-square-foot ballroom, 21 meeting rooms, six restaurants, a golf course,  10 lighted tennis courts, a health club and an acre of pools set on three  tiers, each with different water temperatures. Its restaurants include Mary  Elaine's, named after Keating's wife, and Charlie Charlie's, named after  Keating.  </P> <P> Lincoln invested $28 million in the Crescent. Last year, regulators said that  the hotel had incurred a $5.2-million operating deficit since it opened in  1986.  </P> <P> Steve Webb, a free-lance writer in Phoenix, contributed to this report.  </P></p>

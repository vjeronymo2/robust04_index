			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The premier of Soviet Azerbaijan has been replaced less than two weeks after  2,500 officials and party workers in the republic were disciplined over ethnic  unrest linked with the predominantly Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.  "Comrade (Gasan N.) Seidov was relieved of his duties as chairman of the  Azerbaijan Council of Ministers to retire for health reasons," said a decree  issued by the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet. The decree named Ayaz Mutalibov, one  of several deputy premiers, as Seidov's successor. The statement made no  explicit link between the departure of Seidov, 56, and the violence in which at  least 78 people died last year. New Communist Party leaders were appointed in  Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia last year.  </P></p>

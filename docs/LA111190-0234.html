			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> FAST-GROWING TREES TO GUARD YOUR PRIVACY;  </P> <P> EVERGREENS: THE TRICK IS TO PLANT TREES THAT DON'T GROW TOO TALL, TOO WIDE OR  MAKE A MESS.  </P> <P> It's familiar quest for many Southern California gardeners: the search for an  evergreen tree that will quickly soar above a six-foot fence to block a view of  the neighbors. But then it must stop before it towers over the rest of the back  yard and casts shadows everywhere.  </P> <P> Fifteen to 25 feet of fast growth will do, with a leafy canopy about as wide.  In smaller urban gardens, that's probably all the space to be had.  </P> <P> The trouble is, many young trees that look so appealing in their nursery cans  become too tall, too wide, too messy or too lacy to provide a solid block.  </P> <P> But there are a few winners. Most are readily available for fall planting.  Because of their smaller scale, some are commonly grown as large shrubs. But  they're easily trained as trees. Or you can get a head start by buying or  ordering "standards," which have already been pruned into tree form.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bronze Loquat  </P> <P> Ideal for cramped gardens or filtered shade, bronze loquat (Eriobotrya deflexa)  tops out at about 20 feet. Long, new leaves emerge a rich, reddish-brown, then  gradually change to dark green. In spring, fragrant white flowers similar to  apple blossoms appear clustered on branch tips.  </P> <P> The small, yellow-green fruit is not edible, but does attract birds. (The  larger Eriobotrya japonica produces edible fruit.) Bronze loquat does well  along the coast or inland with regular, deep watering.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fraser Photinia  </P> <P> This popular street tree (Photinia fraseri) tolerates a host of urban woes:  smog, dust, heat, even sprinklers. Mature leaves are dark green, while new  leaves and stems are bright red. Plentiful clusters of white flowers top the  red tips for a splendid, spring display.  </P> <P> Although it adapts well to espaliering or shaping, fall pruning does limit  spring flowering. Photina prefers full sun and frequent, deep watering early on  to develop drought resistance. Provide good drainage -- in constantly wet clay,  leaves may yellow and drop.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hopseed Bush  </P> <P> Native to the harsh, Arizona desert, hopseed bush (Dodonea viscosa) tolerates  everything from salt spray to winds and dry heat. Its long, narrow, upright  leaves form a dense, willow-like screen.  </P> <P> Cold weather causes the rusty-purple leaves of 'Purpurea' to turn bright purple  (it reverts in spring). Full sun helps sustain the distinctive color. Tiny  spring flowers are barely noticeable, but clusters of pale pink seed pods in  late summer are interesting and rustle in the wind. With regular water, hopseed  bush grows fast. With less, it remains compact.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lemon Bottlebrush  </P> <P> Hummingbirds descend on lemon bottlebrush (Callistemon citrinus) whenever a  flush of bright red "brushes" of flowers appear. Bloom peaks in early summer,  although some flowering occurs all year. Left unpruned, it forms a round,  12-foot-tall bush. But with shaping, its gnarled branches grow into a graceful,  slender tree to 25 feet. Lemon bottlebrush tolerates heavy soil, smog, wind and  heat, and may become drought-resistant over time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pineapple Guava  </P> <P> One of the prettiest flowering and fruiting small trees, pineapple guava  (Feijoa sellowiana) pumps out showy, edible, red-and-white flower clusters in  early summer, followed by edible, gray-green fruit. Its clean, oval leaves are  glossy green on top and pale-gray underneath. In coastal areas, it requires  full sun. Inland, provides filtered shade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shiny Xylosma  </P> <P> Commonly seen as a hedge, shiny xylosma (Xylosma congestum) is also a fine,  quick-growing tree. Glossy, apple-green leaves are tinged with red when they  emerge.  </P> <P> Left to their own devices, the branches droop, crisscross and dangle in odd  directions. But with direction and pruning, it grows into a graceful,  multi-trunked tree to 25 feet. Shiny xylosma tolerates most soils and weather  conditions, but may drop leaves after a severe frost.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. G. B.: "Primakov's Stripes"] </F>   [Text] Academician Ye.M. Primakov is the director of the  Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] of the Russian Federation.  Yevgeniy Maksimovich is the only one of the notorious  Gorbachev's closest and prominent confederates who also stayed  on Yeltsin's team. As is known, this happened because Primakov,  a very farsighted politician, got his correct bearings in time  and from the beginning of 1991 began to secretly supply the  needed information to the former RSFSR president's inner circle.  The academician's talent for secrecy served him well later, when  he bargained for himself the job of FIS head (he was also aiming  at that of minister of foreign affairs).    ...The academician-director's prominent trait is lordly  generosity and love for his "loyal crowd." For instance,  Primakov's permanent aide (of many years now) Robert Vartanovich  Markaryan, who has never been in any way related to  intelligence, was recently promoted to the rank of general!  General Markaryan (who lovingly and tenderly carried Primakov's  suitcases during his numerous voyages) is planning to become  head of the FIS information-analytical department. My, what a  gift for the CIA!    Some time in the past Primakov gave his buddy Kantorov the  job of legal department chief, which has only a few employees.  And behold!--Kantorov also becomes an intelligence general.    A man Primakov needs very much is Yuriy Antonovich Zubakov  (a  friendly nickname within the FIS--Dubakov). Deputy director for  personnel, Zubakov has already become a rear admiral. Having  donned a glittering admiral's uniform, Yuriy Antonovich likes to  admire himself in the mirror when he is alone.    By the way, the personnel director-admiral Zubakov-Dubakov  intends to become head of one of Russia's stations in a far  abroad foreign country. One imperialistic tabloid has already  published a write-up of this dream.    Academician-director Primakov is not only a "hospitable"  host, but also a "wise" arbiter in the squabbles among his  entourage. For instance, Mr. Mertsalov, chief of the FIS  transportation and utilization department, and his "war" deputy  Mr. Panov recently came to blows. To such an extent that the  shock waves generated by this "clash of the titans" reverberated  throughout the entire service. Professional intelligence  officers, who still remember the special responsibilities of  their profession, came to the conclusion that both Mertsalov and  Panov were on their way to being dismissed in disgrace from the  FIS. Naive people, they forgot about the academician's love for  his retinue. Mr. Panov ceremonially departed for a foreign  assignment, while Mr. Mertsalov still grandly occupies his old  position of responsibility.    ...Do you want to become a general under Primakov? Become a  "useful" person for the academician-director.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs 'back reform' A NARROW majority of Labour MPs want the party to back electoral reform, a survey showed last night, as the Plant committee inquiry into alternative electoral systems reached its final stages. The survey of 128 Labour MPs for the New Statesman and Society magazine showed 59 per cent backing the principle of electoral reform and 36 per cent wanting to keep the first-past-the-post system. Of those supporting electoral reform, 30 per cent favoured a German-style Additional Member system, 16 per cent wanted the Australian-style Alternative Vote method and 13 per cent wanted the Irish-style Single Transferable Vote system. Support for electoral reform is stronger among new Labour MPs. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, is under pressure from within party ranks to initiate a radical switch in Labour policy away from supporting the existing, first-past-the-post system of elections, the survey suggests. So far Mr Smith has given little indication that he is prepared to embrace electoral reform, although a senior party official said yesterday that the Labour leader would be 'pragmatic'. Mr Smith will set out his views at the next meeting of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee later this month. He will have then the final results of the two-year long inquiry under Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton university. Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader of the party and a member of the Plant committee, is strongly opposed to change. But, as the survey indicates, there is also dispute among the pro-reformers over the prefered system from the alternatives considered.</p>

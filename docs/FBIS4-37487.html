			<p>BFN     [Text] The appointed Palestinian Housing Minister,  Zakariya al-Agha, said that the ministry is planning to  establish Palestinian housing neighborhoods in the Jewish  settlements in Gaza that he is assured will be evacuated in  three years time, according to the agreement with Israel.    He pointed out that the plans being prepared aim to find an  urgent solution to the problem of lack of land in Gaza for  constructing houses.    Al-Agha said that the Palestinians are in need of 250,000  housing units, 110,000 of them are needed in Gaza and he refuses  to build skyscrapers of more than eight storeys each. "We want  to keep the general character of Gaza."    Al-Agha revealed that the headquarters of his ministry will  be in Gaza, and indicated that the reason behind this decision  is that his ministry will be needed there as most of its work  will be focused in Gaza, while branches of the ministry in other  parts will be in the West Bank and Jerusalem.    He expects that these projects will absorb most of the labor  force in construction. "The implementation of this plan will  need 150,000 laborers," he added.    Al-Agha said that his ministry will coordinate with the  Higher Palestinian Council and will try to enroll the council  with the ministry responsibilities.</p>

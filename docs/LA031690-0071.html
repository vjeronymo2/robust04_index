			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> PROPOSAL TO DOUBLE BRIDGE TOLLS FAILS  </P> <P> The Assembly rejected a proposal to double the toll on seven state-run bridges  in the San Francisco Bay Area -- from $1 to $2 -- to raise $200 million for  public transit. The bill was introduced during the Legislature's special  session to address special needs after the Oct. 17 earthquake.  </P> <P> It failed on a 26-35 vote, well short of the two-thirds majority needed to  clear the 80-member house. But Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) said he would  revise his measure and bring it up again in regular session. Besides doubling  tolls, it provides free passage for cars carrying three or more people,  including the driver. The measure does not apply to the locally operated Golden  Gate Bridge, which already has a $2 toll.  </P></p>

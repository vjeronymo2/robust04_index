			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Knin, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- The ministry of foreign  affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] called on all  Serbs and Serb associations in the world today to do everything  they can against the planned NATO air strikes on Serb military  targets and the population of the Srpska republic, ISKRA  reported.    "The casualty toll will be huge, whole families will perish,  including infants. It will be a real genocide -- a crime which  began in World War II when the Muslims and Croats, sponsored by  Adolf Hitler, killed 1.5 million Serbs," the statement says.  [passage omitted]    For their part, the Serbs have already done a great deal for  establishing peace: They surrendered Sarajevo airport to  UNPROFOR, they surrendered territories to the Muslims in  exchange for peace on two occasions, and they saved 80,000  Croats from being massacred by the Muslims. The Serbs have  never besieged the city of Sarajevo. Sarajevo is a city divided  into Serb and Muslim parts, ISKRA reports.    The ministry of foreign affairs calls on all Serbs in the  world to present these details to politicians, parties, members  of parliaments, journalists and other respected personalities,  also calling for organization of protests because Serbs  currently have no other weapons, the statement says.</p>

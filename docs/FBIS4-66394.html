The average number of valence electrons  N[.sub]eff[/] dependences of the spontaneous magnetostriction  _o_[.sub]S[/] and the average magnetic moment  [.sub]FeCo[/] have been obtained, and it has  been found that the _o_[.sub]S[/] takes a maximum at  N[.sub]eff[/] = 8.1-8.2 where the  [.sub]FeCo[/] begins to decrease drastically.  The generalized phonon densities of states (PDOS) were deduced  from inelastic neutron scattering experiments, and the phonon  softening phenomenon in amorphous Invar alloy was observed from  phonon spectra.</p>

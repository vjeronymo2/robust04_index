			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTING THE DESERT  </P> <P> This is in response to Bruce Barnbaum's comments Aug. 28 (letter). He says,  "(Sen. Pete) Wilson has blocked every attempt to create wilderness, national  parklands, or any other viable protection of our besieged desert lands."  Perhaps Barnbaum confuses the raising of legitimate questions over bad  legislation with blocking.  </P> <P> In an open letter to Sen. Alan Cranston (Cycle News, July 13, 1988), Wilson  expressed these concerns and indicated a willingness to work with desert  protection bill proponents to correct its faults. Wilson's questioning of this  bill was an act of political courage as it incurred the displeasure of the  Sierra Club in an election year. Happily, he was reelected.  </P> <P> As The Times said in an editorial ("Desert Dilemma," Aug. 27), both sides  should increase their efforts in search of some common ground.  </P> <P> JOHN GAWLEY  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

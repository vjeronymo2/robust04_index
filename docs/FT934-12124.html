			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Danish order gains subsidy BRITISH COAL will receive government subsidies for an order to supply coal to a Danish electricity generator. The government's decision, announced yesterday by Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, will encourage hopes among other potential coal buyers, including UK industrial companies, that their purchases will also qualify for subsidies. It indicates that the government is taking a more lenient view on which deals it is prepared to subsidise than it indicated when it introduced the coal subsidy scheme last March. Ministers originally suggested they were prepared to grant subsidies of up to Pounds 500m for contracts between British Coal and UK electricity generators. In the absence of such deals, however, ministers have granted subsidies to two other types of contract. The first, announced last week, was for a contract between British Coal and Alcan, an industrial company. The Danish deal involves British Coal exporting 100,000 tonnes of coal. Some of the exports will be produced by opencast operations and so will not qualify for the subsidy. It is thought the government has provided British Coal with about half of the difference between the cost of producing the coal and the selling price. Both the Alcan and Danish deal subsidies are for coal mined from Ellington, Northumberland.</p>

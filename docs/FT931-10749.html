			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: German financials climb on Buba initiative - But from now on, there will be contradictory factors at work on Frankfurt stocks At last, action from the Bundesbank] Thursday's cuts in key German interest rates were no surprise in themselves; but the timing of the move certainly was, especially in the wake of hawkish comments from members of the Bundesbank's council last week which led many economists to believe that rates would not start falling until March or even April. Expectations of a cut had fuelled a January rally in the German stock market, which palled a little in the last week of the month, and which has since revived. The DAX blue chip index of 30 shares was up 1.2 per cent last month, and the wider FAZ general index by 3.2 per cent. The cut itself prompted a strong rally. The DAX climbed yesterday by 39.76 to 1,641.37, a record high for the year. Financial shares - particularly sensitive to interest rate movements - showed impressive gains. Allianz, the big insurance company, climbed 2.7 per cent, Dresdner Bank rose by 5.7 per cent, Deutsche Bank by 5 per cent and Commerzbank by 4.5 per cent. From now on, the German equity market is likely to be influenced by two contradictory factors. On the one hand, interest rates are definitely, unequivocally on the way down. The detailed timing and scope of further cuts is not clear but economists expect lead rates to fall by 200 basis points by the end of the year. This is positive for equities, in principle. 'All other asset classes are unattractive,' says Mr Sy Schluter at CSFB First Boston in Frankurt. 'Cash has lost its appeal and bund market yields have already discounted further rate cuts. The yield on 10-year bunds is likely to be at the same level at the end of the year as it is now (around 7 per cent).' Working against this is the fact that the downturn in the German economy has by no means reached a low point. There is plenty of bad news still to come from the corporate sector and the latest interest rate cut is not going to lead to a sudden reversal in the outlook for corporate earnings this year. This outlook is bleak: Mr Reinhard Fischer, head of German equity research at Paribas Capital Markets in London, calculates that earnings on the DAX companies will drop by 14.5 per cent in 1992 and by a further 7.4 per cent in 1993. This puts the market as a whole on a multiple of some 17.6 times current year earnings, higher than the average in recent years. 'The danger is that the current rally may prove to be no more than a bubble,' says Mr Fischer, who is predicting that in the next two to three months the DAX will climb to 1,700 before dropping back again. 'The market is not at all supported by fundamentals.' Under these conditions, the choice of stocks becomes especially important. Mr Schluter at CSFB divides his recommendations into two categories: companies which are likely to outperform over the short-term, irrespective of fundamentals, and those which offer fundamental value over the longer term as well. He believes that clients interested in making trading profits should buy Daimler Benz and Volkswagen, in spite of the problems afflicting the German car manufacturing sector. Siemens also should be bought on a short-term view but rates only as a hold for the medium to long-term. These stocks have high beta values, traditionally outperforming when the market is rising, and doing worse than the market when share prices are sinking. Other companies with high beta values include Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Munich Re, the large reinsurance company. Of these, Mr Schluter likes Deutsche and Munich Re as short and long-term investments. Allianz is seen as attractive in the short term, but the discount of the share price to asset value is far less pronounced than at Munich Re, where the asset value is DM3,500 per share compared to yesterday's share price of DM2,850. Allianz, traditionally viewed as a proxy for the market, closed up DM58 yesterday at DM2,200, compared with an estimated asset value of DM2,500. The choice of Deutsche Bank among the big banks is not shared by all analysts: Mr Paul Brunker at Robert Fleming in London recommends buying Dresdner instead. Deutsche traditionally has the highest rating of the three large banks and for the last year its earnings are likely to slip back from DM49.50 per share to DM49, climbing back up to DM53 for 1993 according to Paribas estimates. Analysts also point to the two large Bavarian banks (Hypo Bank and Bayerische Vereinsbank) where business is traditionally weighted towards mortgage business rather than risk-prone commercial lending. DePfa, the Wiesbaden-based mortgage bank which was one of last year's star performers with a share price rise of nearly 50 per cent, is still favoured. Among the more cyclical stocks, Bayer is preferred to the other large chemical companies simply on the grounds that its high proportion of pharmaceutical sales leaves it less exposed to the downturn in the world chemicals markets. Mr Fischer predicts that it will cut its dividend for 1992 from DM13 to DM10, but that BASF's dividend will fall from DM12 to DM8 and Hoechst's from DM12 to DM9.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would require that, except for milk and milk products imported from Canada, milk and milk products imported into the United States from countries declared free of rinderpest and FMD be accompanied by a certificate stating that the milk was produced and processed in a country declared free of rinderpest and FMD, or that the milk product was processed in a country declared free of rinderpest and FMD from milk produced in a country declared free of rinderpest and FMD. The certificate would have to name the country in which the milk was produced and the country in which the milk or milk product was processed. The certificate would also have to state that the milk or milk product has never been in any country in which rinderpest or FMD exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not expect that requiring a certificate would have any significant economic impact for U.S. importers of milk or milk products. The exporter of the milk or milk products would have to obtain the required certification through the national government of the country of export prior to shipping the milk or milk products to the United States. We do not know how many of those governments would charge a fee for providing the certificate, but it is unlikely that any fee would be high enough to significantly raise the cost of the milk or milk product should the exporter choose to pass the cost of the certificate on to the importer in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule will be submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget.

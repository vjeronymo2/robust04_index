			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Istanbul--[passage omitted] Turkish National  Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan noted: "Germany and France have  banned the activities of this organization."    The Turkish minister added: "We expect similar behavior from  other countries. However, this is not done by certain  neighbors, such as Greece. We have learned, through confessions  by members of this organization, that certain people are trained  in that country."</p>

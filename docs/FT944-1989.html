			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Suharto bypasses minister in tariff row President Suharto of Indonesia has created a new committee to take charge of tariffs and in the process raised eyebrows by reducing the power of finance minister Marie Muhammad in the formulation of Indonesia's trade protection policies. The move has prompted speculation in Jakarta that the creation of a new group and Mr Marie's reduced role in it may be due to his public rejection to of a request for tariff protection by promoters of a huge petrochemical project called Chandra Asri. The Dollars 1.6bn project is majority owned by timber tycoon Prajogo Pangestu of the Barito Group and Mr Suharto's second son Bambang Trihadmodjo of the Bimantara group. Analysts say the growing controversy has already raised questions about Jakarta's commitment to promote greater trade liberalisation, especially after Mr Suharto hosted the recent summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec). In a presidential decree this month Mr Suharto ordered the establishment of the new tariff team, which will displace the current three-minister group headed by Mr Marie. The new team will be chaired by co-ordinating minister for industry and trade Mr Hartarto, who was not a part of the previous tariff team. Mr Marie, who is widely respected by the international financial community, will be deputy chairman. Investment Minister Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo said this week the new team will would reformulate government policies on tariffs and help 'optimise functions' of the existing tariff team. Last week a Chandra Asri director Mr Peter Gontha told a Parliament committee that the project, which is scheduled to come onstream by the first quarter of 1995, will need tariff protection of up to 40 per cent to shield it from the potential threat of dumping by foreign companies. Critics maintain that protection would only ensure the promoters quicker returns on their investment and give it control of a vital industry. The request evoked hostile reactions and drew almost immediate opposition from Mr Marie. The minister said all projects must comply with existing tariff policies without exception. Mr Sanyoto has openly supported tariff protection for the project. Mr Hartarto has not publicly declared his position, but several economists and government officials say he is a strong advocate that Indonesia should develop its own petrochemical industry. According to government officials the new tariff team will take effect on January 5.</p>

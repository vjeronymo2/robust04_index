			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SWAGGART THREATENS SEX STORY SUIT  </P> <P> A lawyer for television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart today threatened a "mammoth"  libel suit against Penthouse Magazine for publishing the account of a New  Orleans housewife who claims Swaggart conned her into performing sex acts.  </P> <P> Dennis Brewer Sr., an Irving attorney who is also a member of the Swaggart  Ministry board of directors, said that Swaggart had never met the woman and  that she had falsified the account for fame and money.  </P> <P> Catherine Kampen, 38, claimed that the affair with Swaggart began in July,  1987, and lasted until January, 1988, before Swaggart was defrocked last spring  by the Assemblies of God for a tryst with a prostitute. Kampen, who was  employed by a "strip-o-gram" service, alleges in the article that she met  Swaggart on the street and that he pretended to counsel her on her marital  problems. She said they never had sexual intercourse but claims that he conned  her into performing sadomasochistic acts for his sexual pleasure.  </P></p>

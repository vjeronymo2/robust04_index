			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ulrich Deupmann: "Mondays It's a Matter of </F> Power; Scharping's Kitchen Cabinet: Six Strategists Bet on  Victory"]    [Text] The "Monday circle," which is shrouded in secrecy,  met for seven and a half hours, from four in the afternoon until  half past eleven at night. Rudolf Scharping, head of the Social  Democratic Party [SPD], met with a group of his closest advisors  at party headquarters in a brainstorming session concerning  election campaign strategy. Election slogans were presented to  the circle, then rejected once more. Then it was a matter of  selecting some pictures for election posters. The slide  projector showed pictures of the chairman on the wall: Scharping  on vacation in Mallorca, in a denim shirt, or in a highly  serious pose. Suddenly it was nearly as cozy as if it were in  someone's living room. There were some jokes about some of the  snapshots, and Scharping, like any "pater familias," got just a  bit touchy.    "Monday circle": under this by-word, since January, at the  outset of nearly every week a sort of SPD party chairman's  kitchen cabinet, for which the party by-laws make no provision,  has been meeting to chart the party's "operative course." Among  this circle of the elect, in addition to Guenter Verheugen, the  national managing director, are the head of the state chancery  in Rhineland-Palatinate, Karl-Heinz Klaer; Wolfgang Clement,  Klaer's counterpart from North Rhine-Westphalia; Reinhard  Klimmt, head of the SPD caucus in Saarbruecken's Landtag: and  Peter Struck, parliamentary managing director of the SPD  Bundestag caucus. All these men are in their mid-forties to  early fifties, that is to say, as old as the party chairman. All  have strategic minds'; all are professionals in the day-to-day  business of politics; all are anything but pantywaists. Being  possessed of a strategic mind: that means knowing one's way  through Bonn's political jungle, finding it fun to sniff out the  opponent's traps early in the game, and laying a few traps of  one's own, but it also means finding the hazardous focal points  in one's own camp and disarming them.    The exceptional meeting on Sunday [24 April] definitely  served as an external expression of the fact that "the training  period is now over and the first half-time is starting," as  Scharping said last week in the SPD Bundestag caucus. In the hot  phase of the campaign, what is at stake for the SPD is rescuing  over time the opinion poll results, which have been less and  less favorable, by election day, which is set for 16 October. It  nearly appears as if the electorate, for the fourth time in a  row, believed that the SPD overdid it in the training and came  up short in the game. The pitiful experience of the defeat, and  the knowledge that Kohl can pour it on for a final spurt at the  end, are matters of which most participants of the Monday circle  are only all too keenly aware. In 1986-87, Wolfgang Clement had  a key contributory role in managing the fruitless Bundestag  campaign for the SPD's candidate for the chancellorship,  Johannes Rau. In 1990, Reinhard Klimmt and Karl-Heinz Klaer  attempted to advise the candidate for chancellor, Oskar  Lafontaine, in the election campaign. By no means the last  lesson shared by the group as a result of its experiences is  Rudolf Scharping's firm article of faith: the opposition has  never yet been elected to the government because of its better  program; quite the contrary: the people have elected their  chancellor out of pity for him or his policies. A participant in  the Monday circle expresses the SPD strategy that follows from  this in very simple terms: "Disarm the government, take the toys  right out of its hands, then crack the nut."    The "strong men" before whom Kohl and Schaeubele are  expected  to quake in fear, are unknown quantities in terms of national  politics. Karl-Heinz Klaer, for example, as head of the state  chancery in Mainz, the right hand man of the minister-president  of Rhineland-Palatinate: after the 1990 defeat in the Bundestag  election, Klaer offered Scharping, who was the leader of the  opposition at the time, to organize the Landtag election with  him, and go with him to Mainz. Up to that point, Klaer had been  responsible within party headquarters, in his capacity as  division chief, for strategic planning and "observing the  enemy"; prior to that, he had served party boss Willy Brandt as  office manager. Scharping knows that in the last analysis, he  owes his victory in the election to the party chairmanship to  this intimate party acquaintanceship. After that, Klaer  consciously remained in Mainz. With their "close ties" to one  another, they want to disarm the charge that Scharping, because  of obligations in Bonn, was neglecting his job as  minister-president. Should Scharping become the chancellor in  October, it is almost a certainty that he will entrust  Karl-Heinz Klaer with the post of head of the office of the  chancellor.    Peter Struck, the managing director of the SPD Bundestag  caucus, who is skilled with the media, may justifiably hope that  in that case, he would occupy the influential boss' chair in the  caucus. With his outgoing ways--Struck uses the familiar form of  address with nearly everyone in Bonn, from Theo Waigel, head of  the Christian Social Union [CSU] to the Greens' Joschka  Fischer--he has managed to pull off many a political trick that  would have eluded a person with a gloomier disposition. He  always garners the evil eye from members of his own party  whenever he leans against the government's bench, engrossed in  some confidential joke or other with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In  addition, the rough-and-ready way in which, from time to time,  Struck calls the SPD deputies to order has won him a few  enemies, as well as friends.  <H5>  Political Craftsmen </H5>   Wolfgang Clement and Reinhard Klimmt create the axis to  Scharping's chief allies in the SPD in Scharping's Monday  circle. Clement is considered to be Johannes Rau's alter ego,  Klimmt, as "permanent number two man" behind his friend from  student days, the head of the Saarland government, Oskar  Lafontaine. Both have been selected by their ministers-president  as crown princes.    This circle--together with Verheugen--is unified by the view  of political practice. For them, ultimately, political questions  are questions of power, or, as one participant put it: "Of what  good is the most beautiful ecological platform to us if we do  not have the power to implement it?" Their understanding of  themselves rather resembles that of craftsmen, political actors  who, in the second tier, keep the machinery running. Visions are  not their field of expertise.    And certainly, it is no accident that the SPD boss has  surrounded himself with precisely these friends. Scharping and  his cronies have had enough of "opposition politics without  consequences." That is the explanation for current tensions  between this second tier of the party leadership and that wing  of the Social Democrats who think in terms of platforms. For  Scharping, taking over the power is of primary importance, not  pure convictions.    The tensions were discharged in thunder and lightning over  the weekend when it became known that Christoph Zoepel had  vented his spleen in DER SPIEGEL. Zoepel, who is responsible for  transportation and housing in Scharping's government platform  committee, used his well-known sharp tongue to analyze the  situation: "Since the original election, there have been nothing  but personalities. They have opinions that can no longer be  altered by the opinions of the party. The SPD is now a party of  the presidium." For a long time, Zoepel had fought for the  inclusion of a speed limit in the platform, also for confessing  that any federal government, regardless which one, would have to  increase the petroleum tax. Scharping blue penciled these  provisions from the draft on him, and at some point, Zoepel  decide to save his breath to cool his porridge.    Perhaps he would have done better not to have done so,  because Scharping's reactions to public slogans of the  "presidial party" type are definitely touchy. At the SPD  presidium on Monday [25 April], there was such a row between the  two that those who were sitting in the vicinity prefer to  maintain a guarded silence on the subject, even after the fact.  Scharping took an imperious tone toward Zoepel, saying if he had  something against the platform, he should say so beforehand, in  private. Zoepel interjected it was a matter of his reputation.  Finally, the SPD boss threatened to throw Zoepel out of the  government committee. Ultimately, they struck a compromise,  demanding a speed limit according to the resolutions of the  European Parliament. That body has decided to impose pretty much  everything from 120 to 150 kilometers per hour. And so, in the  future, anyone can pick from the platform whatever speed limit  he likes, more or less. Oskar Lafontaine and Gerhard Schroeder,  incidentally, at least so it is rumored, were amused by the  quarrel. A "presidial party" would not be so bad at all,  Schroeder is claimed to have said.    Scharping cut a deal by which he was permitted to state his  views in a preface to the governing platform all by himself. It  is said that the content will not contain any surprises, Guenter  Verheugen hastens to explain. The party boss wants to bring  those matters that concern him the most to the foreground,  namely fighting unemployment and the desire for a fresh start  for the country. The fact that the speed limit played an overly  important role in the process is something no one has to  believe. That is "the least important matter we have discussed  in two years," one high-ranking member of the party leadership  says and he adds: "Whoever believes we can win an election on  that point also believes in Santa Claus."</p>

The projects would occur within an area of existing oil and gas activity which is referred to as the ``cumulative study area.'' The cumulative study area encompasses all or portions of 27 townships (T. 22&hyph;28 N., R. 108&hyph;113 W.) or approximately 900 square miles. The Green River forms the western edge of the cumulative study area. The area is characterized by intermittent drainages, sagebrush-greasewood vegetation and an absence of residences. Lands within the cumulative study area are primarily BLM and Bureau of Reclamation-administered but include minor amounts of State and private land. Affected lands are primarily used for grazing, recreation, and oil and gas production. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A Scoping Notice will be distributed by mail on or about the date of this notice.

This would benefit consumers by making additional supplies of clean-burning natural gas available. The additional wells will maximize production in an area where approximately 447 wells are already producing. The existing wells, plus the maximum potential development wells, could result in up to approximately 1,769 wells within the combined Fontenelle and Lincoln Road fields. However, the level and rate of additional drilling and development will be contingent upon gas prices and energy tax credits. In addition to wellheads and production units, associated facilities will include access roads, natural gas gathering pipeline systems, and individual well tank facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An environmental assessment and supplement were prepared on natural gas development within the Fontenelle and Lincoln Road areas in 1991 and 1992 respectively. The decisions for these environmental analyses concluded that a certain level of development could be authorized without resulting in significant impact to the human environment. Development concurrent with the preparation of the Fontenelle Natural Gas Infill Drilling Projects would be authorized so long as it remains within the scope of the existing environmental analyses and decisions. Land and resource management issues and concerns associated with the construction of roads, well pads, and pipelines; the drilling and completion of wells; and the operation and maintenance of a producing well field that will be analyzed in the EIS include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Potential impacts to big game crucial winter range and habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Potential impacts to wildlife caused by poaching, harassment and increased vehicular access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Potential impacts to sage grouse breeding and nesting habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

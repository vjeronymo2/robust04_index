			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Tel Aviv drops on conflict allegations SHARE prices in Tel Aviv fell heavily yesterday, the latest lurch in a 10-day downtrend as investors reacted to allegations that Israeli banks have been stoking the market to unwarranted levels. Already depressed by worries that equities were over-valued after riding a surging bull market for most of the past two years, the index of the 100 most traded shares dropped 5 per cent during the morning session, before recouping some of the loss. It ended the day down 3.9 per cent at 194.63. This compares with a high of 218.17 on February 8 and an end-1992 mark of 195.98, which in turn compared with a level of 100 at the beginning of 1992. The day's fall followed remarks to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday by Mr Moshe Beijsky, the former High Court judge, which raised the spectre of a disastrous share collapse in 1983. Mr Beijsky, who chaired a state commission of inquiry into the 1983 crash, said bank-owned mutual and providential funds, which have supplied much of the heavy demand on the TASE, 'do not always have the interests of savers as their first concern.' He added: 'The fact that it is the banks which manage the provident and the mutual funds constitutes an inadmissible conflict of interest.' Present market conditions are very different from those of 1983, when the principal cause of the crash was the collapse of a system by which the banks ramped up their own shares. But government officials, brokers and analysts have noted that the banks, suffering from low margins in their mainstream business, have benefited by heavy lending to investors for stock purchases made through their own institutions. Mr David Klein of the Bank of Israel comptroller's committee also told the Knesset: 'People who want to invest are still not getting objective financial advice. Each bank simply sells its own goods.' Bank of Israel officials said they were considering moves to remove mutual and providential funds completely from bank control, or at least to strengthen the 'Chinese walls' between them through independently appointed investment committees. Judge Beijsky noted that his commission of inquiry had advised separation, but that no action had been taken. The issue has acquired extra urgency because of the government's plan to sell off 20 per cent of Bank Hapoalim, the country's biggest bank, on the TASE within the next few weeks. Along with its rivals, Bank Leumi, Israel Discount Bank and Bank Mizrahi, Bank Hapoalim has been majority-owned by the state since the government spent Dollars 7bn on buying up bank stock after the 1983 crash. Mr Klein said it would be impossible to take back control over the mutual and providential funds from the banks after they were re-privatised. In spite of the heat generated by the row over the role of the banks, analysts said it tended to cloud judgment of the underlying health of the market, which has slipped back significantly in a yo-yo pattern of trading since peaking in early February. Comments by the Bank of Israel that the market was like a 'financial bubble' and similar cautionary talk from the Finance Ministry helped to induce the slump, which the banks row compounded. Significantly, Israeli high-tech stocks quoted in New York, where they have consistently outperformed local markets over the past year, also declined on Wednesday, a day when the Dow Jones index rose overall. But most analysts in Tel Aviv say they do not anticipate a 1983-style crash. They point out that the market is now much broader and deeper, but still not soaking up a steady flow of demand. Also, the high inflation, low growth economy of 1983 has been replaced by strong growth and single-digit inflation. Mr David Rosenberg of Pacific Mediterranean Investments said: 'The market was due for a correction, but we are probably past the worst of it.' He added that average historical price-earnings ratios were down to 20 or less. 'It could go to 185 before recovering, but the underlying fundamentals are still good. We think it is a little overvalued, but not much.'</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Equatorial Bank gives up licence Equatorial Bank, the small Asian-owned bank which was placed into administration in March, has voluntarily surrendered its Bank of England banking licence after various attempts to rescue it failed, it was disclosed yesterday. Mr Gareth Hughes, the administrator from Ernst &amp; Young, said that the bank had surrendered its banking licence because there was 'no prospect of rescue'. The bank's liabilities and assets were being worked out. The Bank of England said that Equatorial was one of two companies deleted from its list of authorised institutions under the 1987 Banking Act. The other was Bunge Finance. Mr Hughes said that an interim payment of 25p in the pound had already been made to Equatorial's creditors. He expected that further payments would be made in the next few months as loans were reallocated to other institutions. Equatorial was one of three Asian banks in London to close since last October, prompting concern about the supply of finance to Asian businesses. They lost liquidity after the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Among those who expressed an interest in rescuing Equatorial was a group headed by Mr Ketan Somaia, a Kenyan Asian businessman.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Resignation blow to City watchdog The creation of a Personal Investment Authority, the planned City watchdog, suffered a fresh setback yesterday when one of its directors resigned in protest at the composition of the board. The move by Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, was backed by his company, which became the third leading life office to oppose publicly the plans for the authority. The setting up of the PIA, a self-regulatory body for retail financial services, has met a series of obstacles. The damage from yesterday's events is more serious because the PIA had previously been gaining momentum amid growing recognition in the financial services industry that the authority would come into effect around the middle of this year. Its creation is central to the plans set out by Mr Andrew Large, the chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, for enhancing investor protection. Mr Stretton said his resignation arose from the board's decision that only nine of the 19 directors should be active industry practitioners. The board decided just before Christmas that the other directors should comprise nine public interest directors and the authority's chief executive. Mr Joe Palmer, the PIA chairman, regretted Mr Stretton's decision and paid tribute to his contribution to PIA's development over the past year. Privately, another board member described Mr Stretton's departure as 'a major blow'. Mr Stretton argued that since the industry would be in a minority on the board, the organisation could not be a self-regulatory body, and that the preferable route would be to move to statutory regulation. Mr Roy Nicolson, chief executive of Scottish Amicable, has expressed similar concerns. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, the UK's largest life office, has already made clear his preference for statutory regulation and yesterday said he was interested to see the conclusions 'people we regard as sensible' had reached. The SIB, the City's chief regulator, is expected to receive a document next month on the PIA's plans, and other life offices may wait until that has been published before making their views known. If they intervene in similar terms, then the prospect of a confrontation between the industry and the regulator will intensify. Lex, Page 18</p>

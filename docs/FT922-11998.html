			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Observer: Duo to watch It would be wrong to read Derek Bonham's appointment as Hanson's chief executive as just a sop to City opinion. It is a much more significant move than last October's 'strengthening' of the board by the addition of a few tame non-executive directors. Bonham has been made chief executive of the whole group and not just the UK bit, and although it is hard to imagine Lord White taking orders from the 48-year-old chief executive, time is on Bonham's side. It is early days yet but the combination of him and David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson's US operations, could develop into a sensible replacement for the elderly Lords Hanson and White. However, Bonham will need to make his mark fairly soon, if he is to convince the City that anything has changed. Obviously, he can't kick Lord Hanson upstairs as life president just yet, but perhaps he will be able to dump some of the head office hangers-on. On the other hand, it's not good news for the young Honourable Robert Hanson's prospects.</p>

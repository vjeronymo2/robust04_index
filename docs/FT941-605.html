			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Air Canada sees loss reducing The turnround at Air Canada continued in the first quarter of this year and the loss would be much smaller than that of a year earlier, said Mr Jean Jacques Bourgeault, chief operating officer. 'The second quarter should also be better and the third, our best, will be profitable. For all 1994 we should at least break even at the bottom line and return to profitability in 1995,' he said. In 1993, Air Canada reported operating profit of CDollars 77m (USDollars 57.4m), but after restructuring provisions saw a final loss of CDollars 326m.</p>

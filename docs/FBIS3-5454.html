At the same time the United States is demanding  that we reduce our automobile tariff rate. In the past, the  United States has expressed satisfaction over the ROK's schedule  for opening up. Therefore, it seems that a visible apprehensive  element will not immediately appear at the upcoming ROK-U.S.  trade negotiations. However, since the United States is  continuously showing interest in our automobiles,  communications, and intellectual property rights, and is even  demanding the improvement of the ROK's system and business  practices, a detailed countermeasure is necessary in this field.    Looking at the ROK, the United States recognizes that we may  become a second Japan. It is necessary to turn our attention to  this view. We do not have elaborate organizations for domestic  dealings, a distribution network like a spider's web, and  business practices like Japan. Therefore, there is no reason  for us to be unnecessarily misunderstood.    The United States is demanding that we reduce the tariff  rate  of U.S. automobiles -- currently 10 percent -- to 2.5 percent.  When we consider the fact that Europe imposes a 10 percent  import tariff rate on foreign made cars, it is difficult to  accept the U.S. demand. The United States is picking a quarrel  on special excise and local taxes imposed according to the car's  engine displacement. The tariff rate must be readjusted in some  cases, but we cannot give special treatment to foreign goods by  changing our domestic law.    The U.S. intention is to increase the number of its cars in  the ROK market. Even though we cannot accept all the conditions  the United States is demanding, we must bear in mind the hidden  message it is giving us. It is now inevitable for ROK  businesses to be more exposed to competition with foreign  businesses. We must realize that the arena for competition is  even affecting our domestic market.    In the process of economic development in the past 30 years,  which was mainly centered on exports, ROK consumers were sort of  forced to sacrifice themselves to assist export products.  Consumers could not but endure high price and low-quality goods.  Strengthening competitiveness is important in an international  environment, but promoting the consumer's convenience is another  important yardstick in judging competitiveness.    We cannot face the demands for opening up through  negotiations alone. We must accelerate competitiveness among  domestic businesses to strengthen their structure. However,  this is also a difficult matter. Furthermore, the people's  demands to obtain high-quality goods at cheap prices are  increasing. Even though we have opened up, import is a  monopolistic structure and the distribution level is  complicated, thus, the benefits of openness are not being spread  equally.    The government must bear this in mind. It is also necessary  for the government to resolutely revise the domestic system  related to imports. When considering the general trend, the  attitude of domestic businesses is to be competitive with cheap  and high-quality goods and services. Also, businesses must bear  in mind that they can no longer expect nor can they receive more  assistance from the government and the people.</p>

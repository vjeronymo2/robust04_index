			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-PITCHER BOUTON STRIKES OUT IN COURT  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today burst former major leaguer Jim Bouton's hopes of  winning a big-stakes contract battle over a baseball bubble gum product that  resembles chewing tobacco.  </P> <P> Bouton, a former pitcher and best-selling author, lost an appeal to revive a  $1-million damage award.  </P> <P> The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out the award  against a subsidiary of the Wrigley chewing gum company.  </P> <P> Bouton, whose best pitching days were in the 1960s with the New York Yankees,  was with a minor league team in Portland, Ore., in 1977, when he and Coach Rob  Nelson came up with the idea that led to Big League Chew, shredded bubble gum  in a pouch.  </P> <P> The novelty was a bonanza that launched Bouton's business career. Sales were  $18 million in 1981 after Bouton and Nelson teamed up with Amurol Products Co.  of Naperville, Ill., a Wrigley subsidiary, to market the bubble gum.  </P> <P> Bouton got into a dispute with Amurol in 1984 over an advertising campaign for  the bubble gum. That led to a mailgram the company sent to Bouton agreeing to  new contract terms. The mailgram became the focus of the court dispute.  </P></p>

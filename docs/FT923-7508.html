			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Kabul suffers night of rocket duelling A NIGHT-LONG rocket duel between rebel forces and pro-government troops ended early yesterday with defence ministry officials claiming to have repulsed the attack, AP reports from Kabul. For a week rebels loyal to fundamentalist rebel Gulbuddin Hekmatyar have been pounding the capital with rockets, killing an estimated 1,000 people. The three-month-old Afghan government expelled Mr Hekmatyar and his fundamentalist Hezb-e-Islami group last Friday. Mr Hekmatyar has vowed to destroy the capital unless an Uzbek militia, led by Gen Rashid Dostam, is evicted from Kabul. Clashes between rival Sunni and Shia rebels on the western outskirts of Kabul have been aggravating the violence in the city.</p>

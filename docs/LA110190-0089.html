			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PATIENTS MOVED AFTER LEAK FLOODS HOSPITAL  </P> <P> A water pipe believed to have been broken by construction workers sent water  cascading down several floors of Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar, forcing  hospital workers to move about two dozen patients, officials said.  </P> <P> A one-inch pipe in a sixth-floor restroom broke about 9:16 p.m. Tuesday, Los  Angeles Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said.  </P> <P> Water gushing from the pipe caused flooding down to the third floor, but the  fifth and sixth floors were the hardest hit with several inches of water  reported in the hallways.  </P> <P> Assistant Hospital Administrator Mario Sewell said 10 patients in the  adolescent psychiatric ward were moved from their sixth-floor rooms soon after  the pipe burst; 16 patients in rooms directly below the pipe were also moved.  All the patients were moved back to their rooms Wednesday, Sewell said.  </P></p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Moslems and Serbs seek refuge by the bridge of fear 'I DO NOT know if we will be able to defend the police station tonight,' said the police chief of Zvornik as shots rang out piercing the silence. The police station lies tucked beneath the hills from where the Moslem police officers say their former colleagues, Serbs, are launching mortar and artillery assaults on Zvornik. Most of the 13,000 inhabitants of Zvornik, about 60 per cent Moslem and 40 per cent Serb, fearing war, have fled the town over the past week. It stands deserted except for men wielding Kalashnikovs and hunting rifles. Serbs control one section of Zvornik. The Moslem-controlled part can be reached by crossing the bridge from Serbia over the River Drina. It leads to a dead end, blocked by heavy vehicles and several Moslem guards carrying automatic weapons. 'There is war, hysteria and panic. But no one has been killed,' said the police chief who is afraid of retaliation and refuses to give his name. He appears confused about what went wrong in the once-harmonious town. Last week 40 Serb officers took weapons, cars and walky-talkies to form their own police station. 'The situation detoriated over independence. Serbs want to be part of Greater Serbia - we want an independent Bosnia,' says a Moslem officer. Zvornik is now under siege. The Moslem police and reserve officers pledge to defend the town but a local journalist says: 'This area cannot be defended whenever they want Zvornik will be captured.' While they maintain their all-night vigil, the police chief, is trying to organise an exchange of prisoners. 'We captured four Chetniks (Serb extremists) last night with automatic weapons, knives and a metal chain used for strangulation.' He tells an army intelligence officer in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital: 'I want them to get out of town safely, not only because of them - but because of the situation.' The policemen wonder if their Serbian prisoners, who say they were in town awaiting orders, were a provocation. They believe that it may have been an attempt to provoke real violence instead of this bloodless war. A panicky officer reports news of an imminent attack. The shooting becomes louder. They peer through the windows looking for the invisible snipers. The police chief says: 'The future of Zvornik is not decided here.' He estimates that at least 2,000 ultra-nationalist Serb fighters have come from Serbia and are in the region waiting to attack. Back across the river, dozens of Serb police officers and irregulars stand guard, waving away bystanders. 'Hey, where are you going? Don't cross the bridges,' one officer in full combat gear, calls out to two Serb peasant women. 'They're shooting over there.' Another Serb woman tells how she must reach her children in Malesic, a village by Zvornik. But a Serb policeman angrily interrupts her and tells watching journalists to go home. 'Get away, go back to America,' he shouts, showing his anger at the US and EC recognition of Bosnia.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Technology: Going with the flow Power fluidics, a new technology which uses the flow of liquids or gases instead of mechanical devices to control manufacturing processes, is set for widespread application in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The UK Atomic Energy Authority originally developed power fluidics as a maintenance-free way of controlling highly corrosive and radioactive fluids in the nuclear industry. Now, in its new guise of AEA Technology, it is transferring the system to non-nuclear users. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drug company, agreed earlier this year to develop power fluidics for some of its key manufacturing processes, starting with antibiotics. And this week AEA signed an agreement with Foster Wheeler, the international engineering contractor, to exploit the technology more widely in the pharmaceutical industry. Power fluidics does away with the need for mechanical devices such as valves, pumps and mixers. No moving parts come into contact with the process fluid. Instead, hydrodynamic forces such as a swirling vortex are used to control it. For example, AEA has developed three different fluidic mixers to replace conventional stirrers. They can produce fast, medium or slow mixing, depending on the chemical conditions required. According to AEA and SB, the advantages of fluidics include: reduced maintenance requirements and costs; increased product yield and quality; more compact and therefore less expensive process equipment; move from batch to continuous processing; environmental benefits through increased reliability and reduced waste. Ray Allen, who runs AEA's processing engineering department, says power fluidics is already bringing in revenues of Pounds 1m a year. These are expected to increase rapidly, once Foster Wheeler starts marketing the technology to its customers in the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. Although drug manufacturing is likely to be the largest application, AEA will also sell power fluidics to other process industries where maintenance-free operation is important, including off-shore oil.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Investment firms face tougher EC rules on capital: Smaller financial advisers and fund managers most affected HUNDREDS OF British investment firms may be forced either to raise more capital or to change their business activities because of a European Community directive set to take effect at the end of 1995. The directive will impose much tougher rules on many smaller firms, and regulatory officials fear that some may find themselves undercapitalised by EC standards. For the first time, UK investment firms will be required to hold an initial amount of capital, ranging from Pounds 39,000 to Pounds 560,000, depending on the nature of the business. The rules are a prelude to the European 'passport' which firms will be able to hold from December 31 1995 in order to conduct cross-border activities. This week the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, and the self-regulatory bodies which oversee the industry directly are writing to member firms to explain the requirements and to seek details about their capital position. The SIB points out to firms that they must comply with the directive to remain in business, and warns that it 'is not a consultative document'. The regulators are worried that some firms may ignore the directive because they do not intend to seek business outside Britain. An official of the Securities and Futures Authority, which regulates stockbrokers, said: 'Either you are in this industry or you are out. You do not have to be opening offices in Frankfurt or Paris to be affected.' The UK has vigorously urged that the EC adopt capital requirements closer to its own over the five years that the directive has been debated in Brussels. However, the EC has been under pressure, particularly from France and Germany where investment business is largely conducted by banks, to set high minimum capital requirements. As well as the rules on initial capital, firms will also have to have enough to cover their fixed overheads for 13 weeks and to cover risks associated with their trading position. While large securities firms must now meet broadly equivalent standards under UK rules for these categories of capital, smaller financial advisers and fund managers have lower requirements. It is this type of firm which is likely to be most affected by the directive. 'There will be more firms which have to lock up more capital than they do now,' said an official at Imro, the self-regulatory body for fund managers. 'Initial capital is the nasty shock.' Meanwhile, the Treasury is being lobbied by the investment industry to interpret the Brussels directive liberally. But even with a liberal interpretation of the directive, officials at the self-regulatory bodies believe that a significant minority of firms may not meet the standards. Those which think they may not are being invited in the letter to apply for 'grandfathering' - under which they can be eased into the new regime. Securities firms in capital squeeze, Page 6</p>

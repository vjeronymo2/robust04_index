			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Allegheny Denied Extension: A U. S. bankruptcy court judge has denied a request  by Allegheny International to extend for six weeks its exclusive right to plan  its reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws. The judge's decision  clears the way for the appliance maker's creditors to file their own  reorganization plans, which could include proposals to sell all or part of the  company. The extension would have been Allegheny's 10th since filing for  protection from creditors in February, 1988; the latest period expired June 2.  "There's almost a disease abroad," said Judge Joseph Cosetti, announcing his  decision. "When you don't know what to do, you delay."  </P></p>

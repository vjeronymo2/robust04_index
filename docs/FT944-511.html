			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: A mouth-watering bite Sir, Nick Gillies does the legal profession a great disservice with regard to the generosity of solicitors in the area of biscuits ('City thefts take the biscuit', December 20, and Letters, December 23), as this act of hospitality can yield unexpectedly profitable results for clients and staff alike. Clifford Chance who, according to Gillies, restrict the issue of chocolate biscuits to two per head, provide Jacobs Club biscuits in their selection. Inside the wrapper is a scratch game which requires one to scratch, with a silver coin, three squares; and, if the numbers revealed match, the player wins a cash prize. I was very pleased during a recent meeting to select three matching squares and win Pounds 100. Unable to contain my surprise, I expressed joy at this good fortune, whereupon there was an unsightly scramble for the remaining biscuits. There can be few occasions when a client leaves a lawyer's office with money in his pocket and I would urge an early visit to 200 Aldersgate Street before the senior partners institute a charge for opening the lucky wrapper. Mark Stadler, 21 Mountfield Road, Ealing, London W5 2NG</p>

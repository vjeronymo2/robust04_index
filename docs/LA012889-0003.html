			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> AMERICAN AND DELTA MAY BLEND RESERVATION SYSTEMS  </P> <P> American Airlines and Delta Airlines said Friday that they are involved in  discussions to merge their computer reservation systems. The airlines said that  if a transaction were concluded, they would establish an independent company to  operate the system.  </P> <P> American's computerized system, called Sabre, is already the largest of five  U.S. computerized systems with more than 8,000 locations. Delta's system,  called DATASII, is the smallest, with about 2,000 locations.  </P> <P> Airline observers maintain that a computerized reservation system is one of the  essential ingredients needed to survive in the deregulated airline environment.  </P> <P> Because of the great disparity in size between American's and Delta's systems,  "if money changes hands, it will flow from Delta to American," said Edmund S.  Greenslet, publisher of the Airline Monitor, a monthly review of airline  financial trends. "American is putting more into the pot than is Delta."  </P> <P> He said a variety of studies have concluded that it was undesirable to have so  much market power in the hands of just a few companies. The smaller airlines,  as well as hotels and car rental companies, pay reservation fees ranging from  $1 to $1.50 to the computer reservation systems. Both American and Delta charge  $1.50 per transaction, according to a 1988 study by the Transportation  Department.  </P> <P> In terse, identically worded announcements both airlines said it is  contemplated that the combined system initially would be owned 50% by American  and 50% by Delta. The combined system would operate as an "autonomous" company,  the airlines said. The airlines said they "contemplate" offering interests in  the new system to others, including domestic and international carriers.  </P> <P> Travel Weekly, a travel industry newspaper, reported on Friday that Lufthansa,  the West Germany carrier, and Japan Air Lines, would invest in the new company.  But a spokeswoman for Lufthansa said Friday that "we have not heard from  Germany about that, so we cannot comment." A JAL spokesman said there was  nothing to the reports.  </P> <P> American said it had, in the past, spoken to others concerning joint computer  reservation activities but that none of these discussions had resulted in an  agreement. "Therefore, there can be no assurance that the proposed transaction  can be accomplished on mutually agreeable terms." Both carriers said there  would be no further word until there is an agreement or the discussions are  broken off.  </P> <P> The computer systems were started in the 1960s by airlines. Thereafter,  attempts were made to launch some independent systems, but the government  denied immunity from antitrust laws to allow discussions, and such efforts were  dropped and the airlines' systems became giants.  </P> <P> There is great value in the reservation systems. Two years ago, United Airlines  sold half of Covia, the company that owns Apollo, to a group including some  European carriers and USAir, for $500,000.  </P></p>

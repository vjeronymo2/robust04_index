			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by Bertil Lintner in Chiang Mai; quotations marks as </F> received]    [Text] A semblance of peace may be returning to Burma  after years of civil war, but it is increasingly apparent that  the chief beneficiary of the cessation in hostilities will be  the ruling military junta in Rangoon rather than the ethnic  rebels it has been battling.    In October last year, Burma's biggest ethnic rebel group,  the  Kachin Independence Army, made peace with the junta, or State  Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), and now the Karens,  the Mons and the Karennis along the Thai border have begun talks  with the central government.    The junta has benefited from being able to negotiate  separate  peace treaties with each rebel group, a process that also  resulted in the increasing marginalisation of Burman  pro-democracy groups who sought refuge in rebel strongholds.  While the patchwork peace process will probably result in a  cessation of hostilities for the time being, analysts say  fundamental differences between the Slorc and the rebels must  still be resolved before any long-term solution can be reached.    "There's a fundamental difference between the Slorc's  perception of how to solve the ethnic issue and what the  minorities themselves have been demanding throughout the years  of civil war," a Rangoon-based analyst told the REVIEW. "The  minorities and their Burma allies in the DAB (Democratic  Alliance of Burma) are basically advocating a modified version  of the federal system that existed before (the first military  coup in) 1962.    The Slorc, on the other hand, wants a system similar to  China's -- let the minorities do what they want within their  respective areas as long as they don't interfere with national  politics. Bring them to the capital dressed up in their  colourful costumes to attend conventions and congresses, but  don't let them have a say in the running of the country as a  whole."    Rangoon's actions so far lend credence to this analysis.  When the first talks were held with the Kachins in the border  town of Panghsai near China in late 1991, the government  representative, Col. Kyaw Thein of the powerful intelligence  apparatus, stated clearly that he wanted a separate deal with  the Kachins only. He also referred to the Burman members of the  DAB -- various pro- democracy groups, student organisations and  an association of dissident Buddhist monks -- as "a nuisance,"  indicating that they would not be part of the peace plan.    "It's the pro-democracy movement that is the main enemy. The  strategy is to neutralise the ethnic groups in order to  eliminate what's left of the Burman opposition," another analyst  in Bangkok said.    If that is indeed the government's goal, it is succeeding.  Since late 1990, the Karen headquarters at Manerplaw has also  been the main base not only for dissident students, but also for  fugitive MPs, who were elected in May of that year but prevented  from assuming office, as well as numerous activists from what  was Burma's main prodemocracy party, the National League for  Democracy.    A number of recent events have effectively separated the  Burman opposition from the ethnic rebels at Manerplaw. The  current peace talks -- which the Burman dissidents are opposing  -- are only one example. In September last year, five leading  Burman activists left Manerplaw to travel to the United States  to lobby at the United Nations. They have been barred from  entering Thailand by security authorities in Bangkok, whose  connivance they would need to return to Manerplaw.    Thai participation in brokering the peace talks is evident  also in the pressure that has been placed on the ethnic rebels  to negotiate with Rangoon. The Mons were the first group along  the Thai border to strike a deal with the Slorc in late  December. The Karennis, who are closely related to the Karens,  met government representatives in their area in early January.  A meeting in the border areas also reportedly took place at  about the same time between the Karen rebel leader, Gen. Bo  Mya, and Lieut.-Col. Thein Swe, the Burmese defence attache in  Bangkok.    Originally, the DAB's stated policy was not to talk to  Rangoon's representatives individually but to insist on a  political settlement that included the entire front. Under Thai  pressure, this policy now appears to have been abandoned. "But  even worse is that the ethnic groups lack any kind of  coordination. They're entering into these talks just to see  what the Slorc has to offer, not with a comprehensive,  coordinated agenda," a source close to the ethnic rebels said.</p>

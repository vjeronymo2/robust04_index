"I have come to discuss and announce the discovery of a  major  drug-trafficking network whose primary hubs were the ports of  Maracaibo, Puerto Cabello, and Punto Fijo," Montoya said.    Operation Rainbow used hollowed-out coconuts in which the  drug--presumably cocaine--would be hidden.    [Guillen] How many kilograms would be exported that way?    [Montoya] Three hundred tons of the drug.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CRISIS IN CARE: SO MUCH NEED, SO FEW NURSES  </P> <P> The American public has grown accustomed to living with a health-care system  that suffers one acute crisis after another. During the 1960s there were not  enough doctors. Now we have too many doctors. Growing health care costs  continue to escalate and there is inadequate financing of care for the poor. In  the midst of this, trauma centers and hospitals are closing and prepaid  health-care programs have gone bankrupt. It may be difficult, therefore, to  convince anyone that one of the best-kept secrets in the industry is a critical  shortage of nurses that threatens to make the situation worse. The result will  be the closure of patient care units in hospitals and the reduction or  elimination of visiting and community nursing services.  </P> <P> Several national commissions have located the nursing crisis at the educational  level, at the time young people think about choosing a career. The current  shortage will only become worse unless we can reverse the declining interest  among young people in nursing. The solution requires, in addition to money,  improving the work environment.  </P> <P> Right now, more than 80% of the nation's 2 million nurses are already working,  although some are part-time employees. In 1972 there were 50 nurses per 100  patients, whereas in 1986 there were 91 nurses per 100 patients. In today's  hospitals, patients are sicker and the treatments more sophisticated. The  nearly 1-1 nurse-patient relationship is not a factor of more bed-baths or  taking more vital signs. Providing care has become a far more complex service;  there is increased demand for nurses with advanced educational preparation, to  monitor and respond to the life-support technology critically ill patients  require. Modern medical care requires a nurse well-grounded in both the  biological and social sciences, a professional able to attend the needs of  patients and their families.  </P> <P> With the expanded nature of the work-load and the limitations faced by nurses  in the workplace, it is no surprise that bright, caring young women so often  look elsewhere. Their career-options are now much broader than nursing or  teaching; they are encouraged to become doctors, lawyers or business  executives. These choices offer larger opportunities for more income, prestige  and control over their work environments.  </P> <P> Today, hospitals are spending enormous sums to recruit nurses -- from abroad or  from each other. Wages have increased as a function of demand, but clinical  nurses reach the top of their salary range in five to seven years. To gain more  income and prestige -- or to feel more responsible for the care provided --  they are likely to move into management and away from the bedside.  </P> <P> Some health-care practitioners -- the American Medical Assn. in particular --  would relieve the nursing shortage by adding a new person with a limited job  description: "registered care technologist" -- a high school graduate trained  to perform non-nursing tasks. Yet in the process of routine bedside nursing  tasks, professional nurses are able to make some of their most critical  clinical observations, the early warning signs of physiological deterioration.  Let those who would solve the problem with new job titles work exclusively with  barely trained people -- at least for a while. Such people might be more easy  to "control," but God help the patients.  </P> <P> The nursing shortage will not be solved -- or susceptible to solution -- until  hospital administrators and physicians accept this contemporary fact: The  environment they helped to create for nurses, one that may have worked for them  30 years ago, does not provide the quality of working life that young women and  men want and that able young adults deserve.  </P> <P> After 32 years in nursing, I begin to ask myself, "What if we 'owned' the  nursing units? What if we were involved in decision-making about the care of  patients and the organization of our work? What if we set the standards for  care and decided which institutions provide the quality of care that met our  professional expectations?" In some instances, we make those decisions out of  necessity right now, because there are not enough of us. But few of us are  involved as professional partners in the day-to-day decisions about our  environment.  </P> <P> The California Nurses Assn. has worked diligently with nursing-related  organizations throughout the state to improve our stature and implement  strategies to deal with the shortage. Our efforts include setting more rigorous  standards for professional practice, but we cannot solve the crisis by  ourselves. We also need support from the public, hospitals and physicians to  improve the structure of the workplace so that nursing practice meets our  needs, as well as those of patients, attending physicians and hospital  management.  </P> <P> As long as the media-portrayed image of "handmaidens" or "bimbos" persists,  being a nurse has a limited future, with limited opportunities to participate  in thedecisions affecting one's sense of self-worth.  </P> <P> Stop and ask yourself: Would you want your daughter or son to become a nurse?  On the other hand, the next time you are unfortunate enough to be in a hospital  bed, who would you like to answer your call light? After your discharge from  the hospital, who would you like to help you, your family and friends deal with  the self-care activities related to recovery? In a concerned, good world, there  will be a competent nurse available, with the appropriate educational  preparation to provide a quality of care that will make a difference.  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Flotations mean business for City solicitors - Legal briefs A flood of flotations has been good news for City solicitors. Linklaters &amp; Paines was the leading legal adviser in the final quarter of last year: it was involved in 13 new issues as sol- icitor to the issue or the company. Clifford Chance and Ashurst Morris Crisp were equal second for their involvement in nine issues each. Slaughter and May was fourth with eight issues; Herbert Smith fifth with seven; and Freshfields, Norton Rose and Travers Smith Braithwaite equal sixth with five each. Figures from accountants KPMG show 73 companies joined the official London list in the final quarter of 1993, the highest number since KPMG began keeping records in the mid-1980s.</p>

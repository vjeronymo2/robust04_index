			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: US payroll week THE main focus for the foreign exchange market this week will be the US non-farm payroll figure for April due out on Friday, writes James Blitz. Traditionally, the payroll figure is the most important US indicator affecting the dollar, and this week it takes on particular significance. Recent US data have shown that the strong upturn in the US economy seen in the fourth quarter of last year did not follow through to the first quarter of 1993. Last Friday's data under-lined that the US economic upturn is proving to be sluggish. US personal consumption, for example, showed a decline of 0.2 per cent in March against expect-ations of a 0.1 per cent dip. After the net fall of 22,000 in the headline payroll figure in the March month, analysts appear to be looking for a rise of 175,000 in the April number. Mr Neil MacKinnon, how-ever, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, believes the figure will only show an increase of around 70,000. He thinks that the drop in personal consumption and the difficulty that President Bill Clinton has had getting his budget stimulus package through congress require a downward revision in growth forecasts for this year. The poor news on the economy is particularly disappointing for dollar investors because it comes amid new indications that the Bundesbank wants to cut interest rates further, narrowing the differential between short-term German and US rates. There is little expectation of another reduction in official German interest rates at this week's Bundesbank council meeting. However, last Friday's cut in Germany's three-day Treasury Bill rate has raised new speculation that the discount rate floor will be lowered later this month.</p>

This amendment requires the same design changes and procedures as the previous AD, except that it would eliminate the 500 hours' time-in-service repetitive inspections for centering plug disbonding. This amendment is prompted by an improved bonding and repair procedure and the lack of reports concerning the movement or disbonding of the centering plug. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the centering plug from disbonding and moving out of position, which could result in loss of tail rotor control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective September 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Sikorsky Aircraft, Commercial Customer Support, 6900 Main Street, Stratford, Connecticut 06601&hyph;1381.

Thompson, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Section, ANE&hyph;152, FAA, Boston Aircraft Certification Office, New England Region, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803, telephone (617) 238&hyph;7162, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 84&hyph;06&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;4829 (49 FR 10922, March 23, 1984) which is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;76A series helicopters, was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41442). That action proposed to require the same design changes and procedures as the previous AD, except that it would eliminate the 500 hours' time-in-service repetitive inspections for centering plug disbonding. This amendment is prompted by an improved bonding and repair procedure and the lack of reports concerning the movement or disbonding of the centering plug.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. However, for consistency of word usage throughout the AD and to make the language more consistent with the Sikorsky Aircraft Alert Service Bulletin 76&hyph;65&hyph;35A, Revision A, dated February 29, 1984, the word ``pressure'' that describes the part has been changed to ``retaining'' and all forms of the word ``debond'' have been changed to ``disbond.'' Other minor editorial changes were made, also. Therefore, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 190 Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;76A series helicopters of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 150 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will save approximately 4 work hours per helicopter by discontinuing the current 500 hours' time-in-service repetitive inspections, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the annual cost savings of the proposed elimination of these AD inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be $33,000 annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

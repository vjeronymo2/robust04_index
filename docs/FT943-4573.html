			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Good news is not always bad news One of the paradoxical aspects of current economic discussion is the way that good news is presented as bad. If output rises more quickly then expected or unemployment falls faster, many market commentators treat it as bad news. The reasoning is that central banks will fear 'overheating', and will be more likely, in the case of the US and Britain, to raise short-term rates or - in the case of Germany - less likely to cut them. A few dissenting economists have always suspected that the mainstream discussion was wrong and the instinctive public reaction correct. For instance, the American 'new classical' economist, Robert Barro, has chided the Federal Reserve for worrying about growth being too fast in its public presentations of interest rate policy. The issue is particularly relevant in the UK the day after chancellor Kenneth Clarke's monthly meeting with Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. In spite of a standstill in the housing market and a downward blip in consumer credit, the overall movement of the economy suggests that output is rising faster than forecasters expected. Goldman Sachs makes a plausible case that real gross domestic product outside the oil sector is likely to rise by 3 per cent this year and 4 per cent in 1995. The conclusion of the investment firm is that 'without higher interest rates there is a considerable risk of the economy growing much too fast for comfort'. There is a good chance that the Bank will express, and the chancellor accept, such a view, if not this month, then next month or soon after. Moreover, Goldman Sachs persists in its call for higher interest rates even though underlying inflation is at a 27-year low and well below the Treasury's 'optimistic' summer forecast. The Goldman economists persist in spite of their own statement that the composition of the recovery is changing in favour of exports (10 per cent up in volume on a year ago) and investment (6 1/2 per cent up), and despite their more optimistic assessment both of the current balance of payments and of the government's borrowing requirement. Obviously, there can be too much of anything. But the inflationary danger comes not from too much output or too much employment, but from too much expenditure. Indeed, to the extent that output rises to meet an increase in spending the inflationary danger is mitigated. The object of policy should surely be to encourage a rise of expenditure in cash terms fast enough to support growth but not so high to finance an inflationary take-off. In current circumstances this would be about 5-6 per cent a year, not only in the UK, but also in many other western countries. However, the precise breakdown of demand growth in any particular year between greater output and higher prices depends on the actions of businessmen, trade unionists and other agents  - as well as outside shocks and world events - and is not under the control of policymakers. The current orthodoxy is not nonsense. The general idea is that future inflation depends both on the gap between actual and capacity output and the speed with which that gap is being reduced. The capacity gap is a useful aid to thought and I have used it in these columns in spite of sarcastic notes from former finance ministers. But to use it directly for setting policy presupposes a good idea of the trend growth of capacity, the present margin of unused capacity and the size of the capacity gap required to prevent inflation accelerating. It also depends on having a good idea of the likely growth of output under unchanged policy. It is idle pretence to suppose this knowledge exists. The two years ahead, on which the Bank claims to take a view, are not nearly far enough for its present approach. For the main question about current trends is not whether they may lead to a temporary inflation peak of 4 per cent in 1996 - with which we could live - but a cumulative pressure on resources which will lead to ever rising inflation in subsequent years. It may be that because of supply-side improvements, the UK economy could sustain 4 per cent growth for several years ahead. On the other hand even 3 per cent growth may be too high. Goldman Sachs makes a brave attempt to bypass these imponderables with two sets of leading indicators, which have had an empirical relation to inflationary turning points. The shorter indicator contains only three items  -import prices, earnings and gilt-edged yields. This indicator gives a lead averaging six months, but it gave scant warning of the inflationary pressures of the late 1980s and its recent upturn is minuscule. The longer indicator contains 11 variables, ranging from monetary aggregates and house prices to industrial production and skilled labour shortages. The lead time here has averaged 20 months, but varied from 5 to 44. It has been rising, although not strongly, for 36 months. Such an index is a useful supplement to a conventional forecast, as are the bond market's inflation expectations. But all three signals together still leave 75 per cent of the decision to hunch, judgment and fashion. My own often-stated preference is an objective for total national expenditure of which the headline measure is Nominal GDP and which can be popularised as a national cash objective. It has the great advantage of not pretending that monetary policy influences only inflation, and its pursuit would provide a safeguard against the kind of collapse of spending which took place in the 1930s Depression. A nominal demand objective would also provide some reassurance against fears - recently voiced by Jacques Delors - that downward pay flexibility would defeat itself by reducing demand for products and labour. Indeed the Bank's economic director Mervyn King went part of the way, in a little-noticed section of his 1994 Institute of Fiscal Studies Lecture, to argue that by making use of the full range of the 1 1/2 -4 per cent official inflation target, something approaching the aims of a Nominal GDP objective might be fulfilled. But quite apart from the question of whether that speech is official policy, it does not go far enough. For it still depends on what economists call a well-determined short-term Philips curve - that is, an idea of the level of activity which would go with any given rate of inflation. Many of the objections to a nominal demand objective misunderstand the proposal as one for short-term fine-tuning. That is why critics put so much emphasis on delays and revisions to the quarterly GDP data. In fact the intention is to influence the trend of spending rather than to hit a precise quarterly or even yearly path. If the idea were ever taken seriously it would probably be best to concentrate not on the exact measure known as Nominal GDP but on some alternative such as domestic expenditure at factor cost. The chart shows how this measure explains, more convincingly than any other kind of analysis, the effects of the credit boom of the 1980s. The rise in underlying inflation was not that great, but inflationary spending was diverted into imports, which provided a safety valve while policy was being tightened. The outstanding advantage of a nominal demand objective in present circumstances is that it would reduce reliance on forecasts. If a set of leading indicators could be developed for nominal expenditure so much the better. But it would not be disastrous to rely on what is actually happening. A slump would soon show itself in the growth of nominal expenditure falling below a 5-6 per cent objective, as it did in 1991-92. Overheating would show itself in expenditure rising persistently above it. The ride would not be smooth, but it will not be anyway.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           NOMINAL GDP VERSUS INFLATION OBJECTIVE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Nominal GDP target of 5% growth pa  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             Allows eg, 2 1/2% inflation plus 2 1/2% growth                      or  0 inflation plus 5% growth                      or  5% inflation plus zero growth  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Offical target  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             Allows       1 1/2% to 4% inflation                          No (even conditional) growth objectives             Allows eg 2 1/2% inflation and minus 1% growth             Also allows price level to double in 28 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

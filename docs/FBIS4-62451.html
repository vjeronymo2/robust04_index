			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Indira Dunayeva report under the "Parliament" rubric: </F> "State Duma's Debut in a New Place. Lawmaking Activity Resumed  With New Vigor"]    [Text] At the State Duma's new head office (the former  building of the USSR State Planning Committee) yesterday, a  number of Duma committees that have had time to move there held  their meetings.    The Legislation and Judicial-Law Reform Committee passed its  opinion on the draft federal law "On the Basic Guarantees of  Citizens' Electoral Rights," which was discussed by the  committee back on 25 April. The opinion says that the draft's  content is inconsistent with its name -- in particular,  "regarding the extent to which a number of the draft's  provisions, for instance, on electoral commissions, are related  to the guarantees of citizens' electoral rights." Committee  members think it arguable that the electoral commissions should  be defined as bodies of state power and the Central Electoral  Commission as a federal state body. In the committee's view,  the law gives an unreasonably narrow interpretation of citizens'  electoral rights, which boil down to the right to elect and to  get elected, while the nomination of candidates, the conduct of  electoral campaigns, and so forth have been left outside the  term. In addition, the draft does not establish an upper age  limit upon reaching which the citizen may not get elected. When  assessing the document in general, however, the committee  proposed that it be submitted to the State Duma for  consideration, while at the same time setting up for further  work a joint group made up of deputies, Duma committee staffers,  and also representatives of the Russian president and the  Central Electoral Commission.    Having considered the draft federal law "On Making  Amendments  and Additions to the RSFSR Code on Administrative Law  Violations," the Legislation Committee made numerous editorial  amendments to it and recommended that the draft be brought in  line with the Russian Federation Constitution, after which it  should be put before the State Duma Council.    The Committee on the Affairs of Public Associations and  Religious Organizations was preoccupied with preparations for  two roundtables -- 16 May, on the draft law on political  parties; and 19 May, on the draft law on trade unions. The  roundtables will be attended by representatives of parties and  trade union leaders. Yesterday, a commission preparing  parliamentary hearings on the threat of fascism in Russia held  its meeting at the same committee.    The Committee on Information Policy and Communications  considered amendments to the Law on Coverage of Government  Authorities' Activity by State-Owned Mass Media. According to  Igor Yakovenko, a committee member, the law is currently leading  in the number of amendments made to it. The committee decided  to back only those that eliminate excessive regulation of mass  media activity. In addition, the committee elected its  representatives -- Igor Yakovenko ("Yabloko") and Valentin  Chikin (Communist Party of the Russian Federation) -- to sit on  the commission on state support for the mass media at the  Russian Press Committee.</p>

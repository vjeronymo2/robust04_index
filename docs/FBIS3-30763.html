			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of the UN </F> secretary general for the former Yugoslavia, and General Michael  Rose, UN Protection Forces commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina,  after talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in  Belgrade on 7 February; all questions and answers are in English  with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian -- recorded]    [Text] [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr.  Akashi, how do you assess the talks with President Milosevic and  what was the purpose of your visit?    [Akashi] For me, this was an opportunity to discuss all  essential questions, promote peace, and reduce tensions in the  region for which I am responsible. It was a good, business-like  discussion on numerous concrete issues.    [Unidentified correspondent] Could you be more specific,  please?    [Akashi] Yes. We discussed the development of the situation  in Sarajevo. We also discussed the issue of Srebrenica and  Tuzla. We discussed ways to improve the humanitarian aid in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and also the normalization of relations  between Serbia and Croatia. Therefore, the talks touched upon  numerous issues.    [Unidentified correspondent] Was Milosevic in favor of  Sarajevo's demilitarization?    [Akashi] Yes, he truly hopes for progress on the issue of UN  administration of Sarajevo and the town's demilitarization, even  before the peace agreement is reached.    [Unidentified correspondent] I have a question for Michael  Rose. Do you hold any new information about the explosion in  Sarajevo?    [Rose] Which one are you referring to?    [Unidentified correspondent] The bomb that fell on Saturday,  it is impossible to say where it came from. However, some  people already accuse the Serbs.    [Rose] We base our assessments on technical analyses.    [Unidentified correspondent] General, how would you comment  on such a destructive effect of only one mortar bomb?    [Rose] The destruction was great for one bomb alone. The  reason that it occurred is that it landed on a market stall at  waist height. For this reason, the effect was to devastating.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Akashi, what do you think  is the future of the Geneva talks?    [Akashi] President Milosevic assured me that the talks on 10  February will be held and that topics of interest will be  discussed by the three sides.    [Unidentified correspondent] How do you comment on possible  air strikes against the positions of the Bosnian Serbs?    [Akashi] I believe that the NATO Council will examine the  question of air strikes in relation to the proposal by the UN  secretary general.    [Unidentified correspondent] What will your report to the UN  Security Council contain regarding the present situation?    [Akashi] I will inform the UN Security Council about the  reports and findings that I have already sent to New York. My  latest report, of yesterday, referred to an immediate and total  cease-fire. We will continue with our efforts even though there  have been no results so far as a cease-fire would be extremely  useful to reduce tensions and prevent tragedies like the ones we  have seen in Sarajevo in the last few days.    [Unidentified correspondent] Are you worried that if strikes  do take place this will escalate the entire matter?    [Akashi] I believe that everybody is definitely worried  about the consequences of any sort of air strikes.    [Unidentified correspondent] Are you worried for UN troops  in Bosnia now?    [Akashi] We are worried about many things, yes. O.K.?  Thank you very much. [end recording]</p>

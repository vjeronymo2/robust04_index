			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Citicorp lifts write-offs by 72% to Dollars 4.9bn CITICORP, the biggest US bank which is struggling to contain losses and cut costs, yesterday reported a 72 per cent cent jump in total loan write-offs to Dollars 4.9bn for 1991. The bank also unveiled a Dollars 457m loss for the year, which compares with a Dollars 458m net profit for 1990. Citicorp's losses, Dollars 133m in the fourth quarter, had been forecast by Mr John Reed, the chairman. Total bad debt provisions for 1991 rose by 46 per cent, to Dollars 3.89bn. Mr Reed, as expected, yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Onno Ruding, a former Dutch finance minister, as vice-chairman of Citicorp with responsibility for the troubled corporate finance division. Mr Michael Callen, former head of Citicorp's corporate division, left last week. Earnings from Citicorp's global consumer banking division, which has in the past provided up to 60 per cent of the bank's total core earnings, slumped by 39.3 per cent in 1991, to Dollars 549m. The corporate division Mr Ruding is taking over, which covers North America, Europe and Japan, suffered a 1991 loss of Dollars 1.02bn, nearly four times the level of 1990's Dollars 275m loss. The cross-border refinancing portfolio managed a Dollars 187m profit in 1991, compared with a loss of Dollars 317m the previous year. The international banking and finance division achieved a modest improvement in 1991, with profit rising to Dollars 426m from Dollars 407m in 1990. Mr Reed yesterday reiterated his expectation that Citicorp would return to profitability in 1992. He also said the bank's cost-cutting and capital-bolstering plan remained on track. Operating expenses in 1991 were Dollars 10.3bn, but this excludes restructuring charges of Dollars 750m. In 1990, Citicorp's operating expenses were Dollars 10.8bn, excluding Dollars 300m of restructuring charges. The ratio of Citicorp's common equity to total assets at the end of 1991 was 3.4 per cent, down from 3.8 per cent at the end of 1990 and still well below the US banking industry average. The bank's total revenues for 1991 were Dollars 14.8bn, compared with Dollars 14.6bn in 1990. Total assets at the end of 1991 were Dollars 222bn, down from Dollars 232bn a year before. The number of employees fell to 86,000 at the year-end from 95,000 at the end of 1990. The Citicorp dividend was halted, as previously announced. Welcoming hand, Page 23</p>

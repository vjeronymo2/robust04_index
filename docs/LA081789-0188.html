			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LINNEY SCALED MOUNTAIN OF A NOVEL AND UNCOVERED THE PLAY 'HEATHEN VALLEY'  </P> <P> "I'm not sure why I wanted to do it," said Romulus Linney about his novel  "Heathen Valley" that he turned into a play. "Maybe it was just wondering if I  could. As a novel, it's a sprawling historical story with many characters. But  as I got into it, I found that underneath a great deal of what was the novel,  there was a sort of play lurking."  </P> <P> Linney, who wrote the novel 27 years ago, rewrote it as a play two years ago  and directed the piece in its maiden stagings -- at the Philadelphia Festival  for New Plays, Milwaukee Rep and New York's Theatre for the New City.  </P> <P> "It's in as good shape as I could get it," noted the Philadelphia-born writer  on the phone from his home in New York. "And now it's on its own." On Friday, a  new production of "Heathen Valley" opens at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Based on an actual 19th-Century incident in rural North Carolina (where the  family of Linney's father was from and where he himself spent many of his  growing-up years), the story centers on a community parish which doubled as a  clinic and primitive school. It was founded by an Episcopalian bishop and run  by a native-born "mountain man." When the bishop has a change of heart and  joins the Catholic Church, the mission falls apart.  </P> <P> "I asked myself, 'What would happen to these very basic Appalachian  mountaineers if this mission was built up -- which they thought a great deal of  and which did a great deal for them -- and then, for some reason, it was taken  away?' For me, it was a story of regeneration betrayed. I don't know about  other writers, but the first thing I have to find is a good story. And somehow,  it has to have something to do with me personally."  </P> <P> Linney notes that the connection needn't be firsthand.  </P> <P> "I've written plays about historical figures, Frederick the Great and (Lord)  Byron among them. But in both cases, in reading about these great lives,  there's been something about them that's had great personal meaning. Then I  have the authority -- or feel I have the authority -- to go ahead and write  about such Titanic figures.  </P> <P> "It's the same with 'Heathen Valley.' Also, these people are kind of my  ancestors. So I felt that I had some kinship and a great deal of admiration for  them."  </P> <P> Nowadays, Linney, who squeezed in an Army stint between studies at Oberlin  College in Ohio and graduate directing/acting courses at Yale Drama School,  divides his time between teaching duties at the University of Pennsylvania and  Columbia College. He is married to a college professor and has two grown  daughters.  </P> <P> "Of course, creative writing can't be taught," he said. "But what you can do is  create an atmosphere in class where somebody's work is presented and very  candid, supportive things can be said: truthful yet helpful."  </P> <P> The work is emotionally satisfying -- and physically manageable.  </P> <P> "I teach (in Pennsylvania) one day a week; it's only 1 1/2 hours on the Amtrak.  When I get there I have a three-hour seminar, then I see some students -- then  I get on the train and come back."  </P> <P> Linney (who has received Rockefeller, Guggenheim and National Endowment for the  Arts grants, plus a 1980 Obie for his play "Tennessee" and a 1987 American  Theatre Critics award for "Heathen Valley") counts music as his main influence.  </P> <P> "When I was growing up, I had no idea what I was going to do -- but I knew it  would be something that music spoke about. My father was a doctor, a very fine,  civilized man. We had a nice life, but there was no art connected to it. The  thing that affected me most -- way back in the '30s -- was hearing concerts on  the radio. Whatever it was, I responded to. I guess music being the most  abstract of the arts, once you're moved by it, you want to find out everything  that has to do with it.  </P> <P> "So you start reading really good books instead of detective stories -- and it  becomes a search. It's like when you first read Poe instead of having somebody  tell you how wonderful it is. Then it becomes yours. Of course, when you first  start writing, you do imitate. I wrote a little bit like Faulkner -- those  huge, sprawling rhetorical things -- and a Swedish Nobel Prize-winner, Par  Lagerkvist, who writes very fine, concise, crystalline prose. So it was kind of  an odd crossbreeding."  </P> <P>  "Heathen Valley" by Romulus Linney will be staged at the Gem Theatre, 12852  Main St., Garden Grove. Preview performance tonight at 8.

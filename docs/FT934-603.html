			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Footsie futures regained their lead against the underlying stock market yesterday as buyers returned, writes Peter John. The March contract opened at 3,355 and moved ahead to 3,390, at which stage it reflected a premium of some 30 points to cash. Then in the afternoon, dealers said there was heavy buying linked to expiry of a large tailor-made Footsie option expiring at 3,350. Morgan Stanley, the US investment house, was believed to be behind the deal. The house, which has a prestigious global client list, has become a by-word for large futures related deals in the past few months. In mid-November it bought 8,000 FT-SE puts - options to sell the market at a fixed time and price. By the official close, just after 4pm, the March contract hit 3,377 on moderate turnover of 6,711 lots but the buying pressure pushed it back up by another 10 points in after hours dealing. Fair value for the March contract - the premium which factors in the cost of carrying minus the dividends that would be had by holding the underlying stocks - is estimated at around 18 points. On the options side of LIFFE, total turnover of 49,139 lots was up from 37,336 lots on Tuesday but activity was boosted by expiry of a number of stock options. Some 25 stocks had their December series expiring and all the most actively-traded issues - British Gas (5,634 lots), Dixons (3,582), Glaxo (2,554), Barclays (2,494), TSB (1,846) and Hillsdown (1,698) - reflected the technical situation. Turnover in Footsie-related options was less than 18,000 contracts.</p>

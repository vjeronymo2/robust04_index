			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Travel and tourism to account for 13% of consumer spending THE travel and tourism industry is expected to contribute Dollars 3,500bn to the world economy in 1993 - a 20 per cent increase on its Dollars 2,900bn contribution in 1990, according to Wharton Econometric Forecasting in a study commissioned by the World Travel and Tourism Council.* 'The challenge for both governments and our industry is to lift our vision above today's economic trenches to the renewed growth, market dynamism and competitive opportunity beckoning on the horizon,' said Mr James D Robinson III, Chairman of American Express and chairman of the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council, in a comment on the study. He called for policies to liberalise markets, improve infrastructure, and eliminate bureaucratic trading barriers, at the same time emphasising that the sector must expand 'in harmony with the environment'. The study predicts that the industry will account for 127m jobs worldwide by next year. It will attract Dollars 422bn in investment (6.7 per cent of the expected world total) and will account for Dollars 2,000bn in consumer spending - perhaps 13 per cent of all consumer spending. The importance of the sector is consistently underestimated, according to Wharton Econometrics, which shows in a survey of 20 countries that policymakers see it as the eighth most important economic contributor. Their study shows travel and tourism as the world's biggest in 1990, and likely to remain so into the 21st century. Looking ahead to the year 2005, the study warns of increasing congestion in the air, increasing attention to environmental issues, and the emergence of ecotourism and rural tourism as new growth areas. It predicts a real compound growth for the industry of 3.9 per cent, with its global economic contribution doubling to Dollars 9,673bn in nominal terms, and consumer spending on travel and tourism up to Dollars 5,800bn in nominal terms. A further 40m jobs will be created, lifting the world total to almost 170m. Wharton Econometrics based its projections on methods proposed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations and the World Tourism Council (WTC). * Travel &amp; Tourism, the WTTC Report, 1992.

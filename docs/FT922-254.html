			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Lloyd's moves on efficiency FIRST STEPS towards possible broad changes in the management of Lloyd's of London will be taken this week as the troubled insurance market braces itself for the results of two extensive inquiries. The opening on Wednesday of an office intended to raise the efficiency of claims processing may be followed by a rationalisation at the Lloyd's corporation, which regulates and provides services to the 278 underwriting syndicates. The management of the market will figure prominently in one of two long-awaited reports, scheduled to be considered by the Lloyd's Council, the governing body, also on Wednesday. The report, drawn up by a committee headed by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, will also focus on the regulation of the market. A second report, prepared by a separate committee led by Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the City watchdog, will also be put before the council. Sir David has investigated allegations that working Names - individuals who provide the market's capital - have benefited at the expense of outside Names. Last week Lloyd's reported its worst-ever losses of Pounds 2.06bn for 1989, in time with its three-year accounting system. The market, which faces legal action from financially embarrassesd Names, is under pressure to adopt wide reforms. The new claims office will have more freedom to operate along commercial lines than its predecessor, the marine claims office. It will assume the functions of the aviation and non-marine claims offices, owned by associations of Lloyd's underwriters. The office will have wide powers to set staff levels and pay and will be able to buy in services rather than rely on the corporation's resources. In the past, underwriters and the agencies which manage them have criticised what they have seen as excessive bureaucracy in the market.</p>

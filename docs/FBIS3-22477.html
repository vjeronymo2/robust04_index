The affected towns are Ekumfi Otuam, Apam, and Komenda.    According to Dr. George K. Aggrey, Mfantsiman District  Medical Officer who led a team of medical personnel to Otuam  said 23 cases had been reported at the Otuam Health Post.    He said out of the number, 20 patients were treated and  discharged while three are on admission.    He attributed the disease to shortage of water in the area.    Dr. Charles Ntiamoah Takyi, the senior medical officer in  charge of Apam Catholic Mission Hospital, attributed the  outbreak to the acute water shortage which has hit the Apam area  for more than six months now.    According to Dr. Takyi, about 20 students were treated from  Apam Secondary School alone with diarrhoea for the past two  weeks.    Dr. Takyi advised the people to stop buying water from  petrol  and oil tankers.    He alleged that some of the petrol and oil tankers are not  well washed before they are filled with water for consumption.    Commenting on the issue, Dr. Elias Sory, Central Regional  Director of Health Services said an outbreak of cholera has also  been reported in the Komenda area.    He said apart from enough stock of drugs for the treatment  of  the disease, mobile vans have also been despatched to the  affected areas to educate the people on its prevention.    The director appealed to the people to ensure that their  environments are kept tidy at all times.</p>

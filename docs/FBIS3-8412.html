			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 9 (CTK) -- The present Slovak  cabinet, personified by Premier Vladimir Meciar, was losing the  "moral claim to legitimacy" which in a democracy is an  inseparable part of the legitimacy of power, President Michal  Kovac said in his speech to parliament today.    Political power in Slovakia is going through a period of  severe crisis, ensuing from the gradual loss of a reliable  government base in parliament and in the ranks of the governing  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Kovac said. Many  voices, he said, pointed to the autocratic methods of the  premier's government, adding that "Whoever expresses an opinion  or standpoint different from that of Vladimir Meciar is  gradually branded disloyal, unreliable and finally a traitor."    Some unethical practices such as slander and not speaking  the  truth were being carried over into the whole of society, and not  even workers in the president's office or the president himself  were immune to the premier's lunges, Kovac said.    "As soon as the premier discovered that I intended to  perform  the function of head of state with sovereignty in the spirit of  the Constitution, he gradually began to ignore me, cast doubt on  my work and finally set out to influence and discredit, which  was to result in my being prematurely removed from the post of  president," he said.    "I am not against the HZDS, nor am I against the government.  I do however have serious reservations about the ethics and  style of Mr. Meciar's political work, about the methods of his  government and about the practices which create an atmosphere of  confrontation in political life," the president stressed.    He gave a number of examples of Meciar putting pressure on  him to carry out state policy in the most immediate interest of  the HZDS, and that after he refused to do so, Meciar attacked  him sharply. Also relevant here, he said, was Meciar's  opposition to Kovac's attempts to meet the heads of district  authorities. This climaxed in the premier's announcement that  he would "immediately dismiss those functionaries who accepted  the invitation. Kovac also recalled Meciar's pressure on him to  appoint his faithful follower Ivan Lexa privatization minister  last year.    "The premier insisted on the appointment of Lexa, saying  that  the HZDS needed money and it had no other means of obtaining it.  He also promised that he would then dismiss Lexa as soon as he  had fulfilled his task," Kovac said. He also pointed to the  dispute concerning the filling of the post of foreign minister,  the offensive breaking of state protocol concerning the  president and other clashes. In general, Meciar's approach was  an "unheard-of limitation of the constitutional rights of the  head of state," he said.    Kovac denied the accusation that he would try to destabilize  the HZDS or create a new government with the help of  behind-the-scenes negotiation, and that "he behaved like an  enemy the whole time."    "The chief guilty party on the unstable domestic political  scene in Slovakia is not the president," Kovac stressed.    He then said expressly that he was not calling for the  dismissal of the current government, and called on Meciar to  think "seriously and dispassionately" about the criticisms which  he had made about the premier. He also called on parliamentary  deputies and all the components of the political spectrum in  Slovakia to cooperate and bring about national reconciliation in  the interest of the general welfare of the state.</p>

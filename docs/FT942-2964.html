			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Bonn to impose levies on all motorway trucks The German parliament yesterday voted to impose levies on all domestic and foreign trucks using the country's motorways from next year, although domestic hauliers will be partially compensated by a cut in vehicle registration fees. The decision, which follows a decade of debate over whether charges aimed at foreign truckers are discriminatory, comes as several other European governments are also planning to introduce levies to contribute to the upkeep of road networks. In Germany, only 10 of the 600 parliamentary deputies voted against the bill in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, which proposes an annual DM1,500 (Pounds 600) charge for a three-axle truck and a DM2,500 charge for four and five-axle trucks. The UK Road Haulage Association said the introduction of the motorway charges would create 'yet another expense for the British haulier'. The Netherlands is also aiming to introduce truck levies from January 1, although the necessary legislation has yet to pass through the Dutch parliament. Mr Matthias Wissman, the German transport minister, said the levies would raise around DM609m (Pounds 243m) a year, excluding the costs of managing the system, estimated at DM91m. The German upper house has yet to vote on the proposal, but its passage is taken for granted by the government. Germany is the destination for 23 per cent of international journeys by UK hauliers but it is crossed by many trucks en route to other destinations. The UK Freight Transport Association had argued for a clearing house system between European governments to reimburse countries whose roads suffered wear by foreign based hauliers. Dutch road hauliers, who handle around 25 per cent of all cross-border road freight shipments in Europe, are expected to seek compensation for the extra costs. One possibility is a reduction in vehicle tax, in line with Germany's policy for its road haulage companies. Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark also intend to introduce charges in their countries from January 1. Germany's original plan was to charge only foreign trucks for the use of German motorways while exempting domestic hauliers, though this was blocked by European authorities on the legal grounds that it was discriminatory. Mr Wissman said the tolls would put Germany on a level with other countries.</p>

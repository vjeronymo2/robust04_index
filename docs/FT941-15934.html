			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Divisions remain over tropical timber accord A fourth round of talks aimed at negotiating a successor accord to the 1983 International Tropical Timber Agreement opened in Geneva this week, with producing and consuming countries still divided over the scope and financing of the new pact. The present agreement, which has 50 members, expires at the end of March. Producer nations argue that temperate as well as tropical timber should be subject to the conservation disciplines of the new accord, which calls for all tropical timber exports to come from sustainably managed forests by the year 2000. They are also seeking extra financial aid to meet this goal. The two sides are said to have made 'some progress' during last November's meeting in Japan of the International Tropical Timber Council, which administers the 1983 pact. The Geneva talks, under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, are due to end on January 21 but may be extended for a third week. Mr Wisber Loeis of Indonesia, who chairs the negotiations, has proposed a compromise under which the future accord would essentially be limited to tropical timber but all member nations would espouse the Year 2000 Objective. The US, Australia and Japan, among temperate timber producers, have already done so.</p>

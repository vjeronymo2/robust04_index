			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPT. ROGER TEMPLE DIES; KNOWN AS UNIFYING FORCE  </P> <P> Roger Temple, popular superintendent of the Garvey School District, was  remembered by friends and colleagues this week as a compassionate man and a  crucial unifying force for the once-divided district.  </P> <P> Temple, a San Gabriel resident who began working for the district in 1966 and  became superintendent a year ago, died of a brain tumor Sunday. He was 51.  </P> <P> "He was elected by the unanimous consent of the board, and that's no small  task," said Board President Diane Martinez, a student at the Richard Garvey  Intermediate School 20 years ago when Temple was assistant principal there.  </P> <P> Martinez, 36, said she doesn't remember many of the former administrators at  her school, but Temple stood out.  </P> <P> "He always had that very tranquil aura about him," she said. "He was somebody  you (could) talk to."  </P> <P> Martinez said that before hiring Temple, the board had split into two factions  and wrestled over many issues. "Yet the one thing we could all get together on  was that Roger was the best thing for the district."  </P> <P> Board member Jim Smith also praised Temple, adding that he will be difficult to  replace.  </P> <P> "There's not too many of his caliber," Smith said. "Roger will be a tough act  to follow."  </P> <P> Mercedes Chavez, Temple's administrative assistant, said Temple was admired for  his fairness. "He treated everyone as an equal."  </P> <P> Temple began his career in 1959 as an elementary school teacher in the Downey  Unified School District. He joined the Garvey School District seven years  later, beginning as a teacher in the Dewey Avenue School before moving on to  administrative positions.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife, Alyce, three daughters, two stepdaughters and nine  grandchildren; by his parents, Scott and Faith Temple of Downey; a brother,  Walter Temple of Downey, and a sister, Marilyn Hunt of Salt Lake City, Utah.  </P> <P> Funeral services were held Wednesday morning at the Church of Our Savior in San  Gabriel.  </P> <P> Temple's wife has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the  Roger W. Temple Memorial Fund. Money from the fund will be used for educational  purposes at the former Fern Intermediate School, which the school board renamed  the Roger W. Temple Intermediate School in July.  </P> <P> Checks should be sent to the Garvey School District office at 2730 N. Delmar  Ave., Rosemead 91770.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 22 Mar--Forty-one percent of those polled by  the Public Opinion Research Centre [OBOP] agreed with the view  that the West betrayed Poland and the other Central European  countries by refusing them immediate acceptance into NATO. At  the same time, 79 percent of those canvassed by OBOP think that  Poland should try to get into NATO. Seven percent were against  this idea, and 14 percent had no opinion on the matter.    The poll was carried out from 4 to 6 February of this year,  on a 1,015-person random nationwide sample of Poles over age 15.    Fourteen percent of those polled firmly agreed with the view  on "betrayal," and 27 percent "were inclined to agree." Nine  percent of those polled firmly disagreed with this formula, and  27 percent "were inclined to disagree." Twenty-three percent of  those polled had no opinion on the matter.    In the opinion of 52 percent of those polled by OBOP, Poland  is a sovereign country; according to a further 36 percent, it is  not, and 12 percent of those polled had no opinion on the  matter. According to OBOP, these results do not differ from a  similar poll carried out in March of last year.    Forty-two percent of those polled think that entry into NATO  will happen in several years' time, and 23 percent in a dozen or  so years. In the opinion of 6 percent of respondents, entry  into NATO will happen inside a year or two; the same percentage  stated that it would never happen. The youngest respondents  were the most positive on the chances of rapid acceptance into  NATO.    Sixty-eight percent of respondents had heard of the  "Partnership for Peace" program, and 31 percent of them  expressed interest in the idea. Two-thirds of this group think  that the partnership proposal will increase Poland's security,  and one-quarter are of the opposite opinion.</p>

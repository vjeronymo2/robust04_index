			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: On the road to cleaner air - US companies are offering commuting staff incentives to leave their cars at home Every day, Doris Bouton of Vitro, the California-based defence group, makes her rounds of the company's offices with a bag of sweets in her hand and asks employees how they travelled to work. If they say they walked, rode their bike or shared a ride with another employee, she gives them a sweet. If they say they made a solo trip in their car, she says 'Shame on you]' and moves on to the next desk. 'It may sound silly,' says Bouton, the company's transport co-ordinator, 'but it works]' Her daily scolding shows the efforts that many companies are making to comply with new laws forcing them to cut down on the number of cars their employees drive to work. The legislation, part of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, is an attempt to reduce car emissions in the US. Starting next year, companies with more than 100 employees will have to submit plans to reduce the use of what are referred to as 'single occupancy vehicles'. The US is slowly coming to grips with one of its biggest environmental hazards: excessive car use. 'More people are driving than ever before and they are driving longer distances,' says Martha Casey, a spokesperson for the Environmental Protection Agency, which is helping to implement the new rules. 'This legislation is an attempt to change people's commuting habits.' Ten metropolitan areas are targeted in the amendments: Los Angeles, San Diego, the Southeast Desert (next to San Francisco and including Silicon Valley), Ventura County, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Houston and Milwaukee. The legislation should have an even wider impact, however, as other states, attempting to comply with reduced emissions standards, pass similar laws. With the implementation of the new rules, environmental regulation in the US will move to a new level. Previously, companies only had to worry about the amount of pollution their factories created. Now, they will also be responsible for the pollution their employees create on the way to work. Even service companies, which were once outside the environmental debate, suddenly find themselves under the watchful eye of the EPA. President Bill Clinton stepped up the pressure in October with a list of rules to help the country cut down on emissions. One presidential suggestion is that companies providing free parking to employees should offer cash equivalents as an alternative benefit. Compliance with the rules will be voluntary, although the administration has threatened to make them enforceable by law if necessary. Prising solo commuters away from their cars has shown itself to be a Herculean task. Attempts by public institutions over the last two decades to influence behaviour - by creating special car pool and bus lanes, for instance - have proved hopelessly inadequate. 'For most of this century, cars have been a key part of the American dream,' says Pamela Couch, transportation programme administrator for Ventura County in California. 'Governments have subsidised highway travel and generally ignored public transportation. It's very difficult to change a country's habits overnight.' Exacerbating the problem is the lack of adequate public transport in many of the target regions. Companies complain that this is making it difficult for them to comply with the regulations. 'It's just not feasible to get here with a bus or train,' says Jack Gundrum, head of transport administration for Textron, the aerospace company, in Connecticut. 'That means we have to look at other alternatives.' Success is measured in terms of 'average vehicle ridership' (AVR) - the ratio of the number of cars driven to work to the number of employees. Most companies in the target areas have AVRs of about 1.1 - that is, nearly every employee is a solo car commuter. The legislation's goal is an AVR of 1.5. Compressed working weeks and increased telecommuting (working from home) are options that many companies are adopting to cut down on car usage. 'We have to take a fresh look at the scheduling of work, at when and where it takes place,' says Peter Valk, president of Transportation Management Services, a consulting group. 'Moving to four 10-hour days is popular, and so is allowing more employees to spend at least one or two days a week working from home.' Car-pooling is a main focus. Companies encourage this by putting employees in touch with each other. Zip-code parties, in which people from the same area meet in the office to discover ways of helping each other get to work and car-pool databases have become popular. Car poolers are also rewarded with benefits such as priority parking spaces and free petrol. Some companies - such as Amgen, the Californian biotechnology group - offer vans free of charge to car poolers. Company lotteries, in which all car poolers get a chance to win small prizes, are also used as an incentive. Setting a good example at the higher ranks is essential, say transport managers. 'The vice-president of our company is a regular car pooler,' says Bouton of Vitro. 'He also gave up his personal parking space at the company to set the tone for the other employees.' One innovation is 'guaranteed ride home' programmes. 'We found that one reason people didn't want to car pool was that they were worried that if their child got sick, or if they had to work late, they wouldn't be able to get home,' says James Ferro, transport manager for Xerox Corporation. 'So we provide a few vehicles which employees can use in case of an emergency.' Other companies are exploring ways to link up with public transport, either by providing shuttles to nearby train stations or by uniting with other companies in the area to offer a limited bus service. Companies located near public transport facilities often offer subsidies for bus and subway fares. In fact the ultimate solution, according to transport experts, may be to locate companies closer to public transport in the first place. 'I think better site planning, which takes commuting options into account early on, is something that will happen in the future,' says Margaret Heatherington of Metropool, which advises companies on commuting issues in Connecticut. Company managers, however, think that site planning will be used as a last resort. 'It's a simple matter of whether the higher rent outweighs the improvement in AVR rates,' said Valk of Transportation Management Services. As an alternative, many companies suggest that public transport be built to accommodate them. 'We are hoping that public transportation will improve in this area,' says Marcia Brandt, employee transport co-ordinator for Amgen. 'And that's a possibility. With more voters now worried about public transportation, it may become a bigger issue in the voting booth.' Companies which have implemented new commuting programmes have achieved some success, moving to AVRs of about 1.3 or more. Still, most find the AVR goal of 1.5 elusive. 'We found that the first improvements were easy, but after that we levelled out,' says Ferro of Xerox, which has had transport programmes in place for several years. 'There's always a hard-core group that you can't get through to,' comments Couch of the Ventura County Control District. 'Some people think driving a car is downright American and they hang on tenaciously.' One barrier to real improvement, say transport managers, is that the new federal rules are not binding. In most areas, legislation is worded so that companies must make only a 'convincing effort' to improve their AVRs. Yet, whether or not companies achieve the magic 1.5 AVR soon, the legislation has led them to take a hard look at their employees' commuting habits. In the US government's fight to reduce car usage, the private sector is now set to play a key role.</p>

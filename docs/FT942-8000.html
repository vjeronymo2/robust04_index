			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / People: Crescendo for Sir George - Lucy Kellaway explains that the opening of Glyndebourne's new opera-house this week is the pinnacle of the chairman's career On May 28 1934 a special train left London carrying a grumbling group of music critics to a small town in Sussex. They were off to hear the Marriage of Figaro at a new theatre built by a rich English eccentric in the garden of his Elizabethan manor. Their expectation of the music was low, their resentment at wearing dinner jackets and travelling 50 miles was high. Yet the following day the newspapers carried rave notices, and Glyndebourne has played to full houses ever since. This Saturday, 60 years later to the day, 1,200 people will dress up and make the same journey with gladder hearts. They too will hear the Marriage of Figaro, performed in a new theatre built on the same site by the founder's son, Sir George Christie. His is the first important opera-house to be built in Britain this century, and has been paid for without a penny of taxpayers' money. The opening is a business triumph for Sir George. In 1987 when he first floated a plan to knock down the ramshackle old 800-seat building and replace it with an expensive new one, people thought he had lost his mind. Yet doggedly, and without a hitch, he raised the Pounds 33m needed, and witnessed the completion of a splendid new opera house in his back garden on time and on budget. Eat your heart out, Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of Eurotunnel. His project was declared open earlier this month a year late, and at twice the initial cost. And that was quick and cheap in comparison with the British Library, still not ready more than three decades after the initial plans were drawn. My first glimpse of Sir George is an expanse of scarlet sock seen through a half open door where he is dictating to his secretary. He apologises for running late, and directs me to his study next door. Here among the battered leather-bound books and good furniture, a beige pug dog lies on a blue pouffe. It is hard to believe that a few yards away from this preposterously English domestic scene scores of singers and musicians are engaged in earnest pursuit of artistic excellence. Likewise it is hard to believe that the genial, gentlemanly Sir George, who presents himself in due course, is the executive chairman of the only opera company in Britain that covers its costs without public assistance. As he closes the door, he sets off the burglar alarm. 'Oh damn,' he says, and disappears to turn it off. On returning, he tells me of one evening last year, when he heard a pair of thieves trying to get in through the window. He pursued them, giving chase in his Mercedes. 'Their car wasn't all that fast. I was flashing and peeping, but I couldn't get them to turn round so I could get a look at them.' Despite the red socks and the car chase, Sir George is no chip off his father's eccentric block. While John Christie famously had his appendix removed simply to keep his young opera singer wife company as she underwent the same operation, his son appears measured and sensible. Why did he embark on such an ambitious building plan in the first place? Sir George refers to his 'venal' motives - as if unaware that the Financial Times is sympathetic to this sort of thing. 'I wanted to make the theatre bigger to respond to the audience demand, to provide additional box office and to secure our long term future,' he says. 'The funding strategy had an element of commercialism,' he continues. Strong-arm tactics might have been a better description. The aim was to get most of the money from companies without granting them a larger share of the tickets than the 30 per cent or so they claimed already. In the nicest possible way, Sir George told the existing 230 corporate members that unless they could each make him a present of up to Pounds 90,000 they could no longer be in the club. Some grumbled a little, but in the end only four failed to get their cheque-books out. That done, he approached the companies on the waiting list for corporate membership. Fed up with what promised to be a 900-year wait (300 were waiting and on average only one member dropped out every three years) some 70 companies came forward, each paying up to Pounds 120,000 for the privilege. I express amazement at the pulling power of Glyndebourne, and he shrugs. Its uniqueness has been a fact of life for him since babyhood. He attributes it to freedom from 'the vagaries of government funding', to its season of three short summer months, above all to the high reputation of the performances. Only when pressed does he add Glyndebourne's snob value to the list; 'the family's presence unquestionably has an effect.' It is not only special to the audience but to the singers, who readily agree to spend the summer singing at Glyndebourne for a fraction of the rate they might get elsewhere. The successful completion of the new building was partly down to luck; Sir George raised the money in a boom, and built the theatre in a recession. But good timing alone does not explain how seven consultants and 50 subcontractors worked together so well. The secret, he says, was running the project 'on a personal level. It has not been subject to huge committees and sub-committees'. Sir George will have been running the company from his home above the shop for over four decades when he reluctantly steps down six years from now. Then he will be 65 and his second son Augustus, who is his chosen heir, will be in his mid-30s. 'Gus makes wildlife films, which makes him ideally suited for the job.' Augustus is no worse qualified than his father was when he took over at the age of 23. Sir George had always known he would assume the mantle and was brought up to be passionate about opera. But at the time he was 'completely green', and certainly couldn't read a balance sheet. Yet soon he found himself plunged into the rude world of commerce. Sir George shakes his head at the memory of the more impulsive business ventures, which the sensible son was forced to unwind on his father's death. 'He owned a 120-bedroom hotel in north Devon, called the Sultan Sands. It was a disastrous investment.' It would be wrong to present him as merely the business behind the music. Although he has no training in opera - he's an 'enthusiastic amateur', he says - he is closely involved in commissioning the works. The triumvirate - Sir George, the general director, Anthony Whitworth-Jones, and the music director, Andrew Davis - ensure the quality of the performances. In his younger days he used to tour Europe looking for singers, but latterly has given up his talent scouting because he loathes living out of a suitcase. Apart from the singers, who are on freelance contracts, Glyndebourne has a permanent staff of about 50, many of whom have worked there for decades. 'I know it sounds smug, but we don't have a motivation problem here,' says Mark Beddy, the finance director. Saturday's opening should mark the pinnacle of his career, yet Sir George is showing no sign of nerves. 'I'm so thrilled with the acoustics. I adore the look of the auditorium.' Evidently, he feels it will be more than all right on the night. Later, after our interview, I bump into him in the staff canteen. He and his wife are queueing up for their canelloni, chatting and joking with some of the singers. Being chairman of Glyndebourne must be nice work if you can get it. Or, as Sir George prefers to think of the job: 'It is better than being a dentist or a vet.'</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRANSPLANT;  </P> <P> TWIN SISTERS CREDIT LIBERALIZED SOVIET EMIGRATION POLICY WITH GIVING AILING ONE  NEW CHANCE AT LIFE  </P> <P> Call it physiological perestroika.  </P> <P> For Yelena Faynegold, the Soviet Union's policy of political restructuring and  its easing of emigration restrictions has literally meant a new chance at life.  </P> <P> Her recent move to United States enabled her to undergo a kidney transplant  last week, with the help of her identical twin sister, Dina Vaisberg, who  donated one of her kidneys.  </P> <P> The surgeries were performed by Drs. Rafael and Robert Mendez, who are also  identical twins.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pair Leave Hospital  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the 34-year-old sisters were discharged from St. Vincent Medical  Center in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Hospital officials said the operations went smoothly and, because of the close  organ-match between the two, Faynegold's outlook for a normal life is  excellent.  </P> <P> Relatives of the sisters credit the changes brought about in the Soviet Union  under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "It was easy to immigrate now," said Dina's husband, Alexander.  </P> <P> Having relatives in the United States and being Jewish also helped.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Here for Nine Years  </P> <P> Dina Vaisberg, who now lives in West Hollywood, emigrated nine years ago.  </P> <P> After a year's wait, Faynegold was allowed to move here five months ago.  </P> <P> If immigration had not been possible, the sisters said, Faynegold's prognosis  would be much bleaker.  </P> <P> Doctors in her hometown of Odessa, on the Black Sea, did not diagnose her  kidney disease, Faynegold said in Russian.  </P> <P> It was an American doctor, based on information she provided her relatives in  letters, who pinpointed the problem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Specialist Left Town  </P> <P> When, after much waiting and cajoling, she finally was admitted to a hospital  in Moscow, the specialist Faynegold saw left the city the next day.  </P> <P> For two weeks, she recalled, a parade of doctors came by her bed in a crowded  and dirty ward -- each telling her something different. The hospital's kidney  dialysis machine was 20 years old.  </P> <P> Soviet hospitals also held other privations.  </P> <P> "No TV," Faynegold said in English. "No bathrooms."  </P></p>

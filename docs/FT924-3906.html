			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Thailand (4): Air Force officers ousted - Thai Airways International THE turmoil in the boardroom of Thai Airways International (Thai), the partly privatised national airline, has mirrored the upheaval in national politics: in both cases the military were finally thrown out. For decades, the senior officers of the Royal Thai Air Force had controlled the board of Thai and treated the airline as their personal fiefdom, but this year they were ousted from the company by the interim civilian government of Mr Anand Panyarachun. Mr Anand and his cabinet, appointed by the King after troops killed about 50 pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of Bangkok in May, moved rapidly to reduce military influence in state enterprises before leaving the field to the new civilian coalition government elected in September. The targets included such military-dominated cash cows as the Communications Authority of Thailand, which controls international telephone calls, as well as Thai Airways. Thai, however, provided the clearest evidence of the military's declining influence, partly because its business gives it a higher public profile, partly because its shares are now listed on the stock exchange, and partly because Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the supreme military commander at the time of the May killings, was at the same time also the chairman of the Thai Airways board. With less than a week to go before the September 13 election - which might have produced a pro-military government but ended up handing the country a broadly liberal coalition - the Anand government succeeded in removing the reluctant air force officers from the Thai board and installing its own civilian nominees. Mr Pandit Bunyapana, the finance ministry permanent secretary, became chairman, and Mr Chatrachai Bunya-Ananta, Thai's marketing chief, was promoted to the post of president. The changes at Thai, valued at about Dollars 3.5bn by the stock market, were swift and visible, and Mr Chatrachai himself is a changed man. Under the old regime, the urbane Mr Chatrachai was deputed to receive foreign visitors but, mindful of his military bosses, he was only able to shrug and give the most evasive answers to queries about corruption or the airline's financial health. One of the most glaring examples of mismanagement was Thai's decision to waive its rights to fly the lucrative route to Cambodia in favour of Bangkok Airways, a local airline with links to Air Chief Marshal Kaset. Mr Chatrachai and other Thai executives wheeled out a motley collection of excuses, ranging from the poor state of Phnom Penh airport to the alleged lack of passengers - at a time when competitors such as Malaysia Airlines were starting to fly in from other centres, flights from Bangkok were full and passengers were paying exorbitant fares for the route. Since the boardroom revolution on September 7, Thai has started flights to Phnom Penh and Mr Chatrachai has moved quickly to expose the follies of his predecessors and restore the airline's fortunes. 'We have to set about cleaning our house, reorganising and restructuring to return to a leaner and more efficient organisation,' he told a corporate planning conference in November. In his speech, he soberly assessed where Thai had gone wrong and outlined his plans for the future. The fall in profits could be blamed partly on the effects of the Gulf war, the recession in leading international markets and the political violence in Thailand in May, he said. But there were other factors, too, including lower productivity among Thai's workers and a proliferation of aircraft and engine types which made maintenance more expensive. Thai may have been doing better than the average international airline, but its operating margin of 7.2 per cent compared unfavourably with its principal competitors in the booming Asian market, Cathay Pacific with 17.4 per cent and Singapore Airlines with 19.2. Mr Chatrachai produced a graph which showed the break-even load factor line crossing and rising above the drooping load factor line in 1991. In other words, the airline was losing money on flights, even if it had been able to massage its profits with other operations and the sale of aircraft. This year, Mr Chatrachai said, the load factor was 66.3 per cent, whereas a figure of 78 or 80 per cent was 'child's play' a few years back. He has already started to apply his medicine. He has banned any expansion of Thai's 20,000-strong workforce and is attempting to deploy his staff more profitably. He has also cut flights and reduced the seat-kilometres flown by 4 per cent. He has decided to retire eight aircraft - five BAe-146s and three DC-10s - eliminating two aircraft types at a stroke and thereby reducing the cost of maintenance and of spare parts stocks. Mr Chatrachai disclosed that some aircraft were flying less than three hours a day. Those who bought Thai's shares when 7 per cent of the airline was sold to the public by the state earlier this year, and who have watched the share price languishing below the 60-baht offer price, are delighted by the new management's apparent dynamism. If Thai's profits and its share price react positively to Mr Chatrachai's initiatives, he may be able to fulfil his ambition of selling another 14 per cent of the company to local and foreign investors by the end of this financial year in September 1993. 'I feel that by next year we may be in a position to launch an overseas road show, perhaps in London, Hong Kong and Tokyo prior to our second shares offering,' Mr Chatrachai said.</p>

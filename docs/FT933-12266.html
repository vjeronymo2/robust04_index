			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Books: What price a Czar after Communism? NICHOLAS II EMPEROR OF ALL THE RUSSIAS by Dominic Lieven John Murray Pounds 19.99, 304 pages IN FEBRUARY 1991, six months before Communism collapsed, I stood in the Peter and Paul Cathedral of what was still then Leningrad. There was a large hole being dug next to the line of tombs holding the remains of Russia's rulers. 'For Nicholas II,' a fierce young student explained, 'And with God's help we'll soon see a Czar crowned here again'. At the time this had about all the apparent likeliness of a Jacobite fulminating in Westminster Cathedral. Lievan, an LSE don specialising in late Imperial Russia, has written this biography in the light of Communism's recent collapse: no longer are the Romanovs the pariahs they once were. The dustbin of history is now crammed with the cadavers of former consigners. There is a certain amount of fresh archive information here but not enough to justify another biography. The interesting part of the book is the new perspective and the insights that flow from it. Lievan's last chapter, 'Then and Now', where he weighs up the Romanovs and Nicholas II in the light of Communism's collapse, contains stimulating ideas and should have come at the start of the book. Since capitalism won in the Cold War, the late flowering of an industrial and mercantile culture under Czarism now looks healthier, he argues, than the State-run artifices which replaced it under Lenin and Stalin. The concept of three waves of 'modernism imposed from above' which Lievan perceives in Russia's history is sound and insightful. Lievan counters the usual canard about the Empress Alexandra's pro-Germanism by bringing out the intense Englishness of her character. It was Nicholas and Alexandra's very lack of Russianness which so alienated them from fashionable upper-class Petersburg. The pusillanimous refusal of Nicholas's cousin, George V of England, to grant the deposed Romanovs visas for England leaves the author with 'a somewhat sour taste In the mouth' - perhaps the greatest understatement in an understated book. It was the disastrous Russo-Japanese war which lost the Romanovs their autocracy and their legitimacy, and the even more catastrophic First War which destroyed both them and their dynasty. Nicholas was certainly at fault in precipitating the former, but the latter he saw clearly as a grave menace and tried to avoid with all his power. This chapter of history is by no means closed. The Yeltsin era may yet come to be seen as Kerensky-in-reverse, a republican interregnum between Communism and a full-blown return to Czarist-style, right wing, Russian nationalist autocracy. Many would say Yeltsin already has many of the hallmarks of a new, absolutist Emperor in embryo.</p>

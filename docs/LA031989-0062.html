			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: OFFICE WORK ALWAYS WAS A PIECE OF CAKE  </P> <P> Occasionally, when the boredom of working from my home gets to me, I think of  the good old days when I went to an office.  </P> <P> I remember the excitement of a day when I had something new to wear. There was  the stimulation of being around other people and the luxury of having a  restroom with a key. And then I remember the down side of working in an office:  Seven hours of snacking with an hour off for lunch!  </P> <P> That workplace was like a giant cookie. I didn't work at a desk; I worked at a  buffet table. The filing cabinets were china closets. The desk lamps were  warming lights. I grew at a faster rate than the company.  </P> <P> Every morning when I arrived, I had to run the course between two rows of desks  that groaned under the load of doughnuts, sweet rolls and coffee cakes. The  out-baskets were lined with Danish. It was worse than facing the Notre Dame  backfield. I knew if I made it to my desk, I was safe until coffee break.  </P> <P> Deep breath. First, I had to make it past Mother Mildred, who couldn't stand to  see anyone miss breakfast. Breakfast was her answer to irregularity, a bad  marriage, deep depression, early menopause, bad skin or a dead car battery. If  you refused juice and coffee, she spread rumors about your sexual preference.  </P> <P> Next, there was Shirley, who weighed 85 pounds (30 of that was hair). I dubbed  her Meal on Heels. She never ate anything herself, but insisted you "just  taste" some new, exotic dish she made the night before in her experimental  kitchen.  </P> <P> Every office has a Cake Queen. Ours was Charlotte, who baked, decorated and  torched a cake not only on everyone's birthday, but also for every other  occasion you could imagine. I once refused a slice of cake in honor of the  first anniversary of her dog's hysterectomy, and she was cool to me for two  weeks.  </P> <P> You had to admire the adventurous spirit of Wanda the Wonder Worker, who turned  office cooking into an Outward Bound exercise. She begged for challenges. If  you had two raw potatoes that needed baking for lunch, Wanda made a solar oven  on the windowsill out of the tray that held paper in the copier and foil from a  thousand packs of chewing gum. She once served lamb shish kebabs on a letter  opener over a fire set in the wastebasket. You don't want to know where she  chilled the wine for Lois' baby shower.  </P> <P> One day I took stock of the giant tins of popcorn, boxes of candy bars,  crackers, jars of peanut butter and cheeses. Our whole office building could  have been under siege for three months, and we still would have gained weight.  </P> <P> I work from my home now, where the only distractions are a microwave, two  ovens, a full refrigerator, freezer and pantry of fast foods.  </P> <P> To this day, I cannot answer a phone without automatically shaking the cookie  crumbs out of the mouthpiece before I say "hello."  </P></p>

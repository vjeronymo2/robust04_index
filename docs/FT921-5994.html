			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Gardening: Grown in the glory of youth - For best-blooming summers, Arthur Hellyer recommends the old-fashioned way of pruning roses THE ROSE world has seen some strange goings-on recently. Serious people have been pruning them with power-driven hedge-trimmers, mowing them off at a level height above the ground. Surprisingly, the pruners report that these roses have grown and flowered excellently. If that is true, why bother with all the finer points of officially-approved pruning? That includes the preliminary removal of all dead, badly-damaged or diseased growth, plus very thin stems; and the subsequent shortening of good growth according to its strength and the precise purpose for which the rose is required. I think it is premature to throw away the pruning instructions and bring out the hedge trimmers. For, when you think about it, you would expect good results for a year or so from the sort of indiscriminate hard pruning that hedge-trimmers would give you. The point about roses of nearly all kinds - especially the garden hybrids that have been bred to flower freely and in succession for much of the summer - is that they thrive on young growth. They must have a plentiful supply of it and, in the short term, the most certain way to get this is to cut everything down hard. The sap pumped up by the roots is concentrated on far fewer buds than there would be otherwise. The result is vigorous growth with, in the case of all repeat-flowering varieties, a good second (and even possibly a third) flush of flowers. I would expect this to continue for two or three years with hedge-trimmer pruning, but it would be a policy of diminishing returns. This all-over pruning at one height, irrespective of type of growth, would result in a gradual accumulation of dead and dying stems. This is much the way roses live in the wild. They allow their old stems to die, caring not at all how unsightly they look; and if they get diseased, that also is permitted to take its natural course. There is a lot of renewal from sucker growth coming direct from the roots, but few garden roses are grown on their own roots from seedlings, cuttings or layers. Instead, they are increased by budding, which is a particularly economical form of grafting; and the roses that are chosen to provide the roots are of a different kind from the garden roses that are budded on them. Below ground, these root stocks need to be encouraged by every means possible. Above ground, they must be suppressed totally by being cut out close to the roots from which they grow - and as soon as they are seen. None of this would be managed by hedge-trimmer pruning. On the contrary, it would be aggravated, because the root stocks are almost always stronger-growing species of rose than the garden varieties grown on them. Thus, when all kinds of growth are cut back equally, it is the root stocks that will multiply with greatest freedom and vigour. I would agree, however, that some of the refinements of pruning, as practised by specialists, may be part of the fun of growing roses rather than an absolute necessity. You could state a general principle that, the more vigorous roses are by nature, the less detailed pruning they require. Most shrub roses, such as Fritz Nobis, Nevada and Kassall, can simply be thinned, concentrating on the removal of dead, dying and diseased growth which is easy enough to identify by its appearance. If the bushes are cleaned-up only every few years, it can become quite a time-consuming task; but if it is done annually, it should not be nearly so difficult. With bush roses, pruning usually is done in February or March when the growth buds are swelling and can be identified easily. Ideally, all cuts should be made just above a growth bud from which it is hoped a new stem will grow. But Then look over rose bushes later in the spring, when they are growing freely, and shorten any shoot ends which have no new growing tips. They should be cut back to the topmost point at which there is a shoot or a good growth bud. If there is neither, that stem may be removed altogether, since it is of no use to the plant. Climbing roses divide broadly into two groups: the rambler or very vigorous type, such as New Dawn, which makes a lot of long stems from near the base (or, at any rate, from fairly low down); and the less-vigorous climbing or pillar roses, which make most of their new growth from partway up the old stems. With the vigorous type it usually is possible to cut out many of the old flowering stems when the flowers have faded in summer or autumn and to train the new, non-flowering stems in their place. With the climbing type, it is really a repeat of the pruning applied to bush and shrub roses: cut out dead and diseased stems, tie-in good growth, and then remove as many of the older but still healthy stems as can be spared. 'Roses thrive on youth' is the motto you should bear in mind with pruning.</p>

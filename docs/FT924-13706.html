			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Management: Never mind the customer, just feel the quality - Companies introducing TQM schemes for all the wrong reasons Most large companies in the north of England which have introduced total quality management (TQM) have done so without surveying their customers' reactions and have failed to use their marketing departments to develop their internal TQM plans. Two-thirds have, however, carried out surveys of their 'internal customer' needs, involving the supply of materials, components and services between their own departments or divisions. The inescapable conclusion drawn by John Whyte and Barry Witcher of Durham University Business School is that much TQM is too internally focused and not concerned enough with what customers want - the very opposite of what quality programmes are supposed to be about. 'We believe TQM ideally starts with the external customer - and if it does not, then the customer quickly becomes the focus of the TQM effect. Only then does TQM provide real total customer satisfaction,' they say. Quality, they add, means meeting customer requirements exactly. Management's role is to act as an enabler, creating the conditions under which total quality can be sustained. This means commitment from the top to a holistic approach, breaking down any tendency to divide a business into separate compartments. Whyte and Witcher have just published a preliminary paper on a recent survey they carried out among 235 companies with more than 300 employees, each in northern England. It follows a similar study they carried out for the Scottish Development Agency two years ago. Comparison of the two surveys, however, shows a marked deepening of understanding of TQM over time. The Scottish survey was carried out when TQM ideas were in their infancy; Whyte and Witcher say there is a better grasp of principles now, possibly because TQM consultants have become more experienced. They were, however, surprised by most companies' failure to involve their own marketing specialists in developing their plans. Only 8 per cent did so, in spite of the knowledge of customers, markets and research which the marketing specialists ought to have had. Telling figures in the survey are that only 59 per cent of companies said TQM involved all departments, only 43 per cent involved more than 90 per cent of the workforce, while training took less than three days for 41 per cent and less than a week for another 32 per cent. Inconsistency was also apparent: although 84 per cent of companies said they trained for quality improvement and 80 per cent planned for it, somewhat fewer - 74 per cent of companies - monitored and measured it, and only 61 per cent set targets to achieve it. Yet the stakes are high: of the 62 per cent which said they measured the cost of not meeting quality standards, four-fifths estimated this as worth up to 20 per cent of their turnover. Most had TQM steering groups, but only 29 per cent involved supervisors in them, 21 per cent front line operators and 12 per cent union representatives. On achieving quality standards, only 46 per cent had reached BS5750 Part 2, although another 33 per cent had reached the standard's Part 1 level. Factors impeding TQM were entrenched attitudes, lack of time or resources and lack of understanding. The main benefits were ranked as improved performance, better attitudes and customer satisfaction. In their own defence, some companies told Whyte and Witcher they were using TQM to put their own houses in order before risking it on their customers. Ominously, however, the researchers warn that TQM has to deliver. If it produces diminishing returns, senior managers might weaken their commitment and look for 'another management fashion' to make an impact.

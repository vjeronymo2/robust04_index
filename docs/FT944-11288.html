			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / UK Company News: TeleWest attracts institutions Institutional interest is believed to be considerable in the flotation of TeleWest, the largest cable company in the UK and the first to come for a London listing. The pathfinder document to be published today will suggest a likely value for the company - a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest US cable operator, and US West the regional US telephone company - of between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.9bn. The company will place about 20 per cent of its ordinary shares in London and New York in a move designed to raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds 390m in new money. The flotation will test the market for new media stock in advance of the much larger British Sky Broadcasting float later in December. Although satellite television has more than four times the number of subscribers as the cable networks, many analysts see cable as the better long-term bet because it can offer a wide range of services apart from television, including telecommunications and new interactive services. Mr Fred Vierra, executive vice-president of TCI responsible for international operations will become non-executive chairman of TeleWest. The non-executive directors will include Sir Gordon Borrie, former director general of Fair Trading and a current non-executive director of the Mirror Group, which has recently announced its intention to launch a new television channel for cable networks.</p>

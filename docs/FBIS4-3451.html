			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 20 (XINHUA) -- China's central bank  will not relax its control of the money supply in view of the  slower rate of growth of some state-owned enterprises, a senior  bank official said here today.    Dai Xianglong, vice-governor of the People's Bank of China,  noted that in the first quarter of this year, state-owned  enterprises recorded a production growth of only two percent, in  contrast to 50 percent for township enterprises and 90 percent  for foreign-funded ones.    According to the State Statistical Bureau, the country's  overall economic growth was 12.6 percent for the January-March  period.    Factors contributing to the slow growth of state-owned  enterprises include tightened investment in fixed assets and  reduced supply of materials, said Dai, now attending a national  conference here in China's largest city.    Another factor was that state-owned enterprises which have  been transformed into stockholding or joint venture companies  ceased to have their production included in the state sector's  statistics.    The state increased loans for working capital to  enterprises.  From now on, said Dai, banks will act on a case-to-case basis in  extending loans to state-owned enterprises.    Priority will be given to those with good economic  performance, followed by those in a position to turn red into  black in a short time.    Enterprises up to the neck in debt and with no hope of  recovery will be declared bankrupt, in line with the "bankruptcy  law," Dai added.</p>

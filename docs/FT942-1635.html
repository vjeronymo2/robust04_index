			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Dumping of the dollar Dollar weakness is an old story. Until 1971, the once all-conquering greenback was worth 360 yen. Until 1969, it was worth four D-Marks. How has the mighty fallen] The questions to be asked are why this latest bout of weakness has occurred, whether it is possible to do something effective about it and, finally, whether action should even be attempted. The problem in explaining the dollar's weakness is not that there are too few explanations, but that there are too many. While movements in relative interest rates in 1994 should have been favourable to the dollar, fingers can still be pointed at external balances, at fears of inflation, at the US fiscal deficit, at the Federal Reserve's somewhat modest monetary tightening since February and at the current caution of investors. It is tempting to draw the sage conclusion that the dollar has been weak because too few want to buy it. Can one do better than that? Perhaps. If the dollar is to remain stable, the rest of the world must be a net buyer of claims on the US, at existing exchange rates, of some Dollars 140bn in 1994, says the IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook. Similarly, Japan must be a net buyer of claims on the rest of the world, to the tune of Dollars 133bn this year. Unless the US offers relatively attractive returns on assets (including on the dollar) and Japan relatively unattractive ones, these capital flows will occur only after exchange rates reach self-evidently under- or overvalued positions. Convinced investors Until then, current account flows are likely to become overwhelmingly important. They are still more likely to determine the fate of the dollar once the US authorities have convinced investors that they do, foolishly, hope to eliminate the bulk of the Japanese current account surplus. The US current account deficit must then also fall, which suggests the dollar's real exchange rate will have to decline. Is there anything the authorities can do about that decline? The answer is yes. The central bank in charge of the strengthening currency can always stabilise the exchange rate, by purchasing the weakening one, without limit. This was pretty well what the Japanese did, following the Louvre Accord in February 1987, not an experience they wish to repeat. The problem is that they can stabilise the dollar only by abandoning domestic monetary control. As Professor Ronald McKinnon pointed out in the FT on Tuesday, the two countries must, in effect, form a joint monetary policy. Frighten speculators The effectiveness of all other measures is uncertain, limited intervention particularly so. If central banks hit the markets unawares, they can frighten speculators for a while. They can make announcements, as secretary of the Treasury Bentsen did yesterday, about how strong the US economy is. Such talk is cheap and will not work for long. That leaves changes in monetary policy itself. But the effects even of that are uncertain. They depend on what happens to prospective returns on longer-term assets. If higher short-term interest rates are thought to prove that a central bank is hysterical about inflation, they may harm the cause of the currency as much as they help. The final question is whether the authorities should, in fact, try to do something about the dollar's decline. A partial answer to this question is that the dollar's decline is probably not particularly harmful. But the policy changes suggested by the foreign exchange markets are, in any case, in the right direction. Developments in the US economy and bond markets would justify somewhat higher short-term rates of interest and a tighter fiscal position, the latter underlined by Mr Alan Greenspan yesterday. Despite faint signs of recovery, there also is a case for a more expansionary monetary policy in Japan, something that unsterilised foreign exchange intervention would ensure. Why is the dollar weak? We are not certain. Can something be done about it? Yes, but nothing decisive will be. Should something be tried? Yes, because the required changes in policy would push the two main players in sensible directions. Does dollar weakness matter that much? Probably not. However unhappily, the world economy has survived 25 years of it. It can, no doubt, survive a few more.</p>

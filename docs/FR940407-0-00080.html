			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As to the conditions under which RACT/non-RACT trading may occur, many commenters from industry expressed the view that such trading should be allowed at a 1-to-1 ratio, i.e., that no exceptional environmental benefit was required to justify RACT/non-RACT trading. These commenters felt that any trading ratio greater than 1 to 1 would limit the economic, technological, and environmental benefits that could be derived from innovations brought about by RACT/non-RACT trading. Other commenters, including State and local agencies and some industries and environmental groups, supported the concept of requiring RACT/non-RACT trades to achieve an exceptional environmental benefit in general, and the use of the proposed statutory offset ratios in particular. However, some of these commenters expressed concern that the offset ratios may have a chilling effect on such trading, and encouraged the EPA to identify justifiable circumstances under which trading ratios could be lower than the offset ratios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rules continue to allow RACT to be met in the aggregate. In addition, the final rules continue to allow RACT/non-RACT trading, provided that an exceptional environmental benefit is achieved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the 1977 Act, the requirements specific to nonattainment SIP's were found in part D of title I of the Act. Section 172 specified the attainment date and the required SIP measures. Subsection (a) of section 172 required that nonattainment SIP's provide for attainment by specified dates; subsection (b)(2) required that those SIP's ``provide for the implementation of all reasonably available control measures (RACM) as expeditiously as practicable.'' Subsection (b)(3) required that the SIP's provide for RFP, including RACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (Nonattainment SIP's must) require, in the interim (prior to the attainment date) reasonable further progress *&blank;*&blank;* including such reduction in emissions from existing sources as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA took the position that RACT requirements do not require each affected emissions unit to achieve a prescribed amount of reductions in emissions from its own processes, but rather require the affected sources to achieve in the aggregate the reductions that would be achieved if each applied RACT controls to itself. Under the EPA's interpretation, the application of the requirement to impose RACT upon ``existing sources'' meant that RACT applied in the aggregate, as opposed to source by source. This interpretation, which is reflected in the Emissions Trading Policy Statement (51 FR 43814 (December 4, 1986), the ``Bubble Policy''), was upheld in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  33 ERC 1657 (4th Cir. 1991), an unpublished decision. There, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld as reasonable EPA's approval of a Maryland SIP revision for the American Cyanamid Company relaxing the SIP limit on several lines in exchange for tighter limits on other lines. The EPA reasoned that the RACT requirement was met by the subject lines in the aggregate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Official defends Girobank sell-off SIR Peter Gregson, permanent secretary to the Department of Trade and Industry, told the Commons public accounts committee yesterday that 'no corners were cut' when the state-owned Girobank was privatised in 1989. He said no complaints had been received from the Co-operative Wholesale Society about the way its Pounds 124m bid was overtaken when the Alliance and Leicester building society increased its original offer and acquired Girobank for Pounds 130m. Sir Peter was questioned about the role of Schroders, advisers to the Post Office on the privatisation, in informing the two bidders that they were in a 'competitive situation'. He was asked if the Alliance and Leicester had been told that its original bid of Pounds 120m had been 'topped'. Sir Peter answered: 'To the best of my knowledge it was not.' Mr Robert Sheldon, committee chairman, said it would be a 'very serious matter' if it were found that one bidder had been privy to circumstances which had not produced the best result for the taxpayer. Responding to questions from Mr Terry Davis (Lab Birmingham Hodge Hill) Sir Peter said he had been told by Schroders what took place in telephone calls made to both the Co-operative Wholesale Society and Alliance and Leicester. Mr Davis asked: 'Did you say this is a bit suspicious?' Sir Peter answered: 'I do not see why you should be suspicious.' He highlighted the National Audit Office report which stated that Schroders did not explicitly invite revised bids, but sought to establish whether final offers had been made by the Co-operative Wholesale Society and Alliance and Leicester.</p>

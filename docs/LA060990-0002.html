			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WATER PIPELINE BACKERS BEGIN PETITION DRIVE  </P> <P> Local business interests who want to bring an outside water supply to Ventura  say they are encouraged by the surprisingly strong showing of a candidate who  proposed connecting drought-starved Santa Barbara to the California Aqueduct.  </P> <P> "The election in Santa Barbara clearly signals that people vote in their best  interest, and our interests lie in obtaining quality water from the state  system," said Robert McCord, chairman of the Assn. for Quality Water  Alternatives.  </P> <P> AQWA supporters, which include many of the city's commercial, real estate and  development interests, began collecting signatures Monday for a November ballot  initiative asking the city to build a $120-million pipeline from Ventura to the  state aqueduct in Lake Piru or at Castaic Lake.  </P> <P> The aqueduct transports vast quantities of water from Northern California to  the arid southern part of the state. But some cities, such as Santa Barbara and  Ventura, have not hooked up to the system, though Ventura has spent about $12  million over the years to reserve the right to obtain the water.  </P> <P> Much of the city's water now comes from dwindling local sources, including  wells, Lake Casitas and the Ventura River.  </P> <P> State water opponents, who include environmentalists and slow-growth activists,  say they believe that connecting Ventura to the state water system will create  runaway development. They said Friday that the ballot initiative will be  defeated and pointed to pro-growth election setbacks in Oxnard and southern  Ventura County this week as barometers of voter sentiment.  </P> <P> "These are the same pro-growth people who were defeated in the Oxnard tax  initiative and the county supervisor race, and they will be defeated again,"  said Councilman Gary Tuttle, an avowed pipeline opponent. A 5% utility tax  proposal was defeated easily in Oxnard, and 4th District Supervisor Madge L.  Schaefer was edged out by a political newcomer, environmental candidate Maria  VanderKolk.  </P> <P> But AQWA members draw hope from the showing of dark horse Steve Malachowski,  who received 47% of the vote against environmentalist incumbent Tom Rodgers in  the Santa Barbara supervisorial race Tuesday. Malachowski, a newcomer to Santa  Barbara politics, campaigned almost exclusively on the state water issue and  called his opponent a "water wimp" for refusing to support state water  importation.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara is facing the most acute water shortage in the state. Residents  have been forced to cut water consumption by 40% and lawn watering has been  banned in that city.  </P> <P> AQWA members believe that a similar future is in store for Ventura unless the  city builds the pipeline as soon as possible. Malachowski's strong performance,  despite accepting developer contributions in traditionally anti-growth Santa  Barbara, gives AQWA's fledgling ballot campaign a shot in the arm, members  said.  </P> <P> "I think people will react the same way here as they did in Santa Barbara once  they start getting higher water bills for less water," said Jim Barroca,  executive director of the Greater Ventura Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the chamber sent out ballot petitions to its 1,700 members.  </P> <P> Bill Cooper, spokesman for the Ventura Board of Realtors, said 85 realtors are  collecting signatures. "Our goal is to get 100 people out there, and we'll have  that by the end of the week," he said.  </P> <P> AQWA has printed 5,000 petitions and 2,000 "We Need State Water" bumper  stickers. In addition, McCord said, AQWA will place newspaper ads this week  urging residents to support the initiative. He said AQWA has collected 700 to  1,000 signatures since Monday and raised more than $2,000.  </P> <P> Given the type of support he already has received, McCord said his group will  easily collect the 7,468 signatures needed by June 26 to place the pipeline  initiative on the November ballot.  </P> <P> But Tuttle, who favors building a desalination plant instead of importing  water, said AQWA will be defeated despite its "well-financed media blitz."  </P> <P> In Oxnard, a ballot initiative to raise utility taxes was defeated by a  grass-roots campaign that was outspent by a ratio of 9 to 1. Most of the  financial support for the tax increase came from out-of-town developers.  </P> <P> In Ventura's 4th Supervisorial District, which stretches from Port Hueneme to  Newbury Park, incumbent Schaefer suffered a stunning upset at the hands of  VanderKolk, a virtual unknown. VanderKolk repeatedly accused Schaefer of being  pro-development.  </P> <P> AQWA members counter that water importation has nothing to do with growth.  </P> <P> "Whether you are a developer or an environmentalist, Ventura residents are  interested in the best possible source of quality water," McCord said. "And the  state water pipeline is the building block to any sound water policy."  </P></p>

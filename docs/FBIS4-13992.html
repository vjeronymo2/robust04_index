			<p>BFN     [Text] The All India Urdu Editors and Intellectuals  Conference has strongly condemned Pakistan's support to  terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. In a resolution in New Delhi  today, the conference said while fighting militancy in the  valley, it should be ensured that the lives of innocent people  are protected. It suggested the government to send a delegation  of Urdu editors to Kashmir to assess the situation there. The  conference also stressed the need to review all TADA [Terrorism  and Disruptive Activities Act] cases and demanded the release of  innocent persons.    Addressing the conference the railway minister, C. K. Jaffar  Shariff, said that efforts should be made to enlist people's  support in restoring normalcy in Kashmir.

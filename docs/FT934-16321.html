			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Matsushita lifts China profile with VCR link THE race among Japanese companies to win a larger share of the Chinese market is heating up. An expected investment of Y10bn (Pounds 62.5m) by Matsushita, the consumer electronics group, in a Chinese joint venture to manufacture components for video cassette recorders for the Chinese market will be the largest yet for a Japanese company there. The deal, which could be officially agreed next month, follows Matsushita's decision in September to set up a wholly owned company in Xiamen to produce audio equipment. Matsushita exports about 10,000 VCRs a month to China but aims to manufacture 1.5m units a year there by the end of 1994. The company already has a manufacturing facility for colour TV tubes in Beijing and for black and white TV tubes in Shanghai. In the audio market, Matsushita is shifting production of cassette players and clock-equipped radios for the Chinese market from South-east Asia to the Xiamen economic zone. Although future products from China could be exported, the company believes production will just meet Chinese demand for the foreseeable future. Sanyo, the electronics group, is also investing in a Chinese joint venture company to manufacture and supply commercial refrigeration equipment. Sanyo has the largest share of the Japanese market for refrigerated display cases. The group will have a 55 per cent stake in the new venture, with China Dalian Refrigeration holding 40 per cent and Nissho Iwai, the Japanese trading house, 5 per cent. It will be Sanyo's 12th manufacturing facility in China. The new company will begin operating in Dalian late next year with initial production of 500 units, rising to about 12,000 annually within seven years. China's market for supermarket showcases is estimated at 4,000 units this year, but is expected to grow rapidly.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nokia registers FM324m loss as sales decline 16% NOKIA, Finland's leading electronics and telecommunications group, suffered a FM324m (Dollars 72m) loss before financial items last year, compared with a FM711m profit in 1990. Sales dropped by 16 per cent to FM15.5bn from FM22.1bn in the previous year. This was mainly due to a sharp decline in demand in recession-hit Finland, the cessation of trade with the former Soviet Union, and a weak demand for Nokia's consumer electronic products. The board proposed cutting the dividend to FM2.00 from FM2.80 per share. Nokia said 1992 would provide good opportunities for growth in many areas, but admitted there was uncertainty about the economic prospects in its main European market areas. The group's liquidity amounted to FM3.7bn, up from FM3.2bn, while it invested FM868m, or 6 per cent, of its net sales on fixed assets. Nokia's electronics business division reported a FM230m operating loss last year, against a FM550m profit, while its sales fell to FM5.281bn from FM6.399bn due to falling demand for televisions and video-recorders. The operating profit fell sharply in the cables and machinery division to FM97m from FM383m in the previous year, and sales declined to FM4.719bn from FM5.359bn. The group did not reveal details of its financial results in mobile phones and telecommunications but said mobile phones had made a satisfactory return on net assets of between 10 and 20 per cent and telecommunications a 'fair' one of between 0 and 10 per cent. Mobile phone sales rose to FM2.516bn from FM2.333bn. The group strengthened its position as the world's second largest cellular phone manufacturer, increasing its market share.</p>

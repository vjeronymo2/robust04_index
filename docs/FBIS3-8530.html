Minister Crvenkovski has made a special statement for Skopje  Radio from Geneva saying that Vance has been informed about all  the aspects of problems created in the wake of the imposition of  the Greek embargo, and that there was still a great deal to be  discussed. The FYROM side stresses that it was difficult to  conduct a dialogue under the pressure of the blockade and that  it was necessary first to lift the embargo before the dialogue  with Greece could be resumed.

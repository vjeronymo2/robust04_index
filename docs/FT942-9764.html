			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Daewoo launches Dollars 75m three-year FRN The Ascension Day holiday in many parts of Europe brought activity in the Eurobond market to a standstill yesterday, with the only issues coming from Asian borrowers. Daewoo, one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, raised Dollars 75m through an issue of three-year floating-rate notes. Lead manager Korea First Investment said the notes appealed mainly to investors in Asia. However, European investors were also interested since the notes were registered with Euroclear. Chia Hsin Cement Corp, the only Taiwanese cement company permitted to invest in mainland China, launched a Dollars 65m offering of eight-year convertible bonds. The proceeds will be used to finance Chia's expansion in China. Joint lead manager Robert Fleming said the bonds were targeted at equity investors in Asia and Europe since US demand for such instruments had waned in recent months. News from Nairobi that the annual meeting of the African Development Bank (AfDB) had suspended proceedings while its governors discussed the bank's arrears and soft loan arm put pressure on the AfDB's Eurobonds. Dealers said the yield spread on the AfDB's recent issue of 10-year Eurobonds had widened by five basis points to 45 basis points over 10-year US Treasuries in the last week. The bonds were launched in March at a spread of 28 basis points. Revelations of mounting arrears, now more than Dollars 700m, and a critical report of the bank by outside consultants have put a question mark over the AfDB's triple-A rating. Ms Helena Hessel, a director at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York, said she would be reviewing the AfDB's rating in the next few months. She noted the bank's problems were 'part of the package for a regional development bank', and said that S&amp;P would only be concerned if the criticism had a negative impact on shareholders. 'Should we see a real lack of support from shareholders and an increase in the bank's gearing ratio then this would have to be reflected in the rating,' Ms Hessel said. However, she was encouraged by the bank's steps to strengthen its provisions and sanctions policies.</p>

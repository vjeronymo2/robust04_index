			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Seeboard share buy-back spurs Recs to new highs Shares in most regional electricity companies rose to record levels yesterday after Crawley-based Seeboard joined what could become a rush by the companies to buy back their own shares. Yesterday's increases mean the companies have seen their market values rise 16 per cent on average in the two weeks since the industry regulator announced a pricing regime generally regarded as favourable to the industry. Yesterday's rises alone added Pounds 460m to the companies' market values taking the total to more than Pounds 17bn. Analysts predicted further increases immediately and in the long term. Some said there could be falls for a short period after mid-October, when share buy-backs would be ruled out before the annual results season. However, others believe an expected announcement in October on the National Grid, which the companies are likely to float on the stock market next spring, could keep share prices high. Seeboard is the second of the companies, after Eastern, to buy back its shares but the first to do so since the regulator announced the pricing review. It made the purchases on Tuesday, paying 425p for 2m of its 257m shares in issue. Like seven other regional companies Seeboard's shares, at 438p, up 17p, were at a record high last night. All the regional companies have powers to buy back shares, mostly for up to 10 per cent of their equity, and all are well equipped financially to do so. Each either has cash in hand or low borrowings. Buying back shares will benefit earnings per share and the potential to increase dividend payments, even if share prices rise further. However the scope for effecting buy-backs is limited. Stock exchange rules mean companies cannot pay more than 5 per cent above the average share price on the previous 10 days. That may be a constraint, with share prices rises. However, there should be some days when prices fall and companies can buy in the market. Postponing share buy-backs could mean a long delay as the companies will be forbidden from trading their shares during the results season and, potentially, after then because of the grid flotation. Knowledge of the flotation details would give the companies insider knowledge. Lex, Page 14</p>

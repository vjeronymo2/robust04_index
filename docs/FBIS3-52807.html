[passage  omitted]    Asked about Israel's claims that the so-called Cairo  document  is the only basis for negotiations, Dr. Sha'th said that that  which is agreed upon and signed will be the basis. This was the  case with the Declaration of Principles, which was initialed in  Oslo, he said, noting that the Cairo draft was not signed. We  must not overtake events, he said.    He explained that the Cairo document includes some disputed  issues that must be resolved. But he said there are many points  of agreement, which makes us hope a final agreement will be  reached.    On a linkage between the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations  and  the upcoming summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and  U.S. President Bill Clinton, Sha'th stressed that the summit is  a contributing, not a frustrating, factor for the  Palestinian-Israeli talks. We want Syria to return to the peace  process armed with its right to a full Israeli withdrawal from  the Golan, he said. When this happens, he added, it will  reflect positively on the peace process and the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. [passage omitted]    Sha'th denied that Jordan told the Israelis it rejects a  Palestinian presence on the crossings between Jericho and the  Jordanian border. [passage omitted]</p>

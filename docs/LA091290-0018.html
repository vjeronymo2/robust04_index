			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES RAISES PARKING FEES, BUSINESS TAX  </P> <P> In the Aug. 29 Metro section you reported:  </P> <P> 1) "Council OKs Hike in Tax on Businesses"  </P> <P> 2) "LAX Parking Fees to Increase Again"  </P> <P> When will this taxation stop? Recently, every time I pick up a publication,  higher taxes are being reported.  </P> <P> Will 1990 be known as the year of "gouge the taxpayers to death"?  </P> <P> I will vote against every incumbent currently in office. I will encourage  family, friends and co-workers to do the same. We must begin to live within our  means -- including local, state and federal governments!  </P> <P> LES MILLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

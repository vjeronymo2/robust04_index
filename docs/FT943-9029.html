			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Amsterdam is gripped by hopes and fears  -The Dutch market In most countries, the failure to form a new government more than 100 days after a general election would be expected to spark, at the very least, some sort of reaction on the stock exchange. In the Netherlands, where coalition governments are the norm and economic stability is almost ingrained, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange has hardly taken any notice of the drawn-out political talks in The Hague. This week the deadlock appears to have been broken at last, though this caused little excitement on the bourse. This might seem surprising because the proposed new government - comprising members of Labour, the right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66 - would be the first in modern Dutch history to exclude from power the Christian Democrats, the main losers in the May 3 general election. But as Mr Kees de Vaan, an analyst at Amsterdam-based merchant bank MeesPierson, says: 'The government formation talks have been a non-event for the bourse.' The main political parties are in broad agreement on the economy and the new government, when it is installed, will bring only nuance differences to existing policies, he notes. The prospect of a new government taking office next week will make little difference to sentiment on the bourse. And the strong likelihood that the finance minister will be from the Liberal party should quell any nervousness on the government bond market. Far from dwelling on politics, the Amsterdam exchange has spent much of the summer focusing on the dollar, interest rates and second-quarter corporate earnings, which reached a peak over the past 14 days with results from companies such as Philips, Royal Dutch, Unilever, Akzo, DSM and Hoogovens. As probably the most dollar-sensitive exchange in Europe, the Dutch bourse was hit briefly by dollar weakness earlier in the summer. But it has recovered well from the lows of late June, when the Amsterdam-EOE Index (AEX) hit 376.7 points after falling steadily from a high of 438.7 in late January. The reporting season of early August has seen Amsterdam swing from euphoria to nervousness. In spite of some strong gains that took the index up to more than 420 points and a series of sharp rises in corporate profits, the bourse has failed to achieve earler heights, closing yesterday at 414.43. The bourse's mixture of hope and fear is part of the market's transition to a new preoccupation with earnings following two years in which it has been driven mainly by interest rate concerns. Two of Amsterdam's cyclical companies, the chemicals groups Akzo and DSM, started the reporting season on August 3 with figures showing steep profit rises. Although the results exceeded analysts' expectations they led to some profit-taking on the day, reflecting the fact that both companies have outperformed the bourse in recent months. Since then Akzo has fallen further to trade at Fl 218.70 compared with Fl 219.50 on August 2, while DSM has slipped to Fl 144.50 from the F1 147 level in early August. In spite of the jagged price movements this month, analysts believe that some stocks, including individual cyclicals, still have room to rise. ABN Amro, in its August strategy report, said that it was cautious for the short term, but added there was a possibility that the AEX might stand at around 465 points by mid-1995. 'Our strategy remains unchanged,' the bank said. 'We continue to be overweight in cyclical shares.' MeesPierson, noting that market valuation was already high in historical terms, is forecasting a 15 per cent return for the bourse over the next 12 months. Analysts are agreed that selectivity is important, even in the popular cyclical end of the market. Of the two chemicals companies, Akzo is preferred for long-term potential over DSM. Other cyclicals cited as buys are KNP BT, the big Dutch-based paper and packaging group; Hunter Douglas, the manufacturer of venetian blinds and ceiling systems; and Nedlloyd, the Rotterdam road and ocean-going transport company. Not all company results were well received. The nearly 15 per cent rise reported on Tuesday by PolyGram, the music company that is majority-owned by Philips, fell short of expectations, helping to unsettle other parts of the market briefly at mid-week. In recent days investors in Amsterdam have shown that they are looking not only at second-quarter results but also at forecasts for the rest of the year. Hoogovens, which reported a swing back into profit for the first half, pleased the market with forecasts of substantial increases to come. Its shares rose by 4.7 per cent to Fl 80.70 on Wednesday after the results. Another beneficiary from a strong forecast is Philips, which trebled net profit before extraordinaries at the half-year stage and predicted a substantial increase for the year as a whole. Banks and insurers, underperformers in recent months and not due to report until later in August, seem out of favour with many analysts because of the potential for rises in long-term interest rates.</p>

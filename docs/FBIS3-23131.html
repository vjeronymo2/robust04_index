			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Suhayr 'Ubaydat] </F>   [Excerpts] Amman--The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)  Sunday renewed a call on the mainstream Fatah faction of the  Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) to renounce the Middle  East peace process and join hands to liberate Palestine through  armed struggle.    "We call upon our brothers in Fatah to join hands and  escalate the intifada and holy war against the enemy," said an  open letter signed by Hamas.    In a separate statement, the group, which is dominant in the  occupied Gaza Strip, warned Palestinian negotiators to quit the  peace talks or face unspecified consquences. [passage omitted]    "The (massacre in Hebron) in which hundreds of our people  died confirms the righteousness of the resistance and armed  struggle... and exposes the Zionists' claims that they wish to  live with our people in peace," said the statement.    In its open letter, a copy of which was made available to  the  JORDAN TIMES, Hamas urged "our brothers in Fatah ... to respond  to this brotherly and national call ... to abort the  surrendering scheme led by the Oslo men."    Hamas, while vowing to wreck the autonomy accord through  escalated attacks against Israeli targets, appeared to drop its  earlier stand that it would not take up arms against fellow  Palestinians.    In its message addressed to the Palestinians in the occupied  territories, Hamas threatened Palestinian negotiators with  attacks if they do not withdraw from negotiations with Israel.    "We demand that the Oslo team announce their immediate  withdrawal from the negotiations with Israel ... we will not  allow a handful of us (Palestinians) to continue negotiations  with those murderers at the expense of the Palestinian people,"  said the letter.    The letter also called on the Palestinians in the occupied  territories to observe a three-day general strike, escalate the  intifada and carry out revenge attacks against Israeli soldiers  and settlers and engage in fights with them.    "We call on our people to avenge the killing of our martyrs  and consider the occupation troops and settlers as permanent  targets wherever they may be," read the letter.    The letter also called for demonstrations and marches  throughout the occupied territories.    It also called on the people of Hebron to protect the  Ibrahimi mosque and continue praying in it.

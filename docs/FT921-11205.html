			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Travel: A perfect choice - Morocco combines startling physical beauty with cultured sangfroid. It is ideal for the trekker, the loafer and the honeymooner. Honeymooner Antonia Sharpe booked herself into La Gazelle d'Or at Taroudannt, where things got off to a generally fine start THE SWARTHY waiter in a long white robe politely approached the plump English woman eying the lavish buffet, writes Antonia Sharpe. She dismissed his attempts to explain each dish with an almost regal wave. 'Don't worry, I'll work my way down,' she said, her plummy voice echoing across the pristine swimming pool. 'Obviously a practised hand,' murmured my husband of less than seven days, without taking his eyes from his fourth book of our honeymoon. I stifled a laugh, not wanting to shatter the sunny peace for our fellow guests at La Gazelle d'Or. Looking around, I saw that their noses were also buried in books. I sighed, and settled back into my sunbed. Yes, I had made the perfect choice for our honeymoon. The five-hour journey had not been too bad, though the flight from London to Casablanca had been ruined by Royal Air Maroc's easy-going attitude towards smokers. But that was forgotten once we touched down in Agadir and were met by the hotel chauffeur who drove us the 60 km to Taroudannt with consummate despatch. Our spirits rose further on our arrival at La Gazelle d'Or at midnight. We listened to the chorus of cicadas, looked at the stars in the inky sky, and breathed in the clear mountain air sweetened by the smell of oranges. We were shown to our bungalow, where the soft lighting set the peach-coloured walls aglow. There was a big fireplace in one corner, carpets on the stone floor and, beneath a large wall carving, a king-size bed. To steal a line from Truman Capote, we soon got the feeling that nothing bad would happen to us at La Gazelle d'Or. After breakfast we often took a stroll through the hotel's gardens. There was a profusion of bougainvillaea, frangipani, orange and lemon trees, cotton trees, hibiscus and oleander bushes and waist-high geraniums. The sight of gleaming Arab horses grazing on the lawns, with the snow-capped Atlas mountains in the background, seemed unreal when the Sahara was only 200 km away. We only ran into the other residents at mealtimes or at the swimming pool. Since the hotel has only 30 bungalows, it seemed as if we had the place to ourselves. During our stay most of the residents were English, though there were a few continentals. We thought that one French lady was mad because she kept talking to her Louis Vuitton handbag, but we later realised that she carried her tiny terrier around in it. We usually took a light lunch at the swimming pool, and spent the afternoon sunbathing. A five-course dinner, brought by a platoon of waiters under the command of a Peter Sellers lookalike, was served in the hotel's dining room. The menu was pred- ominantly Franco-Moroccan. We particularly liked the briouattes, deep-fried pastry stuffed with veal and vegetables, though the tajines, or stews, might have become monotonous had we stayed longer than a week. We only ventured from the hotel once, when we visited the medina in Taroudannt to buy a Berber carpet. So the nearest we got to a camel was the earthenware figurine laden with salt and pepper on the dining room tables. However, the hotel does organise excursions on request. Hotel La Gazelle d'Or, Taroudannt, Morocco, tel: (8)-852048 and 852039; fax: (8)-852737. The hotel charges a daily rate of Dh2,300 (about Pounds 154) per couple for room and half-board, inclusive of local taxes. Transfers to and from the airport cost Dh500 (Pounds 34) per room each way. Apex economy return flights from London to Agadir via Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc start from Pounds 250. It is advisable to book your stay directly with the hotel because some travel agents in the UK who advertise holidays at the Gazelle d'Or appear to charge excessively.</p>

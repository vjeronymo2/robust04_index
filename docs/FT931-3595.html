			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / People: Ritchie switches off from Tyne Tees TV Ian Ritchie is this week leaving his post as Tyne Tees Television's managing director, following his decision not to stand for re-election as a board member of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Group at Friday's agm in Leeds. Ritchie will be succeeded as Tyne Tees managing director by John Calvert, currently the group director of personnel. No announcement has yet been made on who is to fill Ritchie's other role of group deputy chief executive. Although Ritchie's departure has been officially described as amicable, insiders say it reflects tension within the group over the extent to which Tyne Tees TV, headquartered in Newcastle, could maintain its autonomy following last year's merger with its larger Leeds-based neighbour, Yorkshire Television. A week before Friday's AGM, an executive board meeting of the group discussed plans for a radical restructuring, under which Tyne Tees would have played a much more subsidiary role within the merged company. 'That was the final battle at which Ian lost the war,' said one insider. He said he understood the Independent Television Commission's support had been sought for the restructuring, but it had said it could only comment once plans had been implemented. Yesterday, however, Yorkshire Television firmly denied that it was running down the Tyne Tees operations and dismissed suggestions that Mr Ritchie had left after disagreements with Mr Clive Leach, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees managing director. 'Tyne Tees will continue to have a strong production base,' the company said, adding that nothing would be done 'that would affect the licence commitment of the company, or the commitments given at the time of the merger'. Yorkshire and Tyne Tees were among the highest bidders for franchises in 1991, paying Pounds 37.7m and Pounds 15m respectively - a combined weekly payment of more than Pounds 1m. Last November the group announced 292 job losses, at that time nearly a quarter of the combined workforce. Calvert joined Yorkshire Television as director of personnel in August 1988; previously he was director of industrial relations for the ITV network, based in London. He became a director of Yorkshire Television Holdings in 1989.</p>

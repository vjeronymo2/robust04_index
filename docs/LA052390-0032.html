			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOFTBALL;  </P> <P> MARTINEZ NEARLY PERFECT AS CHULA VISTA WINS  </P> <P> Jennifer Martinez glared at the catcher's mitt, went into her windmill delivery  and . . . pop!  </P> <P> An instant later, ball struck mitt perfectly. Remember that word, for this was  only warm-ups.  </P> <P> A little over an hour and eight innings later, Martinez and Chula Vista High  were 1-0 winners over Mt. Carmel in the quarterfinal round of the San Diego  Section 3-A softball playoffs.  </P> <P> Through the first 23 batters (7 2/3 innings), Martinez was indeed perfect. The  24th -- Trish Maumausolo -- grounded into the hole to the right of shortstop  Kathy Slatinsky, who made a fine play, only to see her throw tip off first  baseman Monica Medina's mitt.  </P> <P> No matter. Catcher Lisa Wilson quickly eliminated Maumausolo on an attempted  steal.  </P> <P> In the bottom half of the eighth, Wilson (two for four) lined a single up the  middle that scored Slatinsky from second, and the Spartans (20-8) advanced to  Thursday's semifinal against Orange Glen at Kit Carson Park in Escondido. Mt.  Carmel finished 20-5.  </P> <P> Martinez (12-3) finished with her second no-hitter, 13 strikeouts and endless  praise from both sides.  </P> <P> "We knew in the first inning it was going to be tough to hit her," said  Jennifer Ortiz, Mt. Carmel's freshman pitcher, who worked a three-hitter  heading into the eighth.  </P> <P> "To throw a no-hitter against a team like that was something," Chula Vista  Coach Debi Daenzer said. "(Martinez) pitched an awesome game."  </P> <P> Said Martinez, just a sophomore, "Even when I was warming up, I could feel I  was going to have a good game. I could pick out a spot and hit it. My spin, my  rise, everything was on."  </P> <P> Martinez was on between the foul lines, too. She didn't come close to walking a  batter and started the game by striking out seven of the first nine.  </P> <P> Chula Vista loaded the bases in the bottom of the first and had runners on in  five of the regulation seven innings, but each time was denied by Ortiz (17-3).  She struck out Medina to end the first, and in the seventh got a nice double  play when first baseman Stacy Thimjon dove and caught in the air a bunt  attempt, got up and threw to first for the force.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate </F> of the Solidarity Party, by unidentified reporter at Solidarity  Party headquarters in Panama City -- live]    [Text] [Reporter] Here we are at the Solidarity Party  headquarters to interview Samuel Lewis Galindo, Solidarity Party  and National Unity Mission [MUN] presidential candidate. Mr.  Sammy, we already have the partial results of these presidential  elections; what do you think about them? What is your first  impression?    [Lewis] I believe there is a seemingly clear trend favoring  Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary Party;  however, as far as I know, the Electoral Tribunal [TE] has not  yet released any official figures. Let us wait for some  tangible information to ensure that we can conduct a final  evaluation of the election results. It seems that the trend is  indeed favoring Ernesto Perez Balladares.    [Reporter] The TE magistrates have reported that the process  seems to have evolved smoothly. Has any candidate of your party  or of the MUN complained? Have you heard anyone complaining?    [Lewis] We do not have any significant complaints, because  the electoral process evolved normally. This situation must  make all Panamanians proud, because we are displaying a great  sense of civic responsibility. We have wisely exercised the  right that democracy bestows upon us. This is indeed  strengthening the incipient democracy we Panamanians have.    [Reporter] Are you going to promote consensus with all  political parties regardless of who is elected president?    [Lewis] I will extend my warmest congratulations to the  candidate elected through popular vote, because all Panamanians  must join the winner and support him to ensure that we reach a  consensus that could not have materialized before the elections.  I trust that whoever the winner is, he will honor his  commitments, because all the candidates talked about national  consensus. I repeat, we hope the winner will honor his  commitments to the Panamanian people.    [Reporter] Thank you very much. This was Solidarity Party  presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo from his party  headquarters. He has been following the elections through  Telemetro Television Network.</p>

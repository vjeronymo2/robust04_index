			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> SAMONIEGO HOMERS TO LEAD SAN FERNANDO  </P> <P> San Fernando High snuffed three consecutive rallies by visiting Taft on  Wednesday and senior first baseman Bernie Samoniego hit a two-run home run to  lead the Tigers to a 3-2 victory in a first-round 4-A Division game.  </P> <P> San Fernando (14-6) led, 2-0, after Samoniego smashed a 3-2 pitch from freshman  Julie Kawamoto over the left-field fence with Gloria Sanchez aboard.  </P> <P> Taft (9-12) scored a run in the fourth and San Fernando countered with a run in  the bottom of the inning. Taft rallies in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings,  however, were cut short by senior right-handed pitcher Denise Mendoza, a good  San Fernando defense and a controversial force play at third base.  </P> <P> In the fourth, Taft left runners at second and third as Mendoza recorded the  final two outs on a strikeout and a back-to-the-box groundout.  </P> <P> Taft scored a run in the fifth, but San Fernando left fielder Lorena Lopez  prevented further damage with a running backhanded catch of a line drive by  Stephanie Fontane to leave a runner stranded at second base.  </P> <P> With none out in the sixth and Taft runners at first and second, Mendoza  fielded a sacrifice bunt and relayed to shortstop Edna Salandez covering third  base in time to retire Michele Gardner.  </P> <P> The ball appeared to squirt out of Salandez's mitt. But both umpires -- to the  vocal displeasure of a bleacher full of angry Taft supporters behind third base  -- ruled the play an out. Taft did not score in the inning.  </P> <P> "That play had an effect on the game," Taft Coach Carol Morgan said. "I don't  believe that both umpires could see it."  </P> <P> Said Salandez: "It didn't pop out. I don't know what they're all thinking."  </P> <P> San Fernando Coach Bill Rielly said that Salandez made a "snow-cone" catch.  "All she needed to do was step on the base and she was sitting on it."  </P> <P> San Fernando will play Carson, which had a first-round bye, Wednesday at  Carson. VINCE KOWALICK  </P></p>

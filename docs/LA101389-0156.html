			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LA QUINTA HOLDS ON TO DEFEAT KENNEDY  </P> <P> How nerve-wracked was La Quinta High School's football team Thursday night as  it watched Kennedy attempt a fourth-quarter rally?  </P> <P> Consider the La Quinta players on the sidelines, screaming at each other in  disgust: "We shoulda killed 'em! We shoulda had four more touchdowns! You don't  want it enough . . . !"  </P> <P> And the La Quinta coaches, shouting at the players in rapid-fire commands. And  don't forget the La Quinta ball boy, dropping down on one knee, looking up  toward the sky while solemnly making the sign of the cross.  </P> <P> All this and more capped La Quinta's 20-14 Garden Grove League victory over  Kennedy at Bolsa Grande High School.  </P> <P> Until the fourth quarter, La Quinta dominated the game, with Trent Julian  scoring touchdowns on a 47-yard play pass from Richard Weaver and on a one-yard  run, and Matt Logan kicking field goals of 49 and 22 yards to give La Quinta a  20-0.  </P> <P> But after three quarters of lackluster play, Kennedy finally found its groove.  After driving to the La Quinta two and fumbling the ball away, Kennedy mad a  fumble recovery of its own moments later and then scored on a one-yard run by  Vince Church.  </P> <P> Two plays later, Kennedy's Craig Road intercepted Richard Weaver at midfield  and ran the ball back 45 yards for the touchdown. Scott Jones' kick cut  Kennedy's deficit to 20-14 with 8:52 remaining.  </P> <P> Kennedy didn't let up, and with a minute to go, started its final drive. On a  24-yard reception from Kennedy quarterback Russ Clark, Church took the Fighting  Irish to the 39.  </P> <P> With 46 seconds left, Clark looked for a receiver in the end zone, but he was  rushed and the pass was knocked away. With 18 seconds left, Clark was sacked,  and on the final play, La Quinta junior safety Don Hopkins intercepted a pass  by Clark in the end zone to end the game.  </P></p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Arts: Controlled turmoil - Jazz We were promised one set of solo manoeuvres from leader/pianist McCoy Tyner before the big guns blew in to the Festival Hall. In the event, the orchestra was in full sail after just two brief standards. From there on in it was grit the teeth and surrender yourself to the gale forces of a nine-piece brass section fronted by three reeds and steered by a weighty rhythm section. For those jazz fans who are braced by a big band at full tilt, an evening with this McCoy Tyner ensemble is equal to a week at Cowes for blowing out the cobwebs. In the game of name association that plagues more than a few individualists in jazz, Tyner is forever linked with the memory of John Coltrane, thanks to a 20-album partnership which includes items of jazz history such as A Love Supreme. Tyner left 'Trane in the mid-1960s as the saxophonist began moving further into the left field and instead devoted himself to refining his turbulent post-bop style of piano playing in small and large group settings. Straight-backed and two-handed, Tyner plays fast and fortissimo now. He hooks mightily into the keys with the right, the left erupting into showers of chords in a style that can encompass stride and frenetic bop in the course of a single solo. But last week, with the (amplified) firepower of 15 other pieces vying for earspace, it was too difficult to discern the sharp nuances of the leader's playing. Instead, the brute force of the brass was the focus of attention. Trombonists Steve Turre and Frank Lacy combined classical colour with New Orleans vigour to crowd-pleasing effect; the rasping tenor of John Stubblefield, cheeky in a Lester Young hat, put a skew on Blues On The Corner. Jerry Gonzalez, as fourth trumpet, added to the controlled turmoil with an extended conga solo. The arrangements provided little in the way of changing dynamic, save for some sweet harmonies in Tyner's Juanita. A big band can stimulate in many ways: last week we heard only the invigorating one.

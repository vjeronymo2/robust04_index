			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MILITARY-STYLE CAMPS TEACH RESPONSIBILITY;  </P> <P> PRISON PROVIDES SHOCK FOR N.Y. WOMEN INMATES  </P> <P> Felicita Rodriguez is ready to start her life over.  </P> <P> "I have a future in front of me," said the 24-year-old resident of New York  City's lower East Side. "A better future."  </P> <P> That future includes a high school equivalency degree, a job and the chance to  raise her two young children properly. Rodriguez said it will not include using  or selling drugs, which is what got her into trouble in the first place.  </P> <P> It also got her into state prison.  </P> <P> "This inmate thinks she can do it," she said. "I know I'm special now."  </P> <P> Rodriguez and 14 other women this month became the first female platoon to  complete New York state's shock incarceration program. About 1,400 of the  state's 40,000 prison inmates are women.  </P> <P> While doing their six months at the shock camp, the women followed an intense  regime of military drills, manual labor, exercise, remedial education and drug  and alcohol counseling. They lost weight, gained some self-respect -- and won  their freedom earlier than they would have in a traditional prison.  </P> <P> They opted into the program, trading a tough six months in an environment very  much like a Marine boot camp for a shorter prison term.  </P> <P> First-time, nonviolent offenders sentenced to three years or less in prison who  complete the shock program are immediately eligible for parole. That means they  can cut up to 2 1/2 years off their minimum prison time.  </P> <P> That is good news for the state, whose prisons are so overcrowded that  officials recently decided to start housing inmates in prison gymnasiums. And  it is very good news for inmates who want to go home early.  </P> <P> "I'm going home and growing my hair," said Christine Conti, a former cocaine  dealer, as she stuffed her possessions in a paper bag and prepared for a ride  home to New Jersey. The women in shock camp do not have to shave their heads as  closely as the male inmates, but their hair is cut to about collar length.  </P> <P> Conti, 25, said most of the other shock inmates "thought I was crazy" because  she liked the running and the strenuous exercise that begins every day at 5:30  a.m. But other aspects of the military life did not sit as well.  </P> <P> "The worst part is the mess hall," she said. "I like to talk when I eat. . . .  You can't talk. You can't even look."  </P> <P> Supt. Rosetta Burke said the military basis of the shock program teaches the  inmates responsibility, discipline and respect, traits most had "very little  grounding" in before.  </P> <P> Conti said drug counseling helped her get over a cocaine addiction. Before  shock camp, she said, "I wouldn't have told you I was a drug addict. They  taught me how to open up and deal with my problem."  </P> <P> Other programs taught her she did not "always have to say something about  everything."  </P> <P> Inmates who do not like the program can transfer back to a regular prison and  their longer sentences. Troublemakers are sent back.  </P> <P> The platoon of 15 started out with 25 women six months ago, most of them  convicted of drug charges. One woman owes a month because she was hospitalized  during her shock term. Another left for medical reasons. Five were kicked out  because of disciplinary problems.  </P> <P> Inmates like the three who chose to go back to prison "can't take it anymore,"  said Burke. "They don't like getting yelled at. They don't like getting up in  the morning. They don't like the responsibility.  </P> <P> "We don't let them off the hook."  </P> <P> While all of the graduating platoon spoke sincerely of new, brighter futures,  the odds are that a few of them will get in trouble again. Shock inmates have a  17% to 19% recidivism rate, Burke said. However, the average prison inmate  return rate is 25%.  </P> <P> That improvement -- and the millions the state can save through shorter prison  terms -- has prompted Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to propose raising the current  26-year age cap for shock camp to 29. The shock programs operated by a growing  number of states -- Louisiana and Mississippi also have graduated classes of  women -- have attracted the attention of national drug policy chief William J.  Bennett, who is interested in it for federal prisons.  </P></p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Appointments: An end to double VAT taxation Attempts to impose value-added tax on the private use of company cars could backfire on HM Customs and Excise and result instead in a reduction in the cost of car leasing. As well as removing existing VAT charges to employees who pay for their cars, there would also be a benefit to businesses as diverse as hospitals and insurance companies. Customs sees the benefit of private use as a service supplied by companies to their employees, on the value of which VAT should be paid. The ensuing dispute with the companies, however, could end in a fundamental change to the way the UK applies this European tax. Since the issue revolves around a case initially brought by a German individual against his local tax office, it also illustrates the extent to which the UK has already irretrievably ceded control of its taxation to superior and sophisticated European legislation. The change in VAT treatment now seems likely because the Customs' action has focused attention on this German case in which the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that a German statute similarly taxing the private use of a business vehicle was overridden by the direct effect of European VAT legislation. From the ruling it is quite clear that the UK has made the same fundamental error as the German VAT authorities in implementing the tax, and has failed to follow the principles of the underlying European legislation. This failure is unnecessarily inflating the price of various services, including car leasing, and costing VAT-exempt businesses and private users a double charge of VAT. To appreciate the significance of the error it must be understood that at present the whole UK car leasing industry is taxed unfairly. Unlike any other taxable business, car lessors cannot deduct the VAT on the purchase of cars from the VAT which they must pay on rentals. In the UK, VAT can only be deducted on the purchase of a new car for resale, not when it is used for leasing or in any other kind of business. This means that, contrary to the general system of VAT, when a car is leased, tax is paid to Customs twice. In the German case, a Dr Kuhne successfully relied on the VAT principle that there can be no taxation without a corresponding deduction. The European Court of Justice supported him in his claim that he should not be taxed on his private use of the car since he had been unable to recover VAT when he acquired it. In the UK, Customs and Excise have been busy in recent years ensuring that VAT is not deducted by exempt businesses, such as insurers, banks and hospitals, which are not allowed to do so because they do not have to charge VAT on their services. The principle upheld by the ECJ for Dr Kuhne supports counter-action by those businesses to remove double taxation arising from the insistence by Customs that VAT should be paid, for example, on the use of assets shared by groups of such companies. It seems that Customs has not yet fully recognised that it is administering a European tax whose principles cannot be altered or omitted, and which override national laws. This was plainly demonstrated in the Kuhne decision. The Kuhne case involved the private use of a vehicle for which the business owner made no actual charge to himself. The German authority therefore assumed a value for the deemed supply of the private use and assessed for tax accordingly. This action was taken under a German national statute, corresponding to the European provision for taxation of private use of business assets, but with one essential difference - the European law does not charge for deemed use where the business, for whatever reason, has not been able to recover VAT on the asset purchase. With the help of the ECJ, Dr Kuhne was therefore able to defeat the VAT charge. The Court said that the European legislation was complete and legally perfect and consequently capable of having direct effect in Community countries. The European law simply overrode the effect of the local national statute in Germany. Although the European principle has not been enshrined in UK national law, until recently Customs and Excise did not attempt to tax such private use of cars where no actual charge was made for the use. However, that policy showed disturbing signs of change last year with the emergence of the so-called salary sacrifice issue. It became known that Customs was levying VAT on the difference in salary between those employees who opted for company cars and those who did not, on the basis that the supposed shortfall represented the value of the car to the employee. This policy must have caused some minor embarrassment to the Treasury, whose fiscal policy seems in recent years to have been encouraging employees to swap cars for salary. So far, in a case involving the Co-operative Insurance Society, the VAT Tribunal has decided this matter against Customs. However, Customs is able to appeal the matter to the higher courts. Although the case was decided on other grounds, the Tribunal noted that prima facie the UK VAT law was proved defective by reference to the Kuhne decision. So how does this help car leasing and exempt businesses sharing assets, all of which, unlike Dr Kuhne, make an actual economic charge for the use of the asset? The answer is that the principle is precisely the same, whether or not any charge is actually made. There can be no taxation without deduction and if deduction is blocked, taxation must not follow. As might be expected of legislation which is complete and legally perfect, the relevant relief is to be found in the same EC Sixth Directive on VAT invoked by Dr Kuhne, which dates from 1977. Article 13 of the Directive deals with exemption from tax and exempts the supply of goods (which may include supply by way of lease) on which VAT has not been deducted. To leave no doubt as to its intention, the Article specifically includes those items on which VAT deduction has been blocked by national order, such as the UK block on cars. It therefore seems clear that, if asked to decide on the matter, the ECJ would conclude as it did in the Kuhne case that the exemption provision is complete and legally perfect so as to have direct effect in the UK. Such a decision, given to a UK company, would radically change the taxation of UK car leasing and ease the burden of VAT administration for exempt businesses. It would mean either that car lessors no longer needed to charge VAT on rentals or that they should be given the right to deduction on their purchases of cars. In either event, the cost of leasing would be reduced and, on cars purchased for the business, there would be no charges of VAT to employees, whether or not they paid for private use. In its wider application, hospitals and wholly exempt insurance groups, for instance, would no longer need to be concerned that the movement of assets might produce further charges of irrecoverable VAT. It remains to be seen whether Customs will act to resolve the anomaly, or will resist such a change on the grounds of fiscal cost. There is, however, more at stake than a slight drop in the tax take. The harmonisation of VAT and the removal of European trade frontiers after 1992 is meant to ease administrative burdens and level the fiscal playing field for national competitors. The Kuhne case, and others like it, have proved that the European VAT legislation works in practice and is truly self-sufficient. It would be a pity to find that UK businesses were disadvantaged in the single market by a national administration which, in failing to recognise this fact, continued to implement an incomplete form of VAT and penalised its own trading community.

Edinburgh Fund Managers said it had received acceptances for its bids from 51.26 per cent of Drayton Asia's capital and 42.04 per cent of its warrants. Mr Ratan Engineer, chairman of Drayton Asia, which strongly contested the bid, admitted that EFM Dragon was 'home and dry', but continued to claim that the deal was unsatisfactory for its shareholders, as there was no offer of a cash alternative. Last week Drayton dropped alternative proposals, which would have offered shareholders the choice between a unit trust and a new split capital investment trust, blaming opposition from CIN, the manager of the British Coal Pension Funds.

EFM Dragon must now calculate Drayton Asia's formula asset value as at March 26 before Drayton shareholders can be issued with Dragon shares under the terms of the bid. This will be done 'as soon as possible'. The offer has been extended. Sir Hugh Byatt, chairman of EFM Dragon, said: 'The way is now clear for shareholders and warrant holders to accept the offers in order to merge Drayton Asia with Dragon and create the largest pure Asian investment trust in the UK.'</p>

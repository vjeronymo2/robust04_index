The economic situation in the country, problems with  structural and agrarian reforms, and the alarming growth in  unemployment were discussed.

After the meeting Stefan Radoslavov, chief secretary of the  Bulgarian Social Democratic Party, expressed satisfaction with  the rather similar positions on various issues that were noted.    On behalf of the Green Party, Vladimir Sotirov conveyed to  the president a charter on national unity worked out by Green  Party experts.    President Zhelev also met representatives of the Union of  Thracian Associations, Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Union of Macedonian Associations, the Initiative  Committee on Protecting the Rights of Bulgarian Refugees, and  the Green Party.

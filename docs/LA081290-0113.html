			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOO MANY SACRIFICES ON ALTAR OF HOUSING  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ruth Galanter says the Channel Gateway project is a great mix of  community input and developer planning. She says the community supports this  mega-project.  </P> <P> She also makes sure the Coastal Commission hears the case more than 600 miles  from Venice rather than waiting one month and having the hearing in Marina del  Rey. She says this is necessary to preserve low income housing in the project.  She also says there is no contradiction between her opposition to Marina Place  and her support of Channel Gateway.  </P> <P> Her cynical pronouncements belie the fact that she has sold out every principle  she ever claimed to believe in. Our community is being raped at her command and  all she can say is affordable housing.  </P> <P> As a lifelong renter I am a true proponent of affordable housing. The Galanter  forces use the cause of affordable housing to further their own goals, increase  their own property values, insure their retirement in the few affordable  housing units available after Venice is transformed, and most important, insure  that the Galanter re-election coffers are always full.  </P> <P> LARRY SULLIVAN  </P> <P> Venice  </P> <P> Sullivan is president of the Venice Town Council.  </P> <P>  The Westside Section of The Times welcomes all viewpoints from readers about  issues on the Westside.

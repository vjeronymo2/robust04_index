			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Outdoors: Where big salmon bite - Fishing I have been goggling in wonderment at an extraordinary photograph, taken in the summer of 1926. On either side is a rugged Norwegian, one in cap and waders, the other showing a gleaming watch chain across his waistcoat. Behind is a wooden cabin, with a bare mountainside. Between the two men, arranged in four rows, are 33 salmon. There are two notable aspects to this catch, one merely amazing, the other well-nigh incredible. The amazing is the size of the fish; two weighed over 40lbs, six others weighed 30lbs or more, and the average of the 33 was 24lbs. What almost defies belief is that they were all caught during the night of July 7, by one man, the Duke of Westminster. Nearly 1,000lbs of salmon, all on fly, all on one rod, in seven or eight hours - the mind reels. It was quite an expedition for the duke and the chums who accompanied him on his yacht, the Cutty Sark. In a little under four weeks, they caught 684 salmon, at an average of 23 lbs. Nor was the Duke the chief scorer. His total of 173 was comfortably exceeded by the 208 caught by Colonel Sir North Dalrymple-Hamilton. Of these, no fewer than six weighed more than 40lbs. The river on which these feats of slaughter were performed lies 300 miles within the Arctic Circle, flowing a mere 27 miles from the forested plateau of Finnmark into the Barents Sea. It is the fabled Alta, and I am afraid the nearest you or I are going to get to fishing it is to read about those more fortunate than ourselves. The story of the Alta is one of its tremendous fish, of the hardy breed of boatmen who ply its surging waters, and of the anglers who, for 160 years, have come to do battle. Chief among these have been a succession of Britons distinguished by wealth, privilege, a taste for comfortable adventury, and a prodigious appetite for catching prodigious salmon. The first pioneer was the appealingly named Sir Hyde Parker, of Melford Hall, Suffolk. There was a painting of Sir Hyde, somewhat romantic in nature, which showed him kneeling in his waders beside a foaming torrent, with a fat salmon on the rocks beside him. He penetrated to the Alta in the mid-1830s, towards the end of a life which seems to have been largely devoted to prowling around Europe in search of sport and artistic treasures. We know Sir Hyde enjoyed good fishing on the Alta, and in the 1850s intelligence about this remarkable river excited the interest of the sixth Duke of Roxburghe. In July 1859 he sailed there, pitched camp, and in a month caught nearly 150 salmon and grilse. It was the start of an association which continues to this day. Five years later - having signed a lease on the whole river - the Duke brought a large party which included the queen's younger son, Prince Alfred, who caught 60 salmon in his first three days, 126 in all. While the fishermen fished each night, the rest of the guests danced aboard HMS Black Eagle, the strains of the brass band echoing across the Alta estuary. The Roxburghe lease was renewed in 1909 by the eighth Duke. The 1920s and 1930s were vintage years, as each summer the ninth Duke, Bobo, and the Duke of Westminster, known as Bendor, sailed north with their families and friends for fishing under the midnight sun. The local association split the river into five beats. But the two dukes returned. On his first night's fishing in 1939, the Duke of Westminster caught six fish over 30lbs. In the same year, the Earl of Dudley had a 60-pounder. But even this monster was eclipsed a few years later by one of the Alta boatman who caught a fish of 70lbs on fly, and another a  1/2 lb bigger on a spoon. Such fishing is the stuff of dreams, but the Alta continues to fulfil them - for the happy few. Among them is the 10th Duke of Roxburghe - as keen a salmon fisher as any of his forbears, but with rather less time to spare. I met him recently at Floors Castle, which stands by the Tweed at Kelso. He lent me two books about the Alta, written and privately published by a brace of its devotees, Roy Flurie and Theodor Dalenson. All the information I have presented comes from these absorbing volumes. Last year the Duke and his party had 47 fish for their week, averaging 25lbs. That, in these debased times, represents fantastic fishing, and the Duke grinned at the memory of it. And I - who have never caught a salmon of 25lbs, and will never fish the Alta - shared his pleasure.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Channel 5 writ against TV-am FIVE TV, one of the companies planning to bid for the Channel 5 licence, yesterday issued a writ against TV-am, the breakfast television company, for alleged breach of contract. Last week TV-am signed an agreement to bid for the franchise in a consortium that included Time Warner, the world's largest media organisation, and Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group. Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am chairman, was to be chairman of the consortium, to be called The Entertainment Channel. Yesterday Five TV, whose investors include Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto, said TV-am had signed a document in January agreeing not to invest in any other applicant for the Channel 5 licence other than Five TV. TV-am  - which lost its ITV franchise in last year's competitive tenders  - last night conceded that it had signed what appeared to be such an undertaking, but by mistake. The company said Mr Stratis Zographos, the TV-am finance director, had signed what he thought was a normal confidentiality agreement in order to be able to see the proposed Five TV business plan. It had then discovered a line about not investing in a rival Channel 5 bid. It said it would defend any legal action. Mr Gyngell said: 'We signed what we thought was a normal confidentiality agreement. We regard that line (about a rival bid) as a restraint of trade and that is also senior counsel's opinion.' TV-am is surprised at the timing of the legal action because both Mr Jeremy Fox, the chief executive of The Entertainment Channel, and Mr David Frost, the broadcaster and TV-am founder, have been in Toronto for talks with Mr Znaimer about a possible merger between the two bidders. The main choice for the Channel 5 licence may turn out to be between Five TV, which plans a mainly city-based service, and something like The Entertainment Channel, offering a largely national service.</p>

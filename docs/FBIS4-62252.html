			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM-TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev 13 May TASS -- A plan for socio-economic  development of Ukraine in 1995 aims primarily at overcoming  inflation, stabilizing economic output, and raising the people's  living standards.    The plan was considered on Thursday [12 May] at a session of  the collegium of the Ukrainian Economics Ministry. It also  highlights demonopolizing national economy; fostering small  businesses; forming stock market and implementing agricultural  reform.    The participants in the session also discussed a national  programme called "Ukraine's oil and gas -- 2010", which provided  for a comprehensive evaluation of opportunities to increase both  national oil and gas production and reserves.    At present, Ukraine's own gas and oil production may meet 9  to 11 percent (4 mln tonnes) of its oil consumption needs and 18  to 20 percent (18 bln cubic meters) of its gas consumption needs.    An effective use of its natural resources may enable Ukraine  to stabilize and, in the long run, increase its oil and gas  production to a measure.</p>

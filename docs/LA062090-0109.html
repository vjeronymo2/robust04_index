			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS CELEBRATE DOWN-ZONING STAND  </P> <P> Residents who have fought for four years to limit development in the Cypress  Street neighborhood are celebrating this week after the Planning Commission  decided that the area should be rezoned for lower density.  </P> <P> The recommendation to the City Council, which residents say closely reflects a  petition drafted by the community, suggests that the six-block area, where  multiple dwellings are now allowed, be down-zoned to allow duplexes at most.  </P> <P> Residents hope the change will help them control overcrowding, crime and gang  activity.  </P> <P> "It's a good beginning," said Bea Vega, a 39-year resident of the Old Towne  community. "It will be a nicer place to live." Vega said she is optimistic that  the City Council will accept the commission's recommendation.  </P> <P> Commissioner Don Greek opposed the change, saying it was not an effective way  to upgrade the neighborhood.  </P> <P> The commission also voted unanimously to recommend a general plan amendment to  rezone the Santa Fe Railroad Depot area from light industry to a limited  business and residential district, if the City Council also can guarantee an  emergency fund that businesses may use to help them relocate in case of  disaster.  </P> <P> Despite the promise of financial help, longtime owners of industrial property  said they were unhappy with the recommendation because rezoning would diminish  the value of their land.  </P> <P> Robert Baier, whose family has owned property in the 33-acre industrial area  for 70 years, said that if the area is rezoned as residential, his two lots  would sell for one-third the current appraised value of $300,000.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission recommendation follows a study two years ago that  showed that the depot area was under-utilized and suggested that it be  developed as a commercial and retail center to attract pedestrian traffic from  Orange Plaza.MARY HELEN BERG  </P></p>

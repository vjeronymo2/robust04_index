			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The People's Vanguard  of Costa Rica adopted a special resolution titled "Solidarity  With the DPRK" on June 12, supporting the DPRK's proposal for  denuclearising the Korean peninsula and expressing solidarity  with the Workers' Party of Korea, the DPRK Government and people  in the struggle against the new war provocation moves of the  United States and the South Korean puppets.    Pressure from the imperialist powers such as "sanctions"  against the DPRK is a blasting fuse which may cause a war on the  Korean peninsula and spread its flames worldwide, said the  resolution, denouncing the United States and other imperialist  powers for monopolizing nuclear weapons and using them as a  means of threat and blackmail against other countries.</p>

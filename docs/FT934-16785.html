			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Plans for free market in milk may trigger legal row THE MILK Marketing Board yesterday announced detailed plans for the structure of the new free market in milk when the compulsory purchasing scheme is wound up next April and replaced by Milk Marque, a producer-owned co-operative. The proposals confirmed a controversial giveaway of the bulk of shares in Dairy Crest, the board's dairy products subsidiary in which a minority stake is due to be floated on the Stock Exchange next February or March. The board's plan to distribute the shares to current dairy farmers only is expected to trigger legal action from former producers if the scheme is approved by the Ministry of Agriculture. Mr William Neville of Burges Salmon, the Bristol solicitors representing hundreds of former producers, said they were confident that the plan would be rejected by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister. The ex-farmers claim that they should receive shares because they contributed to Dairy Crest in the past through the milk price and capital levies. But the board said the proposals, under which up to 75 per cent of its shares in Dairy Crest would be handed to farmers according to the value of milk they produced in the 1992-93 financial year, were the fairest that could be devised. The ministry will consult the dairy industry and other interested parties and is expected to issue its response by the end of the year. The board said that Milk Marque would be established with a net asset value of Pounds 50m. This will comprise Pounds 27m in working capital and Pounds 23m for assets including the board's milk testing laboratories and 23 of the 40 collection depots owned by Dairy Crest. The board is proposing that 25 per cent to 35 per cent of Dairy Crest should be floated. Individual shareholdings would be limited to 15 per cent of total share capital during Dairy Crest's first five years as a quoted company. Current dairy farmers will receive certificates of entitlement to a share of the board's assets according to their milk output. They will receive interest on these and be entitled to a cash payment after five years if they do not join Milk Marque or decide to leave it. Mr Andrew Dare, the board's chief executive, is predicting that up to 80 per cent of the UK's 30,000 dairy farmers will join Milk Marque. Under yesterday's proposals, they would have to give 12 months' notice to leave and would forfeit 2 per cent of the value of their previous year's milk production if they gave less notice.</p>

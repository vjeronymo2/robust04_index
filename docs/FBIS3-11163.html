The Bolivian president is here  on an official visit, and during his first meeting with Carlos  Menem he discussed the signing of several bilateral agreements.  He also began discussions to obtain a measure of exception that  will allow Bolivians who reside here to obtain their residence  documents.    "For Bolivians, Argentina is practically their second  fatherland. Thousands of Bolivians reside in Buenos Aires and  throughout Argentina and contribute toward this country with  their work," Sanchez de Losada said on his arrival in the  country.    Regarding the possibility of joining Mercosur, the Bolivian  president said: "I have very much wanted to approach Mercosur  because we are a part of the Pacific's Amazon Basin, but we also  belong to the River Plate Basin." But a diplomatic source  indicated that the possibility is very remote and could only  happen within the framework of a Brazilian initiative to create  a giant South American common market.    Moreover, the agenda's main topic is the signing of an  agreement that will permit the free exchange of gas, oil, and  their by-products with an eye on bilateral integration in the  energy sector. Argentine credits for the prevention of cholera  in border areas is also an agenda topic.</p>

The investigation is part of a co-operative research program  between Anhui Medical University and the Medical College of  Harvard University in the U.S.    The research into chronic and non-infectious diseases, which  started in May this year and will continue for 20 years, aims at  clarifying the role of occupation- and environment-related  factors that cause chronic diseases.    Since the 1970s the death rate from infectious diseases has  been effectively curbed worldwide because of the introduction of  effective vaccines and antibiotics. However, not much research  has been done on the relationship between the environment and  occupations, and chronic diseases such as tumors and heart  disease, which are now major causes of death.    The two institutes chose the Yingjiang district of Anqing  city, Yijin town in Jiyang County and Haikou town in Huaining  County, all in Anhui, as the focus of their field work.    A four-month investigation of 52,000 of the total 60,000  population in the three areas has already been concluded,  covering 2,378 items, including chronic respiratory ailments,  the influence of pesticides on health, female fertility and  medical services in the countryside.    An investigation of the urban population in the same areas  will soon be carried out.    These surveys will be repeated at five-year intervals, and  the information will be fed into computers.</p>

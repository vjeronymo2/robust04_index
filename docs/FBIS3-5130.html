The United States is prepared to move toward improved  political and economic relations with North Korea, said Lynn  Davis, undersecretary of state for international security  affairs. "To implement this approach," she said, "we will need  legal flexibility to use both inducements and potential sticks'  to influence the North," Davis said.    "Therefore, we do not favor any legislation that would  impose  additional legal barriers to lifting existing economic sanctions  (against North Korea," she said. Speaking at a Senate Foreign  Relations Committee hearing Thursday, Davis said, however, that  North Korea must make a clear commitment to resolving the  nuclear issue in the near future. "It must demonstrate in  actions, not just words, that it is renouncing a nuclear weapons  capability," she said. "That means the North must remain a  member of the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) and  implement its IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)  full-scope safeguards agreement, including special inspections  and any other measures needed to clear up past discrepancies,"  she said. In addition, she said Pyongyang must work with Seoul  to fully implement the North-South denuclarization declaration.    "If the North executes the agreement we reached in December,  and its recent understanding with the IAEA on inspections needed  to maintain the continuity of safeguards, the way will be open  for a third round of U.S.-North Korean talks," Davis said. But  if North Korea fails to implement the agreement, then the issue  will be returned to the U.N. Security Council for further  action, including sanctions, she said. In the meantime, Davis  said the United States and South Korea have continued to take  prudent measures to ensure that "our defenses" remain strong.    "At the request of the U.N. commander of U.S. forces in  Korea, General Luck, we have been considering a decision to  deploy a Patriot missile battalion in South Korea," she said.  This would be a defensive deployment in response to North  Korea's missile capability, and is a prudent military step in  light of the prevailing tension on the Korean peninsula, she  said. "We are continuing to consult with South Korea on this  matter, with the predisposition that we will go ahead when the  time is right," she added.</p>

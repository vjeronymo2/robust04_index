			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (4): A burden and a blessing - Frank McGurty examines the healthcare sector By all accounts, Massachusetts has one of the finest healthcare systems in the US, indeed the world. Its 150 hospitals are renowned for their technical excellence. Harvard leads a list of prestigious medical schools which assure the state has a pool of highly skilled doctors. A dense concentration of research laboratories gives patients access to the latest innovations in treatment and technology. Yet this seemingly enviable position is as much a burden for the commonwealth as a blessing. As the healthcare industry struggles to adapt to mounting pressures to control medical inflation, it has become evident that the elite nature of the system is itself at least partly to blame for the high costs. For hospitals and clinics around the state, the tension between survival and maintaining the highest quality care has become painfully apparent over the past two years. Big purchasers of healthcare - including employers, insurers and the government - are forcing providers to become more efficient. A sweeping restructuring of the industry, which employs about 10.5 per cent of the state's workforce, is all but inevitable. The consequences of this shake-out will extend well beyond the sector, with hospital closures and consolidations likely to impede the economy in its tentative recovery from recession. Estimates of the number of healthcare job losses range up to 30,000, with most of them pruned from hospital staffs. That represents a stunning reversal for the industry, which was one of the few sources of new employment in Massachusetts between 1988 and 1993, when the state's economy suffered a net loss of 400,000 jobs. The market forces driving the industry to restructure have gathered momentum independently of the sputtering efforts in Congress to enact healthcare reform legislation. In the commonwealth, the consolidation is well under way. 'In Massachusetts, healthcare reform is now an auto-catalytic process,' says Mr Ron Hollander, vice-president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association. 'The faster it goes, the faster it will go.' The most important development so far was the merger of Massachusetts General and Brigham &amp; Women's, two of most prestigious hospitals in the state. The goal of the affiliation, announced last March, is to reduce their combined operating budgets by at least 20 per cent over three years, initially through administrative and supply savings, and later by eliminating duplicative medical services. Their union carries symbolic and practical implications for the state's entire healthcare delivery system. It has already triggered a flurry of new alliances between providers seeking to assure themselves of a big enough piece of a shrinking pie to survive into the next century. 'If hospitals with the reputation, clinical strength and financial strength of Mass General and Brigham &amp; Women's see the need to combine forces, what institution can believe it can go it alone?' asks Mr Hollander. Most of the restructuring activity is aimed at creating efficiencies through 'downsizing' and outright closures of hospitals and other facilities. In mid-sized cities such as Worcester and New Bedford, hospitals have either banded together into two or three competing groups in each market, or are discussing such a move. Some big city hospitals are striking deals to divide up the available business. In June, Deaconess Hospital and New England Baptist forged a pact under which the former would focus on adult tertiary medicine and surgery, while the latter would concentrate on muscular-skeletal disorders. Meanwhile, new affiliations between different types of providers - such as teaching hospitals, community hospitals and physician groups - are being constructed, especially in and around the state capital. Such hierarchal networks are intended to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate - and cost-efficient - setting. Carney Hospital, to name just one, is negotiating with the fledgling Mass General-Brigham organisation. An affiliation with the 289-bed community hospital, serving neighbourhoods south of downtown Boston, could give the partners access to a sizeable base of new patients for their specialised units. For Carney, which has lost about 8 per cent of its in-hospital volume in the past three years, the deal may represent a financial lifeline. 'The process is not just about cutting a housekeeper here or clerk there,' says Mr Hollander. 'It's about fundamentally rethinking what we do in order to devise more efficient and effective ways of delivering care.' Analysts point out that the commonwealth spends more per person for healthcare than any other state. Average payments for services and prescriptions are about 20 per cent higher than the US average, according to the Families USA Foundation, an advocacy group. The reasons are not entirely clear, but the evidence suggests that the state has too much of several good things. High personal income and generous benefit packages from Massachusetts employers seem to play a role. More importantly perhaps, a recent study conducted by a group of industry leaders and healthcare professionals suggests the state simply has too many doctors and hospitals. That would not appear to be a problem. However, in apparent defiance of the law of supply and demand, 'healthcare spending has been observed to increase with the size of a state's healthcare infrastructure', the group says in its report, released last spring. The anomaly is explained by the emphasis on in-hospital treatment which results from the sheer number of providers, particularly expensive urban medical centres and teaching hospitals, such as Mass General and Brigham &amp; Women's. 'While Massachusetts teaching hospitals are a vital resource, contributing to the state's prestigious reputation. . . care in teaching settings is known to be more costly,' according to the study, conducted for the Governor's Council on Economic Growth and Technology. Ironically, the pressure to control healthcare inflation arguably is now more intense in Massachusetts than anywhere else. This is largely because the state has a greater proportion of its population - about 40 per cent - enrolled in so-called health maintenance organisations (HMOs). In contrast to traditional indemnity insurers, which pay a percentage of their policyholders' healthcare fees on a service-by-service basis, HMOs offer subscribers a full range of services for a fixed price. They are forcing doctors and hospitals under contract with them to keep expensive services, such as hospital admissions, to a bare minimum. If anything, their clout to bargain for lower rates will probably increase, as HMOs begin a consolidation of their own. Harvard Community Health Plan, the commonwealth's biggest HMO, is awaiting regulatory approval for its agreed merger with Matthew Thorton, a New Hampshire-based group, and Pilgrim Health Care of Massachusetts. The combined organisation would have about 1m members in four New England states. In the face of such pressure, and the development of technology that facilitates out-patient care, hospitals are finding themselves with too many empty beds. Industry observers estimate that the number of patient-days in hospital will shrink by 30 to 50 per cent from the peak years in the mid-1980s. That precludes a drastic reduction in the number of available beds, and a subsequent cut in hospital staff throughout the state. In the end, employers who now must foot the bill for the country's most expensive healthcare system are likely to benefit. The big losers, at least temporarily, are sure to be the thousands who will lose their jobs.</p>

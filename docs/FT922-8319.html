			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (9): Interest rates on way down - Bank mergers seem likely IF THERE IS one issue that unites bankers, farmers, industrialists and politicians, it is the high cost of credit. High interest rates are discouraging investment at a time when continued expansion depends heavily on investment. Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, and Mr Martin Redrado, president of the National Securities Commission (CNV), are both acutely aware of this problem and are working urgently on reforming the financial system. Mr Cavallo's reforms are intended to eliminate the government's role as borrower on the local and international markets, allowing the private sector to occupy that space. Companies have already begun responding, firstly by issuing bonds on the domestic market, followed by a flurry of Eurobond issues in early 1991. Interest rates have already fallen dramatically as inflation subsides, capital floods into the country and Argentines regain confidence in their currency. This is a significant change from previous adjustment programmes, in which governments were forced to keep interest rates artificially high to defend the exchange rate. Despite such action, sooner or later, the currency would slide as speculative investors poured out of the market. In March, Argentine banks had Dollars 16.84bn on deposit - almost twice their volume a year earlier and almost seven times more than in March 1990. Just as importantly, depositors are increasingly willing to leave their money in the bank. For the first time in over three years, deposits with maturities of over 30 days - Dollars 1.60bn - exceeded short-term deposits of Dollars 1.41bn. Businesses have made huge savings as their financial costs shrink and the risk of devaluation recedes. Interest rates on fallen to 8 per cent a year, compared with 17.5 per cent at the beginning of this year. Mr Alan Clutterbuck, planning and financial manager at Alpargatas, a Buenos Aires textile company, says: 'Our financial costs were 25 per cent a year in 1991. Now they are 10-11 per cent a year. You can add this as profit to your bottom line.' Companies have also been able to raise money on the local and international capital markets with increasing ease and banks have been able to raise capital at ever-declining rates, allowing them to lower interest rates further. The government intends to continue reducing reserve requirements which now stand at an average of 40 per cent, and this will allow banks to reduce the spread between interest paid to depositors and that charged to borrowers. Despite the declining cost of credit, it is still hard to find many investment projects that are financially rewarding. This is especially so for smaller companies and those based outside greater Buenos Aires, which are saddled with higher interest charges. That is where further deregulation and development of the capital markets come in. The financial system is in flux as it adjusts operating costs to lower revenues: the retail sector is shrinking to a core of seven to 10 banks. Those unable to compete in retail banking are struggling in the cut-throat investment banking market. A few universal banks will operate in all sectors of the market. Banco Rio, already the country's largest bank, says it intends to operate as a major retail bank, an investment bank, strengthen international operations and set up a pension fund. Eventually, many of the country's 160 banking institutions will have to merge or disappear. Many were opened during the 1980s, when specul- ation, lax regulation and fraud were rampant. Bank failures cost the central bank Dollars 15.8bn during the 1980s through liquidity loans to collapsing banks and deposit guarantee schemes. Bankers now say the risk of financial 'melt-down' has receded and expect the system to adjust without much trauma. The central bank has abolished its unlimited deposit guarantee, although regulation is still weak. The capital market, too, has undergone sudden change. The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange suddenly came alive last year, after decades of torpor. In 1991 the exchange's Merval index rose by 370 per cent as Mr Cavallo's policies took effect. Today, daily trading volume often exceeds Dollars 80m, compared with an average Dollars 3.3m in 1990. The boom has been due entirely to a sudden inflow of mainly Argentine funds repatriated from offshore bank deposits that now pay low international interest rates. Mr Redrado has tried hard to make the market more fluid, by focusing on deregulation, reducing transaction costs and bringing new equity into the system. Response from companies has been disappointing, although several big corporations are thinking of going public for the first time, while others are planning rights issues. That will help slake the thirst for paper. The largest company to state its interest in selling equity is Sevel, the country's largest car manufacturer. Simultaneously, the CNV is tightening up on policing by cracking down on trading irregularities, demanding improvements in accounting standards, and encouraging privately-run credit rating services. However, critics say that while the direction of reform is positive, execution is still only patchy. Two critical changes are due this year. One is the privatisation programme, in which the government plans to sell more than 60 state companies. It will float part of the equity of many of these companies on the local and international markets. The flotation of the government's remaining 30 per cent in the two telephone companies has already raised Dollars 2.06bn. A raft of privatisation issues will hit the market not only in 1992, but over the coming years. The second reform will be the introduction later this year of a private pension fund system, which is expected to channel Dollars 2bn a year into the capital market from a 10 per cent levy on wages. The government is establishing investment guidelines that are expected to favour the equity market.</p>

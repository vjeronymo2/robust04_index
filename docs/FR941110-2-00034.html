			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSK further notes that in the 1974/80 segment of this proceeding, the Department used 1980/85 cost data, if available, as BIA when cost data for the 1974/80 period were missing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken argues that while it may be reasonable for the Department to search the annual period immediately prior to the period in which the sale took place, any search beyond one period would be affected by fluctuations in steel prices and changes in labor efficiency over the course of the six-year review period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken further notes that NSK's citation of the 1974/80 results is misleading. In that case, the Department relied on NSK's 1980/85 cost data as BIA because NSK had not retained cost information for the 1976/80 PORs. Timken contends that for the 1980/86 PORs, NSK simply failed to provide complete review-specific VCOM data despite the Department's request for the information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken counters that the Department specifically requested VCOM information in both markets for the entire POR, and NSK failed to provide it. Under these circumstances Timken concludes that application of a BIA rate for sales with missing data is reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's Position: In our preliminary results of review we applied BIA to sales of U.S. models lacking VCOM data which were matched with similar home-market models. For these final results of review, we applied BIA to sales of all U.S. models when we did not find an identical match in the home market. Since we are not attempting to find matches for U.S. models with no identicals in the home market, VCOM data is not relevant to these results. Therefore, the issue of missing VCOM data is moot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 37:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Koyo contends that the Department should not apply BIA to Koyo's U.S. sample sales because the Department did not specifically request this information until September 17, 1993, 13 years after the end of the first period and 7 years after the end of the final period covered by these reviews. Koyo asserts that it was not the Department's practice to require the submission of information regarding such sales during the periods under review (1979/86). Koyo argues that it may have been able to provide information regarding its U.S. sample sales had the Department completed these reviews in a timely manner. In Koyo's view, the application of BIA to these sales, in effect, would punish Koyo for the Department's own delay. In the interest of fairness, Koyo states that the Department should not apply any BIA to these sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken agrees with the Department's proposal to use BIA for U.S. sample sales, based on the value of sample sales in the home market, as obtained at verification. Timken also states that the Department should guard against increasing the value of U.S. sales (the denominator of the weighted-average margin) and increasing the value of the duties due (the numerator of the weighted-average margin) by a BIA factor which would result in the same amount of duties collected absent the application of BIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its response to our supplemental questionnaire, Koyo failed to comply with our request for a list of U.S. sample sales, stating that ``to produce such a sales listing, AKC would have to review manually all of its sales invoices and records for the covered periods'' (November 1, 1993 submission, p. 6). In that letter Koyo stated that time restraints were the only obstacles to producing a list of U.S. sample sales. However, in its case brief Koyo stated that ``it is unable, at such a removed point in time, to identify its U.S. sample sales, because (it) did not maintain a database of its U.S. sales that identified its sample sales.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act requires that BIA be applied when a party does not produce requested information whether the non-compliance is due to refusal or mere inability to produce the desired data (Olympic Adhesives, Inc., v. United States, 899 F.2d 1565, 1574 (1990)). Koyo failed to reply to our request for a list of U.S. sample sales, saying the effort would be too great. In our preliminary analysis memorandum for these reviews we identified the methodology we intended to use as BIA for the missing U.S. sample sales in our final results of review. Therefore, we are applying BIA to these sales. We only have information on Koyo's home market sample sales. Therefore, we used the data for home market sample sales from the 1985/86 period. We used the relationship of home market sample sales to total home market sales to represent the relationship of U.S. sample sales to total U.S. sales. With this information, we determined a value for those U.S. sample sales and applied a BIA margin to that value. We added both the resulting duties due amount and the calculated value of the sample U.S. sales to our respective margin and value totals in deriving our weighted-average margin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / GPA to ask shareholders to support Dollars 300m share issue GPA Group, the world's largest aircraft leasing group, will today ask some of its biggest shareholders to support a new issue of shares aimed at raising about Dollars 300m (Pounds 150m). For the first time since the group's international flotation was pulled in June, GPA has asked its big shareholders to its headquarters in Shannon, the Irish Republic, for a two-day meeting. GPA will tell shareholders that an injection of fresh equity is part of a recovery programme which includes two more asset-backed securitised issues and the renegotiation of its aircraft acquisition programme. The group has placed Dollars 12bn of aircraft orders for the rest of the decade. Institutional shareholders said they may be willing to participate in a new issue of shares providing the price was right and all of GPA's shareholders took part. In contrast to its earlier attempt to raise finance, which was preceded by a disagreement between GPA and its advisers over the pricing of new shares, the group yesterday said it had an open mind about the pricing of new shares. One institutional shareholder said: 'GPA appears to have learnt some lessons from the aborted flotation. Whereas in the past GPA fixed the price on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, it is now asking us at what price the new shares should be offered.' Since GPA's aborted flotation, when it tried to raise Dollars 800m by offering shares at a price of Dollars 20, most of its shareholders believe the value of their shares have fallen by at least Dollars 5 to Dollars 15. The shares are also being quoted on the Dublin grey market at between Dollars 6 to Dollars 8, although no transactions have taken place. Shareholders will also be given an update on the recent management changes. These resulted in Mr Maurice Foley being replaced as chief executive by Mr Tony Ryan, who founded the company 17 years ago, as executive chairman and chief executive. Some shareholders have expressed concern about the move. Mr Foley, who was well regarded by many institutional investors, was responsible for the day-to-day running of the group. GPA said Mr Ryan had taken charge because of his expertise in leasing and selling aircraft and in dealing with aircraft makers.</p>

A GAZA  WOMAN IS REPORTED KILLED AS A COLLABORATOR.  </P> <P> Israeli soldiers backed by helicopters raided a West Bank village and tracked  down Palestinian fugitives in nearby caves, arresting more than 100 suspected  uprising activists, the army and state radio said Saturday.  </P> <P> In the Gaza Strip, a 22-year-old Palestinian woman was killed Saturday morning  by fellow Palestinians who accused her of helping Israeli authorities, Arab  reports said.  </P> <P> The woman, Ishanhaz Timraz, was murdered on the main street in the Gaza town of  Rafah when she went to a U.N. relief office to get food supplies, Palestinian  journalists and hospital officials said.  </P> <P> The military command confirmed the death and said it was under investigation.  </P> <P> More than 130 Arabs have been similarly slain in the 26-month uprising against  Israeli rule in Gaza and the West Bank.  </P> <P> Also in Gaza, Israeli troops shot and wounded at least six Palestinians in a  number of stone-throwing clashes, Arab hospital officials said. The army said  it knew of three Palestinians who suffered light injuries.  </P> <P> The military command said soldiers raided the village of Yamun in the northern  part of the occupied West Bank over the weekend. It did not say precisely when  the raid took place.  </P> <P> The soldiers, backed by air force helicopters, arrested about 90 Palestinians  suspected of guerrilla activities and participation in violent protests, the  army said. It said weapons such as axes, knives and sticks were found in the  village.  </P> <P> Israel radio said some Palestinians were captured in caves near the village,  where they had fled.  </P> <P> It quoted an unidentified army commander of the area as saying no shots were  fired during the operation.  </P> <P> In another development, Israeli authorities expelled from the country a  Yugoslav woman suspected of spying for the PLO, the radio reported. Patricia  Kansevitz, 26, was sent to Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on Friday.  </P> <P> Kansevitz was arrested by Israeli security officials Jan. 7 along with another  Yugoslav woman, Victoria David, 34.

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Technology: In search of the hot spots - Worth Watching Detecting sources of heat is an important aspect of fire fighting and prevention. Product Innovation has designed a hand-held device which emits visual and audible signals to detect heat sources as a relatively low-cost addition to the available equipment. The Hotspotter sensor detects infra-red waves, which are converted into sounds and lights by a microprocessor. The intensity of the heat is indicated by the frequency of the sound and the colour of the light. The uses of the Hotspotter include locating the source of a fire through dense smoke and spotting a potential fire risk. The device costs Pounds 120. Product Innovation Holdings: 0920 444277.</p>

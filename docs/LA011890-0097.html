			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO OKS CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW  </P> <P> The El Segundo City Council has passed the city's first municipal campaign  finance ordinance.  </P> <P> The ordinance, approved 3 to 2 Tuesday, limits the amount of individual  contributions in an election and confines donations to a three-month election  period. It does not limit the amount a candidate may contribute to his or her  own election, nor the amount a candidate's election committee may spend.  </P> <P> Councilman Scot D. Dannen, who proposed the ordinance, said it is intended to  combat "war chests" and that it "puts out in the open" sources of financial  support. He said many other cities already have such controls. The ordinance is  modeled after one in Gardena.  </P> <P> The measure, which takes effect in 30 days, places a $250 ceiling on the amount  individuals or groups may contribute to a candidate, bars contributions under  assumed names and limits the total amount of anonymous contributions to $1,000.  It also confines donations to a three-month election period, starting when  nomination papers can be filed and ending when polls close on Election Day.  </P> <P> Councilman H. R. (Bob) Anderson voted against the measure, contending that it  was "pushed through" the council without sufficient public participation.  </P> <P> Councilman Alan West also voted against it after objecting to the exclusion of  volunteer campaign workers from ordinance controls. The measure requires  organizations or individuals who are not controlled by a candidate to disclose  expenditures made on behalf of or against any candidate. City Atty. Leland C.  Dolley advised the council that work done by people without charge may not be  limited.  </P> <P> J. B. Wise, who said he will run for council in April, objected to the  ordinance's adoption without the involvement of a citizens committee. He also  objected to a provision that updated campaign disclosure documents must be  filed with the city by noon on the Friday before an election. He argued that  the information could be used for last-minute flyers attacking candidates who  would not have time to respond before the election. He suggested a noon  deadline on Election Day.

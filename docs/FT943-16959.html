			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / CrossRail plan doomed despite MPs' support: Commons committee remains opposed to route The private bill authorising the Pounds 2bn CrossRail plan for an east-west London railway link is dead, despite an attempt by hundreds of MPs of all parties to revive it. More than 250 MPs have signed a Commons motion tabled by Mr David Lidington, Conservative MP for Aylesbury, calling for a private bill authorising CrossRail to be sent back to a quasi-judicial committee which rejected it last month. The move is backed by Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, as well as the bill's joint sponsors - British Rail, London Underground and Railtrack, the rail infrastructure company. But two of the four MPs on the committee say they will continue to oppose the scheme, which would authorise a six-mile tunnel linking Paddington and Liverpool Street main line stations. A third is also thought likely to oppose. The MPs' stand means that under parliament's procedures for private legislation the bill has no hope of success, even if the Commons votes for Mr Lidington's motion. It is understood that two of the three committee members who voted against the project would change their minds if it was amended to link up with the proposed Heathrow Express and the planned high-speed line from London to the Channel tunnel. However, that would require a government commitment to provide up to Pounds 100m in extra public finance, which would be unlikely to be approved by the Treasury. The project only reached the committee stage because Mr John Major, the prime minister, over-ruled attempts by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury, to block it on cost. Mr John Marek, one of two Labour MPs on the committee, wrote to all Labour MPs yesterday insisting that the economic case for the project 'simply did not stack up'. In a 13-point critique of the scheme, Mr Marek said that the funds required to build CrossRail would produce up to 20 times more benefit if spent on the existing Underground system. He said the project would duplicate the Central Line, and could cost BR up to Pounds 100m a year in lost revenue. The government has ruled out the alternative options of taking over the project under the 'hybrid' bill procedure - which involves both public and private interests - or using the 1992 Transport and Works Act. The DoT is already committed to one hybrid bill for the high-speed rail link, and is unlikely to be awarded parliamentary time for a second. Under the Transport and Works Act, Mr MacGregor could simply lay an order before parliament. But public inquiries could delay the project for at least 10 years.</p>

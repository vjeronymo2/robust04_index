			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: AHP puts pressure on Cyanamid American Home Products stepped up the pressure on takeover target American Cyanamid last night, telling the US healthcare and agricultural products group it was willing to lift its bid from Dollars 95 a share to Dollars 100 if the group's board agreed to the offer by tonight. The new offer values Cyanamid at more than Dollars 9bn. AHP, however, warned that it would pursue its original bid if an agreed deal could not be negotiated. There was no immediate response from Cyanamid, which last week urged its shareholders not to accept the unsolicited bid until its board had fully reviewed the bid. If the new offer is rejected, the stage will be set for a proxy battle for control of Cyana-mid. Yesterday's developments came a day after Mr Jack Stafford, chairman of AHP (whose interests range from prescription drugs to confectionery), met his counterpart at Cyanamid, Mr Albert Costello. At that meeting, Mr Stafford failed to persuade Mr Costello to accept AHP's offer, and in a letter to the Cyanamid chief yesterday he expressed his disappointment at their lack of agreement. Mr Stafford wrote: 'While we have always believed that our Dollars 95 per share offer represented a full and fair price, as I stated last night, we were willing to propose an increase of that price to Dollars 100 on the basis of our belief that such an increase would permit us to reach agreement and proceed rapidly to conclude a transaction supported by both companies.' Although Cyanamid's management is thought to oppose a takeover by AHP, analysts believe it will be difficult for the board to reject an offer which values the group's shares at a more than 50 per cent premium over their pre-bid price. If Home Products wins control of Cyanamid, it will be the largest takeover yet in the spate of deals currently reshaping the US drugs industry.</p>

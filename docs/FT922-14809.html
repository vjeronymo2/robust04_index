			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals stump Usher-Walker Exceptional costs hit Usher-Walker, the printing inks group, in 1991 and its pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 60,000. There was a charge of Pounds 332,000 for stock write-offs and reorganisation aimed at lowering the cost base. Operating profit moved up to Pounds 643,000 (Pounds 632,000) on turnover of Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 17m) as a result of continuing cost reductions and improvements in ink formulations. Those factors offset poorer figures from the roller division. After tax there were losses per share of 0.4p (earnings 7.1p). The directors said the group was well placed to take advantage of economic recovery, and are lifting the dividend from 5.5p to 6p with a final of 4p.</p>

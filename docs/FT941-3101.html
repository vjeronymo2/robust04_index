			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: JN Nichols recovers in second half to Pounds 8.65m Pre-tax profits for JN Nichols (Vimto), the soft drinks company, improved slightly from Pounds 8.54m to Pounds 8.65m in the year to December 31. The result marked a recovery in the second half following a fall from Pounds 3.53m to Pounds 3.4m at the interim stage. There were improvements for the core Vimto fruit and herb drink, particularly overseas, and the foods offshoot, which made up for falls in the canning operations. Mr John Nichols, managing director, said that the first half of the year, which had been affected by a poor May and June, was always more dependent on the weather than the second. He added that it was too soon to say how the present year would turn out but he thought the market for Vimto was growing on the back of the expanding cola market. 'And there will always be a niche for Vimto.' Turnover for the year improved by Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 49.5m for increased operating profit of Pounds 7.93m (Pounds 7.48m). Earnings per share came out at 14.98p (14.16p) and a proposed increased final dividend of 3.6p makes a total for the year of 5.76p (5.44p). The Manchester-based company is concentrating on expanding its overseas markets and food activities. The launch on the Russian market was going well with the export of canned Vimto expected to be replaced in the near future by local production based on concentrate from the UK. The foods side now provided Pounds 15m of group turnover and was about to move into a purpose-built factory. Mr Nichols said the contract canning activities were dependent on the weather but as the operation switched from contract work to Vimto that was becoming a less of a factor.</p>

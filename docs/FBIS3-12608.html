The sessions addressed bilateral ties and ways  to develop them further.    Mr. 'Asfur and Mr. Mahmud reviewed bilateral cooperation in  the areas of energy and mineral resources and the progress made  in linking Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, and Egypt in an  electricity grid. They discussed the electricity grid link  between Jordan and Egypt as part of the five-state chain. They  also talked about the use of renewable energy and tapping solar  energy for heating and power generating purposes. Also  discussed was cooperation in harnessing wind to generate  electricity. Jordan already has two such stations in  al-Ibrahimiyah and Jurf al-Darawish and, in cooperation with  Germany, is working on a third with a 1.2 megawatt capacity.    Radi Ibrahim and the Egyptian minister met to discuss trade  and the supply situation between the two countries. The  Jordanian minister briefed the Egyptian minister and his  delegation on his ministry's activities. Ibrahim told the  Egyptian minister he would like to see bilateral trade  increased, observing that, in the past, the exchanges lacked  stability. Noting that the Higher Joint Jordanian-Egyptian  Committee is due to convene after 'Id al-Fitr, the minister  pointed to the need to draw up guidelines to boost bilateral  trade.    The Egyptian minister stressed the need to boost economic  ties with Jordan and called for pan-Arab economic integration.  He lauded the Ministry of Supply's key function of making basic  food items available and stabilizing prices.</p>

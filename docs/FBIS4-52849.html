			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Monday [16 May] spurned afresh an opposition call for an  early general election under the current multiseat constituency  system, arguing it would undermine political reform.    Hata told a plenary session of the House of Councillors that  the next election should be held under the new system, a mixture  of 300 single-seat districts and 200 others chosen through  proportional representation.    Holding a general election under the current system would  "make the efforts so far toward political reform retrogress," he  said.    A government panel is drawing up the electoral map in line  with a political reform package passed in January, which  mandates the replacement of the multiseat constituency system  with the new one.    Hata rejected a call by Shoichi Ichikawa of the Japanese  Communist Party (JCP) for dissolving the House of  Representatives and holding a snap election under the current  system, which Ichikawa said is fairer than the proposed new  system.    Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), the second largest opposition party, last week called for  early elections to restore stable government.    Hata faced a series of attacks by opposition lawmakers in  the  threee-day Diet plenary sessions that ended Monday over the  fragile political standing of his minority government.    The premier repeatedly expressed readiness for dialogue with  the opposition parties and sought their cooperation to cope with  a heap of pending issues.    Hata pledged policy continuity from the administration of  his  predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned in April over  dubious management of his personal finances, and appealed for  the opposition's cooperation to tackle some "historical tasks"  carried over from the previous cabinet, such as tax and  political reform.    Hata tried to reassure the nation that he will stick to the  government's traditional view of the constitution, which  restricts Japan's military to a "minimum necessary" self-defense.    Hata, however, skirted the vital issue of possible  involvement by Japan in international sanctions against North  Korea over its suspected nuclear arms program.    He said he would not comment on any problems concerning the  issue since such sanctions are not being discussed at the UN  Security Council.    But he said that in general terms, Japan's cooperation with  the United Nations or the United States over an international  crisis should be "within the framework of the constitution."    Hata also made a renewed vow to seek Japan's permanent  membership in the Security Council.    Japan should obtain a permanent seat in the key UN council  to  break the monopoly by the victors of World War II, he said.    Hata said there is a growing call in the UN for Japan to  play  a larger role in the council in which he says many important  global issues are decided.</p>

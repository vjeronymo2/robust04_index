			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. WORKERS, NOT CORPORATE RAIDERS, ARE INDISPENSABLE TO NATION'S ECONOMY  </P> <P> We noted with sadness the satirical manner in which you treated the benevolence  of (Drexel Burnham Lambert financier) Michael Milken in the Dec. 11 column by  John Crudele, "Miracle Oat Bran? 1988 Was Weird."  </P> <P> The foundations of the Milken family and Michael Milken personally help to  ensure futures of hope and promise for the seriously emotionally disturbed,  mentally retarded, autistic and abused children served by our programs.  </P> <P> We are especially impressed that Milken not only gives generously of his  dollars but that he gives generously of himself. Through his frequent visits to  our programs, we experience firsthand an individual filled with compassion,  commitment and caring. The children call him "Mike," their soft-spoken,  unpretentious and very caring friend.  </P> <P> Winston Churchill said that we make a life by what we give. Milken's life is  one that is filled with giving in many ways. His largess profoundly influences  the creation of brighter todays and tomorrows for countless children in order  that they may achieve their fullest potential. His support of numerous programs  of education, prevention, health care, medical research and community services  in this country is important and praiseworthy.  </P> <P> RICHARD M. ZELLE,  </P> <P> BARBARA FIRESTONE  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P> <P> Zelle is chairman and Firestone is president of the HELP Group, a group of  nonprofit agencies serving children and families.  </P></p>

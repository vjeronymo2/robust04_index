			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIALEAH LOSES APPEAL ATTEMPT  </P> <P> A state appeals court Thursday refused to reinstate Hialeah Park's pari-mutuel  license, which was suspended after the track changed its racing schedule  without permission.  </P> <P> The 1st District Court of Appeal declined to lift the suspension ordered by the  Department of Business Regulation. That means the track will be closed until at  least Jan. 3, when a full state hearing is scheduled.  </P> <P> Last week, the financially troubled South Florida thoroughbred track announced  it would operate three days a week rather than the six days a week required  under its license.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISLAND REMEMBRANCES  </P> <P> My wife and I were pleased to see the beautiful island of Jersey as your  front-page feature (Jan. 15) until we read the article. We thought travel  articles were supposed to describe the beauties and amenities of various spots,  with a view to encouraging people to visit them. Jersey has many beauties and  amenities, which we have enjoyed more than once, but there's nothing about its  beauty and amenities in Jerry Payne's article. Perhaps Payne has done us a  favor. Since no one who read the article would have any reason to consider  visiting Jersey, it should remain unspoiled for those of us who have already  enjoyed its many attractions. Thank you, Mr. Payne!  </P> <P> WILLIAM L. HODSON  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

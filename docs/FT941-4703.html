			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Labour attacks Major over inflation 'rift' Labour yesterday seized on remarks about inflation by the prime minister and the deputy governor of the Bank of England to claim that the two were 'completely at odds'. Mr John Major said yesterday that inflation was 'under lock and key'. Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea said it was 'a delusion' to think that Britain had defeated inflation. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said: 'The prime minister should clarify his precise inflation target and whether he intends to meet it.' Mr Pennant-Rea told the Institute of Credit Management national conference: 'It is tempting to feel that Britain has won the war against inflation, so we can now afford to relax. That is a delusion, and a dangerous one too.' Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage payments, was 2.8 per cent in January, still in the top half of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range. The Bank said in its inflation report, published in February, that the underlying rate would remain in the top half of the range throughout 1995, and there was an 'asymmetric risk' it would move higher. Mr Pennant-Rea said: 'We have to keep inflation down in order to sustain growth. Monetary restraint is not a hair-shirt but it has to be a habit. After all the unforced errors of the past it will take many years to prove we have acquired it.' Mr Major, speaking to businessmen in Portsmouth, was rather more upbeat about inflation than Mr Pennant-Rea, but his comments about the UK's economic prospects were in tune with those of the deputy governor. The prime minister said: 'What I believe we are beginning to get is a satisfactory platform for sustained recovery with low inflation.' Mr Pennant-Rea said: 'The economy will soon enter its third year of recovery, and the pace of that recovery is enough to have started reducing unemployment. Meanwhile, inflation is low and the government's target is for it to go lower still.' Mr Pennant-Rea's speech marked a departure in tone from the customary solemn phraseology of top Bank officials. In a candid passage about past mistakes in monetary policy, he said: 'At the Bank of England we are merely part of the supply lines. As such, we have the ability to mess things up - and our record shows we have often used it.'</p>

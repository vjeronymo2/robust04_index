Failure to implement  this agreement would inevitably intensify domestic opposition  both in Israel and in Palestinian society, while complicating  the situation of those taking part in the negotiations on both  sides.    And the year 1996 is approaching--the year of parliamentary  elections in Israel, and the presidential election in the United  States. In consideration of this factor, it would be well for  the Palestinians and the Israelis to "stick to the schedule" for  working out their agreement. In this respect, parallel progress  in talks between Israel and Syria is seen as the optimal variant  as well. Although, evidently, Palestinian-Israeli negotiations  could indeed proceed to the implementation phase, while  bypassing the others.    But in this instance it would inevitably experience the  retarding influence of other trends. With such a "truncated"  model of development of the peace process, the potential for  regional cooperation laid down in multilateral negotiations  would not be able to begin functioning seriously. And in the  future there would inevitably be complications in the  Palestinian-Israeli talks themselves, on the permanent status of  their relations, which is to commence in the third year of the  period of self-government.    One must say that the peace process in the Near East has  already become an important factor in regional stability, and  the rounds of negotiations (bilateral and multilateral) and  measures taken between sessions--along with their direct  purpose--are a kind of contact mechanism for the regional  parties and for extra-regional participants in the peace  process, which operate practically on a permanent basis.    At the same time this mechanism in and of itself cannot  substitute for that system of regional security and stability  which would result from settlement of the conflict between its  participants themselves.  <H5>  RUSSIA AND THE NEAR EAST </H5>   In the second half of the 1980's, the diplomatic lexicon of  Russia continually addressed the thesis that for us, the Near  East is not only near, but is contiguous, and that everything  that occurs there concerns us directly. It would seem that, as  distinguished from the USSR, Russia is situated much farther  from the Near East. However, this is not entirely true even  geographically. The fact of the matter is, that changes are  taking place in the very concept of the "Near East," and today  the boundaries of the Near East are much broader than before;  and, they are just as close to Russia as they were to the USSR  in its time.    It would appear that the public has not yet formed a  coherent  attitude with respect to the fact that there is a Near East for  Russia, and what kind of policy she should have toward it. A  wide variety of opinions are expressed, some of which are polar  opposites. On one extreme flank, there is the perception that  the Near East is located beyond the "natural habitat" of  interests of Russian national security; thus, Russia should not  be drawn too closely into near-eastern affairs.    The idea presented in late 1992 by G. Mirskiy at an  international scientific conference at Tel-Aviv University can  serve as an example of the opposite pole of opinion: "The Near  East at present is the only place in the world where Russia  still can play a peace role. Other regions are practically  inaccessible."[.sup]6[/] One may also encounter an  "in-between" approach, which one could arbitrarily call,  "drifting with the events."    Naturally, each of the aforementioned ideas has the right to  exist, and each can and is being substantiated. I would merely  like to note that in recent years the interest of the outside  world to the Near East, and to taking part in its affairs, is  growing sharply. The appearance of prospects for peace in the  region has markedly stimulated this interest, and the diplomatic  and business activities of many countries with respect to the  Near East.    The fact of the matter is that one of the main peculiarities  of the Near East, with determines one's attitude to it from  abroad, is the fact that it represents a voluminous and growing  market. For us it is most common to associate this market with  the arms market. In 1991 and 92, the states of the Persian Gulf  alone expended 40 billion dollars for arms  purchases.[.sup]7[/] Military expenditures of near-eastern  countries is estimated at 45 billion dollars per year, and  taking into consideration the modernization of weapons being  undertaken by the key states in the region, military outlays  will remain at a high level for the foreseeable future as well.    It is precisely the vast market for weapons in the Near East  that they cite "in defense" of the thesis of Russia's developing  relations with this region. Although they are correct in saying  that these markets are on the whole "saturated," and that Russia  sold less than 3 billion dollars worth of weapons in 1992 and  even less in 1993, by 2.1 billion dollars,[.sup]8[/] Russia  in recent years has "crossed over" from the first-place position  she held in the second half of the 1980's, to one that is barely  on the margins. In addition, for weapons importers the nature of  the political ties with the exporting states, stability,  reliability and predictability of these ties, are very important.    Indeed, Russia has something to offer the Near East. This,  of  course, is not the fruits and vegetables, of which this region  annually imports more than 30 billion dollar's worth. Primarily  this interest represents the technical achievements of Russia.  For instance, an enterprise for production of magnesium, using  Russian technology, recently opened in Israel. Interest in  cooperation with Russia is being displayed in many other areas  as well. And for Russia, establishing peace in the region opens  the prospects for significant increase in the potential of its  business cooperation as well.    Previously the market expanse of the Near East was divided  by  a key border obstacle--non-recognition of Israel by the Arabs.  The peace treaty of Israel and Egypt signed in 1979 opened a  breach in these obstacles. The realization of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement is expanding this breach. Peaceful  settlement between Israel and its other Arab neighbors would  lead to a state in which the near-eastern market expanse would  open up all around. World business is positioning itself for  precisely such a prospect.    As arguments "against" Russia's developing an active  partnership with the Near East they cite the indebtedness to her  of a number of near-eastern states. Our principal debtors are  Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Libya. At the same time the share of the  near-eastern states with overdue debts to the former USSR  (according to data of mid-1992) amounted to a little over 6  billion dollars, or nearly 23 percent of the total sum (28.5  billion dollars).    World economic practice has developed methods for settlement  of foreign debts in such a manner that it is advantageous to the  creditor and not overly burdening to the debtor; and there are  firms who make this their profession. And, finally, at times  they assert that in the current complex situation, especially  the economic one, it is hard, they say, for Russia to keep in  step in the Near East with those who are capable of stimulating  their involvement in near-eastern affairs even by financial  donorship, and gratuitous aid. However, one hears from certain  competent persons in the Near East, that Russia does not have to  be a donor in order to take part in the affairs of the region.    The advice to "wait it out" until everything in Russia  "straightens itself out" also seems fallacious, since it is well  known that any pause in a certain foreign sector inevitably  weakens the ties, and in some instances even leads to their loss.    In the context of the present article one must also not  avoid  the question of whether the Near East is important to Russia  from the point of view of the interests of her national  security. If one understands their limitation only as the danger  of direct armed aggression against Russia, then the answer is  probably no--for the present no one is planning on attacking  Russia from the Near East. However, there are also in the Near  East possible variants of a developing situation in which damage  may be done to broader Russian interests.    Some of these variants are connected with the non-settlement  of the Arab-Israeli conflict; others with the continuing  atmosphere of conflict in the Persian Gulf; still others with  the conflict situations along the southern borders of Russia and  the CIS, and the attitude toward them of the states of the Near  East. This list could be continued.    One way or another, clearly, it is not in the interests of  Russia to remain aloof from near-eastern affairs, nor from  regular political and diplomatic participation in them, nor from  intercourse both with the states of this region, and with those  who are involved in these affairs.    Speaking at the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly,  Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs A.V. Kozyrev, making a  positive analysis of the completed political and psychological  break-through for resolution of the key problem of a  near-eastern settlement--the Palestinian problem--stated that  Russia, as co-sponsor of the Conference on the Near East, will  spare no efforts to move the peace process along in all sectors.    Actually, in the present situation the mechanism for the  peace process was found to lie principally in the sphere of  diplomacy, in which both regional and non-regional participants  were interacting, and realizing their own national interests  connected with the Near East and with relations with  near-eastern states. The line for such interaction with the USA  was confirmed by the Russo-American statement on the Near East,  adopted 14 January of this year in the course of the Moscow  summit as well.    It is evident that such active participation in the peace  process is in favor of the national interests of Russia as well,  and in the interests of her security--the settlement of the  near-east conflict within the framework of this process,  stabilization in the context of normalization of the situation  in this region, and the establishment of a system of security in  it.

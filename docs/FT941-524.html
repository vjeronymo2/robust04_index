			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Albanian appeal for investment Mr Sali Berisha, the Albanian president, yesterday called for greater foreign investment in Albania's infrastructure to sustain economic growth which reached 11 per cent last year. Addressing a Confederation of British Industry conference in London, he said Albania expected investment in 1994 of nearly double the Dollars 290m recorded last year as foreign companies supplied the technology to develop Albania's oil, chrome, copper and nickel reserves and modernise its agriculture and tourist infrastructure.</p>

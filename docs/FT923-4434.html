			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Last act in Rome THREE WEEKS ago, Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, declared that his country's 1993 budget would be 'neither Shakespeare nor Verdi'. In fact, the plot centred on Italy's chronic fiscal deficit seems now to be rapidly heading towards a final act rich in drama and desperation. The Bank of Italy on Friday failed to resuscitate the lira despite a 1.75 percentage point increase in interest rates. The weekend declarations at the Bath finance ministers' meeting may calm nerves on the foreign exchanges for the time being. But Italy will be fortunate if it limps through the fortnight before the French Maastricht referendum without a further intensification of the country's financial crisis. Mr Giuliano Amato's government had hoped that last month's L30,000bn emergency package trimming this year's deficit would buy breathing space in which to tackle the still more exacting challenge of the 1993 budget. In its plans for next year, to be presented to parliament by the end of this month, the government is looking for total spending cuts and extra revenue amounting to roughly three times the 1992 deficit reduction. The government aims to realise most of the savings through structural reforms in the civil service and regional administration, as well as in the increasingly expensive health and pensions systems. All these changes will be painful and unpopular. But only by approving them can Italy's parliamentary deputies win the credibility the country needs to weather the current monetary turmoil. Other options do not exist. A lira devaluation would be folly unless it were accompanied by action showing Italian voters and foreign investors that the country really has switched fiscal course. The renewed monetary squeeze, on its own, will prove self-defeating, since higher interest rates dampen economic activity and tax revenues and add drastically to debt service costs. Mr Amato must use the sense of impending financial calamity to press his budget plans through parliament with the utmost urgency. The desire to remain aboard the journey to European integration gives Italy an additional incentive. More than that, Europe's drive for economic convergence is the only thing that gives Italy's reform efforts a semblance of credibility; the weakness of the lira is being exacerbated by uncertainty as to whether the Maastricht treaty will survive. The message from the financial markets is that this really is Italy's last chance. If they judge that Italy has become irrevocably cut adrift from the process of European convergence, then its fate, both political and economic, will be dire indeed.</p>

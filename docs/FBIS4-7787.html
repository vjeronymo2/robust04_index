			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 6 (TANJUG) -- Officials of the  Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) have termed "sheer media ploy and  distortion" the manner in which THE WASHINGTON POST has  interpreted their statements.    RSK Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic and Parliamentary  Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Lazar Macura have said that  their statements made to WASHINGTON POST's journalist John  Pomfrit were "rephrased to suit the Croatian or possibly  American view of things," and that "vital parts were omitted,  ones which reflect the realistic positions of Serb politicians,"  the RSK news agency ISKRA said on Tuesday.    The U.S. daily said in an article in connection with the  effectuation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities  between the RSK and Croatia on April 4 that the RSK was showing  growing readiness, in exchange for broad autonomy, to agree to  live together with Croats and be under Zagreb's sovereignty.    However, the RSK maintains that the ceasefire agreement in  no  way prejudices a political solution to the problem.    ISKRA quoted Jarcevic as saying that he had stated to THE  WASHINGTON POST journalist that he would resign his post in the  RSK government if the incredible was to happen and the Serb  state was to agree to negotiate on autonomy, a federation or  confederation with Croatia. THE WASHINGTON POST, however,  interpreted Jarcevic as allegedly saying that he would be the  first to return to Belgrade if the RSK was to lose its  independence.    Macura, who stated that Krajina could be part of Croatia  only  if the big powers were to make Croatia be part of a new  Yugoslavia and if Krajina was to have political autonomy in the  new state, was interpreted in THE WASHINGTON POST as allegedly  saying that the Krajina Serbs could live as citizens of Croatia  if Croatia was to guarantee them equal rights.    The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in response to Croatia's  forcible secession from the then Yugoslav Federation and the  attempts of Croatian authorities to deny the Serbs the status of  a constituent people and reduce them to a national minority.    In mid-March this year, after three years of war and  Croatia's four attempts to impose its authority in the RSK by  means of force, the two sides signed an agreement on the  cessation of hostilities.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Nadir blames Foreign Office MR ASIL NADIR said yesterday that the Foreign Office was responsible for the collapse of the last-minute Turkish rescue effort that ultimately forced Polly Peck International into administration in October 1990. The former PPI chairman, who jumped bail to flee to northern Cyprus last week, said a credit package from Turkish state banks was ready to be signed when a telex message arrived from the Foreign Office. Mr Nadir said the telex contained a 'stiffer and more crude message than Hitler's message to Chamberlain. It was none of their business to behave in that manner'. Speaking for the first time about the attempt by president Turgut Ozal to salvage the group, Mr Nadir said 'there were lots of unanswered questions' about the role of the Foreign Office. 'I don't think you should underestimate the political aspect of all this,' he said. 'When the Turkish government tried to help a British public company, there should only be gratitude from Britain not a threatening telex from the Foreign Office,' Mr Nadir said. One other attempt to help Mr Nadir was mounted, he said. In October 1990, just before the administration order took effect, three Turkish banks had pledged Pounds 57.5m. Mr Nadir did not name the banks but he said that the reply of the creditors was: 'We'll have the money and then we'll think it over.' The creditors refused to provide 'a sensible standstill period' to waive the re-payments on the PPI debts, and the initiative collapsed.</p>

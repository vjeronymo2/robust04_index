			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week - Romneya coulteri This is the Californian Tree Poppy, a semi-shrubby perennial with stiff, 5ft-6ft stems, some of which might survive the winter, but others are likely to be killed to ground level except in mild places. Stems and leaves are grey-green; the sweetly scented flowers, which are large and poppy-like, are pure white with a big central boss of golden stamens. This is a very beautiful plant, which thrives in warm, sunny places and fertile, porous soils. It is difficult to transplant and should be obtained in pots, from which it can be planted out without root disturbance.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (8): The Swiss are watchful - Tax haven role leaves postage stamps in the shade Liechtenstein's most famous business used to be the issuing of exotic postage stamps. Unfortunately, philately is on the wane these days, and the principality has moved on to other things. Now it is known best as a tax haven. The sector achieved especial notoriety three years ago when Mr Robert Maxwell's empire collapsed. Much of the former UK media tycoon's skullduggery was executed secretly through Liechtenstein trusts, including the rather grandly named Maxwell Foundation. The principality's trustee-lawyers are now in the midst of a tricky row with Switzerland which fears that Liechtenstein is competing unfairly for this business. Liechtenstein's approach to being a tax haven has been an unusual one. It did not want a huge influx of foreign banks and fund managers overwhelming the local population as has happened in Monaco or Jersey, so it maintained severe restrictions on banking activity. Until two years ago, there were only three banks in the principality; today there are five. Rather, it proposed to the world's rich that they could set up unusually flexible Liechtenstein domiciled companies, foundations and trusts. Through these entities, they could hide the ownership of their liquid assets on which taxation is, in most cases, a nominal SFr1,000 a year, regardless of the size of turnover, profit or assets. However, because of the paucity of local banks and professional fund managers, the funds in the trusts and foundations have to be held and managed mainly outside Liechtenstein. It has been a phenomenally successful strategy. Local estimates, based on a simple calculation from the tax take from these domiciled entities, put their number at something like 70,000, more than double the principality's population. Leading bankers and trustees estimate that 60 per cent of Liechtenstein's tax revenues, some SFr500m a year, come directly and indirectly from the financial sector. The Liechtenstein approach has also, notwithstanding the Maxwell case, been remarkably troublefree. No case of drug money laundering has ever been uncovered there, for example. Trustees say that this is mainly because they are in a small, tightly knit community. A black sheep would not be tolerated. And because their businesses too remain relatively small, they have the time to examine every transaction that passes through their offices. There is increasing evidence that foreign clients are comfortable with Liechtenstein entities. Mr Peter Ritter, chairman of Prasidial, one of the largest trust firms, points out that the average age of Liechtenstein trusts and foundations is about 15 years, compared with only six or seven years in the British Virgin Islands. 'With all the problems we have had, we are still doing our job,' Mr Ritter says. However, their relatively tranquil life is now being shaken up. The main immediate threat comes from the Swiss, who have launched a two pronged attack to learn the identity of their clients. Last November, the Swiss people endorsed a government plan to introduce a value added tax on all goods and services. At the time, nobody thought much about Liechtenstein, the Swiss simply assuming that the principality would fall into line and do the same. The Swiss finance ministry also assumed that it would collect the VAT in Liechtenstein, just as it collects the current sales tax on goods there. The trustees initially fought to be exempted from VAT on the grounds that their clients were foreign, but eventually retreated because the basic principle of their activity is that the trusts and foundations they set up for these clients are domestic. But they are horrified at the prospect of turning over their client invoices to Swiss VAT inspectors. The Liechtenstein government took up their cause and made clear to the Swiss finance ministry that, as a sovereign state, it had the right to set and collect its own VAT. The Swiss finance ministry balked, claiming that it feared that Liechtenstein would administer the tax in such a way as to give its financial businesses an advantage over Swiss ones. There were threats of cancelling the bilateral currency treaty, under which Liechtenstein banks have the implicit ultimate backing of the Swiss National Bank. Liechtenstein then agreed to make the rates and conditions of the tax identical to those in Switzerland. The dispute has still not been settled, but it is difficult to see how the Swiss can prevail. Meanwhile, the Swiss are pressuring Liechtenstein to adopt a due diligence agreement that is basically identical to theirs. The main difference between the two at the moment is that Switzerland requires bankers to know the beneficial owners of all their accounts while Liechtenstein permits an exception from the rule provided that a registered trustee knows the beneficial owner's identity. Liechtensteiners admit that their practice gives additional comfort to some clients, in that they know that fewer employees, auditors, inspectors or bureaucrats can find out their identity so the risk of disclosure is perhaps less than in Switzerland. But they say there is no difference in substance so the Swiss should retreat. Moreover, they say, they are about to put their due diligence agreement into law, whereas the Swiss one is only an agreement among bankers. In the longer term, the trustees fear pressure from neighbouring European countries on Liechtenstein to raise its taxes. 'Liechtenstein should be preserved as an offshore centre in Europe. It is better than recycling investment funds through the Caribbean,' says Mr Edmund Frick, president of the Liechtenstein Treuhander Vereinigung.</p>

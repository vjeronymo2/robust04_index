			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL MAY EASE LAW ON KEEPING HORSES  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson introduced a motion Friday that would  make it easier for small landowners to keep horses.  </P> <P> Existing city law runs counter to the "city's policy of encouraging and  preserving the horse-keeping lifestyle" by requiring corrals to be located at  least 35 feet away from a habitable room, Bernson said. That makes  "horse-keeping possible only on very large lots," he said.  </P> <P> "This needs to be changed immediately."  </P> <P> The original intent of the setback requirement was to maintain a 35-foot  distance between barns and stables and human habitation, according to the north  San Fernando Valley councilman.  </P> <P> His motion was referred to the council's Planning and Land Use Management  Committee, which he chairs.  </P></p>

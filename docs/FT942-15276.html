			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (4): A hectic year for the politicians - Vienna fears delays in Brussels This year is proving to be even more eventful than expected for Austrian politics. Provincial elections in March saw a surge in the protest vote and support for the extreme right and the Greens at the expense of the establishment parties. Shortly afterwards, the European Union's unseemly debate on how to block decisions within the EU threatened to undo months of careful campaigning to win public support for Austria's EU membership bid. Both events will make the government's life more difficult. A referendum on EU membership is set to take place in June - the favoured date is June 12 to coincide with Europe-wide elections to the European parliament. If all goes well, Austria could become a member on January 1 next year. But Vienna fears that delays in Brussels or in the European parliament could upset the timetable and reduce domestic support for membership. The row within the EU over blocking rights had a negative impact on local opinion. 'It looks bad. People can't understand what it's about. They are asking why should we join this mess,' says one official. This is a far cry from feelings three weeks earlier when Mr Alois Mock, the veteran foreign minister who headed Austria's negotiating team, was given a hero's welcome on his return from Brussels following agreement over membership terms. Differences with the Commission over agriculture and transit traffic which threatened to derail the talks were successfully overcome in a deal that most politicians considered good, although it was immediately, and predictably, denounced by the Greens as a sell-out. The results of the negotiations strengthened support for membership with the latest opinion polls showing more than 50 per cent in favour, and around 30 per cent against, with a diminishing number undecided. An extensive government campaign in favour of membership has had a positive impact - officials are optimistic about the referendum, provided 'the EU doesn't break down or there isn't another mismanaged crisis as in Bosnia,' says another observer. 'If nothing (contrary happens) over the next 2 1/2 months, the outcome will be positive. It could even be a much as 55 per cent in favour,' says Mr Erhard Busek, the conservative vice-chancellor. Ironically, the strength of current support for EU membership has raised fears that people will not bother to vote. The government also has other worries. Elections to provincial parliaments in Carinthia, Salzburg and Tyrol on March 13 turned out worse than expected for the social democrats (SPO) who lost ground across the three provinces. The conservative People's Party (OVP) fared relatively better, increasing its vote in Carinthia but losing voters in Salzburg and Tyrol. The new Liberal Forum failed to make a breakthrough or win any seats. The victor was Mr Jorg Haider, the youthful-looking populist leader of the right-wing Freedom Party (FPO). The Greens also did well, although they were helped by local factors. The FPO - which under Mr Haider's leadership has veered firmly to the far right with emotional campaigns against immigration - won more than 33 per cent of the vote in Carinthia and was a close second to the social democrats whose share of the vote fell 8.5 per cent to 37.4 per cent. Mr Haider wanted to win back the province's governorship which he was forced to relinquish three years ago after he made a speech apparently endorsing Nazi employment policies. But in spite of the FPO's strong showing, neither the social democrats nor the People's Party appear willing to enter into a coalition with Mr Haider. The FPO also increased its share of the vote in Salzburg and Tyrol, and its success will give a boost to Mr Haider and his party for next October's general election. The Greens were the other 'winners', increasing their share of the vote to 10.5 per cent in Tyrol and 7.2 per cent in Salzburg province. Ms Madeleine Petrovic, the Green party leader, said the results provided 'the best starting position for the general election', although support in Tyrol may have been heavily influenced by a mixture of concerns over lorry transit across the province, the local farmers' future once Austria joins the EU, and fears over foreigners buying up property. Whatever the reasons, the results did not bode well for the two government coalition parties. Mr Franz Vranitzky, the social democrat chancellor, admits that his party may have taken its electorate too much for granted - 'March 13 was a warning for the October elections.' The SPO's supporters did not vote, and he says the party will have to work hard to reverse that trend. Both parties expect to lose some support at the general election, but Mr Busek is confident about the outcome: 'It will be very similar. The government parties will lose a bit, with the social democrats losing more, but there is no alternative to a (grand) coalition,' he says. An alliance with Mr Haider's freedom party is politically impossible - 'Haider has put his party out of political business. The FPO can't be in any coalition,' says Mr Busek. The Liberals also look weak and, in what is still a strongly Roman Catholic country, may have been damaged by a debate in which they pressed for a full separation of church and state. Mr Busek says that, for all its drawbacks, the current coalition offers stability at a time when Austria faces important changes, and this may be a winning argument. The debate over EU membership has caused divisions within the Greens and FPO, with Mr Haider's business backers worried about the potential consequences of economic isolationism. The FPO leader said he would not tell supporters how to vote in the referendum, though a large majority of party members rejected EU membership in an internal party poll this month. About a quarter of the Greens also favour membership, and opposition to joining the EU has been politically weak and primitive, with wild claims about bureaucracy, corruption and the loss of thousands of jobs as result of membership. Mr Busek and, it seems, a large proportion of the public, are unimpressed - 'what counts is not what the parties say, but how people feel, and that's a good thing in a democracy.'</p>

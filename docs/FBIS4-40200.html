			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 15 ITAR-TASS -- The idea of building a  new Russian space centre in the Amur region, which would help  effectively solve the Baykonur problem, was supported by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin during his visit to Blagoveshchensk.    During the president's visit, the question was discussed  with  the chief of the space-equipment testing centre Major-General  Aleksandr Vinidiktov.    According to Vinidiktov, he did not have to convince Boris  Yeltsin that the new space project is advisable. The president,  who is now touring Russia's eastern regions, was ready to  support the idea.    The problem of Baykonur is associated with the fact that  following the break up of the former Soviet Union, the country's  main space centre found itself on the territory of a "foreign  country", the newly independent state of Kazakhstan. Russia is  now using it under a temporary agreement with Kazakhstan but  needs independence for pursuing its own space policy. The  Russian space forces and other interested parties are now  working to expand the space centre in the northern Plesetsk and  looking for a suitable place for a new space centre in southern  Russia capable of performing a number of functions which  Baykonur alone can handle at present.    The Government of Russia has prepared a draft resolution "On  the Development of the Cosmodrome in Plesetsk and the Creation  of a Space Centre in the Far Eastern Region of the Russian  Federation".    Svobodny-18, a former military settlement in the far east,  is  probably the best choice as it has a ramified infrastructure  worth several hundreds of billions of rubles and its personnel  trained to service combat missile complexes can be easily  retrained to launch boosters with space craft. The new space  centre would also create new jobs for the Amur-Baykal main line  builders and local machine-builders.    Ahead of the full-scale development of the new space centre,  a space equipment testing centre is already operating at  Svobodny as part of the Russian space forces. Its specialists  are preparing the launches of the Rokot boosters scheduled for  1996.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Indonesia to buy Malaysian cars Proton, the Malaysian car manufacturer, has won its first export order in Indonesia. Under a memorandum of understanding signed in Jakarta, Indonesia will import between 1,500 and 3,000 Protons, which will be used as taxis. The Proton sale forms part of a complex trade and investment deal being negotiated between Malaysia and Indonesia. Under agreements signed during a visit to Indonesia last week by Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, Malaysia will contribute Dollars 50m to a joint venture capital company which will seek to develop small and medium-scale industries in Indonesia. Negotiations are also under way on the possible sale to Malaysia of a number of Indonesian transport aircraft, made by the state owned Industri Pesawat Terban Nusantara, while Malaysia hopes to sell its own light trainer aircraft to Jakarta. Malaysia has said it is investigating the manufacture of Proton components in Indonesia in order to avoid Indonesian car import duties of more than 200 per cent. PT Citra Lamtoro, a company controlled by Mrs Hardijanti Rukmana, the daughter of Indonesian President Suharto, is to import the Protons into Indonesia. A brother of Mrs Rukmana is already involved in car assembly operations in Indonesia while another brother is part of an Indonesian group which recently purchased the Lamborghini car company from Chrysler of the US.</p>

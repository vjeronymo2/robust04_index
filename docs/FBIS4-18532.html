			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "This Is Not the End of the </F> World"]    [Text] The fact that the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) won  the mayoral seats in Ankara and Istanbul as well as in 25 other  major cities across the country has created an uproar and has  spread fear even among some Turks that the country is falling  into the hands of Muslim fundamentalists.    This is an totally false assessment and misrepresents the  realities in Turkey.    Firstly the Welfare Party, which could once have been termed  as Muslim fundamentalist, has been transformed into a  pro-Islamic party under the influence of young Islamic  progressives like Melih Gokcek, who was elected mayor of Ankara,  and Tayyip Erdogan, who won in Istanbul. So the progressive  wing seems to be making advances in the party and they are  distancing themselves from the fundamentalists...    Secondly the elections have shown that the nationwide  popularity of the Welfare is only 18.75 percent, which means  81.25 percent of Turks oppose it. Thus it is not a popular  movement that can dominate our society.    Thirdly the new mayors of Istanbul and Ankara know well that  they do not represent the majority of the people in their  respective cities. (Both in Ankara and Istanbul the Welfare won  the mayoral seats by winning about 25 to 27 percent of the  votes). In Ankara 73 percent voted against the Welfare, and in  Istanbul 75 percent rejected the pro-Islamic party. But because  of the split in the votes the Welfare managed to win...Now the  Welfare mayors have to realize they cannot run their cities in  an arbitrary manner. Or else they will face both the citizens  and the law. According to Turkish law, mayors who violate the  law can be sacked by the Interior Minister...    Fourthly the mayors can only run their cities and provide  services to the people. They cannot act like a police force or  force people to do anything that is not included in the law.  They cannot order women to cover up or interfere in the way we  live. The RP is not, and will never be, a majority party in  Parliament.    We feel most of the present concern is misplaced. People are  acting as if the RP was the winner of a parliamentary election  and will be running the country in the years to come. That is  not true.    However, if people continue to display anger and frustration  with the election victories of the Welfare, and try to resort to  illegal means, we feel this will only serve to further polarize  the public.    We also feel great concern over the emotional displays of  Welfare supporters in Istanbul and Ankara after they heard about  the victories of their candidates. They have to remember they  do not represent the majority in either Istanbul or Ankara and  their actions could well antagonize the general public. Let us  first give the Welfare the benefit of the doubt. If they step  out of line we have the laws and the government to put them  firmly in their place.</p>

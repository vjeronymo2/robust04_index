			<p>BFN     [Text] This is just-in news. According to Seoul radio  reports, today, approximately 30,000 members of the National  Federation of General Student Councils, who are students of  approximately 130 South Korean universities, held meetings to  express their resolve to stop the National Assembly from  ratifying the treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique's opening of the  agricultural market and waged demonstration struggles. They  also jointly boycotted class [tongmaeng hyuhak].    In Seoul, students of approximately 20 universities,  including Korea and Hanyang Universities, held meetings to  express their resolve and sternly denounced the puppet Kim  Yong-sam clique for a nation-selling treacherous act.    The students denounced that the final implementation plan to  open the agricultural market, which the Kim Yong-sam ring had  presented to the GATT, resulted from its full acceptance of the  U.S. brigandish demand [kangdojok yogu] and strongly demanded  the withdrawal of the plan and the renegotiation of the Uruguay  Round [UR].    After the meetings, the students took to the streets and  waged demonstration struggles. The demonstrators repeatedly  chanted slogans such as "Let us stop the National Assembly from  ratifying the opening of the agricultural market!"    The nation-selling treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique sent  approximately 20,000 combat policemen of approximately 170  companies to Seoul streets to suppress the students. However,  the students defiantly continued their struggles.    Radio reports also say that university students, who are  members of the National Federation of General Student Councils,  joined in struggles in Pusan and various other regional cities.</p>

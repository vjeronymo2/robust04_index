			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Anachronistic Way of </F> Thinking Must be Disregarded"]    [Text] The U.S. imperialists are escalating their plots  for a Northward invasion war. As has already been reported,  they deployed some of their 30 ultramodern Apache attack  helicopters -- which they promised to deploy to South Korea --  to South Korea on 10 April. The Apache helicopters, which have  been deployed to South Korea as a part of strengthening the  combatant capabilities of the U.S. Forces occupying South Korea,  have arrived in the U.S. Army bases near the Military  Demarcation Line.    From 10 to 11 April, the U.S. imperialists also mobilized  and  deployed various kinds of approximately 20 military planes to  South Korea from their overseas bases. They have either  mobilized or supplied a great number of troops and war equipment  to operational areas by air transport from U.S. mainland bases  and the Pacific region.    It has been reported that the first shipment of Patriot  missiles -- which left Texas some time ago -- will arrive in  South Korea soon. All these facts are an intentional plot to  reinforce their arms to further lead the situation on the Korean  peninsula to the brink of war. Therefore, it is a very  dangerous military move.    As everyone knows, it is our consistent position to resolve  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue or  negotiations. However, the U.S. imperialists -- who have  unilaterally broken up the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks by  fully refusing the implementation of an DPRK-U.S. agreement  signed in New York -- have disclosed their attempts to resume  the Team Spirit joint military exercise under an unreasonable  pretext and have more vigorously maneuvered to strengthen South  Korea's military reinforcement by babbling about the so-called  sanctions. This is an act like a thief turning on the victim  with a club and clearly shows that the United States has no  intention at all to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula through dialogue, but instead has plotted to crush  [apsal] our Republic.    Such criminal attempts by the U.S. imperialists have been  properly shown by the recent and bellicose remarks by U.S.  ruling circles. In an interview with U.S. NBC Television on 12  April, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher even set a deadline  for us to accept nuclear inspections, talking about our  so-called nuclear issue. Also, he made absurd remarks that if we  fail to comply with their unilateral and unjust demands by then,  diplomatic pressure will be turned into a more stern step and  that he cannot rule out the possibility of conducting a military  preemptive strike.    Prior to his remarks, even U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry  has not hesitated to make bellicose remarks that he cannot rule  out the possibility of a U.S. preemptive military strike against  North Korea, and that he is willing to take the risk of waging a  war. The U.S. imperialists' arms reinforcement plots -- which  have been further accelerated under the situations in which the  U.S. ruling circles have made such bellicose remarks that  agitate war and in which the U.S. naval fleets are mobilized and  deployed in waters off the Korean peninsula -- are never  coincident. This shows that they have attempted to surely wage  a new war on the Korean peninsula by strengthening the military  threat or pressure against us.    Because of the U.S. imperialists' and South Korean puppets'  reckless war plots, a very grave situation in which no one knows  when war breaks out [onje chonjaengi tojilchi morunun] is now  being created on the Korean peninsula. It is the U.S.  imperialists who are the ringleaders of aggravating tensions, as  well as the breakers of peace and security on the Korean  peninsula.    While acting as if it is an international military police,  the United states intends to bring our people to their knees  with military forcible measures [kanggwon] and force. However,  this is an anachronistic way of thinking. The times have passed  in which forcible measures and force could be used. It is a  foolish daydream if it believes that the method of force can be  applied to us.    We have the might of single-hearted unity, which is much  stronger than atomic or hydrogen bombs, as well as the matchless  revolutionary Armed Forces capable of boldly destroying any  enemies and of safeguarding the socialist fatherland based on  the strong self-reliant national economy and the powerful  national defensive capabilities. We are thoroughly prepared to  cope with the U.S. imperialists' military pressure or offensive.    The persons who sets a fire are doomed to be burned to death  by that fire. The U.S. imperialists should clearly see the  reality and should not act recklessly.</p>

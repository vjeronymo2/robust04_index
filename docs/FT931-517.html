			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Scottish consumers face power price rise SCOTTISHPOWER, the larger of the two Scottish electricity companies, yesterday bucked the trend of electricity companies in Britain by raising its domestic tariffs. The English and Welsh regional electricity companies have cut or frozen their domestic tariffs. ScottishPower is to put the price of electricity for domestic customers up 2.8 per cent in 1993-94, taking account of inflation forecasts and predicted cost rises. In northern Scotland, Scottish Hydro-Electric yesterday froze tariffs at 1992 levels and made a special reduction of 2.3 per cent per unit for those who use less electricity. ScottishPower said it paid its customers a Pounds 20m rebate from last November after it became clear it had overestimated inflation for 1992-93. If it had not done that it would be freezing its prices now, the company said. Its domestic tariffs were still among the lowest in the UK. The Southern Scotland Electricity Consumers committee said ScottishPower was entitled to its increase.</p>

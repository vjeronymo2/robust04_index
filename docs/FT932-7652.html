			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Nadir gains control in his move to regain control of Turkish assets MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive Cypriot businessman, has successfully intervened in the Turkish courts to prevent the sale of Gunaydin, the Istanbul newspaper, in his latest move to regain control of his Turkish assets.

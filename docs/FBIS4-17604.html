			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the talks between Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev and Chairman of the Azeri parliament Rasul  Guliyev in Moscow on Monday the two sides agreed to modify the  Russian plan for the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. This  was stated to INTERFAX by Guliyev after a one and a half  hour-long conversation with Kozyrev, most of which was face to  face.    Asked by INTERFAX correspondent whether Azerbaijan's  attitude  to the Russian settlement plan changed after the meeting,  Guliyev said: "I have always had a positive attitude to this  plan. I have always supported Russia's peacekeeping efforts.  Another problem is that the plan should take into account the  methods of liberating the seized Azeri territories." According  to Guliyev, Kozyrev agreed with his arguments.    Guliyev also said that he had not discussed with Kozyrev the  timetable and all the technical aspects of the Russian plan.  "These issues will be handled by the special envoy of the  Russian president, special ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov and the  Azeri Foreign Ministry," the speaker of the Azeri parliament  said.    In turn, ambassador Kazimirov told INTERFAX that "the  introduction of modifications to the Russian plan for the  settlement of the conflict is continuing on a constant basis."  "This is...a natural course (for such negotiations), so there is  nothing extraordinary in Azerbaijan's position on this issue,"  the Russian diplomat said.</p>

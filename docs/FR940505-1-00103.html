			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second part of this compliance demonstration will be submitted to EPA at the end of the compliance period. This document will contain the sales demonstration for each of the manufacturer's products that are subject to this manufacturers bubble and their VOC contents. This demonstration will follow the methodologies approved by EPA in part one of the compliance demonstration. Manufacturers will be required to retain all documents pertaining to this compliance demonstration for a period of five years. EPA solicits comments on these proposed recordkeeping provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Implementation and enforcement issues. Because of EPA's limited resources, the agency intends to require manufacturers subject to this proposed rule to structure their compliance demonstrations in such a way so that the agency can minimize its review and enforcement costs. EPA invites comment on ways to accomplish this goal. The agency invites comments from other entities with experience in designing and implementing these types of manufacturers bubble programs. EPA especially seeks comment on ways to reduce the cost of enforcement against manufacturers with a potential for multiple inspection locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The use of other economic instruments to incentivize emission reductions. EPA is also examining the use of other economic instruments to achieve emission reductions equivalent to the proposed FIP cap program. The primary instrument that EPA is considering is the use of emission fees to accomplish the necessary reductions in the FIP areas. The use of fees will involve examining at least the following issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fee structures: how much should be charged for a given quantity of pollution and how will the fee structure affect the FIP areas' ability to attain the ozone NAAQS? Should fees be constant up to an allowable emissions limit and increase as excess emissions increase?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Permitting issues: how will NSR and other permitting issues be addressed?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Enforcement issues: how will EPA or the FIP areas enforce a fee program?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Economic impacts: how will the use of fees affect the FIP areas' economies?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA seeks public comment on the above fee-related issues as well as comment with respect to the use of other economic incentive strategies not discussed in this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Mobile Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Overview of Mobile Source Issues and Measures_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Emissions Credit for the California Motor Vehicle Control Program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California LEV program relies on advanced emission control technologies, clean gasoline, and an on-board diagnostic (OBD) system, which together with enhanced I/M, or its equivalent, are designed to assure that in-use vehicles emit at levels close to their respective emission standards. EPA is confident that the LEV program will achieve substantial emission reductions beyond those which will result from federal cars. Emission reductions for the LEV program used in the FIP reflect a substantial reduction in the rate of emission deterioration compared to current vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the California LEV program has addressed the problem of excessive in-use emission deterioration with its on-board diagnostics program, which requires the identification of individual vehicles whose emissions exceed the certification standards by more than 50 percent. Furthermore, ARB's assessment of the new technology which will be used to comply with LEV standards has identified many new components and control techniques which will improve emission durability. These features of the LEV program will help assure that in-use vehicle emission deterioration will be substantially reduced from current levels and that the low emission attributed to the program by ARB will be realized in-use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Summary of Mobile Source FIP Measures_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1990, passenger cars, other highway vehicles, nonroad engines and equipment, and the transportation facilities used in interstate commerce produced from 53 to 63 percent of the total inventory of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and from 70 to 94 percent of the total inventory of oxides of nitrogen (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in the FIP areas covered by this proposal. In order to demonstrate attainment of the ozone standard in these areas, it will be necessary to propose regulations which assure significant reductions in mobile source emissions_beyond those already expected from the continued turnover to newer, cleaner vehicles and engines. The mobile source category covers a very broad range of sizes of equipment, types of fuels, uses and operating modes, and extent of current pollution control. Therefore, there is no one measure or even one uniform type of measure which is proposed across the category to achieve the reductions needed for the attainment plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to those measures that are required in all States by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and those measures being implemented by the State of California and local agencies, EPA considered measures requiring cleaner vehicles and engines via further improvements in technology or through incentives for users to select alternatives with lower polluting characteristics. EPA also developed measures which will achieve emission reductions from other remaining mobile source categories, both to provide sufficient reductions for attainment and to ensure that each category of emission source was contributing to the solution. The following specific measures were developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Programs for Light Duty Vehicles. EPA expects the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program will substantially reduce emissions from cars and light duty trucks, compared to federal standards. However, despite the use of advanced technologies and the OBD requirements, ARB projects LEVs will exceed their certification standards in-use. Emissions above the certification standards will occur because some models may experience more in-use deterioration than expected, or because individual vehicles experience component failure or improper maintenance which is not immediately corrected by the various existing in-use compliance programs, including enhanced I/M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the magnitude of the emission reductions needed for attainment is so great, the adoption of further measures to reduce these in-use emissions will help reach attainment of the ozone standard. EPA is therefore seeking comments on the need for and benefits of adopting an enhanced in-use compliance program which would provide extra emission reductions above and beyond the substantial reduction provided by the California LEV program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically EPA is considering three approaches. The first would modify the current federal recall program to initiate recalls based on the emission results of vehicles tested in their as-received condition, but from vehicles which are subject to the new enhanced I/M program and thus should be well maintained. Obviously tampered or abused vehicles would also be excluded from that sample. This differs from current practice and would result in a shift in responsibility for ensuring low in-use emissions from the consumer to the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

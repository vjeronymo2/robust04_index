			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Atmospheric oxygen concentration below 19.5 percent or above 23.5 percent; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has already determined that these conditions constitute serious hazards, ones that are tightly regulated in the generic permit-space standard in &sect;1910.146. These conditions can also be found in confined and enclosed spaces and in other dangerous atmosphere in shipyard work. In order for Subpart B to be as protective as the general industry permit-space standard, which permits employees to work in hazardous atmospheres using a system of permits and attendants not required by Subpart B, OSHA believes that Subpart B must require measures that ensure that employees are not exposed to such hazardous conditions. For this reason, the Agency is adopting requirements in final Subpart B that prohibit employee entry into confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres presenting an oxygen-deficient or oxygen-enriched atmosphere or containing concentrations of flammable gases or vapors greater than or equal to 10 percent of the gas's or vapor's lower explosive limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA concludes, however, that entry into such spaces can safely be permitted under certain conditions. First, in emergencies, where persons are endangered, entry might be necessary to save the life of an entrant or the lives of every person on that transport. Second, because these spaces will have to be ventilated to make the atmosphere safe for employees, entry might be necessary to set up the proper ventilation equipment. For these reasons, final Subpart B permits entry into IDLH and other hazardous atmospheres for emergency rescue and for periods of short duration to install ventilation equipment necessary for normal entry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During such emergency or short duration entries, however, additional precautions must be taken to protect the entrants. The additional precautions to be taken must be appropriate for the hazards presented by the particular space involved. Thus, the final rule treats oxygen enrichment and deficiency, the presence of flammable gases and vapors, and atmospheres containing toxic contaminants at IDLH levels separately. For oxygen-enriched and oxygen-deficient atmospheres, the space must be continuously monitored for oxygen content (so that appropriate control measures can be taken if it changes), and respiratory protection and other personal protective equipment and clothing must be provided in accordance with Subpart I (so that appropriate personal protective equipment is provided and so that an attendant will be present if the oxygen content makes the space IDLH). The hazards of flammable atmospheres and toxicity are treated separately in their respective paragraphs (final &sect;1915.12 (b)(3) and (c)(4)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) of final &sect;1915.12 sets precautions to be taken before employees enter areas that present hazards related to flammable atmospheres. Paragraph (b)(1) applies to spaces that contain or have contained combustible or flammable liquids or gases and to spaces (called, appropriately, ``adjacent spaces'') that are adjacent to those spaces. These spaces must be: (1) inspected by a competent person to determine whether or not combustible or flammable liquids are present, and (2) tested by a competent person before entry by any employee to determine the concentration of flammable gases and vapors within the space. These precautions also apply to adjacent spaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previous &sect;1915.12(a)(1) requires the same spaces to be tested by a competent person to determine the concentration of flammable gases and vapors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule contained requirements equivalent to the previous standard in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of proposed &sect;1915.12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule differs from the previous and proposed rules only in that &sect;1915.12(b)(1) includes a requirement for the competent person to inspect the space, as well as test it, for the presence of combustible or flammable liquids. The inspection is necessary so that the competent person will be more likely to be made aware of any malfunction in the testing instrument. Obviously, if the inspection reveals the presence of a flammable liquid, a flammability test can be expected to result in some detectable concentration of flammable gases or vapors. The lack of any such reading from the test instrument would be an indication that the device might be defective and should lead to further investigation of the problem. The inspections will also be necessary if a hazardous concentration of flammable gases or vapors is found so that the proper precautions can be taken to eliminate the hazard. Although in the previous &sect;1915.12(a) does not specify that an inspection is to take place, in the previous &sect;1915.7(c), which requires tests  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and inspections  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to be entered into the ``Log of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inspections <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and Tests,'' implies that the competent person is to perform inspections in addition to any tests that are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(2) requires spaces that have been tested and found to contain concentrations of a flammable gas or vapor greater than or equal to 10 percent of the gas's or vapor's lower explosive limit (LEL) are required to be labeled ``Not Safe for Workers_Not Safe for Hot Work.'' If employees are to enter a space that has flammable gases or vapors in such concentrations, then ventilation must be provided to ensure that the concentration of these gases or vapors is maintained below 10 percent of their LELs. After the ventilation produces an acceptable atmosphere, the warning signs may be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(2) of the previous &sect;1915.12 requires spaces containing hazardous concentrations of flammable gases or vapors to be ventilated until the concentration drops below 10 percent of the gas's or vapor's LEL before workers are permitted to enter the space. No labeling of these spaces is required under the previous standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(5) of proposed &sect;1915.12 would have required labeling of spaces in a manner equivalent to that required under the final rule. Paragraph (b)(4) of proposed &sect;1915.12 would have prohibited entry when the concentration of flammable gases or vapors was at or above 10 percent of the LEL, but the proposal did not specifically require ventilation in &sect;1915.12. Ventilation requirements related to flammable atmospheres were proposed in &sect;1915.13(b)(8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No rulemaking participant objected to the proposed labeling requirement. Therefore, OSHA has carried it forward into the final rule. The final rule, unlike the proposal, continues to require spaces that are hazardous because of the presence of flammable gases or vapors to be labeled even when employees are permitted to enter for emergency purposes or for short durations to install ventilation. The proposal did not require the spaces to be labeled during these entries (in effect permitting employers to remove the signs at these times). However, such entries require the adoption of special precautions (see the summary and explanation of final &sect;1915.12(b)(3), later in this preamble). OSHA believes that the labeling must be maintained during these entries so that unauthorized, unprotected entry is prevented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(3) of final &sect;1915.12 prohibits employees from entering spaces containing concentrations of flammable gases or vapors at or above their LELs. However, employees may enter these spaces for emergency rescue or for a short duration for the installation of ventilation equipment provided that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) No ignition sources are present,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The atmosphere in the space is monitored continuously;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The concentrations of flammable gases and vapors in the atmosphere in the space are maintained above their upper explosive limits (UEL), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

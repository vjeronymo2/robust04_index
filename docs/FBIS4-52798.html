			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Perilous War Gamble Against North" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The combined military  exercises of the three services of the puppet army launched by  the South Korean puppets on May 9 under the name of "combined  tactical exercises for the first half of the year" are aimed at  rounding off the posture of attack on the North according to the  war policy of the U.S. imperialists, says NODONG SINMUN in a  commentary today.    The news analyst points out:    The puppets, as they customarily do, are now advertising the  war game as designed to cope with "a surprise attack" and  "infiltration" of the North. But this is no more than a sophism  to cover up their bellicose nature in aggravating the situation  on the Korean peninsula on purpose and seeking only  confrontation and war.    It is the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean warmaniacs  who scheme a surprise attack and infiltration on the Korean  peninsula. The South Korean puppets in league with the United  States have worked out "new operational plan 5027", designed to  unleash a war against the North. The United States has massed  huge aggression forces in and around South Korea and deployed  Patriot missiles and attack helicopters in South Korea to  inflict a nuclear holocaust upon the Korean nation. Some time  ago Defense Secretary Perry, the war boss of the U.S., flew to  South Korea to have war confabs.    The United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must  know that the dangerous play with fire driving the situation on  the Korean peninsula to the brink of war will bring nothing good  to them.</p>

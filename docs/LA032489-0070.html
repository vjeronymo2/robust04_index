			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  DRIVE SEEKS TO BAN BEACH CONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> A group of Santa Monica slow-growth activists launched an initiative drive  Thursday to ban the construction of hotels, motels and large restaurants on  Santa Monica Beach.  </P> <P> Representatives of the newly formed "Save Our Beach Committee" said they hope  to gather 10,000 signatures to put the initiative on the ballot in a special  election later this year.  </P> <P> Sharon Gilpin, a veteran of previous slow-growth campaigns, said she and a  handful of activists began the drive because of a "flood" of hotel and motel  construction in her beach neighborhood in the last two years.  </P> <P> The proposed initiative would target a zone from Santa Monica's northern border  along Ocean Avenue and Nielson Way to the city's southern border, with the  exception of Santa Monica Pier.  </P></p>

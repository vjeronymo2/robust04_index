			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures plunge - Market Report Speculative selling in the New York market sparked off a COFFEE price plunge yesterday afternoon that took London futures values to the lowest levels since the end of October. The March position dipped to Dollars 1,169 a tonne at the close, down Dollars 34 on the day. Traders said there was little fresh news in the market to warrant such a move, but having failed to break out on the upside, disappointed longs had liquidated. 'It's looking tired,' said one, 'and some stale longs have decided to get out.' Others said the fall had been exacerbated by the lack of roaster demand on the way down. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER and ZINC prices opened sharply higher but came under increasing pressure as the day progressed. A chart break-out at New York's Commodity Exchange (Comex) late on Tuesday sent the copper market soaring and at one stage the three months position reached a four month high of Dollars 1,912 a tonne, over 10 per cent up this year and 18.5 per cent above its 1993 low. But with analysts and chartists warning that the rise was becoming over-extended and with Comex falling back, prices dropped during the afternoon before last kerb business at Dollars 1,882, still up Dollars 24 a tonne from Tuesday's close. Zinc had continued Tuesday's rise but ran into resistance near Dollars 1,050 a tonne and settled back to a final trade at Dollars 1,030 a tonne, down Dollars 12 on balance. ALUMINIUM prices lost more ground as news was awaited from the Brussels talks on cutting oversupply. Compiled from Reuter</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Paris call to boost dumping defences France wants the European Union to come to a quick agreement to beef up its defences against dumping and other unfair trade practices, as insurance against the US agreeing to submit itself to tougher multilateral disciplines in a new world trade organisation. Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, said in an interview with Les Echos, the French business daily, that this issue would figure in today's Franco-German summit in Bonn. 'We wish to share with the Germans the same vision, a non-protectionist vision, but at the same time not one of the free market without any rules of the game,' he said. Increased French calls for the EU to reinforce its commercial defences do not necessarily bode ill for a Gatt accord. Indeed, to the extent that France gets concessions on this issue it will need fewer concessions from the US on other issues. See Editorial Comment</p>

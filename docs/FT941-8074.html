			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Western leaders divided on next move in Bosnia Disagreements between western capitals were emerging yesterday over how to capitalise on the ceasefire and continuing demilitarisation in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. President Bill Clinton promised to renew US efforts to achieve peace in Bosnia, using the 'breathing space' won by Nato's apparent success in forcing the withdrawal of heavy guns from around Sarajevo. But he remained wary about issuing further ultimatums in other areas of Bosnia, cautioning that Nato should 'not undertake a mission it is not able to perform'. However, Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, said Nato should be ready to go further: 'The Nato partners . . . in consultation with the UN, should tell the parties concerned in Bosnia that we will not hesitate to widen this measure to other places in Bosnia if there too the hostilities do not stop.' Nato and the United Nations called off plans for air strikes after Bosnian Serbs and government forces moved or handed in their heavy artillery by the Sunday midnight deadline. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned that the threat of air strikes remained. 'If there are heavy weapons discovered within the exclusion zone or if they go back in there, they are subject to attack by Nato,' he said before meeting Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's prime minister. US officials said they would look at ways of encouraging peace moves at talks with the UK, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union in Bonn today. The possibilities included efforts to arrange an agreement between the Moslem-led Bosnian government and the Bosnian Croats so as to increase the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs, and a widening of the Nato ultimatum to ease conditions in other besieged towns such as Tuzla, Srebrenica or Mostar. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said any ultimatum to help other cities in Bosnia was 'weeks away' and Nato's priority was to make sure Sarajevo remained free from shelling. But a UN official in New York said the UN planned to reopen Tuzla airport on March 7 in an operation that could involve close air support. Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, said yesterday that France would ask the UN security council this week to put Sarajevo under UN administration. It was vital, he said, to build quickly on the success of Nato's ultimatum. The need to maintain momentum was echoed by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, who was speaking in Paris after talks with Mr Edouard Balladur, the French premier.

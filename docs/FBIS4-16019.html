			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by ITAR-TASS correspondent Liliya Kuznetsova, </F> "Especially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA": "Rising Level of  Migration"]    [Text] Since 1990 around 100,000 people a year have  emigrated from Russia: The rise in the numbers emigrating is  linked primarily with the liberalization of Russia's emigration  legislation in recent years. The bulk of the emigrants are  bound for Israel, Germany, and the United States. However,  whereas in 1990 the bulk of migrants went to Israel, at present  Germany is the leading recipient of emigrants from Russia.    There has been a large-scale exodus of Germans, Jews,  Meskhetian Turks, and Greeks in evidence for a number of years  now, but the increase in the proportion of Russians among the  emigrants is quite a new phenomenon.    The migration of families is the dominant form of emigration  and the demographic composition is close to that of the  population of Russia: The proportions of pensioners and  dependents in the population and among emigrants are  approximately equal.    The proportion of white-collar workers stands out  significantly in the social composition of people leaving Russia  -- they constitute more than one-third of the total number of  emigrants. This alarming figure reflects the process of the  "brain drain" from fundamental science and the defense complex  in Russia.    However, it must be noted that the level of migration from  Russia is lower than from the neighboring foreign countries.  For example, although the population of the Russian Federation  constitutes a little over one-half of the population of the  former USSR, the proportion of emigrants from Russia represents  little more than one-fourth of the total emigration figure.    The tide of refugees, enforced migrants, and economic  migrants from the former union republics into Russia could soon  reach 6 million people. If the processes of destabilization in  the former union republics ease, the number of potential  migrants could be expected to be in the 2-3 million range.  However, if there is a further worsening of the sociopolitical  situation and the economic crisis and a broadening of the  geographical spread of interethnic conflicts and discrimination  against nonindigenous peoples, specialists of the Federal  Migration Service believe that the potential tide of migrants  could at least double and reach 4-6 million.    According to Tatyana Regent, leader of the Federal Migration  Service, "the Russian migration service has the capacity to  receive, place, and accommodate even such a significant influx  of refugees." But for that it is necessary to resolve some  financial problems: Given the acute shortage of state funds for  the implementation of a large-scale program for the reception of  migrants from the former union republics, it is necessary to  attract resources from extrabudgetary sources.</p>

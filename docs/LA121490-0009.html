			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO ETHICS COST MONEY, TOO  </P> <P> There are very few exercises of representative government more brutal than  coping with a budget deficit.  </P> <P> Politicians engaged in the process like to talk about the necessity of "setting  priorities." What they don't like to talk about is how those priorities get  set. Sometimes, it has something to do with the merits of the outlay; at least  as often, it has everything to do with the strength of the constituency for the  expenditure at issue. Whatever the program, the stronger and more influential  its constituency, the less likely it is to endure a crippling cut.  </P> <P> That may not always be good economics, but it is pretty good democracy.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles is struggling to come to grips with one of the worst  budget deficits in memory -- an estimated $120-million shortfall. As a  consequence, Mayor Tom Bradley has imposed an emergency citywide freeze on  hiring.  </P> <P> One of the victims of that order is the new city Ethics Commission, which is  attempting to assemble the staff it will need to enforce the progressive, new  governmental regulations enacted by the people of Los Angeles when they  approved Measure H in last June's election.  </P> <P> Those reforms hold the key to curbing the excessive influence of special  interests over City Hall's lawmaking process and to eliminating the conflicts  of interest that have plagued the latest Bradley Administration with scandal.  That promise will go unrealized, however, if the Ethics Commission is denied  the staff it needs to enforce the law that takes effect next month.  </P> <P> Some in city government already have attempted to argue that every dollar spent  on the Ethics Commission is a dollar that will not be spent on police, fire or  other vital services.  </P> <P> This false juxtaposition, which was the centerpiece of the anti-Measure H  campaign, is as empty and silly now as it was last June, when the voters  rejected it. Even in these tough times, there is money both for safe streets  and honest government.  </P> <P> Politicians who want to delude themselves into believing there is no popular  constituency for ethical city government can get a bracing dose of reality by  reviewing the results of last June's election.  </P></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Wallenbergs give a lesson in invisibility The empire is held in a strong hand A visitor to Stockholm intent on seeking out Europe's premier industrial dynasty would soon discover something striking about the Wallenberg empire. It has no headquarters, no annual report and no corporate logo. This public invisibility stands in stark contrast to the glittering list of Swedish blue-chip companies which the Wallenberg family controls such as Asea, Electrolux, Ericsson, Astra, Stora, Saab-Scania and SKF. But it is a key to understanding the way in which the Wallenbergs operate. They deliberately adopt a low-profile approach, shunning the limelight and avoiding a jet-set lifestyle. When they take to the water it is to sail in Stockholm's archipelago rather than to cruise in luxury yachts off the Cote d'Azur. Their style is summed up in the family motto 'Esse Non Vidare' - To Be, Not To Be Seen. Their empire is a collection of widely disparate companies gathered under the same umbrella but controlled most often through minority shareholdings. It is the identities of the individual companies which are promoted rather than the common ownership. However, the invisibility belies the strong hold exercised by the family, headed by Peter Wallenberg, and a circle of trusted lieutenants over a fiefdom accounting for 40 per cent of the value of the Stockholm Stock Exchange. 'They will always be strong owners. They want to control their companies, they want to make the decisions,' says a former Wallenberg director. This rule through a close-knit network which acts as a kind of super-board has been the Wallenbergs' traditional way of managing the empire. It operates largely informally through frequent meetings in offices of the key companies scattered around Stockholm's handsome waterfront, through daily telephone calls between the main protagonists and through a regular round of discreet social gatherings. At the pinnacle stands Peter Wallenberg, aged 68. Alongside him in what the former director calls 'an inner, inner circle', are his anointed dual heirs, his son Jacob and his nephew Marcus, both in their late 30s. Today, the other key members of the network include Bo Berggren, chairman of Stora, Anders Scharp, chairman of Electrolux, Claes Dahlback, chief executive of Investor, the family's core holding company, and Bjorn Svedberg, chairman of Ericsson and chief executive of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the family bank. Another insider is Percy Barnevik, the chief executive of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group which the Wallenberg's half control. However, he appears to play a more independent role, holding chairmanships of Swedish companies outside the Wallenberg sphere. All this group, with the exception of Bjorn Svedberg, sit on the board of Investor, which Peter Wallenberg chairs. But they also meet in overlapping combinations, with one of them usually acting as chairman, across the core Wallenberg companies. The system is perfectly suited to providing a sheltered habitat within which Peter is grooming Jacob and Marcus to succeed him. They have moved up from lower level jobs within the empire, inside and outside Sweden, to senior executive positions, respectively, in SE-Banken and Investor, and to assume their first board positions. Peter Wallenberg says the cousins will take over when he decides they are ready. He is using the network to give Jacob and Marcus the chance to gain experience precisely in the way he was denied by his father, who denigrated Peter's abilities. Members of the network say it provides a valuable cross-fertilisation of views and strategic guidance for individual companies. But they insist this is distinct from unwarranted interference in day-to-day manage-ment, which is left to the executives running the companies. The Wallenbergs certainly pride themselves in having fostered successive generations of loyal managements who have had the backing to produce long-term results. One is Ericsson, the telecommunications group, where management under chief executive Lars Ramqvist spent heavily on research and development in the early 1990s - more than 20 per cent of turnover - at the expense of dividends. The pay-off has been Ericsson's present success, especially in mobile telephony. The network also provides an invaluable service to individual companies, providing access to the Wallenbergs' extensive international business, political and academic contacts. Peter Wallenberg sits, for example, on Swiss Bank Corp's international advisory board and GM's European advisory council. Similar prestige posts are held by all the inner circle. These contacts were put to spectacular use in 1991 when Jacob Wallenberg led a move by Investor to raise a Dollars 1.5bn unsecured syndicated bank loan to fund Investor's buy-out of Saab-Scania. 'Do you think you'd get that out of the major banks without having a particular reputation?' says Peter Wallenberg. But the other side of the coin is the concern that the network is too incestuous and is there mainly to support decision-making by the family. 'When it comes to strategy it is a question in the end for Peter Wallenberg to make the decisions, and he does,' says a former insider. 'The others are just advisers.' Key issues, he says, are worked out before board meetings by the inner circle. Some critics worry that the network system ultimately stifles initiative. 'In every such constellation, there is a danger they are protecting each other,' says Per Olof Edin, chief economist at the LO trade union federation. The network to date has certainly tended to resist outside intrusions. In 1990, the Wallenbergs responded to a demand for a seat on Saab-Scania's board by Sven Olof Johansson, a corporate raider who had built up a 22 per cent stake, by buying him out. Today there is a striking discrepancy between the virtual absence of foreigners on Wallenberg company boards and the fact that as much as 50 per cent of the capital of individual companies is held by foreign investors. This is not a pressing issue now because no single interest has built up a significant voting stake in any company. But it could become so as the spate of foreign buying of Swedish shares unleashed by deregulation continues unabated. This is the second article in a three-part series on the Wallenbergs. The first appeared yesterday.</p>

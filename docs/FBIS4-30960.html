			<p>BFN     [Text] The two-day session of the Assembly of the Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina concluded today with the adoption of the  Law on the Government of the Republic, draft law on ministries  and other state bodies, and the endorsement of a score of other  ordinances [zakonski akt]. Here is a report by Adnana  Hadziahmetovic and Zoran Pali on today's Assembly session.    [Begin recording] [Hadziahmetovic] According to the draft  law on the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina that  the deputies adopted today, the government is to perform the  function of government of the Federation until a final peace  solution on Bosnia-Herzegovina is reached and implemented.    Expounding on this proposal, Dr. Kasim Begic pointed to the  need to legally and technically coordinate this proposal with  the first Law on the Government of the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina that was adopted yesterday. What is involved  is, as he put it, the government with the same personnel  composition playing a double role. This legal and technical  coordination should be done by the Government and the  Legislative Commission. At the same time, the law on ministries  and other state bodies of the republic was adopted in the form  of a draft and deputies will present possible remarks on it to  the Legislative Commission by 10 June. The law on ministries  and other state organs of the republic should be adopted at the  next assembly meeting in 14 days.    Deputies of the Republican Assembly today also adopted the  Law on (?Ratifying) Decrees with Legal Power to the [word  indistinct] draft decision on endorsing ordinances adopted by  the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina acting as assembly.  Presenting the Legislative Commission's decisions on the  further procedure of adopting these laws and decisions, Dr.  Kasim Begic made the following proposal:    [Begic] All 594 ordinances adopted by the Presidency acting  as the Assembly should be ratified, thereby ensuring the  consistency of the functioning of the republic's legal system.  We also suggest that the Government of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Assembly reexamine all these  documents, each in detail, within the next three months, so we  can decide which law, decision, or appointment and dismissal  [word indistinct], that is, which individual provisions in them  should be amended or deleted.    [Hadziahmetovic] As they did not take part in endorsing  these decisions, deputies of the Croatian Democratic Community  will be directly included in the procedure of adopting them.    Later at the session, the draft law on Bosnia-Herzegovina's  independence day was endorsed; the Assembly will decide on it at  its next session.    [Pali] The Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted the  proposal of the law on the amendments to the law on roads.  Before adopting the law, deputies Pero Vasilj and Abdulah  Konjicija took part in the debate. Vasilj said that before  voting in the Assembly, one should draft a serious program and  only then discuss it and make decisions. Konjicija spoke of  several roads used to bring humanitarian aid to Sarajevo and  added that prices would be lower by one-half of a German mark if  these roads were repaired. Despite the war and the lack of  resources, one should plan to repair these roads, Abdulah  Konjicija said.    With 10 votes against and four abstentions, the deputies  also  adopted the Law on International Road Transportation.    In the second part of the session the deputies attention was  distracted by the long-awaited draft law on temporarily making  available to former owners the nationalized offices and city  development land. Due to the seriousness of the problems with  this law, it was decided after a brief debate to prepare the  draft, with certain amendments and improvements, to be adopted  at the coming session of the Assembly of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At the second day of the session, the Assembly adopted a  series of legal documents without debate, including the Law on  Zoning Activity, [word indistinct], and the laws on amendments  to ordinance on pension insurance in case of war or direct  danger of war, on military prosecutors' offices, and on regional  military courts.    Concluding the session, Miro Lazovic, chairman of the  Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in agreement  with heads of caucuses, convened the next Assembly of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina session for 15 June.

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): BPB Industries - Other Companies Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, has seen a sharp rise in margins since the price war between it and Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany came to an end more than 18 months ago. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 100m are estimated for the year to the end of March when BPB announces its annual results on Thursday. This compares with Pounds 57.5m in 1992-93 but is still well short of the more than Pounds 200m earned five years ago.</p>

With only 30 working days left until  the cut-off date for applications, 250,000 of the 340,000  eligible applicants have failed to lodge the necessary  paperwork. Immigration Department assistant director, Chan  Ching-bor, said more than 8,000 applications would have to be  lodged every day before March 31 if people were to change their  travel documents from British Dependent Territories Citizen to  BNO passports in time. He said the outstanding applications  would far exceed the capacity of staff processing claims for BNO  passports. Only 3,500 applications can be processed per day.  We would obviously like more staff to process these  applications, but we just can't get the approval for funding."    Mr Chan urgently appealed for everyone eligible in phase two  (those born from 1962 to 1966) to send in their applications.  "It is only a two-page form and the best way is to post it to  the Immigration Department. I urge everyone to act as quickly  as possible on this," he said.    Mr Chan was unable to explain the delay in the procedure.  "Phase two just seems to have been much slower than phase one."  In phase one, 1,500 late applications were received and of the  150 so far processed, all have satisfied the requirements and  been confirmed for BNO passports. He said about 10 per cent of  eligible applicants would probably not apply for BNO passports  for a variety of reasons. "Some may have emigrated, may be  living in countries that don't allow dual nationalities, or are  people who don't think they will need such a passport after  1997."    The phased programme for application is intended to help the  3.5 million British Dependent Territories citizens in Hong Kong  to retain British nationality by having a BNO passport valid  beyond 1997. The programme aims to enable an orderly flow of  applications. Those who fail to apply before the designated  deadlines may lose their British nationality unless they have  special reasons for their late applications. There have been  complaints from people living overseas that they could not  register in time because of difficulties in getting the right  forms in embassies. Mr Chan said any late application would be  assessed on the reasons provided by the applicant as to why it  was lodged late.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Manila defends East Timor conference ban The Philippine government went on the defensive at the weekend after banning foreign participants from a conference on East Timor, apparently under pressure from Indonesia. President Fidel Ramos said the move was 'for the protection of national interests'. The Manila conference, scheduled for May 31-June 4, was conceived to discuss alleged repression in East Timor, which Indonesia annexed in 1976 after an earlier military invasion. Among those who had been expected to attend were Mr Jose Ramos Horta, East Timor foreign minister in exile and a leader of Timorese independence movement, and Mr George Aditjondro, author of a book that detailed a massacre of East Timorese in 1991 by Indonesian soldiers. Mr Horta is currently identified with the anti-Indonesia Fretilin guerrilla group in Portugal. The Philippine government said Mr Horta had sought that the conference try to make East Timor an Asian issue, to focus a global spotlight on the plight of the people and to foster dialogue among human rights advocates in the region. Some members of the Philippine Congress had expressed apprehension that the conference, if allowed as a precedent, could make Manila 'a new base for subversive groups'. Manila's move followed a threat of retaliation by Jakarta should the conference proceed with government permission.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Port row goes right to HK jugular: Desperately needed ninth terminal is feared dead The Hong Kong government is to accelerate development of the colony's 10th and 11th container terminals, given fears that the desperately needed ninth terminal is effectively dead. Container Terminal 9 (CT9) is already 18 months behind schedule. Progress has been mothballed by politics, with China refusing to approve the project (which straddles the 1997 handover, and therefore requires endorsement from Beijing) unless Jardines is ejected from the consortium developing the terminal. China claims that Jardines' inclusion in the consortium was a pay-off for supporting Governor Chris Patten's democracy reforms; Hong Kong says that it operates a level playing field for all its contracts, and that to suggest otherwise is to damage the colony's international business reputation. The stalemate over the terminal, allied to the lack of practical alternatives for extending the colony's port, will spark huge problems of congestion and bring a knock-on effect to the economy, analysts say. Like the airport, also running at capacity and also the subject of a Sino-British deadlock, the port row goes straight for the colony's jugular. Hong Kong, the eighth biggest trading economy, operates the biggest port in the world. Some 90 per cent of Hong Kong's trade passes through it. Annual increases in throughput equal the total annual throughput at the UK's biggest port, Felixstowe: about 1.5m containers. Port operations contribute about 20 per cent of the colony's GDP and employ, in the widest definition of port-related activities, some 350,000 people, or 12-15 per cent of the workforce. While year-on-year growth in throughput stands at about 28 per cent for the year so far, capacity levels were breached back in May. Government figures put the cost of a two-year delay on CT9 at HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in the decade following 1997. This is at the conservative end of estimates, which range as high as HKDollars 200bn. Current trends point to an even bigger role for the colony's port. High economic growth in China will stimulate both export industries and imports; greater industrialisation in the mainland will mean more goods requiring containerisation; and China's re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or its successor will promote two-way trade. Forging ahead with CT10 and CT11 to absorb demand will do little to solve the problems caused by the absence of progress on CT9, and will fail to meet the immediate concerns of shippers and terminal operators. The time lag is contrary to Hong Kong's traditional just-in-time philosophy whereby new terminals were coming on line as soon as the existing ones reached capacity. This is the first time, says Mr Tony Clark, secretary of the Port Development Board, that Hong Kong will fail to meet its targets. Moreover, it can no longer rely on mid-stream business to carry things on. With the Hong Kong port handling around 600,000 TEUs (20ft equivalent units) a month, a year-on-year growth next year of 15 per cent would mean an extra 90,000 TEUs, or a third of total mid-stream business. Mr Dennis Bray, a consultant and former civil servant, notes that the key victim will be China trade: or, more specifically, south China trade, much of which is Hong Kong-funded. 'I think we are in for some really serious problems next summer,' he says. 'Once terminal and mid-stream operators see people queueing, they will jack up their prices, and only the expensive shipments will be able to afford it, not the cheap goods from China. 'But before that happens, there will be serious congestion, with ships hanging around the harbour at anchor, rather like a Third World port.' The ports being developed in China are not yet capable of handling the extra capacity. Nor does China yet have the trading infrastructure, in terms of processing and banking services, to allow big shipments to by-pass Hong Kong: and most such ships are loath to make two stops. 'If we get a typhoon next summer, when we cannot handle any boxes at all for a couple of days and the jams on the roads are so colossal, then I guess there will be some crisis action about providing more land (for existing terminals to expand). 'It's just a pity they cannot do this earlier, because there is going to be one almighty mess,' Mr Bray said.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Bank chief urges curb on deficit Mr Bernie Fraser, Australia's Reserve Bank governor, yesterday threw his weight behind a faster curtailment of the federal budget deficit, suggesting additional revenues generated by a sudden surge in economic growth be used for this purpose. He warned that a rise in interest rates could be required 'in due course', but added: 'The time to begin that adjustment is still some way off.' Mr Fraser said the government's goal of reducing the budget deficit to around 1 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97 was a useful benchmark. However, he added: 'Given the present outlook, the case is for doing more, rather than less. 'Calls to use any higher revenues flowing from a stronger economy, the so-called growth dividend, to boost spending, rather than reduce the deficit, are misguided in my view,' he said. Mr Fraser's comments come as the Labor government is drawing up its 1994-95 finance plans ahead of the May 10 budget. It has already come under pressure from its own rank and file, and from minor parties, to use any additional revenues to fund various social and infrastructure programmes, and to tackle the country's double-digit unemployment rate. Mr Fraser's comments, together with some much-as-expected balance of payments figures for February, helped steady the fast falling bond and equity markets yesterday, although both share and bond prices ended slightly lower. The balance of payments data showed a current account deficit of ADollars 1.256bn (Pounds 890m) last month, compared with a revised deficit of ADollars 1.233bn in January.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Relief and sadness abound in ICI's manufacturing heartland - The reaction on Teesside to news of the deal with Du Pont THE news of the ICI and Du Pont deal was met yesterday with a mixture of relief and sadness on Teesside, home to the highest concentration of ICI's manufacturing assets in the world. It is likely to secure many jobs in fibres which ICI might otherwise have abandoned and to add jobs through the acquisition of Du Pont's acrylics business world-wide. But sadness was expressed at the departure of fibres, a long standing business, from ICI's portfolio. Concern was also raised by workers that Du Pont will be less paternalistic an employer than ICI. While Du Pont's arrival diversifies ownership of Teesside's chemicals industry, the deal also underlines the continuing ebbing of ICI's profile in the area. It is still the dominant local employer, but with 11,000 on its present Teesside payroll it employs fewer than half the number it did before the 1979-'82 recession. Mr Sandy Anderson, general manager of ICI's Teesside operations, was bullish about the agreement yesterday, saying that it would enhance prospects for both businesses, ensure a secure future for their employees and broaden Teesside's employment base. Mr Anderson was 'very confident' about the prospects of ICI's Fibres employees on Teesside retaining their jobs under Du Pont. The deal was also good news for the 500 employed at Billingham by ICI Acrylics. Mr David Walsh, chairman of the development committee of Labour-controlled Cleveland County Council, said there was some sadness among the workforce and the general public, that ICI was pulling out of a business long regarded as a cornerstone of its operations in the area. Workers leaving the Wilton complex near Middlesbrough early yesterday afternoon had heard about the deal during the morning. Fitters mate Mr Alan Taylor summed up the mood of many, saying: 'On balance, it has to be the best thing, as long as the nylon plant is kept open. It's better for us - ICI was going to shut down. It didn't have a future without Du Pont taking it over.' About 650 people work in the nylons production area at Wilton, on the southern side of the river Tees. A further 100 work across the river at ICI Fibres' engineering plastics section in Billingham. However, linked to yesterday's announcement was confirmation of ICI's intention to close its adiponitrile (ADN) plant - part of its nylons area at Wilton - with the loss of 120 jobs. A further 50 jobs will go from the site's support services section. This means that the total number of ICI Teesside employees transferring to Du Pont will be about 580. Also to be transferred are the 85 employees at Workington, Cumbria, making non-woven material under the Camtex banner, along with fibre production staff and sites at Pontypool, Doncaster, and Gloucester in the UK and employees and assets at Oestringen in Germany and Rozenburg in the Netherlands. ICI's former fibres head-quarters building at Harrogate is not included in the deal; it is on the market for sale. ICI Fibres has 6,100 employees in total, of whom 3,600 are in the UK. The first nylons development at Wilton was in 1957. Mr Wayne Barnacal, the nylons area production manager, said ICI had invested Pounds 40m there in the last five years, including about Pounds 5m on environmental improvements. The ADN plant is being closed because of its old technology. The six nylons plants at Wilton to be transferred to Du Pont would be the sub-ject of spending of 'some millions' of pounds, 'in double figures', over the next five years to meet rising environmental standards. Mr Anderson insisted that the nylons area at Wilton was important to Du Pont. 'They aren't taking over the nylons business at Wilton to shut it down,' he said. 'Having Du Pont in Teesside and committed long term to that global business has got to be good. They obviously recognise in the quality of the assets what Teesside has to offer, and much more importantly the people.'</p>

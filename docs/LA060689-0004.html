			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A judge in New York City set high bail for a teen-ager indicted in the gang  rape of a jogger after Assistant Manhattan Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Lederer  revealed that other suspects accused him of going "wild on her," punching her  in the face and stomach and raping her. Bail for the 14-year-old was set at  $250,000 bond or $25,000 cash at the close of a dramatic hearing before Justice  Thomas Galligan at state Supreme Court in Manhattan. The Harlem teen-ager's  attorney, who had asked for $15,000 cash to secure a $50,000 bond, said the  boy's parents -- a postal worker and a stroke victim -- would never be able to  raise the heavier bail.  </P></p>

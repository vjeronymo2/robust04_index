			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin article: "Elections to Local Organs of </F> Power: For Whom Will We Vote This Time"]    [Text] Last week the Federal Assembly State Duma  determined its attitude toward elections to representative  organs in Federation components and organs of local  self-government. It was acknowledged that not everything is  going smoothly and within the framework of the Constitution, and  so the president was asked to take steps "to eliminate the  breaches of citizens' electoral rights and the rights of local  self-government committed in the legal acts of Russian  Federation components."    What is at issue here? An explanatory note circulated among  deputies says in particular that "on the whole the elections in  the regions are rapidly gaining momentum." However, I would  remind you that each region has set the date of its ballot  autonomously. According to the president's edict of 26 October  1993, June is the deadline for the elections, and 64 regions  have decided to hold their elections in March. Karelia,  Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Chukotka are voting in April, while  Dagestan, Chelyabinsk and Saratov Oblasts, and Krasnodar Kray  are doing so in July [month as published]. And several regions  (Adygea, Bashkortostan, Buryatia, Kalmykia, Komi, Tatarstan, and  Khakassia) have still not made up their mind about elections.    But the range of dates is not the most terrible sin  committed  by the Federation components. Parliamentary lawyers have  observed constitutional violations with regard to citizens'  rights to equal representation in organs of state power (in  Krasnodar Kray and Tver and Perm Oblasts), the restriction of  the electoral rights of certain groups of citizens in St.  Petersburg, the removal of elections from public control (in  most regions), and other unofficial constitutional "amendments."    As expected, there have been doubts in some areas as to the  advisability of servicemen on compulsory service voting (in St.  Petersburg and Murmansk Oblast). The logic here is as follows:  Why should someone temporarily living in our area interfere in  local affairs? And there is also the unvoiced but real idea  that in certain circumstances the disciplined military  electorate will be able to supply a sizable influx of votes to  the candidate who appeals to...the command. The desire to  exclude as many servicemen as possible from the elections is due  also to democrat leaders' fear that the Army will vote for  representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and  the Communists. The well known saying that "one-third of the  Armed Forces voted for Zhirinovskiy" -- although repeatedly  debunked by specialists who have specific figures at their  disposal and, most importantly, study the Army on a professional  basis -- still features in publications, surfaces at political  rallies, and alarms the timid section of the Russian public.  Leaving aside the citizen's unconditional right to hold any  beliefs and express them in elections, let us not nonetheless  denigrate the Army by reducing its natural diversity of thinking  to a common denominator. The processes of analyzing and  reanalyzing reality are just as complex in the Armed Forces  today as they are throughout society. Attempts to "bar" the  Army from the ballot box only reveal the frailty of the local  authorities, who rely not on the might of their prestige among  the people, but solely on the force of administrative levers.  And, finally, one last point: Since we have decided to love the  Constitution this time, let us remember Article 32, which speaks  without any reservation about the Russian citizen's right to  elect and be elected to organs of state power.    As for draft service, there may in the future be grounds  for studying the experience of certain countries where a  servicemen taken away from home for a year or two is sent a  ballot paper from his native city (village) and thus  participates in creating local self-government bodies.    The following question is a rhetorical one: Does the Army  have its own interest in these elections? Any commander today  will confirm that his subordinates' lives and living conditions  depend to a considerable extent on how aware the local authority  is of army problems. Rayon-scale politics can mean that the  local population sees these "warriors" as spongers who also  occupy the best land. And the whole life support system of the  regiment, the division, etc., is obstructed with red tape,  chicanery, and demagoguery. Needless to say, the worst-case  scenarios come to mind. But even run-of-the-mill  "misunderstandings" between the command and the local  authorities over housing questions can completely ruin the lives  of the defenders of the Fatherland. Admittedly, to be fair, I  must point out that there are still more examples of the  military and the authorities living in harmony in the localities  than the opposite.    It cannot be denied that ideally the military should deal  with strictly military business, while the civilian authorities  should do all they can to ensure that the military lead a normal  life. And there would be no need for a regiment commander to  besiege self-government organs and keep vigil to see whether  they are not about to violate the interests of the several  hundred men in his charge. But things are not ideal at the  moment. And so a local citizen who is a true friend of the  Army, if not a military man, will invariably have servicemen's  vote. They have their own interests, they should have their own  man. I repeat, he can be a man of any profession at all, but  essentially someone who necessarily possesses one quality --  awareness of how much Russia needs a strong, determined,  self-confident Army today. And a stubborn organ of  self-government afflicted with primitive pacifism will quite  easily develop in a troop unit a cadging complex, a feeling of  being a poor relation. We must take care to ensure that this  does not happen now, when elections are taking place.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Angolan graduates from Cuban education centers last  week in Luanda celebrated a day of solidarity with Cuba on the  33d anniversary of the Playa Giron victory.    Victor Nataniel Narciso, vice president of the association  of  former Angolan students in Cuba, has urged the United States to  lift the economic and commercial blockade imposed on the island  for more than three decades. He said this blockade is the main  cause of the complex economic situation in Cuba.    A baseball game was played yesterday as part of the  celebration, between members of the Cuban diplomatic mission and  members of the Angolan association. This game is considered  historical as the first match of this nature played in Angola.</p>

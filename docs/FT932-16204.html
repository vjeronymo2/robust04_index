			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Council to appeal on pupil tests boycott WANDSWORTH COUNCIL is to renew its legal efforts to stop the boycott of school tests by union members opposed to the testing and assessment associated with the national curriculum. On Friday, the south London borough failed to win a High Court injunction banning a boycott of the tests by members of the NAS/UWT teachers' union. The judge ruled that the boycott was a legal trade dispute because it was wholly or mainly about teachers' workload and their hours and therefore about terms and conditions of employment. Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth Council, said yesterday that the council would appeal against the ruling. The hearing is expected to take place in the week beginning April 19. He said: 'If the boycott continues, parents will be left in the dark without the means to assess their child's progress against others of the same age and without the information on which to judge the performance of individual schools.' Mr John Patten, education secretary, will today attend his first major teacher conference since he took office when he addresses the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Cardiff. The ATL, which has so far stood back from boycotting the tests, will debate its stance on Thursday. But Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, has warned that the union may reverse its opposition to boycotts. The union's president, Mr Harry Isaac, yesterday opened the conference with a warning that teachers were being forced into industrial action by a combination of an overloaded national curriculum and flawed testing.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / GM sets US profit aims after turnround General Motors of the US, the world's largest vehicle maker, has set the target of achieving a net profit on its North American automotive oper-ations in 1994 after three years of heavy losses, Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said last night. GM, which still lags the financial performance of Ford and Chrysler, its domestic US rivals, had achieved an operating break-even on its North American automotive operations in 1993 before interest and tax, Mr Smith said. This represented a turnround of more than Dollars 10bn since 1991 and of Dollars 4.5bn in 1993 alone, Mr Smith told the Automotive News World Congress. Mr Smith, who became chief executive in November 1992 after a boardroom coup, warned that GM's North American production costs were still high and that the group's balance sheet was 'still too weak'. However, GM's Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations in Europe had remained 'significantly in the black', said Mr Rick Wagoner, GM finance director. GM Europe remained the most profitable volume carmaker in Europe last year, in contrast to the heavy losses suffered by its leading rivals including Volkswagen, Ford of Europe, Fiat and Peugeot Citroen. It is understood to have achieved a profit of Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m in 1993, in spite of a fall of around 15 per cent in west European new car sales. Mr Wagoner said that GM Europe had incurred substantial restructuring costs in 1993 to reduce its workforce and its financial performance should improve in 1994. He added that in North America GM had operated at 75-80 per cent of its capacity but was aiming to reach 100 per cent capacity utilisation by 1996 through continuing plant closures, already announced, and rising output. Mr Smith said that GM's top short-term priority for the past two years had been to 'stop the bleeding from its North American automotive operations through improved product quality, a big reduction of unprofitable sales to daily rental fleets with greater emphasis on retail sales, reduced costs and lean manufacturing'. The biggest cost reductions in the short-term - Dollars 4bn between the end of 1990 and the end of 1993 - had been achieved in purchasing, where 27 North American purchasing units were consolidated into one.</p>

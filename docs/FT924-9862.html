			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Scania signs joint venture for vehicle assembly in Poland SCANIA, the Swedish truck and bus maker, has signed a joint venture contract for the small volume assembly of vehicles in Poland. It has reached agreement with Kapena, a Polish company engaged in maintenance and repair of heavy buses and special vehicles, to assemble Scania vehicles at Slupsk, near the Baltic coast. Volvo, Scania's rival Swedish truck and bus maker, has signed an agreement with Jelcz, the Polish commercial vehicle maker, to assemble articulated buses for use in city traffic based on Volvo components. Production of Scania vehicles in Poland is planned to begin next spring with the assembly of kits supplied from its Swedish plants. Output is set to start at 200 units a year but could be increased according to local demand. Scania said the project also called for gradual integration of Polish-made components. It established an importer/distributor, Eurowax, in Gdansk last year, which is responsible for establishing after-sales facilities in Poland. The Capena deal is the first move into local assembly in eastern Europe by Scania, one of the world's leading heavy truck makers. Volvo will transfer technical documentation to Jelcz and provide technical aid to allow gradual inclusion of locally-made components. Initial output by Jelcz, Poland's biggest maker of heavy-duty trucks and buses, will concentrate on articulated buses, with the aim of selling about 100 vehicles in Poland in 1993; The products range may be expanded later. The bus chassis for assembly in Poland will come from Volvo, the body from Steyr Bus, its Austrian subsidiary. The Jelcz pact allows for exports of Jelcz-made buses to parts of the former Soviet Union. MAN, the German truck maker, has signed a letter of intent with Raba, the Hungarian engineering company, and Mogurt, the trading company, to co-operate in assembly of trucks in Hungary. The aim is for MAN to deliver diesel engines and truck cabs to Raba, chiefly for all-wheel drive vehicles exclusively for the Hungarian market.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTS PHILANTHROPIST WILLIAM ALEXANDER RECEIVES BY GIVING  </P> <P> William Alexander may be a millionaire, but he lives in a small house in the  Hollywood Hills, drives an old Toyota station wagon and wears simple clothes.  "I don't care for gilded luxuries," said the sprightly 81-year-old. "They don't  do anything for me."  </P> <P> His life is filled with other riches, for he is Los Angeles' patron-of-the-arts  extraordinaire -- a man who for 20 years has donated hundreds of thousands of  dollars as well as countless hours to arts groups. This year alone he has  provided more than $250,000 to the arts.  </P> <P> Name an arts organization in this city and Alexander is involved in it. From  the Friends of USC School of Music to the American Youth Symphony to the Los  Angeles Mozart Orchestra to the Craft and Folk Art Museum and the Thai Arts  Council, the list goes on.  </P> <P> He doesn't like the word giving to describe what he does; it sounds too  one-sided. "I'd rather call it personalized sharing," he said. "All the  leftovers keep me rich -- the vibrations I get from the people and the music  and art they create."  </P> <P> Usually he is an unsung hero, and he likes it that way. In part, because the  retired architect made his fortune on the advice of his lawyer, friend and arts  patron, the late Sheldon Andelson, who advised him to riches in real estate.  </P> <P> "I never worked for the money, you see," Alexander said, so he doesn't like to  be recognized for it.  </P> <P> But this month, Alexander was honored at a fund-raiser for the America Israel  Cultural Foundation, a group devoted to supporting the arts in Israel, at the  UCLA Faculty Center. Alexander is an active member of the foundation, and  through it he has set up an annual $25,000 scholarship for promising Israeli  artists. The reception featured a program by Orli Shaham, a 13-year-old pianist  from Israel.  </P> <P> More than 200 people crowded the room to pay tribute to their friend Alexander.  In addition to receiving honors from the cultural group, Alexander was  presented with a certificate from Mayor Tom Bradley to commend him for his  service and for "enriching of the city of Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Alexander, overcome with emotion, could barely speak when he accepted the  accolades. Yet, in his typically understated manner, Alexander played down the  tribute. "I really don't care about getting compliments; I enjoyed the concert  more than the words about me," he said later.  </P> <P> Although Alexander is hesitant to sing of his own accomplishments, his friends  in the art world, such as Gordon Davidson, Ernest Fleischmann, Bella Lewitzky  and Jane Fonda, bubble with praise at the mention of his name.  </P> <P> Gordon Davidson, executive director of the Mark Taper Forum, said that the  great thing about Alexander is that he doesn't give to see his name on a plaque  on the wall. "He doesn't do it for ego, or for self-aggrandizement at all, but  because he has a true generosity of spirit.  </P> <P> "He's one of these people who, when I look out into an audience at whatever  cultural event, he's always there," Davidson added.  </P> <P> Alexander's contributions do not end with dollars. He's eager to lend a helping  hand wherever it's needed, whether it's letting a struggling artist live in his  own home, pouring drinks at a reception or mopping the floor.  </P> <P> Alexander sounds too good to be true. The energetic octogenarian, with a halo  of red hair and dancing blue eyes, truly is the guardian angel of arts and  culture in Los Angeles. "I'm not very good at saying no to an arts group," he  said.  </P> <P> Indeed, Alexander's help is not unappreciated. Plaques and certificates clutter  his study, and there are piles of thank-you notes, to which Alexander doesn't  pay much attention. "I don't wait for thanks, I don't care about thanks. I just  go on to the next thing."  </P> <P> Alexander has been good at making things happen throughout his charmed life. At  26, he designed the noted Hangover House in Laguna Beach for Richard  Halliburton, the romantic adventurer and writer of the '30s who was lost at  sea.  </P> <P> In another chapter of his life, Alexander ran a shop called the Mart on Santa  Monica Boulevard. In the early '50s, he opened the mart to sell crafts from  local artists and folk art from around the world.  </P> <P> A Renaissance man, Alexander knows seven languages and has traveled the world.  He admits his experiences in life have given him a unique vision. "I am  forward-looking -- I am able to see what works."  </P> <P> Because he looks to the future, he concentrates on nurturing youth by giving to  programs like UCLA's Design for Sharing, which exposes inner-city youths to the  fine arts. But he does not neglect the past; in his work with the Arnold  Schoenberg Institute at USC, he is dedicated to preserving the works of the  composer, who was also a personal friend.  </P> <P> Modern, yes. But Alexander would rather be known as a classic. "A classic," he  paused, relishing the word. "That's how I want to be remembered."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Sections 380.32(s), 380.33(a)(5) and 380.33(e) state that if Super Bowl game tickets are not supplied when promised, the affected participant must be sent a refund of the price of the entire charter package within 14 days after the return flight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These rules came about following problems with game tickets for Super Bowl tours in the late 1970's (see 45 FR 1856, January 9, 1980). The rules were limited to the Super Bowl because that was the only event where such problems had surfaced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the Super Bowl rules in Part 380, the Department has a policy statement at 14 CFR 399.87 which states that it shall be an unfair or deceptive practice within the meaning of section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act (now 49 U.S.C. 41712) to advertise or sell an air tour that is promoted as including a ticket to the Super Bowl game unless the operator has tickets or contracts for tickets in the manner described in 14 CFR 380.18a (see above). The principal purpose of this policy statement is to reach tours operated on scheduled air service, which are not covered by the part 380 charter rules. The part 399 policy statement mirrors &sect;380.18a, but does not include the other part 380 provisions described above. Most importantly, it does not include the requirement that the entire tour price be refunded if a game ticket is not provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 27, 1994, the Department issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding (published February 1, 1994; 59 FR 4614). In this notice, we stated that we were tentatively proposing to issue a new rule that would contain the procedures of the Super Bowl provisions of both part 380and part 399, and to extend this rule to other types of events. Like current &sect;399.87, the new rule would apply to tours on all forms of air transportation, not just charters. Like the existing Super Bowl charter rules in part 380, the new regulation would require the tour operator to refund the entire tour price to any participant who does not receive a promised event ticket, even if the tour were not on a charter. The proposed rule would also pick up the procedures of &sect;380.31(c) of the charter rule, which requires an operator to refund any money received for a booking within 3 days if the operator has no contract for an event ticket for that person, unless the person has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks a ticket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to setting out the Department's tentative rulemaking proposal, the January ANPRM asked commenters to address a number of questions about the types of issues that such a rule should apply to. The discussion of the comments that appears below is organized according to those questions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received comments from 11 organizations and 7 individuals. The great majority of the comments favored adoption of a rule in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Q. Should the rule apply only to major sports events which would be listed in the rule (for example, the Super Bowl, college bowl games, the NCAA Final Four, the World Cup finals, the Olympics)? To any sports event? To religious events (for instance, the Passion Play in Oberammergau)? To any event?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several of the comments discussed only sports events as the context for the rule. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) recommended applying the rule to the Division I Final Four men's and women's basketball championships, the College World Series, and post-season college football bowl games. The Football Bowl Association (FBA), an organization representing all 19 post-season college football bowl games, also felt that all post-season football bowl games should be covered, and stated that it offered no comment on whether other events should or should not be covered. The National Hockey League (NHL) commented that the rule should apply to all major professional and amateur sports events. Ms. Sara Shea said that the Super Bowl rule should be expanded to include other special sporting events. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Wisconsin Attorney General stated that the rule should not be limited to specifically named events, but perhaps could be limited to ``competitive events'' where participants and locations are determined close to the date of the event. He said that for non-competitive events such as the Passion Play in Oberammergau, the dates, locations and participants are known well in advance and existing consumer protections should be adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters stated that the rule should not be limited to sports events. The American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) said that it should apply to all events where a separately-purchased ticket is necessary for admission to the event. The RG Travel Companies, which were involved in sending 1,700 Wisconsin fans to the 1994 Rose Bowl, stated that the rule should cover any special event ``where a good possibility exists that the demand for tickets will exceed the supply&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' In a similar vein, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses commented that the rule should apply to any event with limited admission. The National Tour Association (NTA, representing motor coach tour operators) and Congressman Robert Andrews of New Jersey expressed the opinion that the rule should not be limited to sports events. Ms. Arlene Caldwell said that the rule should cover any tour that claims to include a ticket to the event, and Mr. Donald Hamilton stated that it should apply to any event for which tour packages are sold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Should the rule apply to both charter and scheduled transportation? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the commenters that expressed an opinion on this point felt that the rule should apply to both scheduled and charter air transportation. Those commenters were the RG Travel Companies, NACA, the NHL, ASTA, the NCAA, FBA, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, and the Wisconsin Attorney General. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Should the rule contain only the advertising and sale restrictions of &sect;&sect;380.18a and 399.87 (of the current Super Bowl rule), or should it also contain the ``money back guarantee'' of &sect;&sect;380.32 and 380.33 and/or the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures of &sect;380.31(c)? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 380.18a and 399.87 prohibit advertising or sale of a ``Super Bowl tour'' (defined as one which is held out as including a ticket to the Super Bowl game) until the operator has physical possession of game tickets or has a contract with the National Football League, with an NFL team, or with another person who has a contract with the league or a team. Sections 380.32 and 380.33 state that any participant on a Super Bowl tour who does not receive promised game tickets must be given a refund of the entire tour price, even if a portion of the services are used. Section 380.31(c) provides that if an operator receives a booking for which he or she does not have possession of or a contract for a game ticket, the operator must return that participant's money within 3 days, unless the participant has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks additional tickets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for NTA, all commenters that expressed a position on this question felt that some form of regulation along these lines was appropriate. NTA stated that the majority of its members that responded to a poll on this matter felt that regulation of special-event tours should not be a responsibility of the government, but the association said that in the event a rule is adopted it favors the ``booking rejection'' and''contingent booking'' procedures of &sect;380.31(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

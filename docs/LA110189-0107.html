			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> VENTILATION SYSTEM EXTINGUISHES BLAZE  </P> <P> Orange County fire officials credited a properly working ventilation system at  an Irvine manufacturing plant for the rapid control of a fire early Tuesday  that broke out in equipment to control air pollution.  </P> <P> Hazardous-materials specialists were called to Holt Integrated Circuits on  Jeronimo Road in Irvine because the company uses acids and other potent  chemicals. The fire was confined and put out after it broke out about 4:30 a.m.  without endangering the chemicals.  </P> <P> Mike Garner, vice president of the company, said the fire was confined to a  device on the roof that screens out manufacturing gases before they are  released into the atmosphere. He said the hazardous chemicals are stored in a  different part of the building.  </P></p>

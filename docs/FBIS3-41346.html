			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fernando Rospigliosi from the "Controversies" </F> page: "`Vaticano' and the Military"]    [Text] The arrest of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez, aka  "Vaticano", seems to confirm what some have feared: the  involvement of the military--and not only those of lower  ranks--with drug trafficking and the existence of corruption  within the Armed Forces. Several factors point to this.    First, there is the testimony of Major Evaristo Castillo  Aste  that was published in CARETAS issue No. 1295 and then by other  media. He gave a precise, detailed, and brave account of the  military's relationship with drug trafficking.    The fact is that Maj. Castillo's charges not only link  subordinate officers to drug trafficking. He mentioned the  names of generals who, through action or omission, may be  linked: General Eduardo Bellido, head of the Huallaga front for  two years; Interior Minister Juan Briones; and Army Commander  General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza.    There is also the version of another Army officer published  in the same issue. This information confirms many other similar  reports.    Second, "Vaticano" was labeled as a narcoterrorist and was  placed under the military court. Why should a military court  judge a drug trafficker? Didn't [President Alberto] Fujimori  reorganize the judicial branch and issue all the laws he wished?  Why can't the new judicial branch judge "Vaticano"?    This strange behavior leads to the belief that they do not  want "Vaticano" to talk. If he is tried by a military court,  the trial will be secret. Nobody will know what the drug  trafficker said. There will be no point in him telling the  military about his contact with other military from whom they  receive orders.    Moreover, by keeping him under military control they can  negotiate with "Vaticano", without the people knowing about it  as they have done--and continue to do--with Abimael Guzman and  the terrorist leadership.    Another query that arises immediately from labeling  "Vaticano" as a narcoterrorist is that if he only dealt with  other terrorists and not with the military, where is the fortune  the terrorists amassed? This raises another theory mentioned a  few weeks ago by this column: the money that the Shining Path  leadership keeps abroad is probably part of the negotiation  between Abimael Guzman, Fujimori, and Montesinos.    When jounalists recently ago asked Fujimori about Guzman's  money, he replied: "I don't know." Why? Didn't he have the  world's best intelligence service? Doesn't he control 95 percent  of the Shining Path leaders? Have the tens of millions of  Shining Path dollars vanished?    Third, Fujimori, General Hermoza, and Dinandro [the National  Police Antidrug Directorate] have refused to admit that there is  one single authority, either civil or military, who is involved  with "Vaticano."    This refusal is totally unbelievable. If Fujimori, Hermoza,  and Dinandro had admitted the links between "Vaticano" and some  of the military, and if they had begun impartial investigations  within the regular jurisdiction, they could have been given some  credibility.    Fourth, the distracting maneuver with the artists, which was  so obvious and unintelligent, makes it clear that there is an  attempt to conceal something. Otherwise, what is the explanation  for this plot that was personally initiated by the president and  that has led nowhere?    The implications of the links between drug trafficking and  the Armed Forces are dramatic. Corruption in other institutions  can create many problems. If the police, customs offices, or the  judicial branch are corroded by this disease, the problem is  serious. But if the Armed Forces contract the disease, the  situation is much worse, for several reasons.    One is that the military play a decisive role in the  government, especially since 5 April 1992.    Another reason is that they enjoy a privileged status within  society, like having their own jurisdiction for trials of  military men, even in cases of common crimes. No institution can  make a serious investigation into the military: neither  congress, nor the police, nor the judicial branch.    Still another reason is the power of arms, which can be  illegally used with much impunity, as was disclosed by General  Rodolfo Robles, who referred to the "gang of henchmen" made up  of military men.    If drug trafficking, or another form of corruption, reaches  a  deep level within the Armed Forces, affecting the command level,  there could be political complications that could produce long  authoritarian government terms and/or very costly damage to the  country. This occurred in Bolivia with General Garcia Meza, in  Paraguay with Stroessner, in Panama with Manuel Antonio Noriega,  and it is currently happening in Haiti.    Yet, unlike Panama, Peru does not have a strategically  important canal, and no one will come here to take away a  corrupt military man. We will have to solve the problem  ourselves. Honest Armed Forces officers have a great  responsibility in this task.</p>

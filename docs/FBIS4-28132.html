			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Past Crimes Cannot Be Hushed Up" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government  recently "offered" to found a "fund" different from  compensations and solve the criminal case of Japan in drafting  "comfort women for the army" through it.    Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says:    This shows that the Japanese Government is intending to  avoid  a full-scale inquiry into the case and adequate compensations  for it and to hush up the heinous crimes of the past in a crafty  manner.    The crimes committed in drafting "comfort women", a grave  human rights abuse, are not a matter which can be solved merely  by establishing a "fund".    When the former "comfort women" demanded compensations, they  did not mean a few amount of money. Their demand is that the  Japanese Government should make a full investigation into the  Japanese imperialists' brutalities in the past and make a  sincere apology for them and make adequate compensations as a  material token of their will not to repeat such past. Whatever  amount of money the Japanese Government may pay them, it can  never wipe off the disgrace and heal the wounds of their past  sufferings.    Nevertheless, the Japanese Government authorities are going  to put a show of solving the criminal case through the  establishment of a "fund". This only reveals their brazen-faced  nature, and it is an insult to the victimized "comfort women"  and survivors.    The Japanese Government can never evade a judgement by  history. The Japanese authorities must know this clearly and  behave properly.</p>

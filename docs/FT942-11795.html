			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Superfailure may yet be a success: Efforts are being made to reform the US Superfund toxic waste clean-up scheme Government, business and environmentalists yesterday seized what may be their last chance to reform the controversial Superfund law on toxic waste dumps, striking a deal on a compromise set of proposals that could become law in the US as early as this autumn. 'We've reached a delicate consensus,' said Senator Frank Lautenberg, chairman of a Senate committee on Superfund, after a day of meetings at the White House. Proposals from the Clinton administration seek to distribute the costs of dealing with toxic waste sites fairly among the polluters, to cut the money spent on lawyers and to increase the amount spent on actually cleaning up. But the contaminated land issue is so controversial that any one of many interested parties - chemicals companies, insurers, local governments, environmentalists - could torpedo a bill. Congressional leaders have thus been unwilling to press ahead until they achieved consensus. The effects of Superfund's faults, however, have been felt in insurance markets worldwide; adding, for instance, to the travails of Lloyd's of London. The Superfund programme has been dogged by problems of cost since it was set up in 1980 and revised in 1986, despite resulting in the clean-up of at least 220 toxic sites on a national priority list of 1,300. 'Despite the creation of a multi-billion-dollar public works programme and an awesome new overarching approach to hazardous waste liability, the Superfund solution has become an implementation nightmare,' according to to Professor Daniel Mazmanian, a professor of political science at California's Claremont Graduate School, and Mr David Morell, head of Epics International, a regulatory consultancy, in their book Beyond Superfailure. Two issues remain fraught: first, what exactly should be done about the chemical and mineral wastes that have for decades been freely dumped without concern for their health and environmental consequences? Second, who should pay? Existing Superfund law is vague on the first question. Neither in 1980 nor in 1986 was Congress able to establish how clean a cleaned site should be. National standards for acceptable levels of contamination have proved difficult to define without unnecessarily tying the hands of the government's Environmental Protection Agency administrators, in charge of drawing up a clean-up plan at each site. Cleanliness is defined in the law not by substance but by process: were the right parties consulted and the right procedures followed in drawing up the plan? On the second question of who should pay, by contrast, Superfund law is excessively clear. Liability for the costs of a Superfund clean-up is legally defined as strict, retroactive, joint and several: anyone who contributed in any way to contamination - the operator of a dump, the landowner, the companies that sent waste there, even the road hauliers - can be held liable for the entire cost. In 1979, estimates showed a national clean-up, taking many decades, would cost between Dollars 26.2bn and Dollars 44.1bn - and the latest assessment from the Congressional Budget Office puts the bill to the public and private sectors at Dollars 230bn in inflation-adjusted dollars. But the original Superfund contained only Dollars 1.6bn, so the government's EPA has every incentive to apply joint and several liability ferociously, in order to find someone other than the fund to pay. Industry, however, has every incentive to fight back, sue other polluters for a share of the costs, and to argue with insurers over every penny. For instance, ICI Americas, US offshoot of the British chemicals group and one of the 'deep pocket' polluters initially targeted by the EPA to pay for clean-up of Delaware's Tybouts Corner landfill, sent a 30-page questionnaire to every manufacturer within 100 miles of Tybouts in its search for other polluters. Litigation dragged on from 1980 until 1989 before agreement was reached on sharing out costs of the clean-up. Thus the result of both the vagueness and the clarity has been endless litigation. Developers, meanwhile, shy away from once-used land for fear of some future liability. 'Many claim that prospective owners who want to develop property have an economic incentive to use undeveloped, or green field, sites to avoid potential Superfund liability, thereby contributing to suburban sprawl and exacerbating chronic unemployment often found in inner-city industrial areas,' according to Ms Carol Browner, head of the EPA. Many flaws in the Superfund legislation are rooted in its creation. The first law was passed in December 1980, as Congress rushed to complete legislation before President-elect Ronald Reagan, committed to rolling back the regulatory burden on industry, took office. Mr Reagan's EPA proved unwilling to pursue polluters vigorously and unable, in a period of tight budgets for all but defence, to spend much money on clean-ups. So in 1986 Congress took fresh aim with the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorisation Act (Sara). Although Sara took modest steps to reduce application of strict, joint and several liability by providing limited incentives for everyone to settle early on fair distribution of costs, it did not get much closer to determining how clean is clean. The proposals outlined in February by Ms Browner aim to clarify the issue. They would establish in law national goals, as yet not spelled out, for health protection, and follow these up with regulations to set national levels of permissible contamination for the most common chemicals. They would also provide flexibility by linking the standard for a particular site to its future use. 'If the community decides that a contaminated site is going to be used for an industrial plant, we might not need to clean it up to the same level as we would for a school,' Ms Browner said. The administration bill would not reverse strict, joint and several liability, but would exempt those responsible for very small amounts of waste; it would seek to reduce litigation through a voluntary process under which an independent expert would decide on fair allocation of costs to polluters who agreed to take part. The Clinton administration originally proposed a new fund financed by a levy on insurers starting at Dollars 500m a year to help settle insurance claims on waste dumped before 1986, when Sara was passed. But insurance and chemical companies have agreed a somewhat different arrangement that has won government approval, if not yet formal endorsement. It differs from the administration proposal in the degree of acceptance a clean-up plan must have before the fund could start to pay out. With no dispute that Superfund badly needs reform, the process has so far been different in spirit from previous attempts to legislate on toxic waste clean-ups. The debate is not overshadowed by congressional distrust of the administration, and the administration has sought out everyone involved in an attempt to build consensus - though it has not yet achieved unanimity. Ms Browner's proposals draw heavily on similar reports produced by an EPA working party with public and private sector representatives. An independent National Commission on Superfund, bringing together industrialists, insurers, environmentalists, state and local governments and community groups, worked towards very similar conclusions. That may be the lesson of Superfund's superfailures: the secret of dealing with toxic wastes lies less in detailed contamination remedies or precise cost allocation formulae than in the process by which a nation reaches agreement on the balance between economic and environmental values.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan June 28 TASS -- Russian presidential envoy  to Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir Kazimirov is leaving Baku for  Ankara on Tuesday to hold talks with Turkish authorities on the  disputed enclave.    Speaking in Yerevan on Monday Kazimirov said that the talks  "are routine consultations which have no sensations or special  turns".    The envoy rejected the idea that contacts with Turkey and  Iran "create a new format for talks in the regional aspect". He  said his recent trip to Tehran and the upcoming visit to Ankara  are made in return to the talks of diplomats of the two  countries recently held in Moscow.    Kazimirov recalled that combat activities had been held  right  on the Iranian border with Azerbaijan going along the Arax  river. He said this was a "very aggravating circumstance" which  can make the conflict spread to other countries. "that is why  the position of iran is an important factor and we take it into  consideration", the envoy stressed.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Court action likely after Names reject Pounds 900m offer Lloyd's Names on the lossmaking Gooda Walker syndicates yesterday voted by a margin of five to one to reject a Pounds 900m settlement offer, dealing a blow to the insurance market's efforts to settle their legal action outside the courts. More than 22,000 Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - have until the middle of next month to accept or reject the deal announced last month by Lloyd's. But it now seems highly unlikely that Lloyd's will achieve its target of persuading 70 per cent of Names - by value of the offer - to accept. The 3,000 members of the Gooda Walker Action Group - Gooda Names taking legal action - stood to receive Pounds 220m, 24.4 per cent of the total compensation on offer, had they accepted. 'We will continue litigation in a determined fashion,' said Mr Michael Deeny, the action group's chairman. He predicted that legal action would produce significantly more than the proposed settlement, which is worth only about 38p in the pound for Gooda Names, and which contained 'deeply unsatisfactory conditions'. These included the absence of any provision for 'deterioration' - further claims against the syndicates which for action-group members could add Pounds 185m to existing losses of Pounds 580m - and the fact that the settlement would be paid in the form of credits rather than in cash. A total of 1,563 group members voted against the offer, with 300 voting for and five abstentions. As a result all members of the action group are expected to reject the offer. More than 4,000 Names were members of seven Gooda Walker syndicates, whose total losses could eventually reach more than Pounds 1.1bn. Last week a second large group of lossmaking Names, those on Merrett syndicate 418 in 1985, indicated they would reject the offer, while a third large group, the Feltrim Names, is expected to vote down the offer when they meet on Friday. At least three of the Gooda Walker and two Feltrim syndicates specialised in so-called 'spiral' reinsurance, in which Lloyd's syndicates and insurance companies reinsured each others' high-level catastrophe exposures. The Gooda Names' legal case alleging negligence by Lloyd's agents is set to come to court on April 26. Mr Philip Rocher, of Wilde Sapte, the solicitors handling the group's action, said he expected a decision from the court by next autumn and an appeal to be heard before the end of 1995. Sir Derek Spencer, the solicitor-general, assured the Commons yesterday that allegations of dishonesty in the Lloyd's insurance market would be rigorously pursued by the regulatory authority and the prosecuting authorities, Ivor Owen writes. The Serious Fraud Office was pursuing two cases, and the Crown Prosecution Service one case, he said.</p>

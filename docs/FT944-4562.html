			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: Danish warning on inflation Denmark's Economic Council, a panel of independent academic advisers to the government, yesterday estimated that consumer prices will rise 2.7 per cent in 1995 and 3.0 per cent in 1996, from 1.8 per cent this year. It also forecast a rise in GDP of 3.5 per cent in 1995 and 3.2 per cent in 1996. It expected private consumption to rise by 7.7 per cent this year, 5.5 per cent in 1995, and 4.6 per cent in 1996. The 'wisemen's council' said that rises in wage costs would be the main source of inflationary pressures on the economy in 1995 and 1996. The council's growth and inflation forecasts are at the upper end of economists' estimates. The council warned that 'if wage costs rise more sharply than expected it will be necessary to implement fiscal policy tightening in order to maintain competitiveness and interest rate levels'. The council said that even if growth were lower than expected, the government should tighten fiscal policy by 1996 in order to sustain the recovery.</p>

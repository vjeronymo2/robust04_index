			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Bank at the heart of the new Europe: Ron Freeman, first vice president of the EBRD, responds to criticism of the institution's performance The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was established in May 1990 by 39 member countries (this is now 54), including the UK, and two international institutions, primarily to finance privatisation in eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union. To date the board has approved investment of more than Pounds 1.6bn (Ecu2bn) of the EBRD's own funds and we have raised an additional Pounds 6.3bn from third party lenders and investors for 88 projects. No other institution, public or private, has mobilised anything like these sums for eastern Europe. Headquartered in London, the bank also provides a unique opportunity for British industry to obtain 'local' financing for British investments and business development among the 300m consumers in the eastern European markets. Last month Prince Charles inaugurated our new headquarters in the Broadgate development in the City of London. We were gratified to be able to become the anchor tenant in this building at very attractive terms. Our presence in the Broadgate complex reinforces the City's standing as the heart of the European financial community. An article in the FT on March 29 confirmed that we had been able to fit out the interior of this building without detracting from the quality of the Broadgate complex. The article concluded that: 'The bank is indeed welcome in London as a crucial and inventive catalyst for the new Europe. If the creative atmosphere of culture and commerce, which is so evident in the new headquarters, is indicative of its approach to the rejuvenation of formerly communist Europe then the future in the east will be bright.' Therefore, it was with decidedly mixed emotions that we read in the FT on April 13, rapidly followed by other national papers, that we spent too much money on ourselves, not enough on central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and were too slow in disbursing funds. On the one hand, we recognise such press attacks as a feature of life today, as the BBC, the Bank of England, the government, and even the Crown can confirm. As such my immediate reaction was to view this assault as a wry form of acknowledgement that the EBRD had joined the UK establishment. However, as a public institution it is our responsibility to set the record straight on a number of the criticisms we have had levelled at us over past few days. First, let me deal with the costs of establishing our headquarters at Broadgate. Before we committed to Broadgate, our advisers conducted athorough review of all accommodation options in London. Our intention throughout was to secure best value for money. We achieved this at Broadgate, agreeing terms for our building which were highly competitive. The building was finished to a 'shell and core' basis and needed then to be fitted out for occupation. The overall fitting out cost was Pounds 55.5m which we financed through a variety of sources: a contribution from the landlord of Pounds 9.5m; a 29-month rent-free period for the new headquarters granted by the landlord, saving the Bank Pounds 38.4m; a Pounds 250,000 contribution from the City of London and Pounds 7.95m which would have been spent on rent at our temporary accommodation at Leadenhall Street had the new building not been completed in record time. Tight cost and budgetary control was exercised throughout by us and the teams acting for us. In the event, the building was finished well ahead of time and to budget, at a cost per square foot which is fully comparable with other headquarters buildings in the City and indeed with other international institutions. Inevitably, there will be comment about some features of the building and whether some things could have been done differently or at lower cost. In overall terms, however, the approach which we adopted and the result which we achieved in establishing our new headquarters will stand up to objective scrutiny. We have ended up with a good building which suits our particular requirements as cost effectively as any other we have found in London. The second criticism was the level of funds we had disbursed to the countries of central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Compared with commitments made, the disbursement figure of Pounds 144m may seem rather limited. The reality is that disbursement of funds lags behind board approval deliberately and by our own bank rules. First, since the majority of our financing is for the private sector, state owners of entities we finance must be 'implementing' a programme of privatisation. For state sector financing, we must normally obtain sovereign guarantees. Either of these alternatives requires government action prior to our disbursement. Second, we co-finance nearly all our operations. This is consistent with our goal of multiplying the impact of our financing. As indicated above, our multiplier ratio is currently four to one, as the Pounds 1.6bn of EBRD project approvals is accompanied by Pounds 6.3bn of third party co-financing. To ensure this multiplier, we normally require that our co-financiers' money goes into the project before ours. Third, we must comply with international tender procedures in all our projects. And finally we only disburse our funds directly against invoices. These factors are all evidence of our caution. We are dealing with taxpayers' money. We carry out all our operations according to sound banking principles. As a result, disbursement takes time. I would rather be accused of caution in our disbursement process than of taking unnecessary risks with taxpayers' money. Notwithstanding, we have disbursed as fast as any other funds provider. Let us now look to the future. We have already committed substantial funds to projects in eastern Europe which will be disbursed as soon as the process allows. We have this week been asked by the G7 group of leading industrialised countries to establish a Dollars 300m fund with the specific aim of promoting small and medium-sized enterprises in the Russian Federation. We are also charged by the G7 with implementing a Nuclear Safety Fund, with a secretariat in the bank, which will allow the dangerous nuclear power plants in eastern Europe to be overhauled. Finally, we have launched 260 technical assistance projects with a total value of Pounds 52.7m, much of which is provided by British accounting, legal and consulting firms. Thus, we have not been either slow to disburse or slow in any other respect as our beneficiary countries have repeatedly confirmed. And, we are continually looking at new proposals. Next week, we hold our annual meeting in London. On this occasion we will welcome more than 2,500 foreign guests out of 3,000 participants representing both governments and business communities, to London. All will, I am sure, share with us our pride in the fast start we have made in carrying out our mission, the splendid staff we have assembled and the role we assume as the sole international institution headquartered in the UK. I anticipate that as a result of this meeting many new proposals will come to the bank. The bank provides a forum where investors from both eastern and western Europe can meet to finance investment opportunities in eastern Europe. I am confident that the UK business community will not be distracted by the misdirected focus of current press coverage, but will instead participate fully with us in the extraordinary opportunity presented by the greatest event of our times; the opening of the European continent.</p>

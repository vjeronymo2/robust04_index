			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Letter: Energy strategy can be environmentally realistic Sir, The result of trade and industry secretary Michael Heseltine's energy policy review could prove a setback for the environment as David Lascelles states ('The grimy face of coal, December 29). That certainly will be the case if a fudged, short-term fix is provided to placate the mining lobby in an attempt to restore government credibility. What is now clear is that 'market forces' are a poor guide to energy policy if environment protection is to be achieved. Burning more coal to accommodate the output of, say, a dozen saved pits means burning less 'clean' gas or switching out of nuclear power. This could lead to failure both to meet the European directive on acid gas release from power stations (which would be illegal), and to stabilise carbon dioxide production at the 1990 level by 2000, a commitment made by Mr John Major at the Rio Earth summit. A polluting sector equal in size to the electricity generation sector is transport, where any sort of energy/environment strategy is unpalatable, as public and politicians alike fear that the freedom to drive anywhere at any time is being infringed. A strategy of fiscal encouragement using market forces to achieve desired ends, such as a reduced tax on diesel fuel to encourage further penetration of highly fuel-efficient and clean diesel cars, would be a start. A move to efficient public transport systems is the next move. It is not difficult to map out a flexible energy strategy which will go a long way to meeting environmental imperatives. But this is possible only if the government abandons its dogmatic stance to privatise everything and instead harnesses market forces to achieve a realistic strategy rather than letting them take control.

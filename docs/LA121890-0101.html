			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL QUAKE STRIKES BIG BEAR AREA  </P> <P> A small earthquake jolted the Big Bear Lake area Monday morning, causing some  jitters but no damage or injuries.  </P> <P> The quake had a magnitude of 3.5 and struck at 9:44 a.m., said Katrin Douglas,  a researcher at the California Institute of Technology's Seismology Laboratory  in Pasadena.  </P> <P> The temblor was centered 16 miles northeast of San Bernardino in the mountains  below the lake, Douglas said.  </P> <P> The quake was apparently felt from Lake Arrowhead to Orange County, authorities  said. Bill Shackelford, a California Highway Patrol officer in Running Springs,  was close to the epicenter.  </P> <P> "We felt it all right," Shackelford said. "I was at my desk, writing reports. .  . . It was like an explosion, like a sonic boom right over our building. It  didn't last long, but it was powerful."  </P> <P> Shackelford said the CHP received about half a dozen calls from curious  residents, and other law enforcement agencies reported scattered inquiries.  Douglas said the quake did not appear related to any other temblor.  </P></p>

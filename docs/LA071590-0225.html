			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE STILLED VOICE THAT DROVE BEAT GENERATION IS HEARD AGAIN  </P> <P> Jan Kerouac only met her father twice. The last time, in 1967, she was an  adolescent; he was an alcoholic. She was longing to live; he was waiting to  die.  </P> <P> "I wish I had known him better," said Kerouac, now 38. "He could spout all  kinds of things on paper, but in person, he was non-communicative. He was  drinking out of a bottle of whiskey when I saw him, and he showed me artwork on  his wall. He didn't know what else to say."  </P> <P> Two years later, her father -- and the father of the Beat Generation, writer  Jack Kerouac, only 47, drank himself to death. Jan Kerouac would know the  legend, the books, the anecdotes -- never the man. Until today.  </P> <P> "It's almost like he's talking to me," said Jan Kerouac about the three-record  Jack Kerouac Collection, distributed by Rhino Records on its new spoken-word  label, Word Beat, and released in late June. "All these years later, I'm  meeting him."  </P> <P> The reunion was arranged by James Austin, Rhino's associate artists and  recording director, who spent two often discouraging years hunting for the lost  Kerouac recordings, and then acquiring ownership. The recordings, based on  Kerouac's books and poetry, were made in 1958 and 1959, but very few copies  were made. With the help of Kerouac contemporaries, such as poets Allen  Ginsberg and Michael McClure, and Kerouac fans, such as record producer Harvey  Kubernik, Austin put together a package revealing the writer's inexhaustible  zest for all life experiences.  </P> <P> In print, such exuberance was best manifested in "On the Road," the journey of  Kerouac and his best friend, Neal Cassady, who drifted from city to city in  search of life's heartbeat. On record, backed up by his favorite music, jazz  and blues, Kerouac's words roll out with a thundering urgency, with passion and  fire, as if there is no guarantee of tomorrow.  </P> <P> "I'd read this stuff," said the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia, whose comments  appear in a booklet accompanying the collection, "but I hadn't heard it -- the  cadences, the flow, the kind of endlessness of the prose, the way it just  poured off. It was really stunning to me. His way of perceiving the music and  the road, the romance of the American highway, it struck me. It struck a primal  chord."  </P> <P> The Kerouac influence has been well documented. Bob Dylan credits Kerouac with  turning him on to poetry. Ray Manzarek, The Doors' keyboardist, says the band  would never have formed if not for the father of the Beat Generation. "We were  fellow Beatniks," said Manzarek. "We wanted to live the life of freedom and  credibility that he represented. Morrison and I talked about him a lot."  </P> <P> After Kerouac's death in 1969, his torch didn't pass automatically to future  generations. He had stayed away from the political and social changes of the  1960s, which he had helped foster, and died almost in obscurity. Still, there  were die-hards who kept the flame flickering, reading his works, discussing his  message. Kubernik, who was producing other spoken-word albums in the late  1970s, recalls that the questions about Kerouac never went away.  </P> <P> "People wanted to know if Kerouac had made an album," Kubernik said. "I knew  there was a market out there for this."  </P> <P> Record executives didn't agree. When Kubernik, who was director of artists and  recording for MCA Records, first pitched the idea of a Kerouac release in 1979,  he was told a spoken-word album would have no marketability. "It was always  dismissed as some sort of Harvey hobby. I had to educate people as to who this  guy was."  </P> <P> Periodically, for almost a decade, Kubernik, after leaving MCA, approached  independent labels to see if there was any interest, but nobody made any  offers. At the same time, Austin experienced his own frustrations. In 1975 he  found that Kerouac had recorded albums, but couldn't locate any. "Everyone had  tapes, but no one had the original albums."  </P> <P> He joined Rhino Records in 1987, and, after launching other projects such as  the Roy Orbison anthology, he made his first bid for the Kerouac release. He  suggested a boxed set; Rhino executives agreed to one record. "At least they  wanted to do something."  </P> <P> Austin contacted Kubernik, head of BarkKubCo, a music and spoken-word  production house, and together, they began lining up Kerouac friends and  supporters. Austin was convinced that there was a market for the readings, and  soon got Rhino to agree to the three-record release. "The fact that everything  he wrote was still in print gave us the indication there was an audience out  there for him."  </P> <P> Still, he couldn't locate the original recordings, released by Hanover Records,  which had gone out of business. Eventually he discovered that Roulette Records  had possession of all Hanover material.  </P> <P> "I thought I had found the Holy Grail," Austin said. "All this time, there was  this cloud, and then it was suddenly lifted."  </P> <P> By coincidence, Rhino had just entered into negotiations to acquire the rights  to Roulette's non-jazz catalogue, which included the Kerouac collection; they  soon got it. Austin had secured the rights to two Kerouac albums, and got the  third from PolyGram.  </P> <P> Other Kerouac highlights, previously unreleased, such as his speech about the  Beat Generation at Brandeis University and his appearance on "The Steve Allen  Plymouth Show," were soon added to the three-record package. The set will cost  $49.98 on CD, and $39.98 on record and cassette. Rhino is issuing 3,000 copies  on CD, and 6,000 on both record and cassette.  </P> <P> Kerouac friends and followers believe the writer would be pleased with the new  release.  </P> <P> "He'd love it," said McClure. "He was truly one of the great readers. I don't  want to discount the page, but Jack lifted poetry from the page. It's the same  thing that happens with rock 'n' roll. You now have a dialogue between the  artist and the audience, and people can answer you back. He enjoyed the  interaction with the audience."  </P> <P> Gerald Nicosia, who wrote a Kerouac biography, "Memory Babe," said Kerouac  always predicted that he would become more famous after his death.  </P> <P> "I don't think he'd want to be at the publicity party," said Nicosia, "and if  he was, he'd be drunk at it."  </P> <P> Nicosia said Kerouac's life was full of contradictions; he showed people the  endless possibilities of adventure, of the ongoing search for answers on  America's highways, and yet, he endured so many years of misery.  </P> <P> "After 1957, there was almost no happiness in his life," Nicosia said, alluding  to Kerouac's life of failed expectations. "He wanted to be seen as a voice of  America, but instead was seen as a voice of juvenile delinquents, and that hurt  him a lot. He was so angry and bitter, he wanted to die. He couldn't take the  easy way, a bullet, because he was a Catholic. But he rationalized that it  wasn't a sin if he drank himself to death."  </P> <P> Still, Nicosia added, the Kerouac spirit that inspired so many youths in the  1950s and 1960s to chart new, exciting courses in their lives can have as much  relevance today. "It's a message that always needs to be heard, and that's why  it's great that this set has been released. Life is to be experienced, and you  can't just get it out of books or listen to what a teacher tells you."  </P> <P> Jan Kerouac certainly followed in her father's footsteps. She has spent much of  her life trailblazing across America and writing about it. She said that she  has probably traveled more than 10 times as many miles as her father. "I have  the same bug," she said. "I couldn't stop it." Her father's last words to her  in 1967 still ring clearly.  </P> <P> "I was 15, and pregnant, and on my way to Mexico," she said, "and he said, 'You  go to Mexico, and write a book about it, and you can use my name,' and that's  what I did. It was called 'Baby Driver.' That was the closest he ever came to  acknowledging that I was his daughter."  </P></p>

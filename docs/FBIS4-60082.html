			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 19 (AFP)--Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati will pay the first visit to Cairo by a senior Iranian  official since the 1979 Islamic revolution when he attends a  meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) later this month, the  TEHRAN TIMES said Thursday. Iran and Egypt broke ties after the  revolution and maintain diplomatic contact at interest section  level.    The paper said Velayati, who is due to leave for Cairo on  May  30, could meet his Egyptian counterpart 'Amr Musa, but they  "would not" discuss improving bilateral ties.    The Iranian minister will be accompanied by a high-level  political and economic delegation including a member of  parliament's foreign affairs subcommittee, Jalal Sadatian, the  English-language daily said.    Since the revolution Tehran has been represented at  international conferences in Cairo through low-ranking  officials. The two governments have on several occasions  expressed a desire to improve ties, but no breakthrough has yet  been made due to the opposition from Islamic hardliners in Iran.  The news of a meeting last September between Velayati and Musa  in the sidelines of UN General Assembly triggered criticism from  radicals.</p>

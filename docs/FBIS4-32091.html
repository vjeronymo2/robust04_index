			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "ajk"] </F>   [Text] Prague--Economic losses incurred by the Czech  Republic as a result of UN sanctions against the warring Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] exceed $290 million--that is, 8.7  billion Czech korunas [Kc]--states Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus  in his reply to an interpellation of Communist Party Deputy  Vratislav Votava.    Although the former CSFR made use of the possibility of  asking the United Nations for partial compensation of the  damage, along with Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine, its  negotiations with the UN Security Council have not produced any  results. "In view of the UN's difficult financial situation,  the possibilities of compensation must be assessed  realistically," Klaus states.    Losses in the sphere of foreign trade amount to $259.4  million. Of this sum, $190 million (Kc5.7 billion) are foreign  trade enterprises' claims in former Yugoslavia. The loss of  another $69.4 million (Kc2.1 billion) is due to the failure by  the republics of former Yugoslavia to cover their debt stemming  from the clearing account between former Yugoslavia and the  Czech Republic.    One-off damages suffered by organizations of the Ministry of  Industry and Trade amount to $17 million (Kc510 million). They  result from nonliquid company claims and the costs associated  with the halting, owing to the UN sanctions, of some planned  deliveries to former Yugoslavia, work on which had already  started.    Damage in the sphere of transportation represents Kc82.9  million, of which some Kc80 million is accounted for by the loss  of fees in railway transportation for transit from former  Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the Czech Republic profits from  the fact that civilian aircraft are banned from flying over the  territory of Serbia and Montenegro and use international air  routes over the territory of our Republic, for which they pay  overflight fees.    Losses incurred from the stricter regime for transit of  natural gas to Croatia and Slovenia have been estimated at $13.7  million.</p>

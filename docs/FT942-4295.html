			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Observer: Off the rails Inter-Rail's full page advert in several of Britain's quality dailies yesterday gave a fresh meaning to the term European Union. It showed 12 condoms, looking rather like 12 EU 'stars', laid out in a circle on a royal blue background. The copywriting featured a plethora of double entendres - 'the Inter-Rail pass gives you the freedom to go as far as you want in Europe' - spuriously tagged to this being the EU's year of Europe Against Aids. The slogan left something to be desired: 'Inter-Rail. You've got the rest of your life to be good.' Just like the copywriters, when you think about it.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Italian PM seeks negotiated future: Ciampi continues consultations ahead of no-confidence debate Italy's prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, today holds a second round of talks with political leaders which may determine the fate of his eight-month-old government. The discussions come before a vote of no-confidence next week which has divided members of the four parties supporting the government. Today's talks follow inconclusive discussions yesterday with leaders of the majority Christian Democrats and opposition parties to sound out parliamentary opinion. Prices on the Milan stock market fell by 1.74 per cent yesterday as a result of the political uncertainty, although the lira gained ground. Next week's no-confidence vote should be the last hurdle before President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro calls new elections to replace the present parliament, which has been largely discredited by the long-running political corruption scandal. Although an announcement on new polls had been expected in the president's end-of-year address to the nation, a decision was postponed after the no-confidence vote was tabled last month. According to political leaders, an election announcement prior to the debate would have been premature. The holiday period and the prime minister's international commitments mean the debate will not start until January 12, and could last some time. In the meantime, speculation has been mounting over Mr Ciampi's intentions, amid suggestions he could resign during or immediately after the parliamentary discussions. Matters are complicated by the sharp divisions in parliament regarding the timing of new elections. Parties expecting to perform strongly, such as the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI, have been pressing for an early decision on new polls as the existing legislature was no longer representative of public opinion. Mr Achille Ochetto, the PDS leader, said yesterday: 'The government's political period is over, in that this parliament is over. In our opinion any moment after January 12 is good for the president to dissolve parliament.' By contrast, many members of the four-party coalition notionally supporting Mr Ciampi would like to postpone the election as long as possible. Some Christian Democrats have even suggested it should be put back from mid-March, as widely expected, to June, when it could coincide with European parliamentary elections. A third camp, largely behind the no-confidence vote, would like to see Mr Ciampi remain as prime minister, but preferably with broader parliamentary support. A new lease of life for Mr Ciampi, who has been placed in an awkward position by the manoeuvrings, could postpone the polls long enough to give the divided centre more time to regroup and fend off challenges from the PDS and the League.</p>

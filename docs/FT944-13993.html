			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Nickel recovery helps Inco to improve operating performance Higher metals prices helped Inco, the western world's biggest nickel producer, to report a sharp improvement in third-quarter operating performance. But the Toronto-based company's bottom line was dented by an accident at one of its Manitoba mines, which forced it to cut production by 8m lbs during the quarter, and spend USDollars 5m on repairs. The shortfall in deliveries was made up by purchases from other producers, on which there was little, if any, profit. Net earnings were USDollars 2.6m, or two cents a share, down from Dollars 91.2m, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Last year's figure included a Dollars 127.9m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, gain from the sale of Inco's controlling stake in TVX Gold, a medium-sized gold producer. Third-quarter earnings were also hurt by a Dollars 7m payout resulting from the early redemption of a series of Swiss franc debentures. Sales climbed to Dollars 603.2m from Dollars 468m. Operating earnings were Dollars 47m, compared with a Dollars 13m loss. Total debt at the end of the quarter stood at Dollars 1.01bn, down from Dollars 1.06bn last December. Finished nickel inventories fell to 46m lbs from from 75m lbs three months earlier. The drop was largely attributable to summer holiday shutdowns at the Ontario and Manitoba Divisions during the third quarter. However, the recent recovery in the nickel market has led Inco to consider reducing next year's holidays. The company said it may shorten the summer shutdown from four to two weeks. Discussions with trade unions are due to be held in the first week of December. Total nickel deliveries rose to 125m lbs from 111m lbs. Copper shipments were 51m lbs, up from 42m lbs. Inco also reported an improvement in its alloys business because of higher deliveries and reduced costs.</p>

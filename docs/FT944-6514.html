			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Burmah Castrol Burmah Castrol, the lubricants and chemicals group, is forming a joint venture in Jordan as part of a Pounds 4.5m expansion of its construction chemicals business in a number of emerging markets. The Jordanian joint venture, in which Burmah's Fosroc subsidiary has a 70 per cent stake, is building a factory in Amman which will also supply the Lebanese, West Bank and Syrian markets. These are expected to grow rapidly as a result of the Middle East peace process. Meanwhile Fosroc is increasing its stake in its Indian joint venture from 40 per cent to 74 per cent. It is also building two new factories in Korea and Indonesia.</p>

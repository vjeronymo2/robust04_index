			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Pedagogical Sciences, Lecturer, </F> Retired Colonel E. Zmachinskiy: "On Subunit Tactics"]    [Text] Today we are becoming witnesses to major changes in  the international situation and in the country's domestic and  foreign policies. The peace-loving course taken by Russia in  recent years has practically reduced to naught the danger of the  emergence of nuclear missile war. But it is perhaps premature to  arrive at the conclusion that no one and nothing threatens  Russian statehood. (Unfortunately, some politicians are  attempting to convince people of that in the mass media). It is  impossible to ignore the fact that combat operations are  becoming increasingly widespread in the near abroad and also  everything is not peaceful in the far abroad.    Battles of "local significance" are being conducted, as a  rule, by small armed detachments and groups, and not always  skillfully from the point of view of tactics. Hence the increase  of unwarranted losses. Officers who have completed higher  military schools and academies are leading compulsory service  personnel who have completed their military obligation and on  the whole well-trained guerrillas. All of this permits us to  doubt to a certain extent the correctness of previously solid  approaches to training people and suggests the thought on the  need to examine certain views that affect the tactics of small  subunits and their comprehension.    This question appears to be fundamental first of all because  the result of a small subunit battle directly impacts the combat  operations of a larger tactical echelon on which the course and  outcome of an operation frequently depend. Furthermore, the  practitioners -- the soldiers and officers, through whose hands  victory is attained, first of all pay for the theorists'  mistakes.    Any science is in constant development. As a component of  military science (military art), tactics are also modified from  time to time. What specific features in small subunit  operational tactics have emerged today?    There are several of them. I will begin with the  advisability, in my view, of imparting a somewhat different  characterization to the opposing side. While studying tactics as  an academic discipline, we perceived and perceive the enemy in  the form of a specific organic structure with definite (known  beforehand) personnel strength, weapons, combat tactics,  standards, etc.    However, in our time, this stereotype is nothing other than  harm and we cannot bear it. Armed conflicts are conducted  according to other "laws". Consequently, it makes sense to  present the enemy numerically. That is, based upon the number of  opposing personnel and armored targets, weapons emplacements and  so forth. And it is hardly worthwhile to delve into the details  of the opposing side's organic structure or, say, its unit  affiliation while accomplishing a training or actual combat  mission on the squad, platoon or company scale. It seems to me  that the main thing here is knowledge of the actual enemy and  his capabilities that have been obtained based upon intelligence  data.    The typical diversity of the enemy and therefore, the  unpredictability of his operations, increases the role of the  latter. We can encounter a completely unfamiliar structure and  even its absence (as it occurred in Afghanistan) instead of  theoretically known enemy formations in one-on-one combat with  spontaneously created detachments and groups.    Formerly, subunit combat capabilities were examined in  detail  when studying their tactics. Now, I think, we need to pay  attention to combat requirements on a par with them. What does  that signify? First of all the need to establish the number of  targets that are subject to destruction to attain success in  battle. For example, on an offensive -- 100% of the  weapons  that are preventing us from seizing the target of the attack. On  defense -- no less than 50% of the attackers' personnel  and  weapons.    As for the combat missions (their parameters) and forming  up,  obviously, the time has come to more precisely define certain  provisions of the Field Manual. By way of illustration, the  currently legitimized method of forming up the defending troops  with the presence of large gaps in them causes bewilderment. You  won't manage to reliably cover gaps between subunits at night,  under conditions of poor visibility, and in a number of cases  during the day. A battle most often carries over onto broken  terrain and soldiers and weapons are located in trenches, that  is, practically on the surface of the earth. Details of the  relief, vegetation, ground features, dust and smoke  substantially impede surveillance and the conduct of aimed fire.  As events in the Persian Gulf demonstrated, it is already  impossible to consider various types of impediments to be  impenetrable barriers. In my opinion, subunits that are  operating according to today's standards are doomed to defeat  from the beginning.    How should we act? We most likely need to return to the  experience of the concluding stage of the Great Patriotic War.  The standards that were applied at that time appeared as a  result of painstaking analysis of a multitude of previous  battles and engagements. We can say that they became the essence  of the maturity of our tactics and ultimately were one of the  main factors in the attainment of victory over the enemy. It is  probably no accident that the leading war colleges of the entire  world have been intently studying the experience of those years  until now.    A few words about the motorized rifle squad. In the existing  organic structure, it is actually incapable of operating in a  combat situation with adequate effectiveness. The fact is that  we cannot even think about similar formations that previously  existed and that currently exist in a number of foreign armies  without hand-to-hand combat. Practically no one in a motorized  rifle squad participates in it. A driver (driver-mechanic),  machinegunner (loader-operator), machinegunner, sniper, and an  RPG [rocket propelled grenade] man with an assistant are here in  secondary and even tertiary roles and are hardly capable of  affecting its outcome. Moreover, in the war years it was thought  that you needed to have no less than 10 men in the squad line  for a successful attack on a front of up to 50 meters.    How does the author of these lines see a modern squad? A  commander, 10 riflemen with automatic weapons (of them one -- is  the assistant RPG man and, possibly, one is the combat vehicle  commander, a machinegunner, an RPG man, a sniper, machinegunners  (loader-operators), and drivers (driver-mechanics). A total of  18 men and two armored vehicles. In this case, a team of fire  support riflemen is drawn in great detail which is extremely  important in cases of limited capabilities of artillery and  aircraft, and also without joint participation of a tank subunit  with the motorized riflemen in a battle. In any case, the  emergence of similar situations is not excluded.    A squad of that structure is capable of defending itself on  a  front of 100-150 meters and up to 100 m in depth. In an  offensive, the motorized riflemen can operate while located  either behind the armored vehicles or ahead of them, or while  having one ahead and the other with the fire support group  behind the squad line. That is, the movement of BTR's [armored  transport vehicles] and BMP's [armored infantry vehicles] will  in some ways begin to remind you of the flight of a pair of  aircraft -- the flight leader and the wing man which, in my  opinion, makes sense.    The subunit combat capability calculation methods proposed  by  the tactics training manuals also need to be made more precise.  Let's take as an example the recommended number of bullets  expended per meter of front per minute. It is thought that the  higher the density of fire the greater the probability of  attaining victory. It would seem that everything is correct from  the point of view of theory. However, in practice, infantry did  not and will not conduct small arms fire against lines or areas.  It fires against specifically visible live targets. And the  outcome of the battle does not depend on the number of bullets  expended but on the number of targets destroyed.    Meanwhile, it is easy to calculate combat capabilities if  you  actually determine the time for conducting aimed fire (while  taking into account the training of personnel). Say, in the  defense -- from the moment of the appearance of targets until  their closure with the forward edge of the battle area and the  transition to a hand-to-hand skirmish.    Average weapons combat capability coefficients were also not  presented in the best manner. For example, they total 0.3-0.4  for an RPG [rocket propelled grenade]. This question is  appropriate: Is it true that a tank will not be hit until they  assemble 3-4 RPG men together in a subunit? Where do these  numbers come from? Perhaps they result from the calculation of  the overall combat capabilities of the weapons that are taking  part in a battle. And if they don't cause any doubts on one  structural level (in a division or regiment), then they don't  appear to be very well substantiated on another (in a squad,  platoon or company). Here I would say we need another, weightier  approach.    How are coefficients that are interpreted so unambiguously  dangerous? First of all by the reduction of soldiers' confidence  in their weapons. Military school graduates in the troops  transfer their knowledge to their subordinates who in turn are  justified in arriving at the conclusion on the inadequate  effectiveness of the weapons assigned to them. Therefore, we  need to provide the appropriate explanations when we discuss  subunit combat capabilities.    I also have to say something about the Ground Forces Field  Manual. It was never as large as it is today. The current  edition contains many repetitions, some articles and attachments  are excessively detailed, and certain inconsistencies are  observed with the combat operations regulations of the branches  of the armed forces and on the types of combat support, and with  other guiding documents. I think that only the primary  provisions should be set forth in it and it is better to provide  for all the rest in training manuals and regulations.  Furthermore, we must simplify the work of commanders of small  subunits to the maximum extent possible, reducing their  activities to command and control of subordinates in battle to  short commands and signals. For example, in an offensive:  "Platoon (squad), attack up to some landmark -- FORWARD". In the  defense: "Platoon (squad), to some line or other -- ACTION." Of  course, personnel must be well trained and know their duties in  battle.    In conclusion, I will point out that, having set forth my  personal point of view, I do not lay claim to the truth in the  highest instance. However, I consider it necessary to sometimes  examine the established canons of military art from a critical  angle. Tactics will only gain from that.    COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 12 1993</p>

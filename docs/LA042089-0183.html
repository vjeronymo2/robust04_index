			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU;  </P> <P> GROUP SUES L.A. COUNTY  </P> <P> The Friends of the Santa Monica Mountains are suing Los Angeles County over the  development of 150 single-family homes at the site of the former Renaissance  Pleasure Faire in Agoura.  </P> <P> The suit, similar to one filed this month by the Sierra Club and the Las  Virgenes Homeowners Foundation, seeks to reverse a March ruling by the Los  Angeles County Board of Supervisors that would allow development of the  320-acre tract north of the Paramount Ranch land that is part of the Santa  Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.  </P> <P> The lawsuits argue that the ruling did not take into account problems of  drainage, traffic and the destruction of the view from the recreation area.  </P></p>

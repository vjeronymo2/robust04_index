			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hydro-Quebec in USDollars 700m bond offering Hydro-Quebec has completed most of its 1994 borrowing programme with a USDollars 700m issue of 30-year 8.05 per cent bonds priced at par, writes Robert Gibbens from Montreal. The bonds carry a put option allowing holders to redeem at par in July 2006. Proceeds will be used to refinance a 12-year debt issue. CS First Boston, co-leader of the syndicate with Merrill Lynch, RBC Dominion Securities and ScotiaMcleod, said the 'put' bonds saved 10 basis points in yield compared with a straight 12-year debt issue.</p>

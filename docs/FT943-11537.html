			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sir Alex Alexander - Obituary Sir Alex Alexander, who has died at the age of 77, will be remembered jointly for his contribution to the food industry and his huge fund-raising efforts for charity and the arts. He arrived in Britain as a poor refugee from Czechoslovakia in 1938 and rose to the top of several British boardrooms. He never denied, and sometimes encouraged the belief, that over the years he had accumulated one of the best address books in the country. Alexander was born Korda Kestenbaum in November 1916 and studied medicine at the prestigious Charles University in Prague. He left for England at the time of the German invasion. With hindsight it is clear that he picked up good contacts from the start. In the early war years he surfaced as a clerk at a gravel pit site of the Alfred McAlpine construction group. After the war, when he changed his name, he worked on the Westwick estate in Norfolk partly as a nurse to the family, but also developing the estate's interest in canned fruit. It was there that he realised the potential of the frozen food business. Alexander went briefly to America to pick up the technology of refrigeration. He then founded Westwick Frozen Products and by 1953 had gone into partnership with Carl Ross, who specialised in freezing fish. The Ross Group expanded rapidly and was taken over by Imperial Tobacco in 1969. Alexander stayed with the new grouping for 10 years as chairman of Imperial Foods. When he retired in 1979, there were widespread directorships - Unigate, Tate &amp; Lyle and Alfred McAlpine, the company for which he had first worked, among them. He also became chairman of J Lyons, the food outlet of Allied Breweries. He moved on to become vice-chairman of Allied-Lyons at a troubled time. In 1985 the group was confronted with a hostile takeover bid from Elders IXL. There was a referral to the Monopolies Commission and the case went on for a nearly a year. The eventual ruling was in favour of Allied-Lyons, though by then Elders had lost interest. Alexander played some role in the defence and could be outspoken in his public comments, but insiders tend to give much of the credit to Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, then the company chairman, as well as the financial advisers in the background. More recently, Alexander has been best known for his work in the arts, though even this had a long history. In his early Norfolk days he was raising money for the local Red Cross. He began fund-raising for Glyndebourne in 1973 and was responsible for introducing corporate sponsorship. He went on to become chairman of the Royal Opera House Trust, the fund-raising body for Covent Garden. Stories about his powers of persuasion abound. When told that a friend had donated Pounds 100,000 to the opera house, he growled that he had promised Pounds 120,000. Alexander picked up the telephone and the cheque for the remaining Pounds 20,000 was in the post. He was married in 1946 to Margaret Irma, whom he knew in Czechoslovakia before the war, and he was knighted in 1974. They had two sons and two daughters. Alexander's last main job was as senior manag-ing director at Lehman Brothers International (Europe).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Meetings of the tripartite Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli  economic committee were concluded in Washington yesterday  evening. Addressing media and press correspondents on the  results of these meetings, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of  state for cabinet affairs and information minister, said:    [Begin recording] First, one of the most important results  is  that the Jordanian and Israeli sides were able -- through the  meetings held in connection with the meeting of the tripartite  economic committee -- to reach a detailed agenda on the issue of  the Jordanian territory.    Within this framework, it has been agreed to form a  committee  whose task is to come to the region to demarcate the Jordanian  borders in accordance with what was agreed in the joint agenda  signed last September. Thus, we have reiterated a basic  principle; namely, Jordanian borders will turn from cease-fire  borders to internationally-recognized borders. This affirms  Jordan's territorial integrity, thereby ending any ambitions  toward these territories and safeguarding the Jordanian entity.    We, of course, agreed on two basic principles: The first  principle is that we should return to the [British] mandate  agreement on border demarcation; and second, these borders must  be demarcated on the ground.    The second important dimension reached is related to water.  We know that the issue of water is a very sensitive issue for  Jordan. It is also directly linked with the rights of Jordanian  sovereignty. Israel used to take from the Jordanian waters in  the Jordan and al-Yarmuk Rivers; that is, it takes more than its  share agreed on in the international and regional agreements  organizing this relationship. Therefore, another committee will  be formed to fairly redistribute water in harmony with Jordan's  rights in this regard.    Also, it has been agreed that the Jordan Valley project  will be viewed as a full-blown project, according to which there  will be discussions for developing its infrastructure. Big  projects that will be discussed later will be launched there in  the future. That is, we have endorsed the launching of some  studies that will pave the way for the launching of big  development projects in the Jordan Valley. You may recall, in  particular, that the most important project in this regard is  the desalination project, or the project of extending a canal  linking the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. This project is a Jordanian  plan and proposal in the first place, and came in response to  Israeli plans to build a canal linking the Mediterranean to the  Dead Sea.    Regarding the talks held within the context of the  tripartite  committee, it has been agreed that the U.S. side will prepare a  paper on the Jordan Valley, and the projects planned to be  carried out there. However, this effort will be confined to the  realm of studies at present. This is because the implementation  of such projects is unthinkable before an agreement is reached  on the issue of borders.    With respect to economic issues, particularly in light of  the  agreement signed between the PLO and the Israeli side on the  issue of banking and trade, the Jordanian side explained the  impact of this agreement on the Jordanian economy. This is  because this agreement somewhat restricts the freedom to export  Jordanian commodities to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The  Israeli side agreed that it is possible to expand the prospects  for Jordanian exports to the Palestinian territories.    Additionally, it has been agreed that Jordan will be  informed  of any future plans or proposals, let us say, to issue a  Palestinian currency so that Jordan may adopt measures that  could protect its currency. Jordan will be given sufficient  time to take such measures.    According to the agenda signed, it transpired that some  issues can be discussed at the trilateral level. That is why a  Jordanian-Palestinian-Israeli economic committee was called on  to meet to discuss some issues at the trilateral level, to  discuss them and resolve them appropriately.    In a nutshell, these are the most important results reached.  In my view, these results are very important for Jordan. This  is because they protect and contribute to safeguarding Jordan's  identity, demographic makeup, and territorial integrity. [end  recording]</p>

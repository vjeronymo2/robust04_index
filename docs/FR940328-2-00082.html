The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to extend the pilot program implemented to establish a procedure regarding the execution of ``stopped'' market orders in minimum variation markets (usually an 1/8th spread market). In 1992, the Exchange adopted interpretation and policy .03 to Rule 37 of Article XX, on a pilot basis, to permit stopped market orders in minimum variation markets. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Prior to the pilot program, no Exchange rule required specialists to grant stops in minimum variation markets if an out-of-range execution would result. While the Exchange has a policy regarding the execution of stopped market orders generally, the Exchange believes it is necessary to establish a separate policy for executing stopped market ordes when there is a minimum variation market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 1992 Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange's general policy regarding the execution of stopped orders is to execute them based on the next primary market sale. If this policy were used in a minimum variation market, it would cause the anomalous result of requiring the execution of all pre-existing orders, even if those orders are not otherwise entitled to be filled. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, assume the market in ABC stock is 20&hyph;201/8; 50 x 50 with 1/8th being out of range. A customer places an order with the Exchange specialist to buy 100 shares of ABC at the market, and a stop is effected. The order is stopped at 201/8, and the Exchange specialist includes the order in his or her quote by bidding the 100 shares at 20. If the next sale on the primary market is for 100 shares at 20, adopting the Exchange's existing general policy to minimum variation markets would require the specialist to execute the stopped market order at 20. However, because the stopped market order does not have time or price priority, its execution would trigger the requirement for the Exchange specialist to execute all pre-existing bids (in this case, 5,000 shares) based on the Exchange's rules of priority and precedence. This is so even though the pre-existing bids were not otherwise entitled to be filled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the above example, Exchange Rule 37 (Article XX) requires the Exchange specialist to fill orders at the limit price only if such orders would have been filled had they been transmitted to the primary market. Therefore, the 100 share print at 20 in the primary market would cause at most 100 of the 5,000 share limit order to be filled on the Exchange. However, the Exchange's general policy regarding stopped orders, if applied to minimum variation markets, would require the 100 share stopped market order to be filled, and, as a result, all pre-existing bids at the same price to be filled in accordance with Exchange Rule 16 (Article XX).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

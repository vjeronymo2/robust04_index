			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the split between Umberto Bossi and Silvio  Berlusconi, there is now expectation to see how the proposal of  the Northern League's deputy-leader will be accepted. Roberto  Maroni has proposed the idea of a relay-style government.    [Begin Maroni recording] We must choose a person who  understands constitutional techniques, a person who is a strong  federalist. I am not thinking of Gianfranco Miglio [of the  Northern League]. I believe that the person we choose should  not even come from the Northern League. [end recording]    [Unidentified correspondent] Following the split, we now  have  the re-launch. Faced with an intransigent Berlusconi who has  resolved to let President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro decide who should  form the next government, the League has sent out its mediator,  Roberto Maroni. Maroni has played down the comments of Bossi  and has put a softer gloss on them. He said that the solution  to the problem could be handing over the reins of power from a  government which was first constituent and led by a federalist,  to one which would then become legislative. Possibly led by  Silvio Berlusconi.    So far there has been no comment from Berlusconi, although  there has been some from the Northern League itself. It is a  Northern League deputy from the Veneto region who has criticized  Bossi. (Rocchetti) called Bossi a Bonapartist. He said that the  party was losing support and the arguments were damaging the  party. It is in these agitated waters that (Bassanini) from the  Party of the Democratic Left is making the first cautious moves.  He spoke of a possible agreement concerning federal reform.</p>

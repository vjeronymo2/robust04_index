Ishihara told a news conference that the push is being made  to allow the Finance Ministry to compile the draft of the fiscal  1994 state budget before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa flies  to the United States on Thursday. "We have no more time to  waste. The situation is fairly severe," Ishihara said.    Hosokawa is scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton on  Friday to assess progress in trade talks being held under a  bilateral trade framework accord concluded last July. The  premier will return home Saturday.    Coalition parties remained divided over Hosokawa's proposal  for a 6 trillion yen tax reduction retroactive to January 1 this  year and a 7 percent tax on goods and services from April 1997.    The Social Democratic Party, the largest contingent in the  seven-party coalition, has threatened to quit the coalition over  the plan for a "national welfare tax," calling it a thinly  disguised increase in the consumption tax rate, currently 3  percent.    Washington has voiced hopes for additional pump-priming  measures by Japan, including a sizable income tax cut, because  it believes this will help stimulate domestic consumer spending,  increase imports and slash Japan's bulging trade surplus.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stoyan Sirakov] </F>   [Text] The Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant will close down  the oldest four generating units, which date from the time the  plant was opened, in 2005. This was established by a commission  of experts that completed a comprehensive analysis of the  nuclear power plant with a view to determining "the plant's  effects on the surrounding and working environment and on the  health of the population." New units will take at least 10-15  years to build, so the experts consider that their construction  should start immediately.    The experts found that the incidence of lung, breast, and  thyroid cancers is less than the national average. The  scientists compared their figures with those for the Belene and  Yambol districts as well as with the average indices. In the  entire series of measurements carried out, they established no  difference in the background gamma radiation levels before and  after the nuclear power plant was commissioned. Measurements  were taken throughout the period that the plant was in operation  at 400 separate points in 46 centers of population. The experts  found no significant deviations in natural and man-made  radioactivity in the regions surrounding the nuclear power plant  compared with other localities in Bulgaria. The waters of the  Danube were found to contain no increased concentration of  radionucleides resulting from fluid discharges from the nuclear  power plant. The team of scientists confirmed that during the  entire period that the plant had been in operation it had had no  effect on environmental radiation. Specialists point out that  the pollution from a 1,100-megawatt thermal power is 10 to 40  times higher than that from a 1,440-megawatt nuclear reactor.</p>

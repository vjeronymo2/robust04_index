			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Balanced budget proposed in Saudi five-year plan Saudi Arabia is committing itself in principle to balancing its budget by the end of the decade, under a new five-year plan in which the government says it will seek to privatise some state industries, 'rationalise' costly state subsidies and invite greater private sector investment in infrastructure and other projects. The principles are contained in an abstract of the kingdom's sixth five-year plan, which will come into effect after approval by King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, on January 1. The abstract contains only declarations of principles guiding Saudi policy for the next five years. Details will be included with the plan's full publication next year. However, it addresses some of the core reasons behind the kingdom's consistently high budget deficits over the past decade and hints that the government may be ready to make significant structural changes to its finances. Saudi officials recently suggested that the kingdom's next budget, also due on January 1, might contain specific measures to raise state revenues. Last year's budget called for a flat 19 per cent cut from all government departments following the kingdom's 11th successive budget deficit in 1993. The fiscal gap in 1993 was reckoned by western economists to be Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.3bn), or 10 per cent of GDP, though no official figure is published. A shortfall of around Dollars 6bn is expected for 1994, even after successful government spending cuts. However, the document, called General Objectives and Strategic Bases of the Sixth Development Plan, says the government will 'adopt a fiscal policy which allows the level of expenditure to commensurate with government revenues' during the plan's five-year period. This will be achieved, it says, by finding 'optimum ways to increase government revenues' without causing 'undesirable social and economic effects'. This is to include increasing government efficiency, enhancing private sector investment, particularly in infrastructure projects, and 'developing privatisation programmes'. King Fahd has already raised the possibility in two recent speeches of eventually privatising Saudia, the highly-subsidised state carrier, and parts of the kingdom's telecommunications system. The new document states a general principle of encouraging the private sector to own and manage 'basic industries' through the 'timely flotation of the shares of these industries'. On subsidies, which at present heavily reduce the prices of power, telecommunications and water services, the document says the government will 'rationalise the system of direct and indirect subsidies'. It says the prices of such services 'should not be less than their production cost, except in rare cases'. While saying that the costs of providing public utilities should be reduced, the document holds out the prospect of price rises, adding that these would be implemented 'without jeopardising the status of low income strata of society'. The document also places a priority on increasing vocational training and job opportunities for Saudis in the private sector. It says the government will seek to 'change attitudes towards certain occupations which at present are not accepted by some individuals' - a reference to most Saudis' preference for secure and well-paid public sector jobs over private sector employment. It also says the government would 'find suitable means to encourage the private sector to provide job opportunities' for Saudis, hinting that it may for the first time introduce specific incentives for companies to hire Saudi citizens rather than expatriate workers. More than 4.5m expatriates now work in the kingdom, most of them in private sector manual, technical or industrial jobs. Remittances from these workers, mostly from the sub-continent and east Asia, amount to Dollars 16bn-Dollars 18bn a year, according to local economists.</p>

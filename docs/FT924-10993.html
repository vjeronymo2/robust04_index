			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / What Future For Coal: Miners return to court to save pits MINING unions yesterday applied for injunctions against British Coal's decision to halt production at 10 collieries earmarked by the government for closure. The move, taken separately by the National Union of Mineworkers and the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, follows British Coal's refusal to heed a noon deadline set by the unions' lawyers. The NUM and UDM applications are scheduled to be heard in the High Court tomorrow and next Tuesday respectively. Attempts by British Coal to have the actions heard concurrently were rejected by the NUM as a ploy to gain time and break the momentum of the campaign against pit closures. Mr Mark Stephens, a solicitor for the NUM, said: 'British Coal is trying to stall on addressing substantive issues which are of clear urgency to the miners and the public at large.' Two pits - Grimethorpe and Houghton Main in South Yorkshire - are due to stop cutting coal on Friday, while seven have already stopped production. Of the 10 collieries, only Betws in south Wales will remain in production from next weekend. Union officials said British Coal was pressing miners to take voluntary redundancy before the 90-day consultation period expired. British Coal figures show wide variations in the rate at which miners are applying for redundancy. At Markham Main in South Yorkshire, 250 of the 730 miners have applied for redundancy while at Parkside, Lancashire, only 2 of the 782 miners have. At Trentham, Staffordshire, (1,544 miners) there have been 97 applications; Taff Merthyr, south Wales, (410 miners) 4; Grimethorpe, South Yorkshire, (957 miners) 150; Houghton Main, South Yorkshire, (441 miners) three. The unions argue that ceasing production and development is endangering the mines' viability and violates an earlier undertaking given by British Coal to the High Court. British Coal said last night that it saw no grounds for continuing production at the 10 pits and would oppose the action.</p>

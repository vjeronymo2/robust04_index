			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Travel: The buckle of Florida's bible belt / A look at life on the Redneck Riviera SCHUBERT Miles is frightened of ostriches. Sitting on the porch of his ramshackle farm, he pushes back his baseball cap and warns: 'Never trust an ostrich. Their toes can kill - rip a man wide open.' At 80 years old, Schubert is not as light on his feet as he was, so he makes sure his wife Daisy is ready with a stick when he feeds his big African birds. Feeding time at Miles Feather Farm, a private aviary deep in the forests of north-west Florida, is done by the book - the good book. Daisy always says grace before breaking the bread and pushing it into the bird cages. Her greatest conversion is Tinker, an ageing parrot who lives in a Kentucky whiskey barrel. He screeches 'Praise the Lord' and 'Amen' when he is fed. Schubert rarely plucks Tinker these days; he prefers to teach him the gospel instead. Reciting the Lord's Prayer to a parrot may seem eccentric in a state better known for Mickey Mouse and the Everglades, but it barely raises an eyebrow in DeFuniak Springs, the old lumber capital of the south. This town is the buckle of the Florida bible belt, and religious pets are nothing new. Stretching from Pensacola on the Alabama border to Tallahassee, the state capital, the bible belt boasts churches in all shapes and sizes - First Baptists, United Methodists, Assemblies of God, Abundant Life Pentecostals and Seventh Day Adventists. Roads across the region, nicknamed the Panhandle, are lined with evangelical billboards exhorting motorists to pull over for a service. 'Trust in God,' says one; 'Have you been saved?' asks another. Schubert Miles thinks he has been saved already - saved from tourism, Florida's largest industry. State regulations protect the forests of the Panhandle and ensure that farming and the local chicken processing plant remain more important to DeFuniak than holidaymakers. Giving thanks, Schubert says: 'This is God's country. Let's keep it that way.' Even Adventures Unlimited, the only company allowed to rent canoes and kayaks in the Blackwater Forest, gets most of its business from the Lord. Church groups like nothing better than to canoe downriver for a weekend retreat on a deserted sandbar. Paddling gently through avenues of pine and cedar, you hear the church groups before you see them. It is unnerving to recognise a chorus from Onward Christian Soldiers wafting round a U-bend in the river; it is even more scary to feel the eyes of a dozen devotees regarding your kayak with horror as they spy the Budweisers weighing it down. God, however, has lost his grip on one part of the Panhandle: the coast. Several towns lining the seashore have put their faith in tourism and their devotion has spawned a string of brash resorts and amusement parks. This is the Redneck Riviera, a popular haunt for holidaymakers from Alabama and Georgia. The riviera has alarmed residents in the Panhandle who fear the coastline could disappear beneath high-rise hotels and gaming arcades. Even Seaside, a new holiday village praised by Prince Charles for its traditional architecture, has failed to impress them. Its pastel-coloured cottages and fine white beach may be pretty 'but where are the churches?', asks one visitor from DeFuniak Springs. There is no shortage of altars in the lumber town 25 miles north of Seaside. The Baptists alone have 10 churches and their congregations command enough votes to persuade the town council to adopt teetotal policies, such as banning all alcohol advertising. The town's most famous baptist took the whole state by storm. Sidney Catts, a local minister, ran for governor in 1916 as the champion of the Panhandle's farmers, nicknamed the crackers. Campaigning with two loaded pistols, he proclaimed: 'There are only three things you can trust in life: Sears Roebuck, the Lord Jesus and Sidney J Catts.' He was duly elected as the 'cracker messiah'. His individual brand of conservatism survives in DeFuniak, where he died in 1936. Sunbright Manor, his former home, has been converted to a B&amp;B but still serves the food Sidney enjoyed: grits, ground corn in hot water and melted butter. Sleeping in the governor's bedroom, it is easy to understand why he always slept with his pistols beside him. At 2am each morning an artillery barrage opens up outside - far away at first but steadily louder until it sounds as though war has broken out. The cause is the adjacent Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Its nightly freight train rumbles across the state like a mobile cannon. The noise is terrific and the locomotive's horn sounds like an air raid siren. The thunder dies slowly as the train heads eastward but it is often followed by a genuine thunderclap. In the Panhandle electric storms are almost as regular as train services. And across Florida more people are killed or injured by lightning than in any other US state. Towns like DeFuniak, however, have a natural storm warning - lovebugs. These hairy insects congregate in droves before a storm but not everyone welcomes their arrival. Their bodies are so acidic that they eat right through metal and they have been blamed for corroding cars. Residents in the Panhandle try all sorts of weird practises to deter them. They fit 'car-bras' over their radiators and it is not unusual to see a motorist massaging baby oil into his Pontiac. Lovebugs skid right off your bonnet if it is greasy with moisturiser. Frequent storms and the insects preceding them are not mentioned by campaigners hoping to kickstart tourism in DeFuniak Springs. They concentrate, instead, on the town's history as the 19th century cultural centre of Florida when it hosted the Chautauqua arts festival. The annual festival, held to attract Sunday school teachers, filled a 4,000-seat auditorium beside DeFuniak's perfectly round lake. But the festival died in 1925 and with it the town's association with the arts. The auditorium, once the largest in the South, has been demolished, but the lake is largely unchanged and the lack of new development has left most of the old mansions around it intact. Tourism campaigners want to open these houses to tour groups but Father John Fowler, DeFuniak's elderly episcopalian pastor, says 'they don't have a Chinaman's chance'. Father Fowler blames the town council for resisting moves to attract holidaymakers. 'This town has been taken over by a bunch of southern boobs who haven't the faintest idea about tourism. They don't want change, they just want religious salvation. It's a shame. Places like this will die out.' Schubert Miles, meanwhile, shakes his head at the idea of tour buses struggling up the rutted track to his farm. He says his faith will prepare him for such an onslaught. Tending his confederate roses, which flower white each morning and turn red as the day passes, he quotes his favourite psalm: 'I say to myself: 'The Lord is my light and my salvation, of whom then shall I be afraid?' . . . only my ostriches.' Tim Burt travelled with Northwest Airlines (tel: 0345-747800), which serves the Panhandle with flights to Fort Walton Beach.

The deadline for appeal is  Tuesday.    Around 0400 on 13 December 1993, a fire broke out at a four-  storey warehouse owned by the Gaofu Textile Company Limited in  the Fuzhou Mawei Economic and Technological Development Zone,  killing 61 workers in the warehouse and injuring 15. It was a  tragedy. After the incident the police investigated the cause  of the fire and quickly discovered that it was set by a factory  worker, Dong Yanglin, who has received a death sentence.    On 27 January this year, the Fuzhou City People's  Procuratorate charged Mai Tsu-wen, the legal representative of  the Gaofu Company and its director and general manager, with  serious negligence at the city intermediate people's court.    It is understood that he was the first Taiwan businessman to  be sentenced on the mainland following the promulgation and  implementation of the "PRC Investment Law Protecting Foreign  Businesses." It is on account of this that relevant authorities  were very careful in verifying criminal evidence and handing  down sentences, giving full consideration to the fact that the  defendant had assisted actively in dealing with the aftermath of  the fire, and had repented and regretted his crime.</p>

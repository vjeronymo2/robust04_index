			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTURY TAKES LEAD BUT CAN'T KEEP IT AGAINST BLOOMINGTON  </P> <P> Century High School scared Bloomington for a half Thursday night at Santa Ana  Stadium, but the Centurions eventually lost, 24-14, and are still looking for  their first varsity football victory in school history.  </P> <P> "We have to walk before we can run," Century Coach Bill Brown said.  </P> <P> "But right now, we're breaking into a trot."  </P> <P> Century's Orlando Olivos, a sophomore wide receiver, set up the game's first  score with a 57-yard reception from sophomore quarterback Rick Odoardi.  </P> <P> Odoardi capped the drive with a one-yard run, scoring the first points of the  year against the stingy Bloomington defense to give Century a 6-0 lead.  </P> <P> Bloomington responded by marching 79 yards in 10 plays and scoring on a  fourth-and-goal, four-yard pass from Larry Humphreys to Jason Smith. Greg  Mermilliod made the conversion to give the Bruins a 7-6 lead.  </P> <P> Bloomington scored the next 17 points, including a third-quarter, 97-yard  interception return by Keith Gory. Century finished the scoring with a  touchdown in the game's final minute.  </P> <P> "We'll get our first win yet," Brown said. "And I won't be pleased until we  do."  </P> <P> Odoardi was a bright spot for the Centurions' offense, completing nine of 17  passes for 204 yards, including three passes that went for more than 40 yards.  He also intercepted one Bloomington pass from his cornerback position. MICHAEL  ITAGAKI  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Fascination with light has led Peter Alexander from the black velvet depths of  the ocean to the splashy horizon at sunset. His newest paintings unite sky and  earth in a battle for luminous dominance as city lights crisscross the flat  Southland basin under spectacular skies.  </P> <P> These paintings are a strange juxtaposition of painterly heavens and  airbrush-spotted terrestrial street lights. Each glows with its own intensity,  ignoring the other and setting up an interesting contrast of power between the  randomness of the elements and the strict structure of the city boulevards. The  city lights, for all the attention that Alexander can bring to their cobweb  luminosity, quickly get boring. But the expressionistic sweep of descending  cloud banks has staying power, especially in the freakish yellow rift of  lightning in the twilight sky over "Saugus."  </P> <P> Alexander has played on the edge of camp for so long that we expect his work to  tweak the nose of the art elite who disdain schmaltzy sunsets and paintings on  black velvet. These newest paintings, with their yellowish runway lights that  may even glow in the dark, suggest the kind of cliche photo postcards you buy  at the airport. Rather than being a negative, however, that play with  commercial democracy is the sly salvation of the work's romantic love affair  with painted light.

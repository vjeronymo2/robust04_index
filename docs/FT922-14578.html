			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Letter: US could stall opening of shipping markets Sir, I hear Ms Margaret S Wigglesworth's message on trade and 'free riders' (Letters, April 1) loud and clear. It is, however, important for all serious participants in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade services negotiations to lead by example. One US private services sector - shipping - is certainly not a 'steadfast supporter of the Uruguay Round', neither is it 'largely open for business'. After strenuous industry lobbying, the US government has listed six exemption requests covering shipping, including 'any other agreements, laws, regulations, or policies of the United States . . . which pertain to maritime transportation and the operation of merchant vessels . . . existing and future'. British shipping entirely supports Ms Wigglesworth's call for a General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats) which achieves real market access. This must include both a standstill on new restrictions and the removal of existing ones. But the American example will enshrine the status quo and stall the current strong move to open shipping markets that is already taking place. Shipping is therefore drawn to taking its chances outside the Gats. Michael Everard, president, The Chamber of Shipping, 30-32 St Mary Axe, London EC3A 8ET</p>

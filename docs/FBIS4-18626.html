			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Gallard: "Who's Part of the Frigate Is </F> This?"]    [Text] Although it could have been the naval counterpart of  the Airbus, produced by an almost perfect European partnership,  the building of a new type of antiaircraft frigate is causing  numerous conflicts between the English, French, and Italian  partners as they fight over the pieces.    "Cooperate." This is the ever recurrent theme of the white  paper on defense, the hobby horse of politicians. If you run  out of funds to cover your needs, cooperate, they declare to  both the military and industry, adding that, as a bonus, it will  contribute to the establishment of a joint European defense  structure. This is more easily said than done. The most recent  and spectacular cooperation program (40 million French francs  [Fr] committed by France over 10 years) is suffering, like a  caricature, from all the shortcomings that can affect  international projects. True, it brings together no less than  the Royal Navy, French Navy, and the Italian Navy for the joint  development of large antiaircraft frigates.    The program is called Horizon, but its skyline is low  because  of the successive storms. It came into being following Margaret  Thatcher's decision, five years ago to back out of the program  under which seven NATO countries were building a frigate that  was to resemble a veritable tower of Babel. The new program,  however, is not benefiting from the reduction in partners to  three, because, of course, they are all expressing different  needs. The negotiations between the industrial partners, taking  place one month in Paris, then in Glasgow, then in Rome,  resemble a big poker game, where each player believes he knows  everything and that the status quo should last. None of the  partners want to release any know-how, and each partner is  trying to recuperate the maximum number of jobs. In this  cooperative project, three is definitely a crowd or, in the  words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is someone else."    The distribution of the work has rapidly become a bone of  contention. "We have three or four times the number of frigates  to replace than the French or the Italians and must, therefore,  carry more weight in the repartition of the workload," say the  British. "False, you will never replace all of your old  antiaircraft frigates," reply the French, adding that the  current discussions only relate to a first lot of three frigates  anyway.... Despite this, they continue to take note of all of  the declarations made in the House of Commons regarding the real  needs of the Royal Navy. Other questions include: If each  country provides one-third of the financing, should it  automatically benefit from 33 percent of the industrial  workload, or should the best economic solutions be sought  without worrying about the nationality of the suppliers? "We  agree with the latter solution, but with a ceiling fixed in  advance, for example, at 40 percent for the country with the  best proposals," say the French, "and without our losing ground  in any of our specialities, because we need to build other  boats," adds the French team leader Michel Gevrey of DCN [Naval  Contructions Directorate] International. Reassured by these  demands, French engineers have no objection to dividing up the  frigate into 30 or so pieces, each with its own prime  contractor, provided that the two other partners are present as  assistants. We are a long way here from the naval Airbus!    However, the battles are likely to be the hardest with  regard  to the definition of the antiaircraft defense systems, which are  the frigates' raison d'etre in the first place. Each frigate  will be equipped with almost Fr3 billion worth of electronic  equipment and is destined to carry the Aster antiaircraft  missile developed by the French company Aerospatiale and the  Italian company Alenia. With only slightly different needs, the  two partners were able to subcontract the workload easily: to  the French Thomson, the Arabel radar designed to guide the  short-range Aster-15 missiles; and to the Italian Alenia the  Empar radar that will guide the longer-range Aster 30 missile.  The British, however, want a more sophisticated radar, of  British design of course. The problem is that the radar in  question, the British Mesar, only exists on paper. "If the  British Navy makes a point of developing the Mesar, it will mean  at least a five-year delay for everyone involved," fulminated  Enrico Gimelli, the managing director of Alenia, last week.  Within a month, the 60 engineers from the three countries will  have to find a compromise in the Rome-based joint program office  led by the Frenchman Herve Guillou. If not the whole program  could be put into jeopardy. A cloudy Horizon indeed.</p>

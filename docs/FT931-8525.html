			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Steel crisis prompts talks THYSSEN and Krupp, Germany's two largest steel producers, and Saarstahl, the sixth largest, are holding talks on future co-operation in their output of certain products. The aim of the talks, precipitated by the crisis in the steel industry, is to decide whether significant cost reductions can be made by greater specialisation between the three companies. The first details emerged as 10,000 steel workers demonstrated on the streets of Dortmund against the threat of mass job losses, and the closure of an entire steel plant belong to Hoesch Stahl, in the process of merging with Krupp Stahl. At the same time Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel Federation, warned that the industry in west Germany alone might have to shed 25,000 to 30,000 jobs, under the latest capacity cuts proposed at the European Commission in Brussels. East Germany would lose 10,000 jobs. The negotiations between Thyssen, Krupp and Saarstahl follow two abortive efforts at co-operation agreements between German steel producers in the past 18 months. This time they have been personally agreed by Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive of Krupp holding company, and Mr Heinz Kriwet, head of Thyssen group. Thyssen Stahl said the talks would focus on 'whether cost improvements could be achieved in the long products sector (girders, rods and the like) through a division of labour in the process of an exchange of programmes. Thyssen and Krupp were involved in a previous round of talks on possible co-operation in special steels production - virtually all Krupp's long products output consists of special steels. These talks ended abruptly last year when Thyssen decided instead to amalgamate its two producing companies, Thyssen Stahl and Thyssen Edelstahl. A further round of talks was initiated by Krupp last year with Klockner-Werke and Saarstahl, which also foundered. However the recent slump in the European steel market has forced the big producers to reopen their talks. Klockner-Werke, currently in negotiations on debt relief with its major creditors, has been excluded from the latest talks. The threat of thousands of job losses throughout the German industry has caused a surge of labour militancy, barely restrained by IG Metall, the giant engineering and steel workers' union. The union has called for a mass national demonstration on March 26, but workers fear that will come too late to prevent agreement on further plant closures.</p>

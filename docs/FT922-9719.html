			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Hunger strike in Thailand adds to pressure on PM ABOUT 5,000 Thais rallied in Bangkok yesterday in support of a popular politician who has pledged to starve himself to death unless Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon resigns. His hunger strike increased tensions in the city on the eve of a parliamentary session in which Gen Suchinda is due to set out his government's policies. Pressure on the government of Gen Suchinda, the former army commander and leader of last year's coup d'etat, has increased steadily since his appointment was announced on April 7. It escalated on Monday when 50,000 Thais protested against the appointment of an unelected prime minister and Major General Chamlong Srimuang, former governor of Bangkok, started his hunger strike . Business leaders expect stocks to fall sharply when the market reopens this morning, accelerating a steady decline in the stock exchange's share price index. The index has lost 71.41 points or 8.6 per cent since Gen Suchinda's appointment. Businessmen say Gen Suchinda should never have appointed to his cabinet allegedly corrupt MPs who were in the government which the military overthrew last year. Gen Chamlong's threat to die if the premier does not stand down is being taken seriously. He has gained popularity because of his near-ascetic way of life and his reputed hon-esty. The party he leads won 32 out of 35 seats in Bangkok in the general elections which took place on March 22.</p>

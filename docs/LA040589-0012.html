			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Unfortunately, your editorial "But There Is an Answer" (March 22) is not at all  the answer, but rather only a single element in a complex situation. These  so-called assault rifles have been around for years and no one even discussed  them. Heretofore, the politically popular target was handguns and specifically  "Saturday-night specials;" this year it's trendy to be against semiautomatic  rifles.  </P> <P> Guns do not shoot by themselves, they require someone to operate them, and that  can either be done lawfully or illegally, just like a car (with the same  untoward results if either is operated illegally). The real problem is how do  we disarm the drug gangs who engage in daily shootings? The mere carrying of  any loaded firearm on a public street is already illegal, so restrictive (yet  properly balanced with appropriate registration provisions) gun legislation,  although perhaps helpful, is certainly not the answer itself. That's much too  easy and simplistic a fix.  </P> <P> The basic issue is plea bargaining and available jail space. We need more jail  space, more courts operated on longer work schedules, more and better paid  police, and legislation restricting the use of plea bargaining (goes  hand-in-hand with jail construction), particularly in cases involving use of a  firearm in a drug-related incident or on a public street or area. It would  certainly help all of us if journalists, politicians, pro-gun groups, and  anti-gun groups alike would now turn their considerable resources and attention  toward resolving these much more pervasive, difficult and important questions  wherein lies the real answer, as difficult, expensive, and painful as it may  prove to be.  </P> <P> DONALD FENMORE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

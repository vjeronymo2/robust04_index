			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Australian dollar falls to five-year low THE Australian dollar fell more than half a US cent to a five-year low of 69.78 US cents yesterday, reflecting renewed international concern about Australia's economic prospects. The decline in the currency followed a fall in the annual rate of inflation to a 29-year-low of 0.8 per cent, the lowest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Mr John Dawkins, the Labor treasurer (finance minister) said lower inflation would not lead to a further cut in official interest rates, which have been reduced 12 times since January 1990. However, there was speculation that the government may cut interest rates from the present rate of 5.75 per cent in an attempt to boost economic activity before the next election, due by June. The Australian currency was also weakened by a recent downgrading by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, of the long-term debt of Victoria, Australia's second most populous state. The Australian dollar has fallen by more than two US cents in a week, in spite of extensive intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has attempted to smooth currency market fluctuations. Some dealers said the currency could fall to 68 US cents over the next few weeks, compared with a recent peak of just over 80 cents in September last year. The currency has fallen by about 13 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the same period.</p>

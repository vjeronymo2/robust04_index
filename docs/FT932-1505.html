			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Securities chief leaves Deutsche Bank MR BARTHOLD von Ribbentrop, executive vice-president in charge of securities sales trading at Deutsche Bank, is leaving Germany's largest bank to set up an investment fund. Mr von Ribbentrop, who has been with Deutsche Bank since 1971, is working with a group of unnamed partners to raise DM500m (Dollars 301.2m) in start-up capital. The fund will be designed to enable foreign institutions to invest in medium-sized German companies, the so-called Mittelstand. He said yesterday foreign institutions' opportunities to invest in the German economy were limited by the structure of the German equity market. There were only 665 quoted companies, and this did not cover the full depth of the German economy. Foreign institutions were obliged to channel investments into a small number of large financial and industrial conglomerates, he argued. This left them no option to make direct investments in the Mittelstand, which generated about 50 per cent of non state-sector German GDP and employed 75 per cent of the total German workforce. A number of foreign banks had tried to establish such funds but have had only limited success, reflecting the difficulties of entering the German venture capital market. Market participants say Germany's leading financial institutions tended to get the best investment opportunities for their own equity participation portfolios. Attempts by independent German financial institutions to set up such investment funds had also foundered. Mr von Ribbentrop, 52, who has been based in Frankfurt since 1986 after spending most of his career with Deutsche Bank in New York, is succeeded by Mr Bernd-Albrecht von Maltzan, 44, currently in charge of securities at Deutsche Bank's Mannheim branch.</p>

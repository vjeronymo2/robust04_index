The law was  rejected during repeat consideration Thursday [20 January] by a  53-13 vote, with 34 abstentions.    The abstentions virtually determined that the president's  veto would come into effect. 71 votes were needed to approve  the law repeatedly. In such case, the president's would have to  sign the law and to promulgate it within three days.    During debates, a majority of lawmakers said the problem of  income declaration by officials should be referred to the  Constitutional Court.    President Algirdas Brazauskas sent the law back to the  parliament for reconsideration because, in his opinion, some  portions of the law contradict the constitutional principles of  property inviolability and equality before the law.    The law was first adopted Dec. 23 under pressure of the  rightist opposition. The law set two deadlines for income  declaration by officials - May 1, 1994 for property owned prior  to Feb. 1, 1994 and March 1, 1995 for property acquired in 1994.</p>

An average of five or six candidates per Supreme  Council seat has already been registered in many electoral  districts. The leaders of parties and movements are not  stinting on interviews in the mass media, are proposing various  scenarios for emerging from economic collapse, and are analyzing  the present blunders in detail.    But everyone is expressing his attitude toward the recent  agreement on nuclear-free status for Ukraine. Some are  unconditionally supporting L. Kravchuk, while others are  accusing him of betraying national interests.    The latter people mostly represent national-radical parties.  Judging by their speeches, you get the impression that they  missed the press conference by the foreign minister and defense  minister, which has been repeatedly shown on republic  television. At the press conference the department heads  explained in detail that implementation of the agreement  entirely accords with the state's interests, that Russia and the  United States have given Ukraine clear national security  guarantees, and that machinery for immediate compensation for  each nuclear missile that is removed has been enumerated.    A recent speech by Stepan Khmara stands out. Accusing the  United States and Russia of imperial ways, he painted a black  picture of the "humiliating agreement" signed by Leonid  Kravchuk, who, according to him, should be immediately relieved  of the presidency. He called on parliament to block the  "adventure by the head of state."    At the present stage the sharp attacks by opponents of the  agreement pursue a single aim -- to influence the course of  parliament's discussion of nuclear status.    The "New Ukraine," Ukrainian Civic Congress, and Slavic  Unity  Party movements have spoken out against the wholesale criticism  of the president....    Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma declared that in Ukraine  there are many "patriotic" politicians who were at first all in  favor of nuclear-free status, but now are campaigning equally  insistently on the other side. When were they being sincere?    Nevertheless, most observers are hopefully awaiting the  discussion of the agreement between the three presidents in the  Supreme Council. In their view, only a positive result will  enable the young state to strengthen its independence and  stabilize the economy with the help of long-term large-scale  credits.</p>

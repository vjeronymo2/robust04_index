			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Yemeni Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah has attributed the cause of the current  political crisis in his country to the rivalry for power, which  has affected the flow of foreign investment into Yemen. He  denied that the worsening crisis can be blamed on external  factors.    In statements to AL-AHRAM published Wednesday, he noted that  charges that his country is providing refuge for terrorists  might be prompted by some Afghan Arabs' infiltration of Yemen.  He said that their infiltration takes place secretly and  without the security authorities' consent.    He pointed out that Yemen has managed to normalize its  relations with some of the Gulf Cooperation Council member  countries and is still pursuing normalization with other  countries so that these ties will return to their level  preceding the crisis of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.    He called for not using the new oil oil discoveries in his  country as pretext for contemplating partition, otherwise its  wealth will turn into a misfortune instead of a blessing.    He said that clouds still loom Arab-Iraqi ties and that  further strenuous efforts and essential amendments to the Arab  League charter are needed.    On Yemen's stand on the Middle East market, the Yemeni  foreign minister said his country is not inclined to end the  boycott of Israel before a comprehensive and just peace is  established in the region.</p>

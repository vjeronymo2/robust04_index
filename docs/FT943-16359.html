			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / People: Clark's chemistry for overseas development The Commonwealth Development Corporation, the UK's overseas development finance institution, is getting a new director of managed business, Bob Clark, 56, (right) who is retiring at the end of June from his post with ICI, where he was chief executive of ICI Explosives. He is replacing Colin Gatt, 59, who is retiring after 23 years with the CDC. Part of the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), the CDC engages in all sorts of project financing, ranging from Pounds 7.9m for an orange juice plant in northern Costa Rica, announced earlier this month, to a seed farm in Malawi. A year ago, the CDC was given UK government approval to start operating in Vietnam. The CDC is now looking to open an office in South Africa later this year; it is likely to be the conduit for some Pounds 40m of funding to the newly-democratised South Africa over the next three years. The CDC has been operating for 46 years, initially as the Colonial Development Corporation but in 1963 adopting 'Commonwealth' in place of 'Colonial'. It is now involved in some 240 projects in more than 50 different countries. Most of the projects are agriculturally-oriented; investments exceed Pounds 1.6bn, with 85 per cent of the projects now in the private sector. The CDC has an enviable managerial record, for a government-backed institution; it employs fewer than 500 staff to run its worldwide projects, with annual running costs well below many other international financial institutions. Britain's Mergers and Monopolies Commission gave the CDC high marks in June 1992, for, among other things, its cost controls and cash management. Cash-generative from its own past investments, it is currently able to invest some Pounds 200m annually in new projects; it does not any longer have 'fresh funds' from the government. As director of managed business, Clark will be responsible for administering those operations - some 30 of the largest - in which the CDC takes a managerial role, by having a seat on the board as well as investing funds.</p>

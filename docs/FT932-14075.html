			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Central Bankers' Verdict on Europe's Economy: Belgium passes central bank law BELGIUM has enacted a law guaranteeing the independence of its central bank and preventing the Treasury from borrowing from the bank, the Finance Ministry announced yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. The law was passed as part of Belgium's efforts to meet the conditions for economic and monetary union. Belgium is one of the few EC states to have enacted the legislation. 'This law guarantees notably the autonomy of the National Bank of Belgium (the central bank) and prevents all possibility of monetary financing by the Treasury from the BNB,' the ministry said. Germany already has such legislation and France has said it intends to move to an independent central bank.</p>

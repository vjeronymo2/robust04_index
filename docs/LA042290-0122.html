			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIAN-AMERICANS KEEP THE MEMORY OF 1915 GENOCIDE ALIVE  </P> <P> The lunch rush was over at Marroosh Sandwiches, an Armenian restaurant on Allen  Avenue.  </P> <P> The last telephone to-go order had been filled, the last falafel fried, the  last shawerma slices rolled in pita bread. At the window table remained only  two dark-suited, elderly men who lingered over their plates, chatting in  animated Armenian.  </P> <P> Cook Garo Krikorian took his afternoon break, sipping a demitasse of strong,  black Armenian coffee and smoking a cigarette to fortify him for the remaining  five hours of business.  </P> <P> "I'll be there," he told Boghos Kozadjian. "We close. We don't open our  business. I don't send my kids to school on the 24th."  </P> <P> "Every Armenian in the whole world who has a shop will close that day,"  Kozadjian replied.  </P> <P> "That day" is April 24, Tuesday, the anniversary of what Armenians call the  Armenian Genocide. The date commemorates the deaths of 1.5 million Armenians  who died beginning in 1915 during their relocation from Turkey.  </P> <P> Turkey, however, does not recognize the deaths as genocide and instead calls  them casualties of war. Armenians continue to pressure to have the genocide  recognized internationally and by Turkey so that reparations may be made to the  victims and their descendants.  </P> <P> For Pasadena's Armenian community, the 75th observance comes at a time of sharp  self-awareness. A special count commissioned by the city of Pasadena revealed  earlier this month that the city's Armenian-American population numbers 6,850.  The statistics depicted Pasadena's Armenian-Americans as educated,  property-owning, middle-class folk.  </P> <P> But the figures do not reveal the soul of the Armenian community. That comes  from the stories some Armenians tell, the memories they revive at this time of  year.  </P> <P> For Barkev Magarian, 74, the genocide is a childhood memory of himself as a  4-year-old, riding in a box strapped to a donkey as he fled Turkey with his  family in a caravan of 400 other Armenians marching to neighboring Syria.  </P> <P> "On the road, you did not speak Armenian because we were scared that if  somebody knew we were Armenian, they would kill us," Magarian recalled,  speaking through a translator in his Washington Boulevard apartment.  </P> <P> As the caravans passed through towns, robbers would set upon the refugees.  "Whoever they were able to kill, they did," Magarian said. "If they saw a good  dress on you, they took it away."  </P> <P> Some Armenians swallowed their gold teeth hoping to hide them from the  brigands, he said.  </P> <P> Once they reached Aleppo, Syria, the Armenian refugees lived in makeshift  houses and piled blankets on the floor for beds, Magarian said. The Armenians  gradually established themselves in Aleppo, where Magarian said he found  employment as a shoemaker and started a family.  </P> <P> But in 1960, Magarian became an immigrant again, leaving Syria for Beirut,  Lebanon, when political unrest caused economic instability. Magarian said he  sold eggs in Lebanon to support his family back in Aleppo. "I used to go to the  train station and give the money to someone on the train who would give it to  my wife," he said.  </P> <P> Eventually he brought his family to Beirut, but a civil war beginning in 1975  between the Christians and Muslims heated to the point that life became  unbearable for the Armenians who tried to stay neutral. Beirut became a  battleground with constant shelling. Normal life again ended for Magarian and  his wife.  </P> <P> "It was always scary," he said. "You didn't want to go out because a car bomb  will explode. We were afraid to go out to get food."  </P> <P> Magarian and his wife slept in their clothes, trying to find a safe place to  hide in their home during the bombing and rushing out during breaks in the  bombing to buy food and run errands.  </P> <P> They tuned to the radio to learn where bombs had fallen, and found themselves  strangely happy to learn they were alive while others had died, he said.  </P> <P> In July, Magarian and his wife finally left, uprooting themselves for a third  time in his life to find peace. He came to Pasadena.  </P> <P> "There are 10 Armenian families in my area, an Armenian grocery, Armenian  church, a pharmacy, Armenian doctors and I have a bus pass," he said, suddenly  jumping to his feet to illustrate -- with an ancient Armenian dance step -- his  frame of mind. "I am happy."  </P> <P> While Magarian is a new, legal immigrant, some of Pasadena's Armenians fled  Lebanon illegally. They include 47-year-old Harout, who asked that his real  name be withheld. Harout's memories do not trace back to the genocide. His are  of modern hardships for Armenians in Lebanon.  </P> <P> A former prosperous businessman in Beirut with 32 employees, Harout now calls  himself "a humble employee," who lied to his current boss about his illegal  status in order to get a job to support his wife and teen-age daughter.  </P> <P> In Beirut, Harout's home was in the city's Christian sector and his work in the  Muslim sector, so he found himself confronting armed men from both camps. Some  nights he couldn't cross the lines and was forced to spend the night in a  hotel.  </P> <P> Four times he was taken into custody during the civil war. Soldiers from both  camps tried to pressure neutral Armenians to take a side. "They said, 'Why  aren't you fighting in the war?' "  </P> <P> Three times bombs knocked out the windows on his car and home. He tried to sell  a vacation home in the mountains only to discover it had been stripped of its  contents, and was being occupied by the Syrian Army.  </P> <P> "They stole everything. It was empty," Harout said. "Even the wallpaper, they  stole that."  </P> <P> Harout fled Lebanon with his family in 1986 and applied for legal American  citizenship. But that procedure, already complicated, was made more so by the  closure of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. All the embassy files were shifted to  Athens, so Harout and his family had to travel to Greece to fill out papers to  stay in the United States.  </P> <P> "Do you know how much money we spent making phone calls, telexes to get the  documents, airplane tickets and hotels?" he said. "A green card cost my family  $12,000."  </P> <P> While Harout appreciates his opportunities here, he knows of others who still  remain illegal, unable to afford the high price of sanctuary.  </P> <P> "I still have two friends who don't have their green cards," he said. "They are  scared."  </P> <P> For Joy Sarafian, a fourth-generation Californian of Armenian descent, the  memories at this time of year are mainly historical.  </P> <P> "I don't feel I represent most Armenians," Sarafian said. "But if you ask me  the Armenian values, I can tell you what it meant to be my grandmother's  grandchild or my father's daughter."  </P> <P> A 37-year-old single woman who owns her own public relations company,  Sarafian's ancestors came from Fresno in the 1890s when the first wave of  Armenians fled Turkey and settled in the United States, she said.  </P> <P> Growing up in Pasadena, Sarafian said she never experienced discrimination, but  she also never felt the strong identification with the Armenian culture that is  now springing up. Assimilation was the goal.  </P> <P> "When we were growing up, there was no such thing as an Armenian school, no  such thing as an Armenian college," she said.  </P> <P> She jokes that if Armenia, now a part of the Soviet Union and Turkey, were ever  to be re-created as an independent country, she couldn't leave the United  States because there are "no Nordstroms." Yet she takes pride in the  accomplishments of her father, Armen Sarafian, founder of the American Armenian  International College in La Verne and a past Pasadena City College president.  </P> <P> Still, she finds herself puzzled as to what makes her an Armenian and what  compels her to strongly identify with her heritage.  </P> <P> "That's my question: What makes us Armenian? I don't know," she said. "Is it  the culture, the books or just pride in family? Even though I'm  fourth-generation Californian, I can honestly say that my sense of being  Armenian has never left."  </P> <P> ACTIVITIES MARKING ARMENIAN GENOCIDE  </P> <P> Area observances of the 75th anniversary of what the Armenian-American  community calls the "Armenian Genocide" include the following.  </P> <P> Lunch for the homeless, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday, Union Station, 412 S.

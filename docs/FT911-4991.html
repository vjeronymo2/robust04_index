			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Mexican reserves rise to Dollars 10.3bn MEXICO'S foreign reserves reached Dollars 10.3bn (Pounds 5.7bn) at the end of last year, Dollars 3.4bn more than in 1989, the central bank announced yesterday in an upbeat annual report. The foreign reserves figures are announced only three times a year, and are a closely watched indicator of investor confidence in the peso. Last November President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said foreign reserves stood at Dollars 8.4bn. The increase in reserves partly derives from Mexico's Dollars 3bn windfall from higher oil prices last year, and from proceeds from the privatisation of Telmex, the telephone monopoly. In the first three months of this year the Bank of Mexico is believed to have added a further Dollars 3bn to its reserves, which would bring the current total to more than Dollars 13bn. The latest figures should reassure investors worried about Mexico's ability to finance its growing current account deficit, which, according to the annual report, stood at Dollars 5.2bn last year. Thanks in part to an estimated Dollars 1.4bn in repatriated flight capital, Dollars 2.6bn in direct foreign investment and a further Dollars 2bn in foreign portfolio investment, Mexico ran a capital account surplus of Dollars 8.8bn last year. However, the amount of direct foreign investment is well below government predictions of inflows of Dollars 5bn a year. The report argued that the current account deficit mainly reflected increased private-sector investment, and would thus lead to an increase in exports. The annual report confirms the worrying growth in Mexico's money supply, suggesting that the biggest risk remains overheating of the economy. Mexico's narrow money supply grew in real terms (adjusting for 30 per cent inflation) by 26.6 per cent.</p>

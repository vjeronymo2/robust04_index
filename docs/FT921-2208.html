			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Letter: Political parties wasting money with poster advertising approach Sir, It is evident from reading David Owen's article (Management: Marketing and Advertising, March 12) on the scramble for poster sites by the political parties that much time, effort and money goes into this operation. What a pity most of it is totally wasted. In our own independent research, most political poster advertising misses the mark, with only 8 per cent of the audience recalling specific executions. This is not surprising as much of this advertising breaks the rules of effective communication. Let us use Castlemaine XXXX as an example, as this brand is featured in Owen's article. First, if a selling message from Castlemaine basically said that Fosters lager tasted like XXXX, it would not only fall foul of the regulatory bodies but would carry no persuasive selling power whatsoever. Yet this is the basic tenet of all the political ads from Labour and Tory alike. Second, if the poster had the word 'Fosters' in 3 feet high letters and 'Castlemaine' in 1 foot letters, it would be no surprise to find most people thinking the ad is for Fosters not Castlemaine. Look again at political ads  -everyone's so keen to bash the opposition, they've forgotten the basics of branded communication. The net effect of all this is further to exacerbate a cynical electorate. If parties are so keen to spend millions of pounds on ineffective advertising, how will they spend the cash in the nation's coffers?

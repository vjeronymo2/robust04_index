			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Fashion: The evidence points to the judge in moonboots - Dressing for the Professions, The Lawyer THE LONG arm of the lawyer is dressed, according to convention, in sombre black, charcoal or navy. This is not so true universally as it used to be, except for formal court appearances, but the outside world could be forgiven for assuming that little has changed since the days of Dickens' Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Lawyers never feature in the 'best-dressed' lists and the law is arguably still the most conservatively dressed of professions partly because of what City solicitor Julian Harris calls 'the dignity of the law.' Lord MacKay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, recently issued a discussion paper questioning the basis of formal court dress, but, says Harris: 'Clients like to see their lawyer in a gown and a sober suit. It implies seriousness and reliability. I always wonder how American lawyers, in short-sleeved summer shirts and no tie, command any respect.' The word that trips most regularly off legal tongues in relation to their dress is 'professional'. The universal drive is for appropriateness, although the sombre public image of lawyers is self-perpetuating in that most like to dress as the client would expect. There is also a tacit suggestion that discussing dress trivialises the profession. Yet thinking about their own dress and commenting on that of others is rife. It is perhaps inevitable that a profession which thrives on details and minutiae, and which dresses in uniform, should register any act of non-conformity - a tendency magnified by the cloistered, collegiate atmosphere of the Inns of Court. Equally, there are those who, within the obvious constraints, make a point of expressing their individuality, subtly. Charles Gray QC, a libel specialist involved in many cases brought against the media, is regarded as cutting a dapper figure. His wide-lapelled, double-breasted chalkstripe suit - bought off-the-peg - gold cufflinks and discreetly bright tie are as effortlessly stylish as the comfortable antique furniture in his chambers. But he says: 'This is a profession where one is deliberately not making a statement. A court is a formal situation where minimum standards must be maintained and not to do so would have a deleterious effect. So we agree on a dress code and it is not an issue. Anyone keen on exotic dress would be unlikely to choose the Bar as a career.' He agrees there have been changes. 'Twenty years ago barristers still wore a costume of black jacket, striped trousers and bowler hat and more recently a waistcoat was the rule in court. Now double-breasted suits are more fashionable. Standard dress does alter but not in a time-scale of less than five years.' Julian Harris is more openly flamboyant. His suits are traditional enough - with a penchant for nostalgia. He has three-piece suits made by Hackett - but he believes 'one can express individuality with colour, in ties, shirts and socks.' A senior partner once told him that 'a tie should always mean something,' implying it should be club or regimental. To Harris it should mean something about the wearer's personality. His own occasional treat is a Hermes tie, justified by the fact that at least two of his clients wear them. 'Years ago when I was still articled, I once wore a three-piece tweed suit. The senior partner merely said, 'off to the country are we?' but I've never done it again.' Even less is needed to cause comment out of London. Nick Toovey is a partner in a big Cambridge firm, with clients varying from farmers to academics and high-tech companies. 'Our style is not as provincial as the brown tweed suits you might find in a market town practice,' he says. 'I dress as I think the client would expect and that usually means a dark suit. But in summer I occasionally wear a lightweight suit or jacket and trousers which my colleagues find quite radical. I also like the individuality of bow-ties which are a bit of fun when the client is appropriate.' Another aspect of the law's eye for detail is the network of rules governing dress in court which are rigorously applied by some judges and not just elderly male ones. Baroness Mallalieu, QC, saw a particularly fierce woman silk, now retired, castigate a young female barrister wearing a black but sleeveless dress. The barrister bought a pair of long evening gloves and cut off the hands. Women in striped shirts were known to hide in the robing room lavatories until the same silk was out of the way. Lady Mallalieu was told off as a young barrister when, having scraped her long fair hair back so it was invisible from the front, the resulting ponytail showed outside her gown. Dress is still a sensitive issue for the growing number of women lawyers. Some fashion companies aim to help - Austin Reed has a specialised department and runs conferences at its stores round the country. Robe suppliers Ede and Ravenscroft recently asked young designer Bella Freud to produce a capsule collection, though its uncompromisingly pinstriped nature is not to everyone's taste. They are also stocking the shirt range by Madeleine Hamilton, herself a former solicitor, who appreciates the need for good-quality shirts that are plain, comfortable but with interesting details. Younger women lawyers see little need for such specialist sartorial resources. Gillie Belsham is a young partner in a City solicitors' firm. Her work, which concerns marine insurance, includes court appearances, client meetings and ship inspections worldwide, and gives scope for a surprisingly varied wardrobe. 'I am not afraid to look as if I'm interested in fashion as an expression of my personality,' she says. 'It should never obscure my professionalism but I won't spend my working life in a sub-knee A-line skirt. I want to look and feel confident and efficient and don't want to think about my clothes once they are on. And the law is no longer a 'man's world' where one might feel the need to ape men in pinstripes or mannish jackets.' She has evolved her own version of the working woman's wardrobe - non-matching jacket and skirt just above the knee, with the jacket dark for court, bright or pastel for client meetings, the skirt always dark, with a simple silk or cotton shirt or cashmere sweater, complementary but discreet jewellery and bright lipstick. She likes feminine, fitted jackets, either short and curvaceous or long and collarless, and finds she gets more mileage and fewer mistakes from designer labels than the middle market - Valentino, St Laurent and Anne Klein are her favourites. Having declared her interest in fashion, she finds her style changing faster than the men's five-year-plus timescale. The power suit looks dated now and chiffon scarves, softer necklines and more fluid fabrics like crepe are creeping into her wardrobe. A wrap crepe skirt looks smarter with her fitted jacket than the straight jersey skirt she would previously have chosen. Ironically, her first appearance in the new longline skirt caused as much comment as the first short skirts did five years ago and most women still choose short for court. In the end, it is perhaps a matter of what you can get away with, and for a competent and confident lawyer that can be a lot. Baroness Mallalieu knows at least one male barrister with a ponytail and several women silks who wear trousers in chambers. 'Then there is the question of boots in court,' she says. 'I've always worn them, ever since I appeared in a freezing cold county court and discovered afterwards that under his robes the judge was wearing moonboots.'</p>

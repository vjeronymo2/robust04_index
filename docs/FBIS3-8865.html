Hanzel was state secretary in the Justice Ministry under  ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's government.    "We have to create the right conditions for an independent  judiciary, and to safeguard its function financially," Hanzel  said. The problems of courts which had no money for electricity  and stamps had to be solved immediately, he said.    "However, the lack of finances in the judiciary should not  be  connected with the pay of judges," Hanzel said, adding that he  believed that judges' pay was commensurate with that of other  civil servants.    Hanzel said he did not think that Slovakia needed a law on  the protection of the republic, because the protection of the  republic and its representatives was sufficiently assured by the  the legal code. He announced himself in favour of abolishing  Articles 102 and 103 of the criminal code, which concern the  defamation of the republic and its representatives.    New Defense Minister Pavol Kanis said he wanted to carry on  with what his predecessor Imrich Andrejcak had successfully  managed to do concerning the creation of ties with West European  security structures, and also to solve the problems of young men  after they entered military service. Kanis is the deputy  chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL).    He added that he too had taken part in the plans bringing  Slovakia nearer to West European structures, so there should not  be any problems with continuity regarding the Ministry's  previous work.    "I do not put my own ideas above the needs of society.  Today, however, it is clear to most people that early elections  are essential for the calming of society, and these should be  held in the autumn at the latest," the new defense minister  said, asked if he could imagine staying in his post until 1996  which is when elections would take place normally.</p>

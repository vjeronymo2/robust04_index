			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by Josef </F> Ferenczy; place and date not given: "The Germans Are To Play a  Greater Role in Europe"]    [Text] [Ferenczy] What can the Germans do to deepen the  growing together of Europe?    [Boross] One of the most important events during the  breakdown of the world system that called itself communist was  the establishment of German unity. It also resulted in the  greater international political importance and responsibility of  the FRG.    This responsibility is particularly important today since a  bloody war is raging in our region and extremist views are  rousing excessive passions.    In our opinion, the economic power, the political weight,  and  the geographical situation commit Germany to assuming an even  more active and courageous role in the interest of European  stability in Central Europe.    The competition between two world powers confronting each  other was terminated by the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  However, this leads to a reconsideration of the world's  security structure.    It is above all NATO's task to create it. When we stress  that European integration is the priority of Hungary's foreign  policy, we also understand by it our accession to NATO as our  basic objective.    [Ferenczy] Are you concerned about the development in  Russia?    [Boross] It is, of course, vital for Hungary and the whole  of the international community that the democratic changes in  Russia cannot be reversed. The newly adopted constitution  guarantees this.    We hope that it will be possible to finally solve the  political discussions provoked by extremists within the  framework of laws, by peaceful negotiations, and in the course  of mutual compromises by the development of the institutional  system of the new, democratic rule-of-law state. In this way,  the danger of chaos and civil wars, which, in addition to its  unpredictable political consequences, would reduce the chances  for accession to Europe, would be averted.    The advance of individual extremist forces in the elections  is not disastrous, but only a signal, which, however, has to be  taken seriously.    [Ferenczy] Why are politics failing in the Yugoslavia  conflict?    [Boross] The south Slav conflict may involve the following  dangers for Europe:    -- The aggressive war of conquest is again becoming an  accepted means for the solution of political, ideological, and  religious differences.    -- In the public Western media a mental iron curtain may  develop, that is to say, the view that Eastern Central Europe is  to solve its accumulated problems itself because the West does  not intend to import a bankrupt's estate, could prevail.    -- The most serious practical consequence is the influx of  people who have been expelled from their homeland or are on the  run to neighboring and developed Western countries -- up to the  point of a mass movement. As a result of this phenomenon,  extremist and fascist views and groups might gain ground, which  is a challenge that has to be taken seriously by the rule-of-law  states.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian wool is selling well at firm prices. Demand from Japan and the EEC is good, and China is also said to be behind some of the Japanese buying. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator has maintained last week's small gain and is unchanged at 545c/kg. There was almost a complete clearance at Wednesday's Newcastle sale, a mere 2 per cent was passed in at Adelaide, and 10pc at Fremantle. Erratic fluctuations in the US and Australian dollars keep prices changing even where wool itself is selling well. The trade believes they undermine confidence, and add to recessionary pressures.</p>

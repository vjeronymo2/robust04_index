			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Risks Must Be Taken To Succeed--Part With  Hothouse-Nurtured Japanese Management; Overturn Domestic  Rankings in New Market    There are huge potentials as well as various risks in China.  However, now that dependence on the U.S. market has reached the  limit, Japanese companies should manage their own risks and  develop the Chinese frontier. There are no returns without risks.  <H3>  "Neophyte Group to Virgin Market"--Uniden Corp. Depends on  Youngsters in Thirties </H3>   Direct investment by Japan in China during the past year  totaled $2.1 billion, surpassing the aggregate amount of the  previous 13 years. The underlying factor is the increase of  smaller enterprises planning to make inroads into China because  of deteriorating profitability of domestic production with the  rapid yen appreciation but views are being raised that "the time  is gradually approaching to reassess making entries as stopgap  measures" (Akiko Mase, deputy chief of Joint Venture Consulting  Office, Japan-China Association on Economy and Trade).    However, among Japanese firms, there are some which are  promoting business with China with a clear vision and long-range  strategy. Though by no means in the industrial mainstream in  Japan, these companies, which have begun to occupy important  positions ranking with Overseas Chinese and U.S.-European  capital in the new territory called China, are showing the  frontier spirit which big corporations have begun to lose.    Xinyou S&amp;T Development Co., Ltd.--a joint venture of  communications equipment manufacturer Uniden Corp. and Chinese  state-operated investment company CITIC (China International  Trust and Investment Corp.)--which sells Uniden products, opened  its fourth domestic branch office in Wuhan in mid-September.    Mariko Osato (30 years old) assumed the position of chief  representative of the new resident employees' office. Osato was  interviewed when she returned to Beijing to attend an  electronics show. She said nonchalantly, "Last week, I went  alone to Wuhan and selected the office location. I will be  residing in Wuhan from next week and I'll be alone for the time  being. However, there's no need to worry. I have many things to  do."    Osato joined Uniden only a year ago. After graduating from  Tokyo University, she worked at Japan IBM. Subsequently, she  enrolled at Northwestern University and earned an MBA degree.  While in the United States, she was recruited by Uniden and soon  after returning and joining the company, she was sent to  Beijing. She is by no means an expert on China and she began to  study Chinese after her assignment there, so she is a neophyte.    "Looking at barefooted persons, you can think what a  terrible  place you came to or you can think of all the shoes you can sell  here, so there are two ways of thinking for a person and a  company. China is a frontier." That is the way Osato thinks.    At present, Uniden has eight resident employees in China,  including Hong Kong. Nobuya Sada, chief representative in Hong  Kong, formerly served in the subsidiary, Uniden 21, and is 30  years old. He had an outstanding record in the company's foreign  sales of crystal oscillators and was handpicked by the parent  company. Isao Sakai, chief representative of the Shenzhen  office, is also 30 years old. Akira Fukushima, chief  representative of the Shanghai office, is 28 years old.    Both were unequaled top salesmen in Tokyo. All of the  employees are young and each is competing in the huge Chinese  market as the chief of his own sector.    Eyeing the potential of the Chinese market, Uniden started  consignment production of portable telephones in Shenzhen in  April 1989 and started joint production at an adjoining new  plant in October 1989.    Chairman Yoshio Fujimoto's pet theory is: "With one-fourth  of  the world's population, China is certain to surpass  U.S.-European markets. In the near future, China will account  for one-half of this company's sales."    Uniden's strengths are its young, highly efficient force as  well as the selection of a powerful partner, CITIC. CITIC is a  type of conglomerate with a wide range of activities, including  trade and finances, in addition to investment operations, and  has a big pipeline to the core of the government. In June 1993,  Uniden received approval for a type of portable telephone for  China only two months after application, a procedure that  normally requires from half to one year, thanks to CITIC's  support.    The challenge now to Uniden is to break the domination of  the  U.S. giant, Motorola, which holds approximately 80 percent of  the portable telephone market in China. In 1993, Uniden hopes to  acquire a 20-percent share of the market, estimated at about  500,000 units, and rise to the position next to Motorola. Takuya  Kumagaya, who is serving as the general manager of Xinyou S&amp;T  Development Co., says: "In China, companies with marketing  strengths in their home countries do not necessarily win. Since  this is a virgin market, you can devise operations through your  own means. China's attraction is that neophyte groups, without  preconceived ideas, have a better chance of displaying their  strengths." Kumagaya, a former Sony technician, is another  member of the group that studied in the United States and is  only 39 years old.    Resident employees are staying in the same hotel in Beijing,  where the main office is located, and gather almost nightly to  drink and encourage each other. The vigor forgotten by Japanese  companies that had passed the growth stage is alive here.  <H3>  Rapidly Consolidating Production, Distribution, and  Retailing--Yaohan Is Taking Advantage of Being First </H3>   In state-owned department stores, 7 percent of the  merchandise is stolen by employees and others, goods are  carelessly thrust to customers, employees do not greet  customers, employees litter the floor, etc. That is China, but  Yaohan is trying to implant the Japanese-style customer-first  retail service.    As the first store in China, the Saide shopping center  (Beijing Yaohan) was opened last fall. Four times a day,  Masahiro Kurosugi, the general manager, stands behind the cash  register clerk and checks on the customer service of sales  personnel. He checks to see if product names and prices are  being read aloud as the cash register is punched, whether  customers are being greeted sincerely, etc.; at first, employees  resented his close guidance.    Kurosugi says: "There is still a misunderstanding in China  that capitalism means moneymaking. I want to convey to the  Chinese people the cultural aspect that service is the heart of  capitalism and that, if one pleases the customer, one will  benefit in the future."    Yaohan Japan's investment ratio in this store is 19 percent.  The Chinese subscriber, CVIC (China New Technology Creation  Investment Co., Ltd.) has the authority over finances,  merchandise stocking, and price setting; Yaohan only has the  right to act as business adviser under the contract.    At first, the Chinese placed illegal prices of 100 yuan  (approximately 2,000 yen) on a package of sashimi for two or  three persons, allegedly because the main customers of  foodstuffs were Japanese who were rich, and asked to sell  teakettles next to the cosmetics corner near the first-floor  main entrance because "they sell well." Kurosugi painstakingly  explained why each of these actions was wrong. At times, he let  the counterparts do as they please and waited patiently until  they realized their own mistakes.    His efforts paid off and Kurosugi says, "In less than a  year,  the employees certainly changed. Personally, I'm beginning to  think that the idea of service is taking root unexpectedly fast  in Chinese minds."    Chairman Kazuo Wada of Yaohan states: "In Japan, we cannot  compete with our major predecessors like Daiei, Inc. and  Ito-Yokado Co. However, Asia and China are unopened new  territory." The aggressive inroad into China is based on Wada's  thinking which stresses the importance of garnering markets  first.    Starting with construction of the distribution center in  Beijing and building of production bases for its own products,  such as the ham factory in Shenzhen, Yaohan's large-scale plans  to consolidate production, distribution, and retailing are  advancing rapidly. Ahead are plans to establish 1,000 stores in  China with the year 2010 as the target. The Beijing store and  the Shanghai Pudong department store, scheduled to open next  year, are the first steps. "If we can quickly nurture personnel  with accumulated know-how, becoming the leading store in China  will not be a dream" (Kurosugi).    Yaohan is receiving tie-up offers from 40 to 50 Japanese  cosmetics, toiletries, and candy manufacturers, covering  operations from production to sales in China. There is the  expectation that "a retail-oriented distribution pattern, which  is impossible in Japan where the manufacturers' domination is  firm, is attainable in China" (Masaichi Tajima, Yaohan vice  president).  <H3>  Yamaha Undertakes Joint Venture Promptly--Aiming for Joint  Production With Future Rival </H3>   Traveling 30 minutes by car along the northern bank of the  Yangzi River from Chongqing City in Sichuan Province, one begins  to see on the left side a section along which a concrete wall  stretches for a distance. The area behind the wall is the  property of the state munitions manufacturer, Chongqing  Construction Industry (Group) Co.    In a joint venture with the Construction Industry Co.,  Yamaha  Motor Co. is building a two-wheeled vehicle factory at this  site. Plans are to produce 60,000 vehicles annually in FY94, at  the start of operations, and 200,000 units annually in FY97.    Shozo Arai, Yamaha director in charge of the China project  headquarters, gives the following explanation for the decision  on the joint venture: "China produced approximately 2 million  two-wheeled vehicles in 1992 and is already one of the world's  largest producers. The growth of China's two-wheeled vehicle  industry will inevitably continue. In the near future, it will  surely become Japan's tough rival. Therefore, assuming the  risks, cooperative relations must be established with China  using our technological superiority as the trump card." The  strategy is to get close to China voluntarily and find the way  for joint survival instead of competing as rivals.    China's annual production of two-wheeled vehicles was 3  million this year and is expected to reach 5 million in several  years. In contrast, Japan's domestic production was  approximately 3 million vehicles in 1992 but production is  leveling off. It is certain that China will become the big  producer of two-wheeled vehicles, leaving Japan far behind.    Two-wheeled vehicles account for 50 percent of Yamaha's  sales. Of the four domestic two-wheeled vehicle manufacturers,  Yamaha depends most heavily on two-wheeled vehicles. The  appearance of a powerful rival will have a big impact.  Therefore, it joined forces before the future rival can become  competitive.    For that reason, business with China was started early. In  December 1979, soon after the reform and liberalization line was  adopted, Yamaha held a product show independently in Guangzhou.  Subsequently, the company provided technical guidance to  motocross riders in Guangdong Province and established service  centers in Guangzhou and Beijing. In 1983, the company concluded  a technological assistance contract with Chongqing Construction  Machinery Plant, the predecessor of Construction Industry Co.,  which is the present joint venture partner.  <H3>  Daihatsu Ranks Next to Volkswagen--Failure To Make Inroad  into United States Was Fortuitous </H3>   Yamaha's sincere cooperation with the Chinese side helped  win  the trust of the Chongqing City government. Moreover, Chen  Zisheng, president and general manager of Construction Industry  Co., is a deputy of the National People's Congress elected from  Chongqing City. He has a pipeline to key personages.    There are 21 technicians from Japan stationed at the  joint-venture company, "Yamaha Construction." The biggest future  task is the nurture of affiliated parts manufacturers. The  success of local operations depends on whether high-quality  parts can be procured stably. For this reason, for three months  from March 1993, machinery manufacturers in Sichuan Province  were personally inspected.    In Chongqing, a leading industrial city in China, production  bases are still scattered in mountainous areas for national  defense reasons. Just to visit one company requires a jolting  10-hour one-way car ride. Once a trip is undertaken, it is not  possible to return to Chongqing for one or two months.    However, the support of the Construction Industry Co. was of  big help on this occasion. They took care of various matters  from selecting which parts manufacturers to visit and obtaining  permission to thoroughly inspect manufacturing processes.    Main parts manufacturers have already been narrowed down to  about 30 companies. Of the 500 parts to be procured outside of  the company, trial manufacture of 100 parts was consigned and  the parts began to arrive from around August. "Initially, we had  thought that it would be a success if the acceptance rate were  about 20 percent, but 80 percent of the parts passed inspection.  We will continue technical training on a three-year plan,  henceforth, and hope to raise the domestic production rate from  the 55 percent set when operations started to 80 percent." So  stated Tsutomu Akusawa, assistant general manager, who was  surprised at the unexpectedly fast improvement of China's  production technology capability.    For the time being, Yamaha plans to retain the profits of  the  joint venture instead of allotting them to the main company.  Rather than making immediate distribution of profits for the  sake of Japan's main office, Yamaha opted to sustain growth in  China.    Of the Japanese firms succeeding in China, many are not  major  companies in Japan. For example, Kentaro Shimizu, director in  charge of the overseas business division of Daihatsu Motor Co.,  says: "When major companies were making inroads into the United  States, our company wanted to enter, but couldn't. For that  reason, we concentrated our efforts on Asia but strategically,  that was fortunate for us."    Daihatsu is presently producing 50,000 vehicles a year  locally and estimates it can expand production to 150,000 in  1997. Of course, it is the leader among Japanese firms and, even  including U.S.-European companies, it ranks second after  Volkswagen.  <H3>  Limit Reached in Low-Risk Business Dependent on United  States--Self-Reform Needed To Attain Growth </H3>   After World War II, Japanese companies sold surplus  industrial products to the United States and continued to grow  using that as a leverage. Simply put, under such circumstances,  businesses could be run profitably by only watching U.S. trends.  Risk factors, such as market selection and timing and scale of  investment, did not have to be considered carefully as long as  firms were under the U.S. umbrella. Japanese companies, which  were given a stable export market and the opportunity to operate  at low risk, were able to manage somehow if they did not neglect  efforts to move ahead.    However, it has become impossible to run on the track laid  by  the United States. Japanese companies can no longer depend on  the U.S. market. Putting aside firms that are determined to  survive only in the saturated domestic market, many Japanese  firms, which think that "enterprises must seek growth," will  probably be forced to enter the Chinese market, willy-nilly.    China is a high-risk market that is totally different from  the United States. There are many risks that are different in  nature from past risks, such as inadequate legal systems and  business methods that are totally unlike capitalistic countries,  defective financial systems, bottlenecks in distribution,  energy, and communications infrastructure, etc. However, it is  difficult for Japanese companies to escape from the current  confined environment unless they enter China. The strength is  needed to risk entry into the huge Chinese market and survive  without being swallowed up.    Wang Songnian, director of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese  Association and chairman of Ashu Kogyo (Asian Industrial  Promotion) Co., a consulting firm for investments in China,  points out that Japanese companies entering China fail because  "those in charge do not think on the local level." In Japanese  firms, responsibilities are shared so it is difficult for a  person to make decisions independently and few responsible  officials can speak Chinese. Persons who make decisions might go  on short visits, but do not take the trouble to learn the actual  situation firsthand by living there. He says that it is  important to undertake the task with the intent to be personally  involved instead of making judgments based simply on desktop  feasibilities studies.    As for these Japanese firms in the effluent stream, so to  speak, whether they view their ventures to achieve success  through their own means as "making inroads into China because  they cannot succeed in Japan" or "because Japanese society is so  rigid that new businesses cannot be accepted" will determine the  dynamism of their future development.    Japanese-style management, which is strong on joint sharing  of information based on bottom-up collective operations and  internal group control, is suitable for moving rapidly in a  specified direction, but is likely to be slow in making  judgments when the direction must be changed expediently in  response to risks. Developing the frontier called China is a  challenge to Japanese corporations to undertake self-reform. To  be tested is the Japanese-style management which was nurtured in  a hothouse.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NOT EASY, BUT SOME AMERICAN FIRMS ARE MAKING IT IN JAPAN;  </P> <P> EXPORTS: PAMPERS HAVE SUCCEEDED BECAUSE PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CHANGED THEM TO  SUIT THE MARKETPLACE.  </P> <P> In a cramped neighborhood drugstore alongside a case of murky Oriental herb  drinks sits a stack of large plastic packages bearing a face and logo familiar  to millions of American parents.  </P> <P> "Pam-pahs," as they are called in Japan -- Pampers diapers to U.S. consumers --  are one of those increasingly common species in Japan: an American product that  not only sells, but sells well.  </P> <P> At a time when polls show Americans growing restive with the onslaught of  Japanese products and money in the United States, a trend is starting in the  other direction.  </P> <P> While IBM and McDonald's are the best-known examples of American products that  have made it in Japan, so too have Domino's Pizza (with the same 30-minute  delivery guarantee); Schick razor blades; Oreo cookies; Kodak film; M&amp;Ms;  Nike shoes; Levi's blue jeans; Microsoft computer software; Haagen-Dazs ice  cream, and McIlhenney Co. Tabasco sauce, to name a few.  </P> <P> Coca-Cola makes more money selling soft drinks in Japan, including its  made-for-Japan canned coffee and Oolong tea, than in the United States,  according to analysts here.  </P> <P> Few of the companies will say it has been easy. In fact, some recently have  chosen to bail out, deterred by the high cost of operating here and the long  time it takes to get established.  </P> <P> But even U.S. trade negotiators acknowledge that it can be done. A composite  study of a successful foreign firm prepared by the U.S. Embassy and used in  recent trade talks concluded that foreigners can make it here, but "government  regulations, lack of antitrust enforcement and traditional business practices  combined to make this an extremely difficult and costly process."  </P> <P> Pampers' experience here shows what it involves. Procter &amp; Gamble Co.,  maker of the diaper, created the Japanese market for disposable diapers in 1977  and then nearly lost it to more creative Japanese competitors a few years  later. Now, after a costly redesign of business practices and the product  itself, Pampers has become the single best-selling brand again.  </P> <P> "It's a totally different ballgame here," said Ronald G. Pearce, president of  Procter &amp; Gamble Far East Inc. "It has been a rough and rocky road. But  today, after many years of hard and expensive learning, we are a factor here."  </P> <P> When Pampers arrived in Japan in 1977, it was virtually the only disposable  diaper on the market. Japanese mothers, eager to shed the mess of washing cloth  diapers, snapped them up. Pampers dominated the market for the next several  years.  </P> <P> But the diapers were imported without modification from the United States, and  they were not quite suited to Japanese consumer needs. Made entirely of pulp,  they were bulky, which made them difficult to transport and then store in tiny  Japanese apartments, and they often leaked, making them a nuisance to use at  night or on outings.  </P> <P> Japanese companies, meanwhile, did what Japanese companies have done for years  when shown a promising new development: They modified it and made it better.  Working to come up with a more compact and absorbent diaper more to the liking  of Japanese mothers, Japanese companies developed super-absorbent polymers,  basically powders that sop up liquid and turn it into a gel. Instead of ending  up with a wet, leaky diaper after four hours of use, they made a diaper that,  in the box, was half the size of Pampers and, on the baby, absorbed liquids,  leaving the child dry and less prone to diaper rash.  </P> <P> "They made a better mousetrap. It just revolutionized the industry, and P&amp;G  didn't see it coming," said Joy Walbert, an analyst with Salomon Bros. in  Tokyo.  </P> <P> Within months, the Japanese diaper brands -- "Moonies" and "Merries" -- had  swept the market. By 1983, "Pampers was virtually driven out of business,"  acknowledged Pearce. The competition combined with other problems in P&amp;G's  Japanese operation, he said, and "we actually came very close to joining the  ranks, along with hundreds of foreign companies, who have failed to enter the  Japanese market successfully."  </P> <P> Pearce declined to discuss the finances of Procter &amp; Gamble Far East. But  it was clear by the mid-1980s that the company needed a major revamping, and  not only in the diaper area.  </P> <P> That meant better research about what Japan's quality-conscious consumers  wanted. It also meant closer relationships with wholesalers and retailers, to  make them feel part of the company and more loyal to the product. P&amp;G  earlier had made inroads into Japan's complex distribution system; now it also  began offering costly services unheard of in the United States but expected in  Japan, such as 24-hour delivery.  </P> <P> Most importantly, though, it meant making a better product. In 1985, Procter  &amp; Gamble came out with its own version of super-absorbent Pampers.  </P> <P> "We were so far behind, we just had to do it step by step," said Pearce. It was  an expensive and time-consuming process of the sort that has convinced other  foreign firms to not bother with the Japanese market. It also has produced a  diaper that Americans living in Japan say is much softer and more compact --  better -- than U.S.-made Pampers. Today, according to Pearce, Pampers is the  best-selling disposable diaper in Japan. Salomon's Walbert and other analysts  estimate that it has about a 25% market share. P&amp;G has several other  best-selling products here as well, including Japan's top-selling shampoo-rinse  combination, a compact laundry detergent and, one of the hit products of the  last year, Whisper sanitary napkins. According to Walbert, Whisper is so  popular because P&amp;G did several years of market research, using test  groups, and came up with a product tailored to the needs of Japanese women,  such as having a wrapper that makes almost no noise when opened.  </P> <P> The result has been that P&amp;G's Japanese sales now exceed $1 billion, and  Japan probably will soon replace Germany as the company's largest foreign  market. An added benefit, according to Walbert, is that P&amp;G's huge Japanese  competitors are now so busy defending their flanks that they have little time  to challenge P&amp;G in the United States and other markets.  </P> <P> Pearce said he believes that the Japanese market is not as closed as many  critics have suggested. A company succeeds in Japan if it is willing to adapt,  both its product and its way of doing business, and is willing to accept that  it takes time and money to get established here, he said.  </P> <P> "From our point of view, it's different. We accepted those differences and  found a way to break through," said Pearce. "You just can't roll out something  here that worked in another country and expect it to sell."  </P> <P> It can be a long and tiring process, he said, but "our experience has shown  that the market was open enough for us to get in."  </P></p>

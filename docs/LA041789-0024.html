			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEMORIAL SERVICE HELD FOR SLAYING VICTIM  </P> <P> Relatives of three victims of confessed killer Robert A. Berdella gathered at a  Raytown, Mo., church to memorialize one of the victims, a Canoga Park man.  </P> <P> The service Saturday at Spring Valley Baptist Church was held four years to the  day that Robert A. Sheldon was asphyxiated at Berdella's home. Sheldon was the  second of six young men that Berdella confessed last year to torturing and  killing in his house between July 6, 1984, and Aug. 5, 1987.  </P> <P> Sheldon's skull and some teeth were found in Berdella's house. The skull of  another man, Larry Pearson of Wichita, was later found buried in Berdella's  back yard.  </P> <P> The remains of the other victims -- Mark Wallace, Todd Stoops, Walter James  Ferris and Gerald D. Howell -- were not recovered. Berdella told investigators  that the bodies were buried in a city landfill.  </P> <P> Berdella pleaded guilty to killing the men and is serving a life sentence  without parole in the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City.  </P> <P> Robert J. Sheldon of Canoga Park had said that he and his ex-wife had planned  to bury their son in California, but then decided to have the service in  Missouri as a memorial to Berdella's victims and their families. Burial was in  Mount Moriah Cemetery.  </P> <P> Sheldon, his ex-wife, Connie Sheldon of Arleta, and their daughter, Tammy  Martinez of Sun Valley, were among the two dozen people who attended the  service. Parents of two other of Berdella's victims, Ferris and Howell, also  attended.  </P> <P> Sheldon also is survived by two brothers, Michael Sheldon and Jeffrey Sheldon  of Arleta; his paternal grandparents and his maternal grandfather.  </P></p>

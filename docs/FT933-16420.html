			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gloomy Asda hits retailers BEARISH remarks on the food retail market by the chief executive of Asda sent the company's shares downward and cast further gloom on the medium-term outlook for the sector. Food retailing analysts warned that a welter of downgrades were likely to add more downward pressure to the sector in the coming weeks, as the market takes the Asda chief's caution on board. Mr Archie Norman said that the 'halcyon days' for the UK food retailing industry were now over, with a decline in growth and the industry facing increasing overcapacity. During the next five years, margins would come under further pressure, as the leading supermarket chains attempted to remain competitive with new discount retailers. 'Archie has really stuck the knife in,' said one gloomy specialist. 'The sector is totally friendless.' The remarks took the shine off good results from Asda, which reported profits of Pounds 142.1m, following a loss last year of Pounds 364.8m. Despite this, Asda shares slumped nearly 10 per cent, dropping 6 to 65 1/2 p in hefty turnover of 41m, with a further 8m equivalent being traded in the options market. Disappointment in the group's operating margins compared with its main rivals was also being expressed in the market, raising doubts as to whether the stock will retain its premium rating. Among other retailers, J Sainsbury slid 12 to 467p, Tesco dipped 4 to 211p and Argyll declined 8 to 317p.</p>

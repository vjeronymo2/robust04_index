			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Trafalgar offer Northern Electric forged ahead 33 to 1018p as the market braced itself for a long drawn out bid battle after Trafalgar House finally launched its long-awaited Pounds 1.2m bid for the distributor. Northern issued a statement after the market closed rejecting the offer. Active trading of the stock following news of the bid saw volume rise to a hefty 4.8m shares by the close. Last week's confirmation by Trafalgar that it was considering a bid for Northern meant yesterday's move was not a surprise, but dealers suggested: 'This is only the opening shot for what will be a bitter battle.' More cautious observers such as Mr Nigel Hawkins at Hoare Govett suggested that the bid could be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. However, the general view was that Trafalgar could eventually capture its prize but would have to 'substantially' increase its current offer. Mr Kevin Lapwood at Smith New Court said: 'The tax benefits to Trafalgar added to the break-up value of Northern, which we believe to be 1125p, should see a take-out price of more than 1200p.' The current offer from Trafalgar House values each Northern share at 1077p, with the cash alternative at 1048p. Mr Adam Forsyth and Mr Richard Alderman at NatWest Securities said simply: 'We view the Trafalgar bid for Northern as fairly priced but not high enough to win round the company's management. Without that support, persuading share holders to accept could be difficult.' The emergence of a 'white knight' has not been ruled out, and several market participants continued to point to Scottish Power as a probable suitor. Shares in that group shed 5 to 332p on the talk. Trafalgar eased a penny to 73p. A combination of a stock shortage, general recovery and reports of encouraging sales of video tapes and compact discs helped Kingfisher advance 15 to 429p, in trade of 3.2m. There was a big seller of Storehouse which left the shares trailing 4 1/4 at 208p xd. Volume of 1.7m included a block of 700,000 that was dealt at 209p. The stock had until recently been one of the better performers in an otherwise dull retail sector. Among food retailers, two-way business in Asda Group brought volume of 10m shares, making it the day's most actively traded stock in the Footsie. The share price hardened  1/2 to 64 1/2 p. Negative press comment weakened drinks group Bass and the shares closed 3 1/2 cheaper at 516p. Worries about the growing 'bootleg' beer market cast a shadow over brewing group Vaux. The shares gave up 6 at 220p. Bid speculation boosted several stocks among the regional electricity companies. East Midlands, which brought the results season in the recs to a close with bumper figures, raced 41 ahead to 851p, while London put on 31 at 774p. Hong Kong related stocks HSBC and Standard Chartered fell 1 1/2 to 698p and 4 to 278p following criticism in the financial press over the Far Eastern market's prospects. Merchant bank SG Warburg lost more of its bid premium following a welter of comment in the weekend press. The bank also announced that it was losing one of its senior directors, Mr Peter Twatchmann, and some insiders were suggesting the change was linked to comments Mr Twatchmann had made about Warburg's fixed interest division  - thus highlighting the group's internal strife. The shares fell 28 to 685p. Some investors were switching into Kleinwort Benson, up 12 at 535p. Pharmaceuticals group Huntingdon International leapt 10 to 30p after announcing a new chairman, Mr Roger Pinnington. Reckitt &amp; Colman rose 8 to 593p after its proposed acquisition of LK&amp;F Household was approved by shareholders. Wellcome fell 7 to 678p, with dealers suggesting that investors had been switching funds into Glaxo, which was held back on Friday by some negative sentiment. Glaxo shares moved forward 13 1/2 to 639 1/2 p. Fisons was restrained, but news that it had ended its US marketing agreement with Rhone Poulenc came too late to hit the shares significantly and they finished unchanged at 114p. However, one analyst said the news essentially marked the end of the US prospects for Tilade, the asthma treatment and Fisons most important drug. Oil major BP was one of the most heavily traded stocks as a rise of 3 1/2 to 425p, against 375p ex-dividend for BT, ensured a change of leadership at the top of the FT-SE 100 league table and consolidated the oil group's rehabilitation in the eyes of investors. Pict Petroleum rose 14 to 155p after the company became the latest to join the increasingly popular bid club. The oil group issued a statement saying its 48.3 per cent shareholder Amerada Hess was in talks with Premier Consolidated Oilfields that could lead to a bid for all of Pict's share capital. Shares of Premier rose 1 1/2 to 23p. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi dipped 3 to 151p following consideration of the implications of the management upheavals. US press comment sent Cable and Wireless rattling ahead in 5.9m turnover, with the stock market beginning to scent the possibility of some sort of hive-off. The shares climbed 7 to 368 1/2 p.</p>

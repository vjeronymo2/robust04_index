			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "The Cause of Tense Relations; Partnership </F> for Peace--Means to NATO Membership"]    [Text] Trencin--On Thursday [31 March], Pavol Kanis,  minister of defense of the Slovak Republic, met in Trencin with  functionaries and civilian employees of the Army Command of the  Slovak Republic. In his address he stated, among other things,  that we understand Partnership for Peace as a means toward NATO  membership.    Speaking about the tasks of the Army of the Slovak Republic  in the coming period, Kanis described as one of the most  important the preparation of an optimal variant of the Army's  transformation into new organizational structures while abiding  by the limits concerning troop numbers and weapon systems set by  the Vienna and Paris agreements.    At a news conference following the meeting with  functionaries  and civilian employees of the Army Command of the Slovak  Republic in Trencin, Kanis analyzed the causes of the tense  relations between the Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic  and the Army Command of the Slovak Republic. One of the causes,  in his opinion, was that, in the process of division of the  former federal Army and the establishment of an independent Army  of the Slovak Republic, the Army Command was set up first and  the Ministry of Defense only later. In his opinion, this has  caused problems in the search for the optimal structure of  relations and powers between the two institutions. Specific  problems of this relationship rested, according to Pavol Kanis,  also in the fact that the minister of defense was a soldier.    Dealing with the reduction of basic military service to 12  months, Lieutenant General Julius Humaj, commander of the Army  of the Slovak Republic, stated, among other things, that this  period is sufficient for the military training of rank-and-file  soldiers but not for NCO's. Their specialized training has been  reduced from six to three months, which is generally considered  insufficient. The Army wants to address this problem by means  of the gradual professionalization of some NCO's, as is common  in NATO armies.</p>

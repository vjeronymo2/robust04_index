			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ANC Information Chief Pallo Jordan, who is </F> "considered to be a candidate for a ministerial office," by  Johannes Dietrich and Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof; place and date  not given]    [Text] [PROFIL] Mr. Jordan, this week the first general  elections will take place as planned and even your archenemy  Buthelezi has given in at the last moment. All in all, a total  victory for the ANC.    [Jordan] No, one cannot say that. One might say, at most,  that the negotiating tactics of the ANC have paid off. But it  was expensive: Much blood was shed, the economy has been  damaged, and the country has been brought to the brink of the  abyss. Buthelezi's Inkatha Party could already have had  everything it now has last year.    [PROFIL] According to the Constitution, there will be a  coalition government at first. The public sector and the  economy will remain largely in white hands. Can the ANC rule in  this way at all?    [Jordan] Power is not just located at the stock exchange, in  the boards of governors, in the public sector, or in the army.  Power is distributed among various centers. It is now important  to shift it. For instance, in 1976, the white management was  still able to tell the black workers: If you want more money,  look where you get it from. In 1984, they were no longer able  to say that, they were confronted with well-organized trade  unions. If we now get a democratic government, the  entrepreneurs will be even more careful. In this way power is  shifted -- not dramatically, but effectively.    [PROFIL] Your opponent so far, the National Party (NP), will  become your coalition partner. Clashes are preprogrammed in  this case.    [Jordan] Quite so. Our first battle in the cabinet will be  about the redistribution program. The NP always says: That is  too expensive.    We cannot count on their cooperation.    [PROFIL] Will you raise taxes?    [Jordan] At the moment, taxes are as high on milk as on  champagne, as high on pig's bones as on Westphalian ham. We  think this is unjust. We say: Put taxes on champagne and leave  milk alone!    [PROFIL] But with that you will frighten the whites.    [Jordan] Of course.    [PROFIL] And then they will not invest.    [Jordan] We will see.    [PROFIL] Will the public sector sabotage the new government?    [Jordan] We must expect that. We are dealing with people who  do not like us. We also do not expect voluntary cooperation by  banks, by the mining industry, and by the rich white farmers.  Whether they will really proceed against us actively is another  question.    [PROFIL] What has the ANC learned from the failures of other  African regimes?    [Jordan] We have also been able to learn from the bad  example  here. South Africa as the most autocratic country on the  continent and far more corrupt than any other state in Africa.  The population was treated like a conquered people, not like  citizens. We did not have any rights, any claims, nothing.  Blacks, who constitute 75 percent of the population, earn about  10 percent of the entire income. As regards inequality, South  Africa tops any other African country.    [PROFIL] While everywhere in the world the red flags are  hauled down, they are hoisted on the Cape. Is the alliance of  the ANC with the communists not an anachronism?    [Jordan] The fact that communists are so successful here is  a  result of history. They have honestly earned their role by  participating in the struggle for liberation. Paradoxically,  they were supported by the white minority regime: Anyone who  was against apartheid was branded as a communist. In the eyes  of the blacks, communism, therefore, had to be something good.    [PROFIL] And the Stalinists in the party could not establish  a new dictatorship?    [Jordan] Most black South Africans know that the communists  are not strong enough to dominate politics. The fact that many  South Africans have this fear is mostly only an alibi: They  pretend to be against the communists, but, in reality, they are  against democracy.    [PROFIL] With the elections, the ANC has achieved its first  goal: national liberation. What will come then? Is the ANC,  the collection pond of political movements, now threatened with  being split?    [Jordan] National liberation has not yet been achieved. What  we will get now is democracy. But national transformation has  not yet been achieved by that. The issue of the land, for  instance, remains an enormous problem. The new government must  struggle for power. The struggle continues.</p>

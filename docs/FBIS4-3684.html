			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Zhou Shuchun </F> (0719 2885 2504)]    [Text] Bishkek, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li  Peng arrived in Bishkek on 22 April at 1830 local time on a  special aircraft to start his official visit to Kyrgyzstan at  the invitation of Akayev, president of the Republic of  Kyrgyzstan.    When Li Peng stepped down from the ramp of the airplane,  Akayev elatedly stepped forward to meet with him, and Akayev  firmly shook hands and exchanged greetings with him. Kyrgyz  girls presented bouquets, bread, and salt to Li Peng to show  their warm welcome to the honored Chinese guest.    A military band played the national anthems of the two  countries at the airport, where the flags of China and  Kyrgyzstan fluttered in the breeze. Li Peng, together with  Akayev, viewed the honor guards.    A large banner stating "We warmly welcome Premier Li Peng"  in  Chinese characters could be seen hanging down from an airport  building. Premier Li Peng warmly shook hands with Prime  Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov and other Kyrgyz Government  officials. A large, bright, eye-catching, five-starred Chinese  national flag could be seen among the welcoming crowd. Premier  Li Peng waved at and greeted the Chinese-flag-waving crowd.    Chinese Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Pan Zhanlin and the entire  diplomatic staff from the embassy were at the airport to welcome  Premier Li Peng and his delegation. Foreign envoys in  Kyrgyzstan also welcomed them at the airport.    Those arriving at Bishkek on the same plane with Premier Li  Peng included Zhu Lin, the wife of Li Peng; Ismail Amat, State  Councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities  Affairs Commission; and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the State  Council Office of Foreign Affairs.    Citizens along both sides of the road greeted Li Peng when  he  was driven to the state guesthouse in the accompany of Akayev.    Premier Li Peng delivered a written speech at the airport.  He said: China and Kyrgyzstan are friendly neighbors linked by  mountains and rivers, and they share a common border stretching  over more than 1,000 km. The friendly contacts between the two  countries' peoples date back 2,000 years. The "Silk Road," the  famous belt of friendship that historically linked China with  the countries of Central and West Asia, ran through this stretch  of land on which we now stand.    He added that the relationship between China and Kyrgyzstan  has developed in an excellent manner since diplomatic relations  were established. The successful visit of President Akayev to  China in 1992 has propelled the development of the neighborly,  friendly, and mutually beneficial-cooperation relationship  between the two countries. "I believe that my visit to your  country will surely further enhance the understanding between  the two countries, deepen the friendship between the peoples of  the two countries, expand the mutually beneficial cooperation in  all spheres, and benefit the peoples of China and Kyrgyzstan."</p>

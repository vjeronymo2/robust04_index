			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has agreed  to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to  conduct inspection on all seven reported nuclear facilities, the  IAEA announced Tuesday. At a working-level contact in Vienna  Tuesday, North Korea informed the IAEA that it will accept all  IAEA conditions for inspection, the announcement said.    Meanwhile in New York, North Korea and the United States  resumed their working-level meeting Tuesday to negotiate  followup measures on IAEA inspection.    At the Vienna meeting, the IAEA told North Korea it plans to  send a team of inspectors as soon as possible. It was reported  that the team would be able to leave before Feb. 21 when the  IAEA convenes a Board of Governors meeting. The team would  probably leave Vienna for Pyongyang over the weekend if airline  flight arrangements are made before that, sources said.    The IAEA said the purpose of the upcoming inspection is to  see whether the nuclear materials in the seven reported  facilities had been converted for other uses since February last  year when the IAEA last conducted inspection. In addition, the  IAEA plans to replace films and batteries for surveillance  cameras after checking them to see if the IAEA seals were  intact, IAEA officials said. These works will be conducted  along with other basic inspection activities, the officials  added.    The main point of the agreement was North Korea's acceptance  of all the conditions the IAEA had laid out for the forthcoming  inspection, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said. He declined,  however, to disclose the details of inspection activities.    Meyer also explained that the agreement does not mean that  there was a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.  Tuesday's agreement covers the upcoming inspection only, he  said. The IAEA would not characterize the forthcoming  inspection as being ad hoc or routine.    The inspection team, comprising six to seven experts, is  expected to stay in North Korea for two to three weeks, IAEA  officials said.    Councilor Yun Ho-chin of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna  said that the agreement was reached in order to maintain  continuity in nuclear safeguards. "We are satisfied with the  outcome (of the negotiations)," he said.    In another development, North Korea is reportedly sending a  high-level delegation to the IAEA board meeting Feb. 21. It was  not immediately known, however, who would lead the delegation.  The IAEA-North Korean agreement came after six rounds of talks  since Pyongyang and Washington reached an accord in New York on  Jan. 7. Despite Tuesday's agreement, the question of inspecting  two unreported nuclear sites in the Yongbyon nuclear complex is  still pending, presumably for the two sides to discuss later.</p>

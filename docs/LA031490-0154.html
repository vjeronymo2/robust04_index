			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GORBACHEV RUNS UNCONTESTED FOR SOVIET PRESIDENCY  </P> <P> Mikhail S. Gorbachev was the only man left on the ballot today for Soviet  legislators to select as the country's new, powerful president, and his victory  appeared certain.  </P> <P> Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Interior Minister Vadim A. Bakatin had been  nominated for the post by a group calling itself Soyuz, or Union, which is  opposed to efforts by Soviet republics to break away, but both withdrew.  </P> <P> Balloting was to begin later tonight and results were expected Thursday  morning.  </P> <P> Although uncontested, Gorbachev could still be defeated if less than 50% of the  2,250 members in the Congress of People's Deputies participate in the vote or  if the majority of those voting cross his name off the ballot. That was highly  unlikely, however.  </P> <P> Deputies narrowly agreed earlier today that they, and not the Soviet people,  would elect the Soviet Union's new president to a four-year term.  </P></p>

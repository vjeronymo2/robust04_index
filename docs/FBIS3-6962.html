U.S. President Bill Clinton has already confirmed that  Patriot missiles will be deployed in South Korea, and press  reports here say the Pentagon is seriously considering  additional measures such as strengthening American forces in  South Korea, placing aircraft carriers near the peninsula and  preparing for chemical warfare.    Secretary of State Warren Christopher added to the hysteria  Tuesday, saying the effectiveness of U.S. diplomatic efforts is  in doubt.    But working-level officials believe otherwise.    The WASHINGTON POST reported on the additional military  measures on the Korean peninsula, while emphasizing that  Washington has yet to set a definitive policy direction.    The Department of Defense has drawn up multiple contingency  plans in case war breaks out anywhere in the world, and planning  on the Korean peninsula remains within this framework, it said.    State Department officials said no military action has been  decided except the Patriot deployment. Department Spokesman  Mike McCurry made a point of repeating that the Patriot missiles  and the South Korean-U.S. military drill Team Spirit are both  purely defensive in nature.    Nevertheless, there are ominous signs. Defense officials  last week confirmed reports that U.S. aircraft carriers,  including the Independence and Abraham Lincoln, and warships are  conducting operations near the peninsula.    The operations, taking place just a couple of thousand miles  from the East Sea, are the first such maneuvers in months and  are tied to the possibility of holding Team Spirit.    The official explanation is that the operations were planned  in advance and are unrelated to the current tension in Korea. A  fleet of that size requires considerable time to dispatch,  meaning the carriers and warships were on their way before the  North Korean situation flared up.    Defense officials refused to confirm the report about a  strengthening of U.S. Forces in South Korea, reminding that  American military strategy remains secret until a firm decision  has been made.    The seeming difference of opinion in Washington is probably  a  two-pronged approach carefully planned by U.S. officials.    The Clinton administration is in search of a new impetus  that  can put the ball in a different court without the present  tension.    While high-level officials talk of a military threat,  mid-level officials speak differently. This is probably  Washington's way of waving both the stick and the carrot.</p>

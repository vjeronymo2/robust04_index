			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Thai power utility opens flotation campaign ELECTRICITY Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) expects to float publicly shares in a subsidiary company in the first half of next year. Egat, a state monopoly seeking approval for a partial privatisation, is looking to fund expansion plans estimated to cost Bt887bn (Dollars 35bn) over the next decade. As a first step, it has established a subsidiary called Electricity Generating (Egco). Egco will buy the 1232-megawatt, Bt20bn, combined-cycle power complex at Rayong, south-east of Bangkok. It will then launch an initial public offering to raise Bt5bn, with a further Bt15bn to be raised through foreign borrowing. Stockbrokers and Egat say Egat will probably keep about 50 per cent of Egco, with the rest sold to local and foreign investors. The plan is to list Egco on the stock exchange of Thailand by June 1994. According to Egat, Egco will go on to buy the Khanom power station, under construction in Nakhon Si Thammarat in southern Thailand. Egat itself is to be listed in 1996, although some brokers regard this target as optimistic. The Egco privatisation has been delayed by disputes over the pricing of the company's electricity supplies and the tax liabilities relating to the transfer of Egat assets to Egco. These problems now appear to have been resolved.</p>

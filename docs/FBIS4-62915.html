			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 18, BNS -- A recent inspection revealed  major financial irregularities in the Latvian Immigration and  Citizenship Department, Interior Ministry's officials told BNS.    The department faced a complete audit of financially  economic  activities for a three-year period, said Arturs Berzins, head of  the ministry's Control and Revision Commission.    The department's wages fund was exceeded 5,479 lats in 1993.  In addition, 14,872 lats were paid in bonuses and social  benefits, the commission said.    Then-Director Maris Plavnieks also ungroundedly spent budget  resources on insurance of department's employees for more that  46,000 U.S. dollars. The money was transferred to the  Austria-based Save-Invest firm, which lacked license to operate  in Latvia.    The insurance deal was one of the sidesteppings for which  Plavnieks was fired Dec. 14, 1993.    The department wired the money without concluding any  contracts. The only documents to confirm the deal are insurance  policies.    The ministry will try to recover the money, if necessary,  with a help by the Economic Court, said Interior Ministry's  Janis Balins.    In addition, the department lacks any form of internal  control, like proper accounting and stock taking.    Plavnieks told reporters that the wages fund was overdrafted  to keep qualified employees from moving to better paid jobs.    Speaking on the controversial insurance deal, Plavnieks said  that Save-Invest was only a mediator firm but the insuring was  done on highly favorable terms in the Fortuna firm, which is, in  his words, one of the 12 largest insurance companies worldwide.    Ints Zitars currently performs the duties of the  department's  acting director.</p>

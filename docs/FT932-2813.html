			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: National Insurance change to hit 2 1/2 m low-paid people A TOTAL of 2 1/2 m people whose earnings are so low that they do not pay income tax will have to pay 'slightly more' in National Insurance contributions next year because of the changes made in the Budget. Mr William Hague, the junior social security minister, admitted yesterday that an earlier statement to MPs, saying that only 500,000 people in this category would be affected by the one per cent increase in contributions, was incorrect. The social security department said revision of the number of those affected was because of a technical change. But the stark increase in the number of low-paid worse off as a result of the changes may cause some unease among Tories when the bill to implement them is introduced. Legislation is now planned for the new session that will begin in November, when the figures will give Labour more ammunition with which to oppose the measure. For many on lower earnings, the rise in contributions will more than offset any benefit from the widening of the 20 per cent income tax band.</p>

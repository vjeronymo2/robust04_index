			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / NZ votes for poll reform New Zealanders have voted overwhelmingly to reject the first-past-the-post election system which the country inherited from Britain, Terry Hall writes from Wellington. In a national referendum at the weekend, only 15 per cent voted to keep the system, where the winning party usually gains a bigger share of parliementary seats than of votes. Seventy per cent voted for mixed member proportional (MMP), as in Germany.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays appointment 'should not be rushed' THE APPOINTMENT of a new chief executive from outside Barclays 'should not be rushed,' Mr Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman said yesterday. The bank's current management structure was 'only just settling down'. Mr Buxton's remarks in the bank's annual report come after the announcement that he intended to bring in a chief executive to take over part of his responsibilities. Mr Buxton became chairman and chief executive in January but decided to split the roles amid public pressure from institutional investors. Criticism was increased by the fact that it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m last year. He said the board was satisfied that there were 'already sufficient checks and balances on my powers as both chairman and chief executive,' but that steps would be taken to split the two roles during 1993. Mr Buxton also criticised public and political attitudes towards banks in Britain, saying a healthy banking system was a pre-requisite for a healthy business environment. 'This economic reality is understood in the United States, where the regulators have encouraged the improvement of profit levels within the banking industry, but unfortunately it does not always seem to be appreciated in the UK,' he said. The accounts disclosed that the highest paid director last year received Pounds 524,000. The salary of Sir John Quinton, the former chairman who stepped down as chief executive last May, fell from Pounds 382,000 to Pounds 265,000. Bonuses totalling Pounds 400,500 were paid to Mr David Band, chief executive of Barclays' BZW investment bank, and Lord Camoys, BZW deputy chairman, 'to ensure that their overall remuneration remained competitive'. The bonuses were also said to reflect the 'improved performance' of the division. BZW's pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 241m in 1992, from Pounds 214m in 1991. Total emoluments paid to directors fell to Pounds 2.88m, from Pounds 3.02m in 1991 when the bank made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 533m.</p>

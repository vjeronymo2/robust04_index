One barrier to entry and expansion is the considerable time and expense required to develop, test, and market a new PC operating system. Other interrelated barriers to entry and expansion include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. the absence of a variety of high quality applications that run on a new operating system, and the difficulty of convincing independent software vendors (``ISVs'') to develop such applications; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. the lack of a sizable installed base of users; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. the difficulty in convincing OEMs to offer and promote a non-Microsoft PC operating system, particularly one with a small installed base and relatively few applications designed to run on it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. These barriers magnify and reinforce each other because the value of an operating system to a consumer is directly related to two factors: the availability of a variety of high quality applications that run on that system, and the number of users who use that operating system and thus are able to share information and work with the system without additional training. ISVs, in turn, tend to develop applications for operating systems with a large installed base of users, and consumers gravitate towards operating systems with a large base of applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Microsoft's anticompetitive contracting practices described below significantly increase the already high barriers to entry and expansion facing competitors in the PC operating system market. These practices reduce the likelihood that OEMs will license and promote non-Microsoft PC operating systems, make it more difficult for Microsoft's competitors to persuade ISVs to develop applications for their operating systems, and impede the ability of a non-Microsoft PC operating system to expand its installed base of users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Microsoft's Exclusionary and Anticompetitive OEM Licenses Foreclose Access to the OEM Channel by Microsoft's PC Operating System Competitors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 19. In 1980, IBM agreed to license the original version of MS&hyph;DOS from Microsoft for IBM's PC, which experienced considerable success. Other OEMs also used MS&hyph;DOS in order better to emulate the IBM PC. Microsoft quickly dominated and gained a monopoly in the market for PC operating systems. It then entered into a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive contract terms to maintain its monopoly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. Because of Microsoft's monopoly position in the marketplace, OEMs believe that they must offer MS&hyph;DOS and Windows to their customers. Profit margins in the computer hardware industry are very thin and OEMs want to obtain MS&hyph;DOS and Windows at the lowest possible cost. Microsoft has induced many OEMs to execute anticompetitive ``per processor'' contracts for MS&hyph;DOS and Windows, even though many would prefer to preserve their freedom to offer PCs with non-Microsoft operating systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

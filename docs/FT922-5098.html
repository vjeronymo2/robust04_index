			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (14): Cause for concern - Disappointment among environmental pressure groups THOUSANDS of environmental pressure groups all round the world have been closely involved in the preparations for Rio. When the idea of the summit was first mooted, many of them were delighted that the environment had finally reached the top of global priorities. But since then, disenchantment has set in. The succession of compromises and cutbacks in the agenda have left them with dark forebodings about the outcome. A few weeks ago a number of them including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, put out a joint statement saying: 'It appears that the Earth Summit is failing to meet its challenge and instead moving in the opposite direction from the path it must forge to save the planet from destruction. Barring a dramatic change of course, it is heading toward a failure of historic proportions.' The World Wide Fund for Nature, the Swiss-based group, is also worried about the 'lack of political commitment' by participating governments, according to one of its officials, Gordon Shepherd. Even so, WWF has dispatched nearly 30 experts to Rio to press for more concrete results. Despite the apocalyptic language, the green groups do have genuine cause for concern. They are worried at the lack of agreement on measures to stem the degradation of the global environment and disappointed that they have not been allowed a more significant role in the preparatory meetings for the summit. It was the intention of the Unced organisers that the views of a wide spectrum of environmental pressure groups should be fed into the discussions. But Roger Wilson, director of the political division of Greenpeace International, says it has been 'really tough trying to get access to the private meetings of the preparatory conferences.' He says there has been a substantial input of reports by the green organisations on a number of issues - 'but we are very disappointed at the lack of delegates' serious concern for the points we have raised.' There was an unwillingness to discuss some subjects, notably anything to do with nuclear power and its impact on the environment. He says this was treated as a 'sacred cow' that was outside the discussions. Roy Thomson, formerly on Friends of the Earth, has been advising the British Government delegation to the conference on the role of the environmentalists. 'In the beginning, hopes were too high, there was too much hyperbole,' he says. 'So it is not surprising that there has been a progressive lowering of expectations.' A consultation process was carried out in Britain by the UK committee of the United Nations Environment Programme in which many environmental groups participated. Mr Thomson drew up a report summarising their views. These included sweeping proposals to solve the problems of world poverty by additional aid from the industrialised world and a Dollars 5bn programme to stabilise world population. Furthermore, there were demands that would mean restraints on economic growth - an outcome which would be strongly resisted by business representatives at the conference. The report urged that demand for goods and services should be constrained and the UK Government should take a lead among rich nations in lowering the consumption of resources. Goods and services should meet 'real needs' rather than satisfying 'generated wants and titillated greed.' At a more realistic level, the report called for policies to ensure the conservation of energy and the minimisation of waste. Many green groups will be disappointed by Rio because it will not provide full answers to their particular concerns. But Mr Andrew Lees, the campaigns director of Frieds of the Earth, says the best way to judge its success will be on the strength of the arrangements for keeping the Rio process going once the summit is over - 'we have to ensure that governments are accountable and held to the task,' he says. SHADES OF GREEN: the environmental movement is a large, often bewildering assortment of interests and ideologies.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the US consultancy, has created this 'prism' which shows how the greens cover all parts of the spectrum - from 'no growth' to 'pro-growth'. In between, lie the greens who advocate a varying balance between growth and regulation.</p>

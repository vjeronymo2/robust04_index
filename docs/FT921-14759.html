			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Italy heading for relegation THE DRAFT treaty on Economic and Monetary Union (Emu) makes it quite likely that Europe will have a single currency by 1999; but its convergence criteria make it still more likely that a two-speed Europe will result. Since only the economically chaste will be allowed to join Emu, life before Emu for those now ineligible will be decidedly austere. Italy, in particular, will not merely have to make a swift move to fiscal chastity, but will have to undergo a period of repentance for past sins as well. Yet there is little sign that Italy's politicians appreciate the sacrifices they will have to make if Italy is to meet the convergence criteria, every one of which it currently fails. The 1992 budget deal, for example, agreed before the statutory deadline for only the ninth time in the last 40 years, ensures that Italy will end 1992 even further away from meeting the fiscal convergence rules than at present. The Emu treaty makes it possible to exclude any country with a national budget deficit that exceeds 3 per cent of gross domestic product, or an outstanding public debt that exceeds 60 per cent of GDP. But the proposed Italian budget implies a deficit of 10.5 per cent of GDP in 1992, while the primary deficit, excluding interest payments, which is set at 0.4 per cent of GDP in 1992, will raise the ratio of debt to GDP above its current 104 per cent. A primary surplus of 2.8 per cent of GDP is needed just to stabilise the debt ratio. Over-optimistic Even before it has been signed, and despite its evident inadequacy, the proposed budget already looks over-optimistic. It anticipates GDP growth of 2.3 per cent in 1992, for example, higher than the OECD's optimistic forecast of 2 per cent; it does not incorporate the higher cost of debt service imposed by the recent rise in interest rates, from 11.5 to 12 per cent; and it relies on further revenue from privatisation, if the politicians can agree on what to privatise, even though expected revenue from 1991 sales is only half in. The election coming up this spring provides the politicians with a ready excuse. The necessary reform of the bloated pension system and cuts in state subsidies to industry would be highly unpopular. In addition, a sufficiently large primary budget surplus might be highly deflationary for the Italian economy. Political cost Yet every year is likely to be an election year in Italy; and the political cost of incurring the voters' wrath now may be small against those created by relegation to the European second division. Even so, a serious attempt to reduce the budget deficit would probably require constitutional reform to strengthen the government. The text agreed in Maastricht could, in principle, permit Italy to dodge the fiscal criteria. The treaty provision on deficits can be over-ruled if the excess is 'exceptional and temporary' while the debt ceiling only applies if 'the ratio is not sufficiently diminishing . . . at a satisfactory pace'. To allow Italy to enter Emu in anything like its present fallen state would make a mockery of guidelines whose entirely proper aim is to reduce the risk that one country's fiscal misbehaviour would impose higher than necessary interest rates on all participants in Emu. Currently, the Italian government pays high interest rates on its domestic debt, to compensate investors for the risk that inflation will spirit it away. Notionally, the European Central Bank will be prevented from bailing out a defaulting government; but it cannot hope to make that commitment fully credible. The fear that the European central bank might bail out a potentially defaulting Italian government would introduce a general inflationary risk into Emu, resulting in higher interest rates for everyone. The political difficulty of disciplining national members once the Emu club is operative makes it all the more important that those most likely to sin are prevented from joining. If that is what it takes to compel the Italian government towards fiscal self-discipline, the convergence criteria will have served Europe, and Italy, well.</p>

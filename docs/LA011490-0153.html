			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUS STATION  </P> <P> Pursuant to the article indicating the siting of a new Orange County Transit  District bus station at Fashion Island, I write to express my strongest  objections.  </P> <P> As a commuter traveling the San Joaquin Hills Road/MacArthur (Boulevard)  junction daily, I find it congested. To place 12 buses in and out of that  junction on a daily basis is absurd traffic planning.  </P> <P> This represents a safety hazard that will clog MacArthur, and the bus turning  will increase pedestrian and vehicular accidents at that junction. I speak from  experience.  </P> <P> My wife was nearly killed in a severe auto accident three years ago at the  MacArthur/San Joaquin junction.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER LYON  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

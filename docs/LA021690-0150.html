			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Herb Cawthorne, the controversial black leader threatened with a lawsuit over  alleged mismanagement of San Diego Urban League funds, has taken over the helm  of the Black Federation of San Diego, the organization announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Cawthorne assumed his duties as chairman and chief executive officer of the  federation Monday, said Vernon Sukumu, the organization's former executive  director who now holds the title of president.  </P> <P> On Jan. 3, Cawthorne resigned from his half-time post as an executive for the  Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, little more than four months after he  had taken the job. On June 7, Cawthorne abruptly quit the Urban League amid  still unexplained allegations that he had mismanaged the organization's funds.  </P> <P> The Urban League decided last month to sue Cawthorne to recover almost $30,000  in funds and costs, according to sources familiar with the decision, but no  legal papers have been filed.  </P> <P> Cawthorne, who takes over an organization with a $50,000 debt, will be involved  in fund raising, both for the organization and black social service groups, and  programs to develop low-cost housing, Sukumu said.  </P> <P> Cawthorne could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

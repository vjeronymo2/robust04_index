			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest buoys Hozelock Hozelock, the garden equipment manufacturer, doubled pre-tax profits in its first half, reflecting the benefits of last November's flotation. Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 26 rose from Pounds 967,000 to Pounds 2.02m. At the operating level, profits were ahead 18 per cent at Pounds 2.06m, compared with Pounds 1.74m. Turnover advanced by 8 per cent, from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 14.3m. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 36,000 (Pounds 774,000). The group, which realised Pounds 4m from the flotation after paying back debt, ended the half with net cash of Pounds 3m. Mr Donald Potter, finance director, said the company traditionally encountered the heaviest demands on working capital at the end of March. But it had negotiated better payment terms from its suppliers, and had brought forward some payments by customers. Shares in the group closed yesterday at 250p, 2p up on the day and level with the flotation pricing. Mr David Codling, chief executive, said the group had taken a record 67 per cent of the core UK watering market, with sales ahead 12 per cent. The aquatics division, which makes pond equipment, lifted sales by 54 per cent. The group will move into its new factory at Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, in early July, giving it time to settle in during the low point of the manufacturing year. Mr Codling described the move as 'like moving from the Dark Ages to the modern age'. Earnings per share were 5.3p (2.6p). A maiden interim dividend of 2.3p is declared.</p>

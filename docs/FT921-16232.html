			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / When an ice-green Rolls is just a memory: One man's recession - Ted Bryant's business boomed in the 1980s but collapsed in 1990 TED BRYANT is not alone in hoping the economy will be better this year. Like thousands of other financial services salesmen in the south-east of England, he lived a high life in the 1980s and then lost it all. He went from a Pounds 285,000 house in Camberley, an ice-green Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit and holidays in Mauritius to a bungalow in Halberton, Devon. Now he drives a second-hand Bedford Rascal van. 'I had 17 suits, 100 shirts, all bought in the West End, and lunch at Langan's in Piccadilly. I saw Joan Collins there once,' he says. Today the Bryants watch television, eat Chinese takeaways and sing Neil Sedaka hits on the karaoke to keep their spirits up. Their children zoom around on mountain bikes and swap shell-suits. Ted, 47, spends his days ferrying his three stepchildren - Stephanie, 16, Melanie, 14 and Kristopher, 12 - along muddy lanes to school, club and the nearest McDonald's. They are rosy-cheeked testimony to the benefits of fishing, country air and bops at the local youth centre. His third wife, Laura, 10 years younger than him, goes daily to a factory in Tiverton to stick labels on bottles of Liberty and Floris scents and creams. 'The Pethers', a tiny three-bedroomed structure set in the rolling green hills of the Devon countryside, is a cosy nest with the central heating on full. The stone-cladded kitchen has a Raeburn stove and television blazing continuously in opposite corners. Ted's experience is both a parable of the recession and the tale of an imprudent businessman who over-extended himself, got caught out and crashed. There are thousands of Teds in the south of England. They enjoyed easy money during the 1980s when their financial service companies expanded recklessly. But competition eroded profits and then the markets they served contracted. Having lost their jobs, the Teds' chances of re-employment in comparable positions are slim. They are the steelworkers of this recession. Everything in Ted's life has changed since his business went under at the end of 1990. His circumstances will strike a chord with other recession victims, even those for whom the details are different. A bulky man in his blouson jacket, with the restless hands of an ex-smoker, Ted may seem an unlikely symbol of the recession. But this new year, Ted has been unemployed for exactly 12 months. 'It's been a horrendous year,' he says. Laura lights up a cigarette and smiles reassuringly as Ted relates how the family has had to live on her wages for the year he has been out of work. A neighbouring sister has lent them some money, but Ted is already two months behind with the rent. He has worked for five weeks since he went bankrupt - at Blundell's School, as an electrician - but only claimed unemployment benefit during the summer. 'People get too complacent if they go on too long,' he says. Slow to point the finger of blame at himself, he singles out two culprits for his business nemesis: 'First and foremost, it was recession, the lack of business, that presented the main problem. Then it was the bank. They pulled the rug from underneath us,' he says. Ted, who has sold mortgages, insurance and pensions since 1979, admits to overborrowing in the late 1980s, just before the rise in interest rates to 15 per cent put the lid on the housing market. His next mistake was shared by the government, the Treasury, and almost all professional economists. He failed to foresee that this recession, unlike the one in the mid-1970s, was going to be so deep and last so long. He opened a new Camberley branch of his company, Surrey and Hants Financial Services, at just the wrong time. He had an overdraft limit of Pounds 100,000, but ran it up to Pounds 220,000. Then the bank got 'cold feet' about financing him further. 'Recessions have never gone on like this. Let's face it, this is absolutely diabolical,' he says. May 25 1990 was the beginning of the end. That day Ted threw a party, attended by Jim Bowen, host of TV's Bullseye darts quiz show, to celebrate the opening of the new branch of the company he started in 1988 and spent Pounds 45,000 advertising in 1989. The branch was tied to Colonial Mutual, a life assurance company, which had agreed to clear S&amp;H's overdraft with the National Westminster Bank. The bank manager had been enthusiastic. He agreed that the overdraft should be cleared, and also agreed to give Ted a working overdraft of Pounds 50,000 to trade with and start afresh. S&amp;H was, Ted says, 'sizeable in Surrey,' and the new branch was a part of his ambition to 'to become a household name in the Camberley-Woking area'. The idea was that as soon as the mortgage market, increasingly pinched since 1988, turned round 'there we would be, waiting in the wings.' But they were not. First the office was three months late in opening, and then there was no turnround. 'When interest rates go sky-high the first thing that gets hit in the following recession is the property market and the mortgage market gets hit the same day.' But that was not all. The week he paid in the last cheque to clear the Pounds 220,000 overdraft, he was splitting up with his wife Sharna, a director of Surrey and Hants. 'I had booked into the Grand Hotel, Jersey, for the weekend. I went with Laura. Came back on the Tuesday. From the airport I telephoned the office to find we had all sorts of problems and the bank had returned four cheques.' The bank had happened to cut off his credit on the same day he left his wife. 'It was incredible - as if they had timed it,' he recalls. Ted called the bank manager from his carphone. He knew the mortgage business had been very slow, but he thought the pensions and insurance side had been trading nicely over the summer. The manager informed him that since the overdraft had been cleared, the regional office had decided to withdraw the Pounds 50,000 trading facility the company had already partly spent. 'You can imagine what that did to us. You can't have cheques bouncing in the financial services industry,' he said. The sales force of 25 left within a week, his wife resigned at Christmas, and the company went into liquidation at the beginning of last year. NatWest, which would not breach banking confidentiality without authorisation from all individuals concerned, merely said it could 'confirm that Mr Bryant was declared a bankrupt on April 2, 1991.' Ted had secured his borrowings against their house where he and his wife had lived what he describes as 'the high life'. With no money coming in it was impossible to keep up the mortgage payments of Pounds 2,000 a month. In July last year the house was repossessed by the building society. Ted, now divorced from Sharna, moved down to Devon with Laura and her three children to start a new life. Sitting in the lounge, he hands over a snap of the Rolls. His initials are on the number plate. The car also went to pay his creditors. He opens another album full of shots of a bronzed and jovial Ted at office parties, laughing with his bank manager and secretaries. Although the new Devon nest is crammed with the wife, children and pets he loves, he reels off the material details of the life he has lost. 'I had a very high social life. I went on a cruise in 1990 to Tenerife, and in '89 I went to Mauritius, Singapore and Thailand in one holiday,' he says. Their sudden hard times have shaped their views. Laura enjoys her job. Kris wants to be a policeman because they don't get made redundant. And Ted is starting a job in January selling record collections round the south-west. 'This'll blow your mind,' he says. He slides open a garage door to reveal an office, arranged with all the furniture - swivel chair and double-desk - from the fateful Camberley branch of Surrey and Hants. 'Put it this way, at least I've done it and been there. Don't turn me off yet because I'll be coming bouncing back, I can assure you.' The next chapter of Ted's rags-to-riches-to-rags story will not, hopefully, end in The Pethers. Ted insists the Bryants will have their day again.</p>

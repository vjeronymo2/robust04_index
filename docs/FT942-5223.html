			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Bangladeshi strikes Opposition parties may continue to call strikes at short notice in Bangladesh and visitors may find travelling around the country even more difficult than usual. Strikes can suspend normal business throughout the country and make travelling hazardous. People ignoring strikes can become targets for violence and cars or buses may be damaged or destroyed. There has been a marked increase in night - time armed banditry on main roads between large towns in recent weeks and travel is not recommended after dark.</p>

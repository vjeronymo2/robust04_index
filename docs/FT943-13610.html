			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Juggling the finances - Arranging start-up funds was like being in a circus act for Tech-Board's chief executive The announcement yesterday that a venture capital-backed start-up will revitalise the UK's moribund hardboard industry should have been a cause for rejoicing. The Pounds 40m project will be the biggest manufacturing start-up backed by institutions in the UK. The plant will create at least 200 jobs in Gwent, South Wales and should cut the UK trade deficit by substituting large quantities of imported hardboard. But the story of how Malcolm Graham, chief executive of Tech-Board, and his advisers raised the equity and debt is not encouraging to entrepreneurs seeking start-up finance. When the deal was finally signed yesterday morning, more than six years had elapsed since Graham first sought backing. During this time, he spent all his savings. He also learned what many others have learned - that with some exceptions venture capitalists and commercial banks are reluctant to back start-ups. The venture capital industry is frequently criticised for this. But the brickbats are often ill-aimed. In the first place, many venture capitalists manage funds raised expressly for investment in management buy-outs - not start-ups. Asking them for start-up capital would be like asking a car insurance salesman to sell cars. Second, the industry has learned from bitter experience that many start-ups fail. Graham points out that the Tech-Board project was different. 'Most start-ups fail because there is no market,' he says. 'Here was a project with an established process and market, but it still did not get a good reception.' This was in spite of the fact that the corporate finance department of KPMG and lawyers at Steggles Palmer said they would work for Graham on a contingency fee basis. Graham had become general manager of UK Paper's hardboard division in 1986, just before its management led a buy-out from Bowater Industries. Its Kemsley plant in Kent was designed to produce 5,000 tonnes, but it was operating at three times this level and was falling down. Yet this mill constituted the UK's hardboard manufacturing capacity. Not surprisingly, 90 per cent of the UK's 200,000-tonne annual demand was imported. In 1987, Graham received board approval from UK Paper to build a new plant, but by 1988, when the company was floated and later acquired by Fletcher Challenge of New Zealand, the plan had been put on the back burner. At this point, armed with little more than plans for a new plant, Graham decided to raise the money himself. 'I met 3i who told me I needed a finance director, a managing director and a complete management team if they were to support the deal,' says Graham. 'It was not an easy route to satisfy.' He spent two years knocking on doors looking for equity backing. Then he met Peter Learmond, the former steel trader who in the early 1970s went through similar hoops to raise money to start Sheerness Steel, a mini-mill. After three months - and another KPMG review of the business plan - Learmond said he would back the project and found an offshore investor, Persis, who put up Pounds 500,000 of interim funding. 'What attracted me was that there were no other producers in the UK,' says Learmond. 'Every tonne is imported and costs money to transport. If we had a plant that could deliver on a just-in-time basis we would have a tremendous edge on imports.' With the backing of Persis, Graham headed back to his contacts at 3i - after they had been warmed up by KPMG. 'Start-ups are extremely rare - nothing quite like this has ever been done before as an industrial start-up,' says KPMG's Nick Theakston. 'I went to 3i on my own so that they would not say no at the first mention of start-up.' By April 1992, with 3i on board, success seemed much more assured. But most other potential equity providers either wondered why no one else had set up a plant, could not believe the margins or wanted to buy into something that would generate an immediate yield. As a result it took until July 1993 to agree the equity layer of the funding  -Pounds 2m of pure equity and Pounds 13.5m of subordinated loan stock. Even then the consortium included a number of foreign investors - alongside 3i, Persis, Rothschild Ventures and RIT are Tinicum Inc of New York and Heffernan of Toronto, a group that backed Learmond's Sheerness Steel. What Graham had not counted on, however, was the difficulty he would face raising Pounds 15m of debt. As soon as the equity was in place, NatWest, which is also a substantial shareholder in 3i, withdrew its commitment to put a loan proposal to its credit committee. The bank says it was not fully informed of the progress towards raising equity and that its circumstances had changed. Graham says the process of keeping the equity suppliers happy while it raised the debt was like keeping plates spinning in a circus act. Eventually Tech-Board found two merchant banks, NM Rothschild and Henry Ansbacher, and one commercial bank, the Midland. The result is that this August civil works will begin in Gwent. The new plant will have a capacity of 88,000 tonnes a year and supply the automotive, furniture, toy and bed-making industries. In theory, 20 per cent of output will be exported and the plant will displace Pounds 25m worth of imports. Only after three years will Tech-Board's assumptions about market penetration and margins be properly tested. By then the memory of so many presentations to largely unenthusiastic City audiences will have faded. But the experience has left many people including Learmond disillusioned by the UK financial community's capacity to raise finance for ordinary industrial projects. 'With the great exception of 3i, the greater part of British institutions are terrified of green field projects,' he says. And has it become easier than when he started-up Sheerness Steel? 'No. Probably it is worse today,' he says.</p>

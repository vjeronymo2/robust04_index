			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / France and Spain close ranks on Maastricht FRANCE and Spain yesterday ruled out changing the Maastricht treaty on European union to meet Denmark's demands for a special status, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said in Paris that Denmark's proposals for binding legal exemptions from key provisions required an unacceptable rewriting of the treaty on EC political, economic and monetatry union. Speaking after talks with President Francois Mitterrand, he said the Danish government did not yet appear to have a final position. But he told reporters: 'As they have been formulated in the document, I think the (Danish proposals) require a change in the Maastricht treaty which I believe will not be acceptable to the member states.' France's European affairs minister, Ms Elisabeth Guigou, said in a parliamentary debate yesterday that France would study Denmark's proposals but ruled out any renegotiation of the accords.</p>

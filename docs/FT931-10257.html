			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Dame Shirley Porter to head LBC DAME Shirley Porter, the Conservative politician, will today be appointed chairman of LBC, the London commercial radio station now effectively controlled by Porter family interests. Mr Christopher Chataway, the LBC chairman who is also chairman of Crown Communications, the broadcasting company now in receivership, has decided to step down as chairman. It is believed that Mr Chataway, the former Conservative minister who now chairs the Civil Aviation Authority, was asked to stay on by the new controllers of LBC, Mr John Porter Dame Shirley's son, and Mr Matthew Cartisser, his partner. Mr Porter and Mr Cartisser are the main shareholders in Chelverton Investments, a company which now owns 49 per cent of LBC and has an option on a further 2 per cent. Mr Chataway, it is believed, has told Mr Porter he will not have the time to chair LBC during the station's franchise renewal period. The LBC frequencies will be advertised by the Radio Authority next month. He will however stay on as a non-executive director and support LBC's bid to regain its franchise. A key element in Mr Chataway's support for the new regime at LBC was the renewal of the contract of Mr David Haynes, the chief executive. Mr Haynes and Mr Chataway were keen supporters of the move into France and the purchase of a stake in RFM which turned into a disaster for the group. Crown was forced into receivership when the CSA, the French broadcasting authority, blocked the sale of the network. Meanwhile Mr Patrick Meyer, the founder of RFM, who sold out to Crown and now lives in the US, has decided to make a bid for his old radio network. Mr Meyer, speaking from Arizona, said he has the support of a big financial institution and a famous French artist. He also plans to make stock available to the staff of the network, which has 114 stations. RFM is now in receivership but is still trading and playing pop music. Mr Meyer says he will soon be presenting his case to the CSA, RFM staff and the receiver when one is officially appointed. 'It is a good station if you get the right format and don't change it all the time,' he added. Observer, Page 17</p>

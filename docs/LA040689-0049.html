			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Customs announced what may be the largest marijuana seizure ever aboard a  commercial aircraft, confiscating an Air Jamaica jetliner and warning that  nation to step up its anti-drug efforts. Inspectors found 3,595 pounds of  marijuana packed into two unlisted containers in the cargo hold of the A-300  Airbus, which arrived at Miami International Airport on Tuesday, agency  spokesman Michael Sheehan said. "You could smell it from 50 feet away," Sheehan  said. "We just cannot comprehend how the Jamaicans could not have discovered  it, and allowed it to leave the country." Under federal law, the plane was  seized and government-owned Air Jamaica could be liable for a fine of $28.7  million.  </P></p>

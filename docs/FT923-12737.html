			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hampson shows 20% decline to Pounds 4m but maintains pay-out HAMPSON INDUSTRIES, the precision engineering, aluminium refining and home products group, saw annual profits drop nearly 20 per cent but had reached the 'nadir of its fortunes' according to Mr John Wardle, chairman. On turnover of Pounds 73.1m (Pounds 78.5m), pre-tax profits for the year to end-March were Pounds 4.06m (Pounds 5.04m) - higher than market expectations and helped by a seasonally favourable second half. At the halfway stage the West Midlands-based group achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.62m. Mr Wardle said profits would not decline further in the current year and the dividend, maintained at 2.373p via a same-again final of 1.773p, would not be cut. Earnings per share were 3.65p, against 4.55p last time. Trading conditions in the current year have not improved and Mr Wardle made clear 'the recession is very firmly with us.' The experience of April, when pressure on margins was relieved, has not been repeated. Mr Wardle's expectation that current year profits will increase is partially based on the fact that in 1991-92 loss-making subsidiaries in the printing, printing machinery and packaging sectors have either been eliminated or sold. With the exception of the carrying cost of some residual borrowings of the Kenmart operation, consequent charges have been absorbed in the latest figures. At the same time, the performance of the precision engineering units, largely involved in the refurbishment of aircraft with British Aerospace as a main customer, has been and is likely to remain strong. The order book is full for the next three years. Precision engineering played a notable role in stabilising the figures: its proportion of profits rose to 56 per cent (46 per cent). By contrast aluminium refining was depressed, with 5 per cent against 14 per cent, and looks likely to remain that way.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Beneficiary Information and Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFA invites ideas that may make the Medicare and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid programs understandable to beneficiaries and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients and that provide assistance to these individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in their attempts to deal with the programs. Potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program users (Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients) need to understand when they are eligible, what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services or products are covered, and what their rights and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities are within each program. An example would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be an information project that would assist health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers, including Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients, by providing aggregate data on provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance and utilization trends, discrete price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, and information on related copayments, etc.; in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a sense, a ``Blue Book for Consumers.'' Another example is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining payment for claims, one of the most frequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems encountered by Medicare beneficiaries. The process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of dealing with Medicare's fiscal intermediaries and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers is difficult for many. Tools that would ease this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process would be welcome. Beneficiaries also need to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to decide whether they should join, or exit from, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health maintenance organization, and the advantages and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disadvantages of the decision. Beneficiaries need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understand what considerations to take into account when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long term care is a possibility. Similarly, beneficiaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to be assisted in the decision about the purchase of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health insurance in addition to Medicare. HCFA invites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ideas in beneficiary communication and assistance approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are tailored to special populations (such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant demographic, sociocultural, or disease-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups of beneficiaries), as well as approaches that could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used by supplemental health benefit program sponsors (for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, employers and unions) in assisting Medicare-eligible retirees. Applicants who are considering this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> topic should understand that the SBIR Program generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeks to support the development of commercially viable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products and that there is already a fair amount of existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial activity in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

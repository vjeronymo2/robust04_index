			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Su Man (5685 2581): "Steven Poon Kwok-lim Says </F> Problem-Solving Conditions Exist in the Sino-British Airport  Committee Meeting"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 19 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Steven  Poon Kwok-lim, Legislative Council [Legco] member and Hong Kong  affairs adviser, has said: It is good thing that the  Sino-British Airport Committee has resumed its meeting after a  nine-month suspension. The atmosphere is now riper and less  fraught with difficulty. We still cannot expect too much, but  the conditions for solving problems do exist. Mr. Poon said  that both sides can talk over the financing package, make the  credit limit flexible, and compromise with one another on the  procedure for granting land. He hopes that both sides do not  stop doing these necessary things merely due to some technical  problems. He anticipates that the upcoming meeting may discuss  the issue of the delay in the new airport project and resultant  nonperformance of the stipulations of the Memorandum of  Understanding on the Airport. He proposes that efforts should  be made to start key airport projects before 1997, so that the  Special Administrative Regional [SAR] Government does not have  to shoulder heavy responsibilities after the British side's  withdrawal.    Poon Kwok-lim said that the first three financial packages  proposed by the Hong Kong Government were unacceptable to the  Chinese side, while the fourth package could be taken as the  basis for talks. He said: The HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars]  in loans prescribed by the Sino-British Memorandum of  Understanding on the Airport are negotiable, and it seems that  the Chinese side will consider it at their discretion.  According to the principles of the fourth financing package --  which has been disclosed -- the Hong Kong Government is going to  invest a total of HK$60.3 billion in two projects so that total  borrowing will drop to HK$23 billion. This is still considered  to be too high, but, due to the fact that the cost of key  airport projects has dropped over HK$7 billion, HK$8 billion of  the cost of the new airport and the airport railway may, in the  end, be made up. In addition, as the prices of land along the  airport railway route have been soaring over the years, doubling  the HK$40 billion value estimated in 1991, it is possible to  utilize these funds so that the total amount of borrowing will  be close to HK$5 billion. As the proceeds of land sales are far  greater than the original estimate, and the Hong Kong Government  has a large financial surplus, it is also feasible to invest  additional funds in the projects if necessary. In his opinion,  Mr. Poon thinks that the Chinese side will accept the reasonable  and flexible arrangement of the credit limit.    Regarding the controversial issue of airport railway land,  Poon Kwok-lim pointed out: Naturally, the 62 hectares of land  should be included in those annually granted by the Sino-British  Land Committee, and the British Hong Kong side should work out  and propose a timetable clearly listing the sites and quantities  of land. If the Chinese side agrees to the proposal, the Land  Committee can work on it.    Poon Kwok-lim also said: The longer the talks on the new  airport financing are suspended, the greater the possibility  that many projects will be delayed. Moreover, we should beware  of the risk that the SAR Government will be left with a heavy  burden of railway construction if key airport projects cannot be  completed by 1997. Hence, he and the Liberal Party advocate that  the Chinese side and its British counterpart should seek common  ground while minimizing differences; that is, they should  utilize as many usable funds as possible to start key projects  first and then continue to discuss their differences. On the  other hand, Legco should examine and approve the allocation of  airport funds on the basis of reason, urgency, nonviolation of  the Joint Declaration, and leaving no burden to the SAR  Government.</p>

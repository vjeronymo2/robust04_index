			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> AFGHAN REBELS KILL RIVALS  </P> <P> As many as 30 Afghan rebel military leaders, including more than half a dozen  senior commanders, were ambushed and killed by a rival guerrilla group while  returning from a strategy meeting in northern Afghanistan last week, rebel  sources and Western diplomats confirmed in Islamabad, Pakistan. The killings,  the most serious internecine violence reported among the U.S.-backed rebels in  years, occurred about 200 miles north of Kabul, the capital, after a meeting of  rebel leaders to plan renewed assaults against the Soviet-supported Afghan  government. Rebel sources charged that the ambushes were ordered by a commander  associated with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of the most anti-Western guerrilla  faction.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Kovalev, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent: </F> "Half of the Soldiers and Sergeants in Belorussia Are Being  Discharged into the Reserve"]    [Text] This spring, for the first time servicemen in  compulsory term of service from two call-ups--the spring and  fall of 1992--will be discharged into the reserve immediately  from the Belorussian Army. The Ministry of Defense believes that  this may seriously affect the combat readiness of the Armed  Forces of the Republic of Belorussia--after all, half of the  soldiers and sergeants are to leave over the course of two  months. Things will also be difficult this spring for the  republic's military commissariats--the call-up plan has been  increased considerably, while the number of draftees has  remained essentially as before.</p>

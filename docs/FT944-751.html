			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome support Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was restrained in early trading as the latest audit data on sales of its Zovirax treatment for herpes prompted profit-taking. The data were not believed to be seriously worrying but Wellcome, along with other leaders in the sector, has performed strongly. Then in the afternoon there was heavy buying of traded options, fuelling old bid speculation and the stock recovered to close 3 higher at 709p. Zeneca fell in spite of the acquisition of 50 per cent of Salick Healthcare for Dollars 195m. The deal will expand Zeneca's involvement in cancer care and was described by Mr Paul Krikler of Goldman Sachs as an 'excellent move'. But the shares dipped 6 to 893p as dealers noted that they had hit a record high on Wednesday. Shares in property group Stanhope were suspended pending clarification of the company's financial position. The shares had advanced a penny to 8p before the mid-afternoon suspension, which came as the market waited to hear if the group's bankers would come up with a financial rescue plan. The Pounds 1.5bn offer for Kuwaiti owned St Martins Property reported earlier this week continued to boost demand in the rest of the sector. Hammerson, which announced the acquisition of two retail property sites in Canada, put on 5 at 348p. Insurers were sold down on growing concern that the cut in household insurance premiums by the Halifax would lead to a price war, but some houses were taking a more fundamental approach which led to a strong two-way tussle in the sector. Some integrated securities houses were ignoring the impending margin pressures and concentrating on the valuations of the stocks compared to their net asset values. UBS was one house which was actively supporting the sector, and which bought several of the composite stocks up from their lows. Sun Alliance, the main underwriter for the Halifax and which was off 11 at worst, also received support from an SGST buy recommendation. It ended the day only 3 lower at 297p. General Accident, off 14 at one stage, closed 4 down at 515p and Royal Insurance moved from 11 off to end a net penny down. The rumoured dawn raid on bid target Northern Electric did not happen but the shares rose 7 to 1007p in anticipation. The view is that Swiss Bank Corp, acting for Trafalgar, will soon go into the market to try and buy around 10 per cent of Northern's shares. The latest speculation in the water sector suggested international conglomerate Hanson may launch a bid for Welsh Water. The latter raced 12 ahead to 650p and Hanson firmed 1 3/4 to 234p. The recent recovery seen in the stores sector was extended yesterday as optimism about Christmas trading continued in some quarters. Great Universal Stores gained 11 1/2 at 543p and Argos 4 at 349p. Marks and Spencer brushed aside a James Capel profits downgrade to end 4 ahead at 396p. News that fund manager Jupiter Tyndall was in talks over its possible acquisition gave a shot in the arm to others within the sector. Gartmore appreciated 6 to 182p, Invesco 3 to 166p and Perpetual 30 to 1165p. However, Jupiter lost 9 at 393p. Hotels and leisure group Ladbroke gained 5 at 170p in trade of 5.5m, with dealers reporting further switching into the stock from Rank Organisation, 1 1/2 lighter at 408p. Yesterday's trades followed a move by Goldman Sachs earlier this week in which it switched a large holding out of Rank and into Ladbroke. Granada Group was another stock said to have benefited from some switching out of Rank. The shares climbed 10 to 506p as greater note was taken of a recent buy recommendation from BZW. A circular from the investment bank said Granada 'has made very clear its resolve to keep dividends rising strongly'. Burmah Castrol moved ahead 17 to 801p after SG Warburg upgraded the company to 'add' from 'hold' following the stock's recent poor showing relative to the overall market. Warburg said the shares had underperformed the market by 13 per cent since August when they reached a 12-month peak of 915 1/2 p. A big buyer for tightly traded Associated British Foods helped the shares appreciate 14 to 582p. Food manufacturer Canadian Pizza, off 6 at 83p, stunned the market with its second profits warning this year, prompting brokers to downgrade estimates. BTR was the most heavily traded Footsie stock, notching up turnover of 13m shares following news of the latest acquisition within its far flung empire. BTR Nylex, the 62 per cent-owned Australian unit, is paying ADollars 800m for the US group which makes Formica laminates. BTR shares put on 3 1/2 at 290p against a background of heavy switching with the 1995 warrants. A buy note from Henderson Crosthwaite focusing on break-up value helped to lift British Aerospace. The agency broker's revised break-up value for BAe is 800p, against which the shares, up 5 at 431p, stand at a discount of 45 per cent. Hall Engineering tumbled 13 to 150p following the announcement of Pounds 4.2m reorganisation provisions. Process plant specialist APV eased 2 to 54p, with turnover in the stock boosted to 5.5m as several largish lines of stock went through the market. Analysts have begun to suspect that the group's restructuring timetable, initially scheduled for late this year, has been put back to early in 1995.

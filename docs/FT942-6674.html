			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (3): It's that festival feeling again - Festival highspots / Keen on music, literature or racing? Gerald Cadogan has been finding accommodation for festival goers The festival season has started again in Britain. Glyndebourne's new opera house in East Sussex reopens tonight, continuing until August 25, and the Cardiff Bay jazz festival in Wales runs until Monday. Brighton (East Sussex) and Perth (Tayside) finish tomorrow. Hay-on-Wye (Powys) and Malvern (Worcestershire) continue to next weekend. Festivals starting in June include: Aldeburgh in Suffolk (the Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears festival, in its 47th year), Bournemouth (Dorset) puppets at Bradford (West Yorkshire), pop music at Glastonbury (Somerset) and opera at Garsington Manor outside Oxford. And so the multi-course cultural feast goes on - from Edinburgh in Scotland to Fishguard, in west Wales well into the autumn. Tickets and accommodation are the problem at many festivals. Main events sell out quickly and hotels and boarding houses are booked, often by the same people, year after year. What is the way out? For one thing, you could always consider buying a place near your favourite festival. From a base in mid-Sussex, for example, it is easy to 'do' Glyndebourne, Brighton and Chichester (where Derek Jacobi has just been appointed artistic director, a post inaugurated by Laurence Olivier). Well placed for all three venues is Nettledown Cottage at Fulking, down a long farm road with views to the South Downs. Price: Pounds 395,000 from Humberts in Lewes (0273-478 828) and Fox in Haywards Heath (0444-459-966). Close to Glyndebourne and Brighton, Humberts offers an unusual and handsome white clapboard house that looks more like Massachusetts than southern England. Gallybird Hall, near Barcombe, has six bedrooms and costs Pounds 240,000. An intriguing house near Chichester is Jolyons at Bury. Built in 1931 from old timbers, this Sussex barn was a studio home for artist Rudolph Sauter, a nephew of author John Galsworthy, and stands in the grounds of his uncle's house. Jackson-Stops in Chichester (0243-786316) is selling it for Pounds 285,000. Cheltenham, an elegant Regency town on the edge of the Cotswolds, has three festivals. In July there is music while, in October, its festival of literature provides a welcome break in the dog days of the cultural year. But the most famous of the trio is the Cheltenham festival of horse-racing each March when the Gold Cup is the climax of the National Hunt season, run over fences. Three Queens is a smart Elizabethan, Queen Anne and Victorian house - hence its name - in Prestbury, on the edge of Cheltenham. Its price is Pounds 345,000 from Jackson-Stops in Cirencester (0285-653334) or Charles Lear in Cheltenham (0242-222722). Charlton Manor in Battledown is equally close. But this one is purely Victorian - originally, it was called Simla Lodge. Price: Pounds 750,000 from Humberts in Cheltenham (0242-513439). The middle of the Cotswolds also offers opera-in-the-garden at Garsington, on the east edge of Oxford. It is best on a fine night, although the audience is in a tented stand and a cover can be unrolled over the singers. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Oxford (0865-790077) is selling the Dower House at nearby Heythrop; offers over Pounds 700,000 are sought for the six bedrooms (to house the party) and 40 acres (for the horses). Another Pounds 80,000 buys a cottage. Just as convenient is Horn Farm at Evenlode, a good Cotswold farmhouse with stabling and 45 acres (from KFR at Pounds 425,000), or Copse Hill Court, a converted stables and coach house in Upper Slaughter for Pounds 575,000. Bergersh Place at Witnesham, north of Ipswich, could prove a splendid base for large parties bound for the music at Aldeburgh, or inspecting the royal Saxon burial ground at Sutton Hoo, followed by oysters and Muscadet at the Butley-Orford oysterage. For Pounds 900,000, you get a Regency house with 187 acres, restored by the present owners. Bidwells (0223-841841) in Cambridge is the agent. Otten Hall at Belchamp Otten, west of Sudbury, is handsome Georgian and earlier, and has a pond in front, although it is further from the Suffolk coast. The price (from Bidwells) is Pounds 375,000. Kelsale Manor near Saxmundham, a 16th/17th century house in the shape of a square bracket, is also convenient for Aldeburgh. Along with 10.5 acres, Savills in Ipswich (0473-226191) is asking Pounds 460,000. Salisbury has a festival in September that deserves to be known better. A good base in the town is 46 St Ann's Street, a Georgian house near the cathedral and close (where many events happen). Savills in Salisbury (0722-320422) offers it for Pounds 230,000. To live outside and come in for the events, consider renting a flat in Wardour Castle, near Tisbury, one of England's handsomest Palladian mansions. Built by James Paine between 1770 and 1776. it was used until recently by the defunct Cranborne Chase school for girls. Smart apartments, restored with great care by Nigel Tuersley, are on offer for Pounds 1,600-Pounds 1,800 a month through John D. Wood in Basingstoke (0256-398 004). For Edinburgh, a flat looks the best idea. Use it yourself at festival time and let it during the academic year to the students who throng the city. The place to look is the Edinburgh Solicitors' Property Centre (031-2263891).</p>

Karadzic by Vasiliy Fartyshev in Moscow, </F> date not given: "Radovan Karadzic: `We Were Merely the First  Line of Defense'"]    [Text] There was a meeting at the Russian Federation  Writers' Union between the leaders of the writers' organization  and Moscow writers and Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian  Serbs and vice president of the Union of Serbian Writers.    In a cordial and fraternal atmosphere poets and writers from  Russia and Serbia talked about the historical ties of friendship  and kinship between the two Slavic cultures and the problems  facing our peoples today. The Yugoslav colleagues noted the  great contribution Russian writers and the general public have  made to settling the armed conflict and to the success of the  joint opposition to the West's expansionist policy directed  against the sovereign republic.    Our correspondent asked politician, poet, and doctor Radovan  Karadzic to answer a few PRAVDA questions.    [Fartyshev] Comrade Karadzic, what is your opinion of  Russia's recent initiative on settling the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Karadzic] We are uncommonly heartened and grateful for all  that Russia has done for Serbia. Many attempts are being made  in the world today to resolve the Yugoslav problem without the  participation of an entire people, and it is perhaps the  grimmest period in Serbian history. During World War II we  learned first-hand what genocide means: The Hitlerites  destroyed 700,000 Serbs as well as a large number of Jews and  gypsies. We have failed to preserve a unified Yugoslavia as a  state, but we are making every effort to uphold the independence  of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is why throughout the 22 months  of the war we have been defending our territory and our people,  in order to prevent further, "civilized" genocide. We have  created and formalized our own Serbian Republic, and a treaty on  this will be ratified in the very near future.    The Russian action helped overcome confrontation with NATO,  and, as a result of this, I believe Russia emerged in the world  political arena as an independent force to be reckoned with.    [Fartyshev] Many of my colleagues who have been in  Yugoslavia when battles have been raging have said that the  Serbs were bewildered by Russia's long "silence" and were  accusing us of inaction. Tell me, in the minds of your ordinary  citizens are the Kremlin and Russia synonymous?    [Karadzic] No, we see a difference between Kremlin  officialdom and the Russian people, who have had truly fraternal  feelings for us Slavs for centuries. I am sure that ordinary  people are well aware of the difference. "If the Serbs cannot  be destroyed, let's befriend them" -- that is more or less the  metamorphosis that has occurred in the case of your Foreign  Ministry.    [Fartyshev] Tell me, did you ask Russia for aid -- two years  ago or after that?    [Karadzic] No, we did not ask for aid. But I admit that we  were hoping to get it. And it came.    Incidentally, I must say that Russian writers and their  protests and solidarity with us had a big influence on your  government.    [Fartyshev] Radovan, you are a well-known poet. Just before  this war you were presented with a prize for making a major  contribution to the development of Yugoslav children's poetry.  How do you manage to combine politics and poetry?    [Karadzic] When Yugoslavia was torn apart we writers were  forced to become politicians. Now most writers in my country  are politicians, and they have done a very great deal to defend  the Serbian people and their sovereignty. We have always  studied the classics of Russian literature, without which there  would be no world literature. In the same way, without Russian  politics there can be no world politics.    As a poet I am very grateful to a number of Russian  publications for publishing my poetry at what is a most  difficult time for my country.    [Fartyshev] There was one particular phrase that struck me  in Dostoyevskiy's "Diaries" -- to the effect that the time would  come when the southern Slavs would "set us an example." What do  you think he meant?    [Karadzic] As I see it, what he meant was that we, the  southern Slavs, live on the border between East and West. In  the present war Yugoslavia was merely the first line of defense  for Slavdom and Orthodox culture in general. This war was a  dress rehearsal for what lay in store for Russia. A veritable  blitzkrieg was mounted against us. The West, NATO, and Germany  were planning to deal with Yugoslavia in two months. But they  did not manage it even in two years. Next in their plans was  Albania, and then the dirct route to Russia. But we are not  talking, of course, about outright aggression, no, the main task  is to split peoples, make them quarrel among themselves, make  Russia small. Never let yourself be divided -- that is one of  the lessons of our war.    Take Ethiopia, another Orthodox country. It lost Eritrea,  and with it access to the sea. And no one in the world  interceded on its behalf. The same might have happened to us,  had not great Russia interceded on Orthodox, Slavic, fraternal  Serbia's behalf.    [Fartyshev] Tell me, has the war ended or is this just a  pause?    [Karadzic] I would like to believe that the war will end  soon. And we will create a new border between East and West, so  that there are no more intrigues against the Slavic world.    [Fartyshev] Are the intrigues still going on?    [Karadzic] I heard a speech by Zbigniew Brzezinski recently.  He always talked with great passion about the fight against  Bolshevism. There is no Bolshevism now, but he is just as  vicious when he talks about the fight against Russia. I  realized that it is not actually a matter of communist ideology  -- Brzezinski and dozens of special institutes in the West have  been fighting and will continue to fight against the USSR,  Russia, and the Russian people.</p>

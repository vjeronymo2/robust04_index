			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 17 (AFP) -- Serb forces Sunday [17  April] released 19 UN peacekeepers who had been held hostage for  three days at a barracks at Ilijas, north of here, a UN  spokesman said in the Bosnian capital.    The peacekeepers were freed at 1:35 p.m. (1135 GMT), said  Major Eric Chaperon.    The troops, 16 Canadian peacekeepers and three military  observers of unspecified nationality, were due to return to  their post at Cifluk, 19 kilometres (11 miles) northwest of  Sarajevo, Chaperon said.    They had been deployed there to monitor seven Serb mortar  and  two anti-aircraft cannons.    The batteries had been retained in Cifluk in violation of  the  February accord under which Bosnian Serbs agreed to withdraw all  heavy weapons from a 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone  around the Bosnian capital under threat of North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation air strikes.    Bosnian Serb forces still detained or blocked Sunday  hundreds  of United Nations peacekeepers in several Serb-held sectors of  Bosnia.</p>

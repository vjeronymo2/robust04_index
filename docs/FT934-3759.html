			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / More Austrian letter bombs A letter bomb badly injured a legal clerk yesterday and Austrian police defused three more devices in a wave of attacks against refugees and supporters. Four people have been injured by the bombs in the past four days, including Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's Social Democratic mayor, who lost several fingers in a blast on Sunday night. Tha attackers have been labelling the devices with the name of a 17th century hero, according to Mr Franz Loesnack, the interior minister, suggesting the letters might be coming from the country's extreme right. 'We're fighting back. Count Ruediger von Starhemberg' was found on four of 10 letter bombs intercepted by police, he said. In 1683, Count Ernst Ruediger von Starhemberg successfully defended the Austrian capital against a siege by the armies of the Ottoman empire. A later Count Ernst Ruediger Starhemberg took part in the 1923 Munich putsch by Adolf Hitler and went on to become interior minister and vice-chancellor in the fascist Dollfuss regime before the second world war. The attacks began on Friday injuring a Roman Catholic curate and a Croatian-born television presenter of programmes aimed at immigrants. Most of those targeted since have been active in helping refugees, foreigners or minorities in Austria. The recent influx of a large number of refugees from the former Communist countries and Yugoslavia has been exploited by right-wing politicians including neo-Nazi groups angered by what they describe as a foreign invasion encouraged by a duplicitous government.</p>

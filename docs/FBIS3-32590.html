This comment overlooked the public  statement by President Carlos Menem that Argentina would join  the TLC together with the entire Mercosur [Common Market of the  South]. Let us go part by part. What does Uruguay think about  this commercial agreement?    [Abreu] Our first assessment is positive. The TLC  represents an additional effort by the region's countries with  the purpose of forming commercial blocs, following the world  trend in this field. Therefore, the signing of an agreement that  involves Latin American countries such as Mexico with Canada and  the United States is a positive fact.    [Banales] Does the TLC clash with Mercosur?    [Abreu] They complement each other. These schemes begin to  overlap each other to the extent that the regional integration  blocs all lead to a greater liberation of trade. In other  words, we are making the integration project and the commercial  opening compatible, but for this the integration systems must be  flexible. It is not a matter of imposing a model to substitute  imports that will entail the isolation and autarchy of the  member countries of those blocs. For example, we believe that  the TLC, the Group of Three, the Andean Pact, Mercosur, and the  bilateral agreements reached within Aladi [Latin American  Integration Association] complement each other and head for a  commercial opening in keeping with the objectives also sought by  the Uruguay Round that ended last 15 December.    [Banales] Let us talk about Di Tella's comment. Can  Argentina -- in its capacity as a Mercosur member country --  unilaterally ask to join the TLC? Does that not affect the  Asuncion Treaty?    [Abreu] The Asuncion Treaty is the legal framework by which  Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, or Paraguay must abide. This treaty  clearly establishes the terms and condition for their  relationship with third countries. The four countries have been  jointly negotiating within the GATT, coordinating their stances.  We have legal duties established in the treaty that compel us  to design common commercial policies, and also the four  countries have an agreement with the United States known as  "Four Plus One" proposed by President (George) Bush that, to  some degree, has materialized following the congressional  approval of the four Mercosur member countries. It is a  negotiation and consultation forum that does not have the power  of a commercial agreement but allows for an institutional and  political rapprochement that, in our viewpoint, is the  appropriate mechanism for this relationship.    [Banales] Right. But what happens if one of the four  countries that signed the Asuncion Treaty decides to split away  and unilaterally ask to join another treaty, such as the TLC?    [Abreu] If Argentina, or any of the other three countries,  wants to leave Mercosur to join the TLC, it must apply the  appropriate mechanism established in the treaty. In this case,  the commercial concessions granted remain in force for another  two years. But if it wants to join the TLC, it also must follow  the same procedures Mexico is following. That is, it must  negotiate the concessions granted to third countries by virtue  of the agreements reached through the Montevideo Treaty signed  within the framework of Aladi. And this goes for Argentina as  well as for the remaining three other countries. It is not just  a matter of expressing a desire; there are obstacles that must  be overcome. The TLC is an integration mechanism that is just  starting; it establishes a free trade zone and is far from the  achievements already made by the four Mercosur member countries.    [Banales] In what sense?    [Abreu] Look, we already have reduced 82 percent of our  tariffs and as of next year -- with some exceptions for Paraguay  and Uruguay -- we will enjoy free trade, which is the TLC's  objective. This is why I maintain that Mercosur is not a mere  political expression or desire. We all want to join the TLC not  because it is a matter of standing in line to join another  treaty, preference zone, or free trade zone, but rather to seek  the mechanisms to join or become compatible with the different  integration schemes.    [Banales] Is Mercosur one of Uruguay's priority issues?    [Abreu] For us Mercosur is a top priority for the four  member countries. This was politically ratified by the four  countries, and currently we are defining the Common Foreign  Tariff, a field in which we have made great technical and  political progress. Therefore, going back to your question, we  believe that any desire to join the TLC is naturally subject to  the legal and political situation. We support any initiative  within this framework because we believe that joining the TLC  merely complements the integration systems. Argentina, as well  as Brazil, have ratified their decision to remain within  Mercosur and then negotiate with the rest of the regional  projects.    [Banales] Has Mercosur already yielded any concrete results  for Uruguay?    [Abreu] Well, if you analyze it, yes. Uruguay's intra-zone  trade during the past few years has gone from $3 billion to $8  billion. This difference may be conditioned, among other  things, by monetary or exchange policies that sometime distort  trade in -- should we say -- a non-genuine manner. But we also  must admit that our intra-zone trade has increased  substantially. To Uruguay, its Mercosur partners represent a  record percentage of its trade history. Currently our Mercosur  partners account for 45 percent of our foreign trade, and we  notice that the treaty has an important impact in the commercial  field. Uruguay's concentric circles policy favors our  commercial partners such as Argentina and Brazil, in addition to  complementing this subregional strategy with a more global  commercial opening.    The Mercosur path is undoubtedly full of obstacles and  difficulties but Uruguay continues to unwaveringly support the  treaty's ratification.</p>

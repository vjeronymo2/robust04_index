			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> EMBATTLED SCHOOL DISTRICT FACES ELECTION;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: SCANDAL AND ACCUSATIONS OF POLITICAL MANEUVERING BY THE ORANGE  UNIFIED BOARD HAVE DRAWN 19 CANDIDATES HOPING TO FILL FOUR SEATS AND ONE  UNEXPIRED TERM OF OFFICE.  </P> <P> The lingering effects of a years-old kickback scandal and divisive labor  disputes have made the Orange Unified School District board race the most  crowded and controversial of the eight school contests on the Nov. 7 ballot.  </P> <P> Plagued by the scandal and a seven-day teachers' strike last spring, the first  in the county in three years, the district also has had more recent problems.  Board members were accused of making a controversial school-boundary change out  of the public eye by traveling to Palm Springs in August and making the  decision there.  </P> <P> This tumultuous atmosphere has resulted in 19 candidates vying for four  single-district seats and an unexpired term in a fifth area.  </P> <P> The three incumbents seeking reelection to the seven-member board have  struggled to get out from under the shadow of Orange County's biggest school  scandal in a decade. One of them, county General Services Agency supervisor Joe  J. Cherry, could face a new trial on charges in connection with the kickback  scandal that rocked the district more than three years ago.  </P> <P> Critics say that by running again, Cherry is prolonging the district's  inability to move beyond its infamy. Cherry, however, says he's running partly  to vindicate himself.  </P> <P> Six candidates have filed to run against him in Area 5, the highest number of  challengers in any of the Orange Unified races.  </P> <P> "The shadow is not only over the board, but it's all over the whole district,"  said Kevin Rice, a businessman who is seeking election to another vacant seat.  </P> <P> The other two trustees implicated in the matter, Ruth C. Evans, who has served  20 years on the board, and Robert James Elliott, who has served for 25 years,  are not seeking reelection.  </P> <P> The three were accused by the 1986-87 Orange County Grand Jury of "willful  misconduct in office" for allegedly not minding the store while thousands of  dollars in kickback contracts were negotiated from the district's headquarters.  </P> <P> The other two incumbents seeking reelection besides Cherry, board President  Sandy Englander and trustee Jane McCracken, have consistently reminded voters  that they were not on the board when the alleged incidents of mismanagement  occurred.  </P> <P> McCracken was named to the board in February to fill a vacancy when member  William Steiner was appointed to the Orange City Council. By law, the district  must put his position on the ballot even though there are only two years left  in Steiner's four-year term.  </P> <P> The district has more than 25,000 students and includes the cities of Orange  and Villa Park, and portions of Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The campaign has been marked by high spending -- some candidates say they are  spending as much as $20,000 -- political consultants advising the candidates  and a variety of forums in which district employees have tried to challenge  incumbents on the issues.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, about 80% of the district's 1,200 non-teaching employees  staged a sickout to protest a breakdown in wage negotiations. An agreement has  yet to be reached in that matter. On Thursday about 200 chanting non-classified  employees demonstrated outside the district's offices as board members were  meeting.  </P> <P> Also this month, parents criticized the board for making a controversial change  in school attendance boundaries while they were at a retreat in Palm Springs,  with no members of the public present.  </P> <P> Several representatives of the teacher's union, wearing buttons that said,  "Kids, not Politics," presented a "State of the Schools" report to the board  Thursday night, citing overcrowded classrooms and lack of support for the  district's bilingual education program.  </P> <P> Last year, the district's teachers staged a seven-day strike over wage  negotiations, and relations between them and the district are still less than  cordial.  </P> <P> The unions for both employee groups have jointly endorsed a field of  candidates, but did not support any incumbents.  </P> <P> They endorsed Nancy Moore, a former teacher who is now an administrator for the  Azusa Unified School District, for Area 3, the seat now held by McCracken; Lila  Beavans, a consultant to the Orangewood Children's Foundation, in Area 4,  Elliott's seat; Barry Resnick, a department chairman at Rancho Santiago College  for Area 5, who is running against Cherry; and James Preston, a medical doctor,  for Area 7, Evans' old seat.  </P> <P> The teachers did not endorse in the Area 1 race, the seat held by Englander.  </P> <P> "We feel it's time for a change," Stover said in a recent interview. "We feel  there's got to be a change in the direction of the school board. We're tired of  politics being the major motivator in this district.  </P> <P> "Teachers are very frustrated because we know this is a good district in spite  of everything around us," she said. "Yet it's getting more and more difficult  to stay here and fight the good fight when you really don't have the support,  when downtown has other priorities."  </P> <P> But the biggest issue facing incumbents during this election is the ghost of  the past few years' troubles.  </P> <P> Bob Bennyhoff, who delivers sharp barbs to the board every chance he gets or in  Common Talk, a community newspaper partly owned by his wife, says the board has  not overcome the taint of the bid-rigging scandal.  </P> <P> "There is a general sense of unease, a general sense of mistrust dating back to  the early '80s," he said recently. "I don't believe the people of this district  have confidence in this board. . . . People still believe things are just not  right down there, and they will not support any of the current board members."  </P> <P> Several candidates running for public office for the first time say that it was  those events that prompted them to enter the campaign.  </P> <P> In his campaign literature, candidate Al Irish, an accountant running for the  Area 7 seat, talks about "the lack of trust and confidence the public, parents  and school employees have here in Orange." Candidate Beavans says in a flyer:  "The lack of leadership at the board level has caused serious problems in poor  morale among parents and employees."  </P> <P> Other candidates say that the current board has spent so much time keeping  itself out of legal hot water that it hasn't had time to deal with the business  of educating children.  </P> <P> "Our district has declined into a private club that is concerned less with our  children or schools and more with politics," said James Preston, another Area 7  candidate. "I honestly believe the Orange Unified school board has let our  children down."  </P> <P> Terri Sargent, a part-time land-use planner with the county, said she is  challenging Cherry "because I want to put the focus back on the needs of  children."  </P> <P> A two-year investigation by the Orange Police Department and the district  attorney's office resulted in the 1987 indictments of former district  maintenance supervisor Steven L. Presson, his wife and two contractors. They  were charged with misappropriation of public funds, but the complex case has  been stalled by delays and has yet to go to trial.  </P> <P> While no criminal action was taken against three members who were on the board  at the time of the alleged bid-rigging, the civil charges against them could  lead to a loss of office. A fourth board member, Eleanore Pleines, was also  accused by the grand jury, but she resigned her seat in 1987.  </P> <P> Cherry continues to fight the charges because he believes he should not be  penalized for the criminal actions of someone else.  </P> <P> "It's just beyond me to know how I'm supposed to know what happens in the heart  of an organization when I come in part time and only as a policy-maker," he  said. "We (the trustees) are actually policy-setters. We set policy and give  direction to the superintendent."  </P> <P> He added that he would not be spending so much money to defend himself if he  was not innocent. The three board members have been told that if they do not  seek reelection, the charges will be dropped, because the only penalty is  removal from office.  </P> <P> "If I don't run, I still have an obligation for a good deal of money to a legal  firm, and if I don't run, . . . it's all over, I'll have been smeared and I'll  never have an opportunity to defend myself. The decision to run was not  difficult. The decision not to run would have been extremely difficult for me."  </P> <P> The incumbents say they realize that the baggage they bring from the past few  years could weigh them down during this campaign.  </P> <P> "I guess right now I think we've been through a very hard last four years,"  Englander said. The investigations and charges "really put most of us back a  while," she said. "A lot of effort went into not so much defending (the three  board members), but we did file our own lawsuit against Presson and that took  up a lot our time. . . . It really has been a drain on our energies."  </P> <P> ORANGE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT CANDIDATES  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Nov. 7, voters in the Orange Unified School District will choose  candidates for five seats on the seven-member board of trustees. The  25,000-student district includes the cities of Orange and Villa Park, and parts  of Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Seats for areas 1, 4, 5 and 7 are 4-year terms; in area 3, voters will choose a  candidate to serve the remaining two years of William G. Steiner's term. Jane  McCracken was appointed to the seat in February after Steiner resigned to  accept appointment to the Orange City Council.  </P> <P> Area 1  </P> <P> John Hurley  </P> <P> College instructor  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P> <P> Area 4  </P> <P> Lila Beavans  </P> <P> Training and development consultant  </P> <P> Villa Park  </P> <P> James H.

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TERM LIMIT PETITIONS CIRCULATED  </P> <P> Proponents of an initiative that would limit elected officials in Inglewood to  three consecutive terms in office have begun circulating petitions to get the  measure on the ballot next June.  </P> <P> Curren D. Price Jr., founder of Inglewood Citizens for Reasonable Reform, asked  the City Council on Tuesday to place the proposed city Charter amendment on the  ballot without requiring the initiative procedure. But he vowed to gather  enough signatures if the council takes no action.  </P> <P> Council members did not discuss the proposal at Tuesday's meeting. However,  Councilman Anthony Scardenzan has spoken out against the measure, and the other  three council members have argued that the petition process should decide  whether the measure is placed on the ballot.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't care if they limited people's terms to one," Mayor Edward Vincent  said after the meeting. "I think if the people want it, they should do it."  </P></p>

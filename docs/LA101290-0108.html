			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.F. BALLET A BOX OFFICE FLOP IN S.D.  </P> <P> The San Francisco Ballet inaugurated the fall season for the San Diego  Foundation for the Performing Arts last weekend, but despite the company's  international reputation and critical acclaim, the four-performance run at the  3,000-seat seat Civic Theatre was a flop at the box office.  </P> <P> "We've had some interesting signals," managing director Fred Colby said after  the close of the last show. "We've increased our subscriptions 100% over last  year. We sold about 1,450 season tickets this year. That's the most  subscriptions we've had in over three years. On the other hand, we're having  trouble drawing single-ticket sales.  </P> <P> "We only missed our projections by about 7%. We expected to fill 65% of the  house, and we ended up at 58%. It's a good thing the rest of the season is at  the Spreckels," a much smaller venue, he said.  </P> <P> "Fortunately, we budgeted very conservatively," Colby said. "We lost money, but  we're only talking about maybe 3% or 4% of our entire budget. That means it  won't really affect anything on stage. It will only mean making cutbacks in  internal things, like marketing, and maybe some outreach programs."  </P> <P> About 300 students attended San Francisco Ballet performances free of charge as  a result of that community outreach program. However, Colby said, "the only way  I can block those tickets off, is if we have more (underwriting). Even if we  sell out, we're still losing money. People don't understand that, but it's a  fact."  </P> <P> Although the poor turnout for the San Francisco Ballet will have no effect on  the 1990-91 season, it might carry over to next year's programming.  </P> <P> "San Diego is not ready for a lot of major ballet," Colby said. "We had the  Bolshoi here, and then the New York City Ballet up the road (in Orange County).  Some people exhausted their budget on the Bolshoi alone. We even had the  symphony open its season on the same weekend. That probably accounts for the 7%  drop in attendance from our projected figures. We didn't know the other dates  when we were setting our schedule.  </P> <P> "But with a city this size we should be able to support them all. That's why  City Moves is so important," he said, referring to the foundation's new  educational arm. "The first year alone, it will introduce 2,500 kids to dance.  We had sell-outs the first time we brought in major dance companies like the  American Ballet and the Joffrey. We've got to teach (audiences) to go back each  time they're here.  </P> <P> "We've also got to retrain people to come downtown. We know what we're putting  on stage is good, and people aren't seeing it. That's what's so frustrating,"  said Colby. "We don't expect to make money on this. We just want people to see  these things."  </P> <P> Overall financial support for the foundation's efforts is good, Colby said. "We  have about $425,000 in contributed income either already in or pledged, so  we're way ahead of the game. This (the four-day stint at the Civic) was a  calculated risk. Now, we'll have to feel our way back to the Civic Theater. But  this won't stop us from doing what we have to do for the rest of the season. In  November, we'll have an improved plan for next year. We're still learning."  </P></p>

In his  reply to the settlers' opposition to the principle of withdrawal  from the Golan and the possibility of dismantling and evacuating  the settlements there, Rabin proposed a general referendum to  decide on the dispute over the future of the Golan.    Clinton's promises and pledges to maintain Israel's military  edge over the Arabs are not enough. All the guarantees and  concessions that Hafiz al-Asad offers are not enough. Because  the Jew, who has become an Israeli, does not look at his huge  gains in land, security, and superiority, but raises media and  political battles concerning the tiny issue of the land of  others that he will relinquish after imposing too many  conditions.    The settlers do not feel secure about the future despite the  U.S. proposals for deploying U.S. forces in a buffer zone in the  Golan, in which U.S. military bases will shoulder the tasks of  warning and security that are shouldered by the settlements at  present.    To the Jew, who is skilled in blackmail, the U.S. presence  in  the Golan is a gain for Washington, and Israeli military power,  which was created through U.S. support, is also a gain to  Washington and its Middle East policy. Therefore, the U.S.  policy of giving orders that will be applied by Arab rulers  engaged in the settlement does not suit the rulers in Tel Aviv  or the Israeli settlers.    According to U.S. plans for establishing a U.S. peace in the  Middle East through Israeli-Arab agreements and through  subjecting the rule of the Arab agents to the security,  military, and economic needs of Washington, the Arab rulers  should apply the U.S. orders.    We have not heard from a ruler participating in the  settlement any promise to conduct a referendum on reconciliation  with Tel Aviv, on establishing normal relations with it and on  relinquishing most of the land of Palestine and some nearby Arab  territories.    While we hear the enemy, which the colonialist West set up,  speak about referendums on the fate of a land that does not  belong to it, we do not hear Hafiz al-Asad asking the people of  Syria about their opinion. This is because he knows well the  Syrian people's opinion of their enemy, which is occupying some  of their land and the whole of Palestine. Al-Asad also knows  the opinion of the Syrian people on his regime, his personality,  as well as his pan-Arab, international, and internal policies.    The strangest thing is that Hafiz al-Asad is opposed to the  idea of a referendum, about which Rabin spoke to his settlers.  This is because to al-Asad, the subject is really about  agreements between presidents, with which the Syrian people have  nothing to do, despite the fact that the Syrian people are the  owners of the land. By this premise, why should the Israelis  have an opinion on this subject?    This time we agree with Hafiz al-Asad's viewpoint. It is  true that the Syrian people have nothing to do with al-Asad's  agreements with Washington and Tel Aviv, because the Syrian  people are innocent of these agreements and of al-Asad's signing  of these agreements.</p>

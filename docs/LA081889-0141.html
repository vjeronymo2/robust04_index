			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAL STALLS DECISION ON DAVIS TAKEOVER BID  </P> <P> UAL Corp. on Thursday stalled a decision on Los Angeles billionaire Marvin  Davis' $6.2-billion takeover offer, saying it was "still premature" to decide  whether selling itself was appropriate and that it would continue to study  other alternatives.  </P> <P> The company, parent of United Airlines, also confirmed that it has been  contacted by various third parties regarding possible bids. In addition, it  said its advisers met with representatives of an employee group. That group is  known to be the airline's pilots.  </P> <P> UAL's announcement, which came following a nearly all-day board meeting, fueled  speculation that UAL will seek to pursue a management buyout or  recapitalization to block Davis' sweetened $275-per-share offer made Wednesday.  </P> <P> But UAL's announcement came as pressures mounted on the carrier to put itself  up for auction. UAL stock has risen about $100 per share since Davis made his  initial $240-per-share offer on Aug. 7, making defensive moves more expensive.  </P> <P> In a statement released after the UAL announcement, Davis continued to hold out  hope that a friendly transaction could be pursued.  </P></p>

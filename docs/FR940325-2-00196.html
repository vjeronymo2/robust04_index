Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend ICC's Rules prohibiting insider trading to conform with recent amendments to Regulation 1.59 <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  of the CFTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 1.59. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, ICC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. ICC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change will amend ICC's Rules prohibiting the misuse of material, nonpublic information to conform with recent amendments to CFTC Regulation 1.59. In general, conforming amendments to ICC's Rules are necessary because Regulation 1.59, as amended: (1) Changes certain of the definitions that are effective for purposes of the insider trading rules of self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''); and (2) requires SROs to adopt and maintain rules prohibiting trading in commodity interests traded on or cleared by linked exchanges of such SROs. In addition, amendments to ICC's Rules are necessary to ensure the conformity of references to the term ``non-public.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conforming references to the term ``non-public'' have been made throughout Rule 222 and reference is made in Rule 222 to the Interpretations and Policies following Rule 222. In addition, the scope of ICC's insider trading prohibition is extended to reach any commodity interest traded on or cleared by any linked exchange of ICC. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  At present, there are no commodity interests that are traded on or cleared by any linked exchange of ICC. The definitions of the terms ``linked exchange,'' ``material information,'' ``non-public information,'' and ``related commodity interest'' have been amended in Interpretations and Policies .01 of Rule 222 to conform with amendments to CFTC Regulation 1.59.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ICC Rule 222(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ICC believes the proposed amendments are consistent with the requirements of section 17A(b)(3)(F) <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  of the Act in that the amendments will protect investors and the public interest by extending the reach of ICC's prohibitions on the misuse of material, non-public information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78q-1(b)(3)(F). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

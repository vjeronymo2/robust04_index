			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> MAN WHO PEDALED CRAFT ALOFT HONORED  </P> <P> An Ojai bicyclist who piloted the first flight of a human-powered helicopter  was honored Monday at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington with  other students from the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student group that built the  helicopter.  </P> <P> Greg McNeil, 22, was unable to attend the National Aeronautic Assn. award  ceremony because he is training for the 1992 Olympic bicycling team.  </P> <P> On Dec. 10, McNeil and a group of other Cal Poly students set a world record  when he hovered for 6.8 seconds in a human-powered helicopter they had  designed.  </P> <P> "It was great. You're bicycling as fast as you can and then all of a sudden --  you're flying," McNeil said Monday of the historic flight. "I bought a plane  ticket to go to Washington, but I canceled it because I just didn't have the  time."  </P> <P> McNeil is one of 46 men and women on the United States bicycling team vying to  compete in the Olympics. He said he bicycles in about 100 races a year and is a  part-time student at Cal Poly majoring in aeronautical engineering.  </P> <P> "I go to school one quarter a year because of the bicycling-at this rate, I'll  finish in 15 years," McNeil said.

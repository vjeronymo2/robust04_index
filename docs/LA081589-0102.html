			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: AME LOSES $213,157; CITES COSTS OF BUYOUT PROPOSAL  </P> <P> AME Inc., a Burbank provider of post-production services for the entertainment  industry, said it lost $213,157 in its fiscal third quarter, compared with a  $126,654 profit a year earlier.  </P> <P> The loss in the quarter ended June 30 came despite a 28% increase in AME's  revenue, to $15.3 million from $12.0 million. The company blamed the loss on  costs related to a proposal by an investor group to purchase AME.  </P> <P> The group, led by Lawrence J. Berkowitz, agreed last month to pay $57 million  for AME's stock and to assume about $42 million of AME's debt outstanding. The  price includes $10 a share for the 44% stake held by AME founder and chairman  Andrew M. McIntyre, and $12.50 a share for the remaining stock.  </P> <P> In the first nine months of its fiscal year, AME lost $190,625, compared with  year-earlier profit of $2.30 million. Nine-month revenue climbed 38% to $47.4  million from $34.3 million.  </P></p>

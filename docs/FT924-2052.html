			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Letter: Japanese report sets example for Russian economic reform Sir, In his Personal View (December 10) on the Russian economy, John Odling-Smee makes no reference to measures of the kind proposed by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry in a document delivered to Moscow earlier this year ('Economic Notebook: A Japanese lesson for all', July 20). These draw upon Japanese experiences in the post-1946 period to make suggestions about economic reform in Russia. The Miti document refers to an International Monetary Fund memorandum of February 27 about measures the Russian government has to take by the end of this year. It accepts those measures as necessary for macroeconomic stabilisation (specifically mentioning as essential a move towards price liberalisation 'which no other policy measure should be allowed to impede') but doubts that those measures alone are enough to revitalise production. It comments that the government thinks it can implement microeconomic restructuing after there are signs of macroeconomic stability, but believes that macroeconomic stabilisation will take about five years. It argues that market mechanisms alone will not work; some government intervention is inevitable; to diversify investment would be the worst policy; a focus is needed on specific sectors. It proposes a 'Russian-type new priority production system' with priority to the oil industry which would involve price, quota and export tax arrangements. Such arrangements, the document claims, could have beneficial effects on the costs of other important industries, provide a significant source of foreign currency for industrial modernisation, and impart a stabilising fiscal influence. The foregoing is a brief extract from advice which derives from the Japanese experience in managing a successful economic performance. It would be helpful to understanding the policy-making scene to know whether the Russians are being encouraged to see the Japanese advice as a potentially constructive contribution to their planning.

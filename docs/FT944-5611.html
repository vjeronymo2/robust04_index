			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GRT climbs 24% to Pounds 2.9m GRT, the smallest of the listed bus and coach operators, yesterday announced a 24 per cent increase in profits, aided by contributions from its aggressive acquisitions policy. Pre-tax profits rose from a pro-forma Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 2.85m in the 24 weeks to September 10 on turnover up 67 per cent at Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 15.3m), including Pounds 2.73m from acquisitions. The company said that following recent purchases, it now controlled annual revenues estimated at Pounds 92.4m, compared with the Pounds 39.9m achieved in the year to March 31 1993. Since its flotation in May, the group has participated in the rapid consolidation of the British bus industry through acquisitions of Eastern Counties, in East Anglia, and Reiver Ventures and SMT in Scotland. It remains keen to make further acquisitions. Operating profits rose from Pounds 2.12m to Pounds 2.98m, with acquisitions providing Pounds 170,000. The contribution from acquisitions will accelerate in the second half. On a like-for-like basis, GRT said it achieved a slight improvement in operating profit margins on existing businesses from 14.5 to 14.8 per cent. It added that it was rapidly turning around the performance of its recent acquisitions. During 1994 and 1995, it is buying 100 new buses at a cost of Pounds 10m. This should help counter the 3 to 4 per cent annual decline in passenger numbers, and would also improve margins through lower maintenance costs. It is paying a maiden dividend of 1.4p per share from earnings of 5.5p (4.5p).</p>

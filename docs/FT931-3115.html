			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Government tells the 14 electricity companies to resolve problems THE government has told the 14 electricity companies in England and Wales to resolve by Friday outstanding problems on tentative contracts with British Coal in preparation for a white paper next week, Michael Smith writes. Its exhortation on proposed deals for 40m tonnes next year and 30m in each of the following years will increase speculation that its coal review will save only a handful of the 31 threatened pits. National Power and PowerGen, the two generators for England and Wales, have heard nothing substantial from the government for more than two weeks on additional tonnages. This suggests the government wants a tonnage closer to the 40m over five years which the generators have indicated they are comfortable with, rather than the 65.5m the government originally wanted them to take. At most an additional 40m tonnes would save eight pits and possibly less. In spite of the electricity companies' expectations, it is possible that the government's timetable has slipped further in the past few days, and the white paper, originally promised for February, will be published next month. The cabinet is not due to discuss coal tomorrow and it will almost certainly be required to give its approval to any plans following revelations that many ministers were kept in the dark before the original closure decisions last October.</p>

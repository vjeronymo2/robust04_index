			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Financial therapy for a mid-life crisis: The Japanese government is confident of economic recovery, but adjustment could be painful and protracted The heyday of the Japanese economic miracle is over. The days when Japan's financiers, manufacturers and retailers could revel in an economy growing at more than 4 per cent a year have gone, perhaps for good. Japan has become a mature economy. Mr Naohiro Amaya, a former vice-minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, one of the architects of Japan's success, puts it this way. 'Japan is particularly susceptible to the Peter Pan syndrome. Even though the economy is now adult, many people behave as if we are a child.' Mr Amaya believes the Japanese economy is beginning a long period of adjustment during which it will grow only slowly, a period which could last until the late 1990s. The economy's main growth industries, cars and electronics, are facing a sharp fall in demand which is forcing them to reconsider their traditional high-growth strategies. The Japanese banks are burdened by bad debts which will take several years to clear. The nation's service sector is facing its first recession. Japanese consumer spending is flat after the conspicuous consumption of the 1980s. If this view proves accurate then yesterday's 0.75 point cut in the official discount rate, to the historic low of 2.5 per cent, may not revive the economy, which the government forecasts will grow by only 1.6 per cent in the year to March, down from 5 per cent two years ago. Yet such opinion is in the minority amid the optimism which rules in most government departments and financial institutions. The optimists argue that Japan is going through a cyclical downturn after the collapse of the speculative bubble economy of 1987 to 1989 when credit was cheap and share prices, land values and profits soared to record highs. Once demand recovers, fuelled by low interest rates and public spending, the optimists believe the economy should grow, from this autumn, by more than 3 per cent a year. The next six months will show whether Japan is going to bounce back after recession or whether the economy needs structural reform over several years. The restructuring of the Japanese economy in the wake of the first oil shock in 1973 took four years. Will it take that long this time? The government is confident the economy will escape the need for root-and-branch reform, largely because it is engaged in an ambitious effort to shore it up. The interest rate cut is part of that effort. By itself the discount rate cut will only have a limited impact on the economy. The biggest beneficiaries will be Japan's hard-pressed banks, which are facing mounting bad debts from speculative property lending. Lower official interest rates will reduce the cost of their borrowing from the Bank of Japan and so allow them to widen profit margins. Yet even with the discount rate at an all-time low it is unlikely that the cut alone will revive consumer spending or investment. Corporate investment is being cut sharply. This is because many industries have excess capacity as investments planned in the late 1980s come on stream at a time when demand is depressed. Japanese households are such prodigious savers that their income from savings is more than twice their interest payments on borrowings. The cut in rates may discourage them from saving more, but it will also reduce disposable income. But more support for the economy is on the way, in the shape of public spending and tax cuts. The Y10,700bn (Pounds 60bn) emergency spending package approved by parliament last autumn is only just filtering through into the economy. This year's budget, which increases overall spending by about 7 per cent, is due to be approved next month. A task force from the ruling Liberal Democratic party is drawing up plans for another emergency package, worth perhaps Y4,000bn and probably including tax cuts, to be announced this spring. Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Bros, the US stockbroker, believes this fiscal push is so large it will eventually revive consumption. The growth rate of personal consumption has halved from 2.6 per cent in 1991 to about 1.3 per cent this year. According to Mr Feldman, the foundations for a consumer-led recovery are in place. Unemployment is still only 2.4 per cent, employment is still growing, albeit slowly, and compensation per employee is likely to rise this year by between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. He believes consumer spending should grow by close to 3 per cent this year, about the level of the mid-1980s. That should allow the economy to grow by 3 per cent this year and next. The equation may not be that simple. First, there are doubts about whether consumption will respond to the fiscal stimulus. This year's fall in consumer spending has mystified economists, mainly because the labour market remains tight and household finances are relatively healthy. Some observers attribute the decline to a shift in tastes and attitudes. After the spending spree of the late 1980s many Japanese are going back to basics - simpler products which give value for money. The markets for electronics and cars are saturated after high growth in the late 1980s. A second obstacle to recovery may be structural problems in finance and industry. Most Japanese corporations are facing a fourth year of declining profits. A recovery in corporate earnings is vital to fund renewed investment. But profits will only recover if Japanese companies tackle their costs, which grew rapidly in the 1980s. The tight profit margins at many Japanese companies leave them vulnerable to a slight fall in sales. This is because their fixed costs and wage bills grew rapidly in the 1980s. 'Restructuring based on squeezing or reducing personnel costs is an urgent priority. In some cases survival is at stake,' says the Japan Research Institute, a private sector research group. Cost reductions on the required scaled could take years, given the constraints of Japan's lifetime employment system. The financial sector is in no better shape. The banks are facing mounting bad debts which could come to more than Y50,000bn, equivalent to about 12 per cent of gross national product. While they are trying to reduce their bad debts, lending could be curbed. Low bank lending is one of the main factors behind the recent unprecedented contraction of the money supply. So if consumption does start to pick up, a recovery might be stifled by the banks' inability to lend to promote growth. One further uncertainty clouds the economic outlook. While the optimistic outlook prevails in government and the bureaucracy, there is some disagreement about how to respond to the downturn. The Bank of Japan only agreed to the discount rate cut after the Ministry of Finance and the LDP exerted pressure. More important, there is no agreement over the strategic aim of economic policy. LDP leaders want a strong recovery to secure victory in a general election due by spring next year. They also want to head off American calls for Japan to reduce its rising trade surplus by delivering higher Japanese growth. But some senior officials at the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance believe the high growth and cheap credit of the 1980s disguised and delayed the need for long-term restructuring to adjust to slower growth. As one finance ministry official puts it: 'Companies made huge profits in the late 1980s, they should suffer some pain now. We have to learn that we are not like Korea; we are not a developing nation any more; we have to slow down.' But the longer the slowdown lasts, the more likely it is that Japan will be in for a painful, wrenching period of restructuring, which could last into the second half of the decade.</p>

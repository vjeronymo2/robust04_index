			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Sainsbury joins supermarket price war J. Sainsbury is joining the autumn price skirmishing with rival supermarket groups with a series of bold, 10-second TV advertisements offering a third or more off the price of selected products. The UK's biggest food retailer said the brash campaign - a departure from its celebrity recipe advertisements - was designed to improve perceptions of its pricing, alongside its reputation for quality. The campaign started yesterday as Iceland, the frozen food retailer, launched an 'Everyday super value range' of basic frozen goods which it said were being sold at almost 20 per cent below their 1984 prices. Sainsbury's new advertisements, more reminiscent of a discount chain but carrying its long-standing slogan 'Sainsbury's - where good food costs less', will run in tandem with its recipe advertisements, producing what Mr Ivor Hunt, marketing director, called a 'double whammy'. Mr Hunt said that in addition to its strong brand name Sainsbury's weekly price check on 750 product lines consistently showed it had a 2 per cent or 3 per cent price advantage over competitors. He said: 'We want to strengthen our price perception. We don't get the credit for these low prices.' He added that the group was using 'short, dramatic and to-the-point' advertisements to 'illustrate prices in a stronger way'. Mr Hunt denied that the advertisements might be seen as downmarket or risk harming the Sainsbury's brand. The advertisements will be backed by a programme of other temporary price cuts. Mr Hunt expected reduced gross margins to be 'more than offset' by increased sales. Sainsbury is also continuing its 'Essentials' campaign, launched a year ago, offering indefinite reductions an about 300 products. Autumn promotions are an established feature of food retailing, but the aggressiveness of this year's campaigns reflects the highly competitive environment, with superstore groups squeezed by slow spending growth, a low-inflation environment, competition from cut-price chains, and increasing market saturation.</p>

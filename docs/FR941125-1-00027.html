			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The COMS must provide a means to simulate a zero and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upscale calibration value in order to check the COMS transmitter/receiver calibration. The calibration checking system shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include, at the same time, all the optical and electromechanical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment used in the normal measurement mode. The checking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system will measure and provide a permanent record of the COMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration status. The COMS's, which conduct zero and upscale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration drift (CD) assessments without simultaneously check <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ing all the components actively used in normal day-to-day opacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement, are deemed to deviate from the proposed specifica <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tions. The Agency recognizes that some existing dual-path COMS's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not include the reflector in the daily zero and span check.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, these COMS's have been, and will continue to be, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted exception to the simultaneous check requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The COMS shall provide operators visual or audible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alarms for exceeding PS&hyph;1, operation specification, equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failures, and effluent opacity standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The COMS shall provide an automated means to assess and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record accumulated automatic zero compensations on a 1-hour and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24-hour basis. The 1-hour is specifically required only during a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific 24-hour period of the operational test period. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24-hour assessment and recording of the 24-hour accumulated CD is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a continual requirement of the system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The automatic compensation for dirt accumulation on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> window surfaces of the COMS requires including the compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance in the 4 percent opacity tolerance for zero CD adjust <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ment. The measurement for determining compensation shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted on those surfaces that are directly in line with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light beam used to measure the effluent opacity. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only those optical surfaces, directly in the light beam path  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under normal operation to measure opacity, may be compensated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dust accumulation. The EPA has determined that systems that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempt to measure dust accumulation in locations, other than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement path of the normally transmitted measurement light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beam or assume equal and uniform dust accumulations on unmeasured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surfaces (e.g., reflectors), could result in unacceptable nega <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tive biases in opacity measurements. Those automatic dust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation systems that meet the optical path assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria may demonstrate and petition the Administrator for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in compensation to 20 percent opacity adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Providing a means to independently audit the COMS will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be required of all new and replacement COMS's. Manufacturers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COMS's, meeting the March 30, 1983 specifications, have routinely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated this performance check allowance into their designs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed specifications recognize and allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of a ``zero-jig.'' This apparatus, which must have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unique serial number specific to the installed COMS, may be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conduct performance check audits as well as for zero calibra <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tions of the COMS transmitter/receiver (dual-path systems) during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The COMS must automatically correct opacity emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured at the COMS installation location to the emission outlet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathlength. The capability to automatically display and record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pathlength correction factor (PLCF) changes must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated into the COMS design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Demonstration of Design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed demonstration of design conformance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of PS&hyph;1 have evolved from historical observation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current required demonstrations. Such demonstrations have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customarily been done by COMS manufacturers due to their unique  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capabilities at the manufacturing locations. The EPA believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this to be appropriate in 1983 when it allowed the source owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or operator to obtain a Manufacturer's Certificate of Conformance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (MCOC) rather than conducting design performance testing at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source. The EPA, then and now, continues to hold the source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner and operator responsible for the overall demonstration that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the COMS meets all of PS&hyph;1 requirements. Today's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specification requires COMS manufacturers to conduct the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specification testing required in section 6.0, Design Specific <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ation Verification Procedure. However, this does not relieve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source owners or operators from demonstrating compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable COMS requirements. Manufacturers of COMS's are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encouraged, although not required, to seek an EPA evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their design specification demonstration procedures for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model of COMS marketed as conforming with these specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evaluation will provide competitive advantages to successful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrations as well as providing purchaser assurances of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial conformance to regulatory requirements. The activity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to reduce retrofit and corrective costs potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encountered with nonconforming systems. The evaluation will also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that COMS's manufactured outside the United States (U.S.),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for subsequent sale in the U.S., perform testing in the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

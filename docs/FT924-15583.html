			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Arts: Badly handled science THERE ARE times when the Royal National Theatre seems like one of those old east European state enterprises where nothing matters except meeting the production targets. The product may be faulty, some of the people concerned must know that it is faulty, but there is no way of stopping it once it is in the system. No-one stands back and says 'look, we are inviting a paying audience to enjoy itself; this won't do.' Perhaps the actors are too frightened to protest. That is the charitable way of looking at Tony Harrison's Square Rounds, which opened at the Olivier on Thursday. A more unkind thought occurs: possibly the cast and directors are so involved in the performance that it does not occur to them to detach themselves and reflect on how awful it might look to the observer. To be fair to Harrison, he does not describe Square Rounds as a play but rather as a 'new theatre piece'. It is unclear what that means except as an excuse for having no characters, no drama, no pathos, no jokes and no plot. Square Rounds is about chemical weapons and the old truism that while science can be a force for good, it can also be a force for ill. Nothing wrong with that as a theme; it is the way of handling it that matters. After about the first two hours, I was preparing to write that nothing is as bad again as the first 20 minutes. That, however, is to reckon without the last 20. The piece opens with the Kaiser's scientists confronting the British over nitrogen and fertilisers: apparently the Brits had the wrong approach to defecation. The opening is scatological all the way. A huge, though mercifully curtained, WC occupies the centre of the stage. Then there is a twist. German scientists demonstrate their superiority by speaking in verse, and it is in verse that the piece proceeds. This is a reference to the German, Fritz Haber, who was a prolific versifier and is here shown developing chemical weapons. There is another slight twist in that practically all the characters are played by women, including about 20 'munitionettes'. A programme note lists 19 military inventions patented by women during the First World War, among them the cartridge tube filter, the incendiary ball and the single trigger mechanism, though what we are supposed to read into that is anybody's guess. There is one pleasure along the way. Sometimes the women break into song. The music by Dominic Muldowney is consistently good and there is some wonderful keyboard playing directed by Helen Ireland. Ignore the words and concentrate on the sound. The moral throughout seems to be that one weapons invention leads to another. Finally we abandon Anglo-German rivalry and move to China where they invented everything first. I found these last scenes racially offensive. The Chinamen (sic) are quite grotesquely parodied with silly grins and silly walks. A sample of the verse is: 'Yes, we learned how to fling what we call jen ching/ And with a bamboo bazooka hurled/ What is plain shit to you (and human shit too)/ The first toxic bomb in the world.' The production is sponsored by KPMG Management Consulting. Sara Kestelman plays Fritz Haber while not being a munitionette. Harrison himself directs what can be only described as a regrettable anachronism.</p>

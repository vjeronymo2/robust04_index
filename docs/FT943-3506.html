			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Japan to send soldiers to help Rwandan refugees Japan's governing coalition of Socialists and conservatives yesterday decided to send 470 soldiers to Zaire and Kenya, to help Rwandan refugees, William Dawkins reports from Tokyo. The three-month mission, to start on Saturday, is the third post-war use of Japanese troops abroad since Japanese participation in United Nations peacekeeping in Cambodia and Mozambique over the past two years. Japan's African mission, in response to a request from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, coincides with the relaunch of its hesitant bid to become a permanent member of the UN security council, the biggest test of Japan's will to assume international responsibilities equal to its economic weight. A cabinet meeting yesterday gave Mr Yohei Kono, foreign minister, clearance to voice Japan's wish for membership at a speech to the UN on September 27, on condition that Japan does not use force on UN duties, in line with its constitutional ban on using force to settle foreign disputes.</p>

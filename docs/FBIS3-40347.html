			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to news obtained by SPAZIO INFORMAZIONI  from a reliable source, the decision by University Education and  Research Minister Prof. Umberto Colombo on whether to complete  or abandon the program for the development of the Italian  scientific satellite SAX (X-Ray Astronomy Satellite) should be  given in the coming days or at most in the coming weeks. After  the much-publicized controversies that emerged within the ASI  [Italian Space Agency] on the scientific value and costs of the  mission (also involving former ASI Scientific Committee Chairman  Prof. Remo Ruffini and the Board of Directors at that time  chaired by Prof. Luciano Guerriero), Minister Colombo had  foreseen the possibility of freezing the SAX program, assigned  by the ASI to Alenia Spazio. In an interview given to a  Milanese daily newspaper last summer, Colombo declared: "I have  found there is extreme interest in the project. We must  consider the 320 billion lire already spent and decide whether  to conclude rapidly to guarantee the effectiveness of the  research to be performed for a further five to six years, or  whether it would be advisable to stop now. However there are  international commitments which must not be forgotten." The SAX  program, costing a total of approximately 700 billion lire  (including 418 billion lire for building the satellite), also  includes the scientific and industrial participation of the  Netherlands through the NIVR (Dutch Institute for Aircraft  Development and Aeronautics).    The structural and thermal mockup of the satellite is  currently undergoing vibration, thermal vacuum, and sound tests  at the European Space Agency (ESA) ESTEC [European Space  Research and Technology Center] in Noordwijk (the Netherlands),  while the engineering model is being subjected to a series of  tests at the Alenia Spazio plant in Turin. "Up to 90 percent of  the contract has already been spent on building the satellite,"  say the Italian engineers, "and all the hardware is now ready.  The assembly of the satellite flight units will start in early  1994. We are making normal progress and our view is that the  project is gaining increasing scientific importance." According  to recent forecasts -- and if Minister Colombo does not decide  otherwise at the last minute -- the SAX satellite should be  launched into orbit at the end of 1995 by an American launcher,  Atlas. The current plans of the ASI foresee the building of an  earth station in Singapore for receiving astronomical data  collected by SAX and for retransmission to Italy.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Banham throws council review into confusion AN ATTACK by Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, on a policy change by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has thrown the local authority review into confusion. Last month Mr Gummer said two-tier authorities should be replaced by all-purpose unitary authorities, even if they cost more. He said counties that kept the existing two-tier local authority structure should be an exception. Sir John said yesterday: 'I think it's absolutely astonishing that a government which claims it's under huge pressure to contain public spending is willing to put its name to the proposition that the extent of administrative overhead costs in shire England is of absolutely no concern.' The commission, charged with redrawing the map of local government in England, was appointed by the Department of the Environment. Sir John's move follows a letter by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, to Mr Gummer describing the department's new policy as 'an exercise in bureaucratic job creation across the country'. The department replied that the latest guidance asked the commission to find proposals that were 'worthwhile and cost-effective over time'. The government's desire for unitary authorities could also create conflict with Sir John. Polls conducted for the commission and published earlier this week found that an overall majority of people in County Durham favoured retaining the status quo. The Association of County Councils endorsed 'every word' of Sir John's comments. Ms Tina Day, of the association, said: 'This vindicates the idea of setting up an independent commission.' But the Association of District Councils supported the government's new policy. It said: 'The commission have appeared to treat cost as the sole determinant rather than one of the factors which should be taken into account.' The standard spending assessments used by the government to distribute grants to local authorities were attacked in a report published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The report finds there is no such thing as an objectively 'fair' spending assessment, and that the level of overspending by English local authorities in relation to their assessments is almost unchanged from the overspend when the system was introduced in 1985-86.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Technology: Taming an unfriendly beast - Printers are becoming easier to use Ease of use has become the slogan of the personal computer industry. Whether this means pictorial representations of commands on the computer screen, or handwriting recognition that enables control of the computer with a pen, PC hardware and software companies are sparing no effort to make their products more 'user friendly'. That is, until these same users try to move their work from the personal computer screen to the computer printer. For years, printers have been the bane of many PC users' working lives. With compatibility problems, multitudes of settings and a lack of standardisation, the printer remains the most complex and frustrating aspect of personal computing. For those users who have the misfortune to share a laser printer over a computer network, the task is even more daunting - with the prospect of an unfriendly printer holding up the productivity of whole groups of people, rather than just one frustrated individual. It appears that the makers of laser printers have finally taken this problem to heart. Industry leader Hewlett-Packard is expected to release a new range of faster and easier-to-use 'network' printers this month, while PC maker Compaq Computer threw its hat into the ring with a similar range of products a month ago. HP declined to comment on its forthcoming product announcements, but the new HP LaserJets will feature automatic language and interface switching for mixed computing environments. This means that in an office which uses Apple Macintosh and IBM-compatible PC systems, for example, one user can print to the new LaserJet from a Macintosh at the same time that someone else in the office prints out documents from an IBM-compatible PC. The printer will automatically sort out the queueing of the documents, switching between page control languages and interfaces. For users with networks, there will be cost and performance benefits. HP's 'JetDirect' interface will allow the new LaserJet systems to be installed directly as devices on the network - and therefore will not require a PC to act as a 'print server' to the network printer. It also means that data will be transferred at network connection speeds - much higher than those that can be achieved over a standard parallel or serial port. Thus, although the new LaserJet models print at only eight pages per minute, their ability to take data from the PC to the printer at network speeds will improve response times and overall performance. HP's latest LaserJets will print at resolutions of up to 600 dots per inch, double the existing 300 dots per inch standard, and will use smaller 'toner' particles so that the resolution may look even higher. HP is expected to price its new printers aggressively, at between Dollars 2,000 and Dollars 3,000. The new LaserJets represent Hewlett Packard's fourth generation of laser printers since 1985 when the company launched the original LaserJet printer, the single most successful product in the history of the company. Ever since, points out John Young, HP president and chief executive, the company has maintained its dominant share of the market. Over the same period, he notes that IBM has seen its share of the PC market dwindle in the face of competition from 'clone' builders. Now Compaq, which led the battle to steal market share from IBM in the PC market in the mid-1980s, is after a piece of HP's laser printer market. This is the first significant new challenge to HP's dominance of the market in several years. Compaq's announcement that it is moving into the network laser printer market appears to have been a long-studied choice. The PC maker dallied with the idea for several years before unveiling its first laser printers a month ago. Rather than taking on HP in the highest volume part of the laser printer business, Compaq is aiming at the high-performance sector with printers that produce 15 and 20 pages per minute. The company cites reams of market statistics to support its decision. In Europe sales of 12 to 19 page-a-minute laser printers grew 72 per cent to Dollars 340m last year, and are expected to continue growing at an annual rate of 31 per cent for the next five years, according BIS Strategic Decisions. In the US, this segment of the market exploded during 1991, with revenue increasing almost fourfold to Dollars 879m, according to the market researchers. Compaq also sites studies conducted by the UK-based Romtec market research organisation showing that for every three PCs sold, two printers are sold to go along with them. According to David Clarke, Compaq marketing director, printers are the second-largest revenue stream for PC dealers after PCs themselves - and that dealers retain higher profit margins on printers than on PCs. He argues that network laser printers have the highest possible margin and offer the ability to sell all kinds of value-added services that do not exist in the sale of a low-end system to a single user. But Compaq faces an uphill climb. HP has a strong hold on the market, while Canon and Apple Computer also represent formidable competitors. Ironically, Compaq's entry into the laser printer market comes just as HP is renewing its efforts to become a big player in the market for personal computers. According to at least one US market report, HP is now winning PC sales to customers who are tired of waiting for shipments of Compaq PCs that have been delayed by component shortages.</p>

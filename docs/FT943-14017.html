			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sanyo Electric ahead despite 'difficult' market Sanyo Electric, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, reported higher sales and profits for the half-year to the end of May, but warned that the domestic environment remained difficult. The parent company reported pre-tax profits higher by 213 per cent at Y6.8bn (Dollars 66m) on turnover up by 0.6 per cent at Y503.9bn. However, Sanyo said weak demand for domestic capital investment, sluggish personal consumption growth, and the sharp appreciation of the yen had combined to make trading conditions difficult. The company has reported an operating loss for the past two years, and in the first six months of the year, the operating figure was again in the red at Y5.8bn, against last year's Y12.6bn. Profits on stock sales of Y9.3bn accounted for the profits at the pre-tax level. Domestic turnover was higher by 2.6 per cent at Y342.8bn due largely to strong sales of semiconductors, colour televisions and commercial refrigerator display cases. Exports fell by 3.4 per cent to Y161.1bn as the company shifted production overseas. The growing strength of the US and south-east Asian economies helped bolster exports, but European markets remained stagnant. Group pre-tax profits rose by 195 per cent to Y7.8bn on turnover up 4.8 per cent at Y767.5bn. After tax, the group reported a profit of Y1.4bn, compared with a loss of Y2.7bn in the same period last year.</p>

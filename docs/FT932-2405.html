			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CBoT aims to boost its international appeal MR PATRICK Arbor, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade said late on Wednesday that the exchange would develop more commodity products with international appeal and proceed with a Dollars 9.3m project to upgrade its financial futures trading floor. Citing the need to expand the market for the CBoT's agricultural products, Mr Arbor praised the exchange's decision to open its cereals and soya products an hour earlier, beginning July 6. The Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade will also adopt the 8.30 am CDT opening, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange this week said it would shift its livestock futures openings to 8.25 am. 'This exchange has at times been criticised as being stodgy, reluctant to change,' Mr Arbor told members in a mid-term address. 'However, the members of this exchange have proven the critics wrong by voting for an earlier ag(ricultural futures) opening. And I intend for us to prove the critics wrong again by redesigning our ag contracts to better meet the needs of customers the world over.' Being more specific, the chairman said the CBoT would launch its international edible oils index contract in the first quarter of 1994, and that contracts on soyabeans and canola (oilseed rape) with Rotterdam delivery are under development. The exchange is also planning to dust off and revise a futures contract on plywood, in a bid to capitalise on volatility in US wood prices. Noting that 81 per cent of the exchange's volume was now comprised of financial futures and options, Mr Arbor encouraged all the exchange's members to support the Dollars 9.3m interim plan to upgrade the financial futures trading floor. CBoT members who trade agricultural products have their own trading floor and some have resisted expenditures to renovate the financials floor. The upgrade will relieve trading congestion until the exchange can construct a badly-needed new trading facility. Mr Arbor said he would present members with a plan for a new building in four to six weeks. Noting that the CBoT's share of world futures markets had dropped to 20.6 per cent from 21.5 per cent last year, he said the new building was necessary to keep the exchange competitive. 'If we don't build a new trading facility, we will remain the world's oldest futures exchange, but we might not remain the largest,' he said.</p>

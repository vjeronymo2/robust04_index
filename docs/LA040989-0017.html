			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> .. . CLOSING QUOTES  </P> <P> On the agreement by Texas Air to sell strikebound Eastern Airlines to a group  headed by former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth:  </P> <P> "This is a new concept in aviation, in which over 60% of the company will be  owned by people who work for this company. We think that is what it needs to  bring Eastern to where it was and to move forward. The very best service you  can get is if someone owns the business."  </P> <P>  -- Peter V. Ueberroth  </P> <P> "I regard this as a giant step forward for capitalism. I regard this as a  strike over the type of capitalism we would have in the 1990s in this country.  (Texas Air Chairman Frank) Lorenzo had come to epitomize an approach to  managing resources that drove away confidence and alienated the work force."  </P> <P>  -- Arthur Shostak, a labor relations expert at Drexel University in  Philadelphia  </P></p>

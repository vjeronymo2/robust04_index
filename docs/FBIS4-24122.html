			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The new UDF [United Democratic Front] government in  Malawi is already beginning to delve into the dealings of  ex-President Banda, who was defeated in the multiparty elections  last month. As always, when leaders fall, it is amazing what  scandals their successors can find to discredit them with. From  Blantyre, Willy Zingani telexed this report:    The rope is getting tighter and tighter around Dr. Banda's  neck. The new UDF government is trying to discover whether the  ex-president abused his position to enrich himself. One thing  they claim to have discovered is that Dr. Banda received rent  from 11 state houses which didn't belong to him. The new  minister of information and broadcasting, Brown Mpinganjira,  says he has documents proving that 2.5 million pounds was paid  in recent years to Dr. Banda as rent for houses belonging to the  state.    The new state president, Bakili Muluzi, hasn't commented on  the matter. It is, therefore, not known whether Dr. Banda will  be asked to pay back the money or be taken to court to answer  charges. Since Dr. Banda's defeat in 17th May general election,  Malawians have been shocked by the news that he had spent 8  million pounds on a new state house in the Malawi capital,  Lilongwe. Earlier this week, for the first time, journalists  were allowed to enter the palaces to see how Dr. Banda lived.  In one room, there were six telephone lines, and all rooms,  including the garage, were air conditioned.</p>

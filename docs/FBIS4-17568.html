			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Adolfas Slezevicius, Lithuanian prime </F> minister and LDDP chairman, by LDDP Deputy Chairman Gediminas  Kirkilas; place and date not given: "We Will Continue To Seek  Stability"]    [Text] [Kirkilas] Mr. Chairman, tomorrow marks the first  anniversary of your election as the new leader of the Lithuanian  Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] at its third congress.    Assuming this double responsibility, you, as well as the  LDDP, legalized a norm which is new to Lithuania's political  life, but which is traditional in Western democratic systems,  when leaders of a party that has the majority in the legislature  also become heads of the Cabinet of Ministers.    [Slezevicius] If this tradition takes root in our country,  the voters will know in the next elections who will be prime  minister if one party or another wins the ballot.    [Kirkilas] Currently, the Social Democrats are trying to  collect signatures from Seimas [parliament] deputies so as to  announce an interpellation to your government. According to  Western standards, this would mean that A. Sakalas, leader of  the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, claims... the office of  prime minister. However, I would like to ask you about something  else. In your opinion, why is a no-confidence vote, which --  this is clear -- has no perspective, initiated now when the  first shoots of stability are emerging in the country, albeit  with difficulty?    [Slezevicius] Maybe, because of this particular fact. I  would not like to believe, however, that Lithuania's Social  Democrats could be for destabilization. They may be trying to  correct in a peculiar way the mistake they made after the  elections -- their refusal to form a governing coalition with  the LDDP.    [Kirkilas] Why did that happen? Did they want to attract  attention to themselves or prevent the LDDP from joining the  Socialist International?    [Slezevicius] Both the Social Democrats and other parties  are  misled by the thought that the LDDP will fail to form a cabinet  by itself, and that it will collapse shortly in this difficult  and critical situation when hyperinflation is flourishing,  prices are rising, and living standards are declining, to say  nothing of the crime rate. Why should they go with those who  will fall soon? Therefore, they have chosen the position of  hesitation, observation, and criticism.    [Kirkilas] After it became clear that these tactics are  fruitless, they have undertaken more radical moves -- to declare  an interpellation to the government, that is, to enhance the  post- election mistake. Might the Social Democrats' criticism  be partially correct?    [Slezevicius] Of course. We ourselves see certain faults.    The government is open to all political forces. As the  government and party leader, I am ready to consult with other  parties and adopt their proposals. This does not require the  moves that discredit Lithuania's stability.    The Social Democrats' actions are quite controversial: They  are proposing a coalition alongside a no-confidence motion in  the government. They immediately put forward additional  conditions -- other parties must also participate in this  coalition....    [Kirkilas] A broader coalition is hardly possible in  Lithuania today. Moreover, the right-wing parties do not voice  such a desire. However, I believe that it is necessary to  discuss and consult on these issues.    Let us go back to the LDDP. You have toured more than 30  Lithuanian regions and towns over the year. What are your  impressions?    [Slezevicius] There have really been quite a few meetings.  They were extremely useful: I saw how people react to and  assess government actions. I understood better which governing  methods are more effective and what problems are the most  pressing.    I see that society is changing: Aggressiveness and anger are  fading. There is a more constructive and businesslike approach.  Most of the questions (about 60-70 percent) concerned the return  of property and loans. Particularly many mistakes were made in  agriculture. They are also the most difficult to correct.    LDDP members are very active everywhere. They are often more  critical than their political opponents. However, they are  benevolent.    [Kirkilas] Could you now say that both positions -- the  leader of the government and the party -- compliment or impede  each other?    [Slezevicius] I can say with confidence that this not easy.  One thing is obvious that the government leader, who is  constantly accountable to the party and the political force that  has nominated him, will always be more determined in making his  decisions and will understand problems much better. All of  Lithuania's former prime ministers were not delegated to the  government by definite parties. This may have partially  determined their failures.    A party represents support not only during elections, but  particularly after them, when one must implement the promised  program.    [Kirkilas] What are your immediate plans as party leader?    [Slezevicius] We will continue to seek stability -- in the  economy, politics, social life, and relations with our neighbors.    Although our opponents do not notice any positive changes,  the latter do exist nonetheless. Not only we ourselves, but  also independent experts and specialists from the World Bank and  the IMF speak about them. One has the impression that it is  this fact that causes our political opponents' greatest concern.  Therefore, their criticism resembles more an election campaign  than a constructive opposition.    Our party has begun to prepare for the self-government  elections. It is very important that Lithuanian people choose  those who will be capable of dealing with the problems in their  region, town, or village, and of resolving them in a competent  manner rather than engaging in politics.    The LDDP leadership, Presidium, and Seimas faction have  recently discussed and projected decision lines in social,  health, cultural, educational, and other spheres. We will  return to legal, national security, and other problems in the  immediate future.    [Kirkilas] I wish the following year was successful for you  as LDDP leader.</p>

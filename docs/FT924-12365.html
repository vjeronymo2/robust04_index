			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Management: Power behind global throne Black's senior management team combines old friends and carefully-picked outside managers. Several are self-made men who have not had Black's privileged upbringing, but share his right-of-centre political views. Larry Perrotto still runs American Publishing's 217 papers from the small, coal-mining town of West Frankfort, Illinois. Perrotto, reputed to be among the wealthiest men in the area, moved there from Pennsylvania in the late 1960s when he and three partners bought the local newspaper. Hollinger bought them out in 1986. Besides Perrotto, two of his original partners also remain on AP's payroll. Most noteworthy among those who have remained at Black's side are David Radler and Peter White, the friends who joined him in buying the Sherbrooke Record in Quebec in 1969. Black, Radler and White between them now own almost all the shares of Ravelston Corp, Hollinger's holding company. The remaining Ravelston stock is held by the estate of Black's father, and by Dixon Chant, an old family friend whom others describe as Conrad's 'father-confessor'. By all accounts, no one in Hollinger has a greater influence on Black than Radler, who carries the title of president. From cramped offices in an inconspicuous, two-storey building on the fringes of downtown Vancouver, Radler directs all Hollinger's north American operations, as well as the Jerusalem Post. The two men are cut from different cloth - perhaps one reason, Radler observes, why they get on so well. Radler, aged 50, is a scrappy, no-nonsense manager with his eye firmly on the bottom line. He is as likely to wear a sports jacket as a suit to the office. An autographed picture in Hollinger's Vancouver offices of Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, is one of the few concessions he makes to the world of international politics and business diplomacy in which his partner revels. Radler says that his background in small-town newspapers has taught him 'how to do without'. He says that 'all I want to see is efficiency. If I can see that an operation can be run by two people, and we have six, I want it run by two.' Radler's blunt manner and his emphasis on cost-cutting have not endeared him to senior management at the Telegraph. While he still sits on the Telegraph board, most of Radler's time is taken up with north America and the Jerusalem Post; had Hollinger got the New York Daily News, Black and Radler planned to run it together. Black's other partner in Ravelston, Peter White, devotes much of his time to outside interests, from skiing to politics, and has little day-to-day influence in Hollinger. But White, aged 53, still has a desk at the company's elegant offices in Toronto. He says he is using his fluency in Spanish to scout for newspaper acquisitions in Latin America. Another long-time ally, Dan Colson, aged 45, has become Black's troubleshooter outside north America. Colson, who met Black at university, is a partner in the London office of the Canadian law firm Stikeman Elliot. But as chairman of Fairfax, he spends almost all his time on Hollinger business.</p>

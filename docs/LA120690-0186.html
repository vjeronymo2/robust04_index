			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILSON FINDS DILEMMAS IN SENATE CHOICE;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN 1992 AND A LITMUS TEST SET BY THE  GOVERNOR-ELECT ARE SEEN AS FACTORS LIMITING HIS OPTIONS.  </P> <P> Before a glittering audience of financial backers, Gov.-elect Pete Wilson cut  quickly to the much-debated subject of his replacement as U.S. senator.  </P> <P> "There are probably a thousand people who can serve admirably," he told  Republicans in Beverly Hills on Tuesday night. "But there are not too many who  are eager or ready or able to undertake what is actually going to be involved,  which is doing the job at the same time that you are running to keep it."  </P> <P> One month after he won the governorship and the right to pick his own Senate  successor, Wilson is sifting through the names of candidates and said he plans  to announce his selection in two to three weeks. Rumors are flying fast and  furiously, but Wilson has limited discussion to a coterie of tight-lipped  advisers.  </P> <P> Some Republicans, however, are finding it hard to come up with a list from  which Wilson can pick, given the parameters the governor-elect has set. The  dilemma, they say, once again points to the party's weakness in statewide  races.  </P> <P> "We don't have the kind of bench that I think we need," said Steven A.  Merksamer, longtime party activist and former chief aide to departing Gov.  George Deukmejian. "I'm not sure it's going to be easy for Pete to find someone  who reflects his views entirely."  </P> <P> While there is some disagreement about that, other Republicans concur that the  party is facing the same problem it confronted two years ago, when Gov. George  Deukmejian announced he would not run for a third term. The solution then,  after much hand-wringing, was the emergence of Wilson, who ran in an all but  uncontested GOP primary.  </P> <P> The limited options faced by Wilson derive from two colliding circumstances --  the need to run an almost constant transcontinental campaign for the seat and  the litmus tests set by Wilson himself.  </P> <P> Wilson's appointee will have to stand for election in 1992 -- right around the  corner in the political lexicon. The appointee also will face election in 1994,  when the seat was to come up if Wilson had kept it. In short, the appointee  would have to run twice in four years, at an estimated cost of $10 million to  $15 million each time, while building a defendable record as a freshman  senator.  </P> <P> "Being an effective brand-new senator is an extremely difficult job," said  former congressman Ed Zschau, who challenged Sen. Alan Cranston in the 1986  Senate race. "On top of that, in your spare time, you have to run statewide in  California, an extraordinarily difficult job. You're put in a position of doing  two different jobs from a standing start."  </P> <P> Complicating matters is Cranston's announcement last month that he would not  seek reelection, leaving his seat open in 1992 as well. That seat has proved  much more alluring to many candidates because the winner would not have to run  again for six years.  </P> <P> "People want to go for the six-year seat," said state Republican Party Chairman  Frank Visco.  </P> <P> Making the pick more troublesome are the ground rules Wilson set for his  successor -- an ideological moderate, an advocate of abortion rights and the  death penalty and someone who can hold on to the seat for the Republicans.  </P> <P> The position on abortion rights, in particular, may be hard to fulfill. Many of  the party's potential candidates -- for example, U.S. Rep. David Dreier of  Covina -- have a more restrictive view of abortion rights than Wilson. The  governor-elect opposes federal funding for abortions but favors a woman's right  to choose an abortion.  </P> <P> State Sen. Rebecca Q. Morgan of Los Altos Hills, who has withdrawn from  contention for the Senate seat, said that in a recent telephone conversation  Wilson seemed intent on keeping his pledge to appoint someone who shares his  moderate views on abortion rights. He also pressed the point of electability,  she said.  </P> <P> But others say Wilson may have to trade off some of his pledges to satisfy  others.  </P> <P> "He may well have to make some modifications," said one senior Republican  campaign activist. "This isn't like the 'Dating Game' where . . . the potential  field is millions of people."  </P> <P> Wilson and his advisers have refused to release a formal list of names under  consideration. But among the field of presumed candidates, both Morgan and  Zschau have asked that they not be considered, and others have spread the word  that they are not particularly interested in an appointment.  </P> <P> Intimates of U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills, said to be among those  being considered by Wilson, have spread the word that she would like to stay  with the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> U.S. Rep. Jerry Lewis of Redlands is close to Wilson, but this week he won a  hard-fought race for the third-highest leadership post among House Republicans.  Those familiar with his thinking have said Lewis would prefer to remain in  Congress, where he is among those in line to replace House Minority Leader  Robert H. Michel of Illinois.  </P> <P> "He doesn't have my resume," Lewis said of Wilson earlier this week. Lewis  would not specifically rule out interest in a Senate bid. Republicans and other  political analysts suggest Wilson has three general options:  </P> <P> * He could pick an elected official, who would have a leg up on creating a  fund-raising base and the political acumen required in the job. A concern is  that few Republicans have shown an ability to win statewide; most state offices  are held by Democrats.  </P> <P> Some Republicans suggest that Wilson could chose from those who ran  well-considered, if unsuccessful races -- for example, Los Angeles City  Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who lost to incumbent Secretary of State March  Fong Eu in November.  </P> <P> Flores said this week that she has not been contacted by Wilson. "Unless it  were offered, I probably wouldn't even think about it," Flores said. "If it  were offered, I'd weigh the pros and cons."  </P> <P> * Another alternative is someone in the public policy arena familiar with the  requirements of politics but not an officeholder. Hills' name is most often  mentioned in this category, along with that of Condoleezza Rice, director of  Soviet and East European affairs on the Bush Administration's National Security  Council.  </P> <P> Morgan said she talked to Wilson about Rice, a black woman who before her NSC  appointment taught at Stanford University.  </P> <P> But Rice passed up an opportunity to run for Congress in 1986. Some Republicans  are wary of placing someone who has never run for office in the position of  running what amounts to a transcontinental, four-year marathon.  </P> <P> "It's a huge hurdle," said a Republican campaign activist. "This person faces  four years of campaigning and fund raising. Until you've done it, I don't think  people know the toll of energy and particularly cross-country travel."  </P> <P> * Others, however, suggest that a policy expert -- or someone outside the  political world entirely -- could win points for being a fresh face in an era  where incumbency does not always play well with voters. Some Republicans cite  Peter Ueberroth, president of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee  and a registered Republican, as an example of a political outsider.  </P> <P> "You don't have to carry all those rocks in the bag," said Zschau, who in his  race with Cranston was battered over votes he cast in Congress. "The longer  you're in office, the more record is there to attack."  </P> <P> No matter who is appointed, Republicans already are worrying whether intraparty  warfare will break out in the 1992 primary and help hand the seat back to the  Democrats.  </P> <P> Several Republicans, in comments about the Senate appointment, suggested a  comparison between the fate of Wilson's choice and that of Thomas Hayes, the  appointed incumbent state treasurer who was defeated by Democrat Kathleen Brown  in November. Many Republicans blame his loss on a contested primary in which  Hayes was forced to spend $1 million to defeat fellow Republican Angela  Buchanan.  </P> <P> At his $1,000-a-plate Tuesday night fund-raiser, Wilson pressured his backers  to support his ultimate selection.  </P> <P> "My friends, when you are relieved of the responsibility for supporting my  efforts, please pick up the cudgels for those who will follow," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Clarke's conundrum The abolition of purdah has not made it easy to discern what Mr Kenneth Clarke actually plans for his Budget in November. Yesterday's conference speech, with its emphasis on spending restraint, looked more a rallying call than anything else. Mr Clarke has already said there is no room for cutting spending below the totals already proposed. But he was hardly gushing in his enthusiasm for higher taxes either. The suspicion remains that tightening in November will be kept to a minimum. With financial markets in their present mood this may not matter much in the short run, especially since the recovery appears strong enough to reduce the PSBR below the Treasury's forecast of Pounds 50bn. One risk is that this could delude Mr Clarke into thinking there is no need for much action in November. He could then find himself having to address the structural part of the deficit much closer to the next election. Another risk is that over-hasty tax increases would reduce the pressure for more desirable spending cuts. But some perks like mortgage interest relief and universal child benefit look ripe for reconsideration. Offsetting such change with lower interest rates could make the recovery more sustainable. Since the full benefit of rate cuts would not be passed on to mortgage borrowers, growth would be less dependent on consumers. Investment and, assuming a modest decline in sterling, exports would be stimulated instead. And Mr Clarke did say at the outset that he wanted to be a pro-business chancellor.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Wet, wet, wet: Jancis Robinson visits Burgundy where heavy rains have badly affected the wine harvest The vineyards are a mire around Meursault in Burgundy. At lunchtime, low-paid pickers stomp into the village, clad in mud-spattered oilskins and rubber gloves. The village streets throb with tractors pulling loads of sodden grapes, all too often tinged brown with rot and covered with tarpaulins in an attempt to keep at least the last hour's drizzle from diluting the juice, and therefore the wine. On backstreets, medieval courtyards are filled with the sound of heavy duty hoses, desperately trying to keep the wine presses, trailers and hods clean. The mood is sombre. The French wine industry badly needs a top quality wine harvest. Wine consumption in France has been plummeting, and French wine exports have fallen nearly 20 per cent in the past five years. International rivals have been increasing their market share and undercutting French vineyards on prices - Chile, Argentina and South Africa are proving particularly fierce competitors, according to a recent report on the wine industry by Insee, the French national statistical office. Together with the recession, these problems have pushed French winegrowers' prices steadily down since 1991, says the institute, with high quality vins d'appellation and champagnes the worst affected. There has been some improvement this year, says a researcher at Insee: 'There is a strengthening of demand from French consumers, and a more marked improvement in some international markets,' he says. 'But there is still a long way to go to get back to the levels of a few years ago.' Above all, France does not need another year of declining production. Total production fell by 19 per cent in 1993, thanks, largely, to bad weather. 'The harvest was greatly affected by rain,' says Insee. This year, Burgundy, like the rest of France, enjoyed an unusually hot summer. At the end of August the grapes were riper and healthier than usual. It seemed as though this could be just the vintage France needed, but farmers such as these know better than to bank on the weather. In the first week of September the rain set in, and continued almost daily to make this the most miserable vintage since 1984 according to optimists - and since 1947 according to pessimists. At present, the quality of the eventual wines can only be guessed at. There will probably be some good white wines, for rot is by no means disastrous for white grapes and the acidity levels will please those who like their white wines sharp. The best sites and best kept vineyards, such as Dominique Lafon's Meursault-Perrieres, can boast tiny relatively healthy grapes which should yield modest amounts of concentrated wine. It is the red grapes which will take the strain of all this rain, particularly where yields are high. Rot destroys pigment; and the skins  - so necessary to red wine making - can taint the final wine. This will be one of those (many) vintages about which the wine trade will be able to boast 'the strictest selection is necessary; buy only from a reputable merchant such as ourselves'. Those who are already practising 'organic' and even 'biodynamic' chemical-free vine-growing techniques are boasting of markedly healthier grapes than their neighbours in such damp conditions. One prominent example is Lalou Biz-Leroy, 'the queen of Burgundy', whose vineyards this year were treated not only to ground nettles applied according to phases of the moon but also to various tisanes applied from a helicopter. Her traditional wooden open-topped (computer-controlled) fermentation vats are full of healthy, small bunches of Pinot Noir grapes which will doubtless become yet another vintage of Domaine Leroy bottles for the world's collectors to argue over. This is little comfort to a bedraggled stream of tourists, cycling through the vineyards on pre-arranged routes from one three-star hotel to another. Small groups were last week wheeling disconsolately around the village of Meursault, mystified that in the frenzy, and gloom, of the picking season, no one could find the time to sell them a bottle or two of world famous Burgundy. But while the tourists trudging around France's wine region in the rain, or loitering longer than they would choose in their hotel rooms, may have been miserable, this has only been a damp holiday. For the vignerons the loss will be in their income, and, in some cases, their reputations.</p>

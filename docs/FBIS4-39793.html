			<p>BFN     The former USSR countries and the East European states --  Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary -- should  unite economically with the aim of protecting their markets.  Ukraine's Deputy Premier Valentyn Landyk said this in an  interview for the mass media. He pointed out that the West  European markets are not waiting for Ukrainian products, but at  the same time everything possible is being done by Western firms  to conquer the CIS markets. In the opinion of Valentyn Landyk,  Ukraine's export potential today is not as high as one would  like it to be -- mainly raw materials are offered for export.  Our state can sell its industrial products to Russia and other  Commonwealth countries.    The Ukrainian deputy prime minister emphasized that our  state's accession to the CIS Economic Union with the rights of  an associate member is an important move. An associate member  is even in a better situation as it has more freedom and elbow  room, underlined Valentyn Landyk.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television The 88 competitors in the Leeds International Piano Competition have been whittled down to six; today and tomorrow each will play a concerto with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Simon Rattle. BBC2 is covering the event starting at 6.55 today, continuing until at least 9.30. Later BBC2 begins another run of KYTV, the comedy about a naff satellite TV station which, like so many things these days, includes Angus Deayton in a leading role (10.00). Then, at 11.15, still on BBC2, an event which may prove to be an inspired idea but which looks pretty odd to me: the first in a series of compilations from That Was The Week That Was. It is one thing to watch extracts from TW3 during a day of 1960s nostalgia, but are there really more than a few vintage TV freaks who want to watch regular re-runs of programmes 31 years old? We shall see. Almost everybody seems to have said that the lines in the carefully scripted programmes of Paul Merton - The Series are not as funny as his unscripted lines in 'Have I Got News For You' (10.30 C4). They are right.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Have a Nice Day, Mr Adams"] </F>   [Text] The British Government was foolish to object to the  Americans granting a visa to Gerry Adams. In the first place,  it was unrealistic. Anyone in Washington could have told  Downing Street that if Bill Clinton were forced to choose  between pleasing the British or winning congressional support  for his health care reforms, he would not hesitate for a second.  The tattered remains of the special relationship had no chance  against congressional pressure for the visa. Britain would,  therefore, have been wiser to accept the inevitable instead of  inviting a public rebuff.    Better still, it could have positively encouraged Mr Adams's  trip to New York. Among the incentives he is being offered for  winning IRA endorsement of the Anglo-Irish declaration is the  prospect of entering mainstream politics. There is every sign  that this attracts him. New York will give him a taste of what  is on offer if he can earn respectability.    It is also possible that he will benefit from contact with  responsible Irish-Americans, most of whom have endorsed the  declaration. The Ancient Order of Hibernians in the U.S. sent a  strong message of support to both governments in December, and  Senator Edward Kennedy's sister, who is the American ambassador  to Dublin, will certainly have reported home in detail on the  Irish Government's attitude. American opinion should therefore  be well in touch with reality, and not likely to mistake Mr  Adams for the voice of all Ireland.    The only strong reason for denying him a visa would have  been  fear that he would spend his time whipping up support and funds  for the IRA. Not only is he forbidden to do this under the  terms of his visa, but he also has no good reason for attempting  it. He still wishes to be seen by the British Government as  doing his best for peace, and in the US he can only gain from  appearing statesmanlike.    It is always a problem when dealing with terrorist  organisations and their supporters to know when to allow them  out of isolation. The main test is a pragmatic one: will doing  so enhance the chances of peace? In the case of Mr Adams, the  British Government has already decided to accept him as an  interlocutor on the understanding that his value depends on how  much he delivers.    While awaiting the answer, there is every reason for  encouraging him with graduated concessions such as the New York  trip. He will be under no illusions that if he fails to deliver  he will be quickly back in the political ghetto. In the  meantime, he will have a chance to clarify his position and show  how he conducts himself on a wider stage.</p>

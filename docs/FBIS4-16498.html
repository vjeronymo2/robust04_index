			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chairman of the Belarusian Parliament Mechyslaw  Hryb shows no enthusiasm on plans to amend the national  constitution in a bid to realize the 12 April agreement on the  merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems.    In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX Hryb said it was  impossible to amend the fundamental law on the first day after  its introduction, if it cost the national legislature more than  two years of hard work to phrase it. On 15 April Hryb and Prime  Minister Vyacheslav Kebich met in Moscow with Russian head of  government Viktor Chernomyrdin. They agreed, said Hryb, that  Article 5 of the merger agreement would be amended in keeping  with the Belarusian Constitution.    Under Article 5, the assets and liabilities of the National  Bank of Belarus make part of the assets and liabilities of the  Central Bank of Russia. That lays a groundwork for the merger  of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. On 12 April,  Stanislav Bogdankevich of the Belarusian Bank agreed to sign the  merger agreement only if the objections in principle against  Article 5 were taken into consideration. He said that under  Belarus' new constitution the National Bank emerged as the  central bank of a sovereign country.    Hryb also opposed Kebich's proposal for a nationwide  referendum on the merger of thee Russian and Belarusian monetary  systems. In Hryb's view, a referendum would confuse the  Belarusians. The decision to call a referendum rested  exclusively with the Belarusian parliament.    Hryb made it clear that his objections were not intended to  spark a conflict between himself and Kebich, let alone a  conflict between the Legislative and Executive Branches of  power. What he said should not be seen in the context of a new  electoral campaign.</p>

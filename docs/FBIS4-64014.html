			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Viktor Dmitriyev and </F> Aleksandr Trushin]    [Text] Buenos Aires May 27 TASS -- A delegation of the  Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament,  led by council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko left the Argentine  capital for Brazil on Thursday in a tour of a number of Latin  American countries.    While in Argentina on an official visit, Shumeyko met with  President Carlos Menem and Guido di Tella, minister of foreign  affairs and religion, and had meetings with Argentine Parliament  leaders and representatives of the business community.    Russia and President Yeltsin can fully count on Argentina in  the realisation of political and economic reforms, Argentine  President Carlos Menem said here on Thursday during a meeting  with Shumeyko.    Mr. Menem expressed gratitude for the invitation, which  President Yeltsin extended to him earlier, to visit Russia and  confirmed that he would pay a visit to Moscow in October this  year.    At Shumeyko's request, President Menem described Argentina's  experience in carrying out a radical economic reform and,  specifically, in achieving financial and economic stabilisation,  curbing inflation and privatising state property on a large  scale.    As a result of the meeting with Carlos Menem, it turned out  that the Argentine people had thought it would take a decade to  carry out privatisation. However, five years elapsed, and  privatisation is already being completed. Argentine experience  in privatising railways and merchant marine is of special  interest to Russia which does not yet venture to privatise these  branches of the economy, Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS.    During Shumeyko's meeting with Guido di Tella, Argentine  minister of foreign affairs and religion, it was emphasised that  President Menem's forthcoming visit to Moscow would become an  important landmark in the history of relations between Argentina  and Russia. The minister said the visit would serve as a signal  to Argentine businessmen that the president devotes much  attention to Russia.    Guido di Tella highly appreciated the results of his recent  visit to the Russian Federation, stating that after the visit he  became "the most active populariser of Russia" in Argentina.    The Russian parliamentary delegation was received in the  national congress of Argentina on Thursday.    In response to a question about the first results of the  patliamentary delegation's tour of Latin American countries,  Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS that the delegation members feel that  people both in Chile and Argentina take genuine interest in the  developments in Russia.    "Direct contacts with Latin Americans convinced us that they  want to gain an understanding of the complex processes taking  place in our country," Shumeyko pointed out. "contacts in  Argentina, primarily those with the business community, give  ground to believe that there are good prospects for fruitful  mutually beneficial cooperation between Argentina and Russia,"  he said.    "We are young politicians. The future belongs to us.  Therefore, we shall never agree to the old notions about the  division of the world into blocs and to the existence of the  very term a "third world." We look for new partners, seeking  benefit for Russia. In this sense, Latin America is of great  interest to us," Shumeyko said.</p>

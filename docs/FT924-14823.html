			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Wide backing forfoes of Canada's new constitution OPPONENTS of Canada's proposed new constitution have opened up a wide lead in several key provinces, less than three weeks before a national referendum on the constitutional package. A Gallup poll published yesterday shows the No side is backed by 53 per cent of decided voters in British Columbia, 51 per cent in the three prairie provinces and 46 per cent in Quebec. Support for the deal in these regions is estimated at between 30 and 36 per cent. Doubts about the outcome of the October 26 referendum have already driven up domestic interest rates and elicited warnings of further economic turbulence. Mr Ted Newall, chief executive of Nova Corporation of Alberta, one of the country's biggest energy and pipeline companies, warned on Tuesday night that a No vote would, at best, mean 5-15 years of economic and political uncertainty. The constitutional package, known as the Charlottetown Agreement, is supported by all three national parties, the leaders of all 10 provinces, and the bulk of Canada's business community. They have been put on the defensive, however, by having to acknowledge that the agreement is a compromise which gives no region or interest group everything it wants. Critics of the deal, the most vociferous of whom include Quebec separatists, western Canadian regional groups and women's activists, have had the advantage of being able to highlight the agreement's weaknesses. Quebec separatists, for instance, have emphasised how few new powers will be transferred to the francophone province under the deal. The Alberta-based Reform Party, on the other hand, has touched a sensitive nerve in western Canada by pointing to a provision which guarantees Quebec a minimum of 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons. In addition, many voters are using the referendum debate to vent a wider range of frustrations with the political process. The Yes side, which was slow to put its campaign into gear, still expects to make up ground over the next few weeks. It is taking some comfort from the high proportion of undecided voters - 22 per cent in Quebec and 17 per cent in British Columbia. The legal text of the Charlottetown Agreement is due to be published next Monday, dealing with complaints that voters have not been able to assess the fine print of the deal. Critics are expected to scour the text in search of new ammunition for their arguments.</p>

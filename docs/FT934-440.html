			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Property: Is there a Dingley Dell left in England? - Gerald Cadogan, in search of an old-fashioned Christmas, has been turning to Pickwick Papers for home-buying inspiration Where do our back-to-basics political leaders find guidance for an old-fashioned Christmas? Not from a Church abandoning its time-hallowed prayer book. Nor from the monarchy, where family values are clouded. But they could turn to Charles Dickens' account of Christmas at Dingley Dell, in Pickwick Papers, the icon of Victorian Christmas. Not that Pickwick is Victorian at all. The first monthly part came out in April 1836, when William IV was king and Dickens only 24, and the last in November 1837 when the 19-year-old Victoria had been queen for just a few months. Nevertheless, Dingley Dell is enshrined as the ideal mid- 19th century Christmas, linked in our imaginations with trees, cards, crackers and presents, which are all post-Pickwick. The Christmas tree reached Britain only when Prince Albert, of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, brought the idea from Germany. Dickens called it 'that pretty German toy' and liked 'its multitude of little tapers'. But a Pickwickian Christmas has to be icy. When Dickens was a boy, the Thames froze and there were frost fairs, and sliding and skating as at Dingley Dell, where Pickwick fell through the ice. At an old-fashioned Christmas there must be hot wassail to drink; games, singing and dancing; mistletoe to kiss under, and a large fire. The highlight of the Christmas Eve party at Dingley Dell is the ghost story of the sexton Gabriel Grub and the goblins. Christmas Day starts with oysters. Church receives a single sentence. 'Mr Benjamin Allen fell fast asleep: while Mr Bob Sawyer abstracted his thoughts from wordly matters by the ingenious process of carving his name on the seat of the pew.' Then a 'substantial lunch' with 'strong beer and cherry brandy' leads to an hour on the ice. Is there a wintry paradise now around which the snow wraps a cocoon of good-heartedness? If it has turned cold, Fryers House in Braughing Friars in Hertfordshire, a traditional, timber-framed house on offer from Mullucks Wells for Pounds 315,000, has a large natural pond that is ideal for skating and is close to the house if anyone should fall in. For tobogganing, try the South Downs in Sussex, if you do not find them too steep. (As a boy, I broke my arm on a sledge in Sussex.) In the middle of the downs at East Dean near Chichester and Midhurst is The Thatched House of brick and knapped flint, which Jackson-Stops is selling for Pounds 265,000. It also has a ghost, who knocks on the front door in the early morning. A hundred years ago two flint knappers lived in the house and took turns to wake each other up at 5am. The ghost has even appeared at the door as a tall man in black cloak and wide hat. In East Sussex Old Rectory Cottage is at the foot of the downs, in Folkington near Eastbourne (Strutt &amp; Parker, Pounds 275,000). And mid-county at Fulking, also by the downs, Nettledown Cottage is the place for a get-away-from-it-all Christmas. Stock up with food and drink, as it is at the end of a long Wenceslas-taxing farm road. Joint agents are Humberts and Fox &amp; Sons, and the price is Pounds 395,000. The Christmas fire at Dingley Dell would fit into the 12ft wide fireplace and bread oven of Abbotsford, 17th century, thatched and full of beams, near Thorverton in the valley of the river Exe north of Exeter. Stags offers it for Pounds 125,000. More expensive is the Northmoor estate in the valley of the river Barle on Exmoor, where large herds of wild red deer suggest Christmas. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in Exeter, is selling it in lots for around Pounds 640,000 in all. A Dickensian-sounding name is one of the attractions of Bleke House, a Regency property on the edge of Shaftesbury in Dorset, with views over Blackmore Vale (Savills, Pounds 245,000). Restoration House near the cathedral in Rochester has real associations with Dickens. It is a large 16th-17th century house with carved ceilings and grand fireplaces, and is listed Grade I. Here Charles II spent his first night in England on returning to take the throne in 1660. Its name became Restoration House. Dickens used it as Satis House in Great Expectations where Miss Havisham lives frozen in time, the cake for her never-to-be wedding overhung with cobwebs and sitting on a yellowed tablecloth. Great Expectations begins at Christmas time, without the cheer of Dickens' earlier Christmasses. The escaped convict, a 'fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg', catches young Pip among the graves at the side of the church porch and frightens him into stealing not only a file from his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, but brandy, mincemeat and a pork pie from Mrs Joe. At the end of the book Satis House is for sale in lots. The house was to be sold, gutted for building materials, and pulled down. Luckily that has not happened. But it needs a lot of money for restoration, 'far more than the usual Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000', says Robin Tillett, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in Tunbridge Wells. The asking price is Pounds 250,000. It has a good-sized garden. Inside it does not look changed from how it appears in Country Life photographs in 1924.

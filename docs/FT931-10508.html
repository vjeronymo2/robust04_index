			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Hong Kong attacks EC on dumping A EUROPEAN Community investigation into alleged dumping by Hong Kong computer disc makers cannot be substantiated, and should be terminated, argues a Hong Kong government study submitted to the EC today. The Hong Kong challenge comes at a time of mounting concern over a 'contagion' of dumping actions, as companies pressed by recession, and lacking protection behind high tariff walls, see anti-dumping laws as powerful weapons against foreign competitors. Recent EC dumping actions against east European steel-makers, and US actions against steel imports and threatened actions against vehicle imports, have raised fears of international trade conflict. The Hong Kong study challenges the dumping complaint, lodged four months ago by the Committee of European Diskette Manufacturers (Diskma), saying the calculations of supposed dumping are flawed; that there is no evidence that European discs makers have been in any way injured by Hong Kong imports; and that Diskma is not representative of European industry, accounting for 38 per cent of EC output. The Diskma complaint was brought by Beltadisk and Computer Support, both from Italy, Boeder of Germany, Rhone-Poulenc of France and Sentinel of Belgium. The Hong Kong report challenges the use of costs in Japan and China to 'construct' the costs of Hong Kong manufacturers. It says that, by using these data but varying the selection, results could show anything from a dumping margin of 86 per cent to overpricing of 30 per cent. It complains that the investigation has had a 'severe harassment effect on trade,' cutting exports which peaked at HKDollars 196m (Dollars 25.5m) in 1991 to about HKDollars 120m last year. In contrast, EC output of diskettes has grown 11-fold, from 6.4m units in 1987 to 74.4m units in 1991.</p>

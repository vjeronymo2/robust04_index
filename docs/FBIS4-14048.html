			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, at a news conference in Bucharest,  Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati was asked by IDF  Radio correspondent Udi Segal why Iran continues holding  Navigator Ron Arad. The Iranian foreign minister replied: "I  firmly deny that there are Israeli MIA's on Iranian territory."    This was the first time the Iranian foreign minister  publicly  answered an Israeli correspondent and reacted to the claim that  Iran is holding Israeli MIA's or POW's. Commenting on  Velayati's remark, an Israeli source said last night that, as  far as Israel is concerned, Iran is responsible for the MIA's  and POW's.    The source said that Velayati's remarks "do not relieve Iran  of its responsibility for the Israeli MIA's and POW's. It may  well be that none are held on Iranian soil, but we hold Iran  responsible for the affair."    According to the Israeli source, Israel continues dealing  with the issue of the MIA's and POW's on all levels, including a  special effort in the international arena, in order to bring the  affair to an end.</p>

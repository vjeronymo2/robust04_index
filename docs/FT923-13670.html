			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Fresh legal hope for creditors ATTEMPTS by four insolvent companies in the London United Investments insurance group to put together schemes of arrangement for the benefit of their creditors have been given a second impetus by the courts. On Thursday, a ruling by the Court of Appeal increased the ability of the Policyholders' Protection Board, whose support is crucial to the schemes, to participate in them. Yesterday a High Court judge held that deposits totalling about Dollars 98m (Pounds 51.7m), held by banks in the names of the four companies, are the absolute property of the companies. Mr Justice Harman said that HS Weavers (Underwriting) Agencies, also a wholly owned subsidiary of LUI, which acted as underwriting agent and managing agent for the companies, had no right to any part of the deposits. Kingscroft Insurance Co, El Paso Insurance Co, Lime Street Insurance Co and Mutual Reinsurance Co, which are in provisional liquidation, have gross liabilities of Dollars 2.5bn and assets of about Dollars 1.7bn. They believe the proposed schemes, which would enable them to run off their business in the normal way and pay a percentage of the claims, would be more beneficial to their creditors than liquidation.</p>

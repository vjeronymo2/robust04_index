			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi, 12 Jun -- "For all friendly states the Day  of Russia's Independence will be a symbol of the new Russia's  democratic aspirations," Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze,  the speaker of the Georgian parliament, has told ITAR-TASS.    In the opinion of the Georgian leader, Russia is celebrating  its Independence Day in new and different circumstances.  Despite the fact that Russia is going through a difficult  period of establishing itself economically and politically, a  new social climate is forming in society.    "It is vital for all world countries that this country,  which  plays the decisive role in whether the post-Soviet region will  become a conflict-free zone, remains stable," he noted. "If one  is to speak about Russia's new role in history, it is the  mission of peacemaker and guarantor of stability."</p>

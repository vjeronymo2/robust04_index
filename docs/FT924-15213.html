			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television The second half of tonight's double-bill of C4's arts programme Without Walls is 'And God Created Tenors', an analysis of the sex appeal of tenors from Caruso and Mario Lanza to Josef Locke, the Irish tenor whose reputation has bloomed again thanks to the gruesomely whimsical film, 'Hear My Song'. Civvies (BBC 1: 9.30), the series about ex-paras maladroitly readjusting to civilian life, has more than an echo of John Macnab about it this week. Can a bracing Highlands location rescue this disappointing drama from a pedestrian script and its pervasive reek of sentimentality? Meanwhile BBC2 tells real tales from the front line in Battle Cries (9.50), part of the current season about warfare. Once there was a scheme to put a garden designed by Marx on top of the Hayward Gallery. Tonight's Omnibus on BBC 1 (10.25) shows what we have missed in 'The Lost Paradise - The Gardens of Roberto Burle Marx', an uncritical presentation of the work of this undeniably important if tiresomely vainglorious Brazilian landscape architect.</p>

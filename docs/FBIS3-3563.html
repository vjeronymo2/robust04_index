			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Correctly Understand Relations Between Reform, </F> Development, and Stability"]    [Text] At present, Sichuan, like various parts of the  country, is experiencing economic development, political  stability, nationality solidarity, and social progress. The  situation is favorable as a whole. To fulfill this year's fixed  target of the whole province establishing the socialist market  economic system, and maintaining sustained, rapid and healthy  development of the national economy, a very important issue  facing us is that we must continue to handle relations between  reform, development and stability well.    Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "We are carrying out  the four modernizations program, reform, and opening up.  Stability is a key factor." There is no doubt that continuing  to maintain stability is a prerequisite for developing the  present favorable situation and guaranteeing the successful  completion of various tasks this year. However, after summing  up our own experiences, and reviewing the situation in various  provinces and cities throughout the country, we realize that to  maintain stability, long-term stability in particular, and to  speed up development is most fundamental and significant. The  present reform has concerned the redistribution of power and  benefits. It is also an issue which concerns vital interests of  people in various circles. To solve these problems well, we  need practical and good policies and methods. Necessary  economic strength is also indispensable. For instance, it is  absolutely necessary to establish a sound social security  system. However, the task can only be eventually accomplished  with the continuous increasing of the economic bearing capacity  of enterprises and individuals. To completely solve the problem  of enterprises running the society, so that fluctuation can be  reduce or avoided in the work of establishing a modern  enterprise system, it is, under most circumstances, necessary to  inject a fairly large amount of funds into the society to enable  reform in production relations to coincide with the development  of productive forces. With regard to the issue of providing an  outlet for the vast rural surplus labor force, furnishing  employment in cities, speeding up economic development,  improving the economy and people's livelihood in areas inhabited  by minority nationalities and impoverished areas, lightening  peasant burdens, and doing work to further lessen and eliminate  factors which might affect stability and unity, necessary  material guarantee is equally indispensable. It is obvious that,  in a certain sense, without development it is impossible to  maintain stability. In the meantime, it should be thoughtfully  noted that the present reform and economic development need a  stable social environment. If the society in not stable, reform  and development can only be an empty talk. Therefore, we must  not use a negative viewpoint of advocating stability for  stability's sake to comprehend stability. We must understand  that as far as Sichuan, a fairly backward big province, is  concerned, its economy must develop faster. It is impossible to  always go about things quietly and steadily. With regard to the  issue of development, we must on no account be overcautious, or  refrain from doing something necessary for fear of a slight  risk. On the contrary, we must emancipate our minds and have  our hands and feet unfettered. In places where conditions  exist, we must do our utmost to promote faster development under  the prerequisite of attaching importance to efficiency and  quality. In the meantime, in the course of development, we must  pay attention to discovering problems and solving them promptly  and properly, so that our economy can advance to a new height as  quickly as possible. To do so, it is beneficial not only to  fulfilling our province's second-step strategic target three  years ahead of time, but also to maintaining long-term stability  of the whole society. Experiences of developed coastal areas  have proved that as long as our economy has been developed, and  that we have more goods on hand, we will have the initiative in  handling various kinds of conflicts and problems. We can thus  maintain stability with assurance.    To speed up development, what is most important is to seize  on fine opportunities, and deepen reforms. The present  international and domestic environment is favorable to us. The  state has put the project of speeding up the development in the  central and western regions and accelerating resource  exploitation in western region on the important agenda. There  are preferential policies for us. Some powerful foreign  businessmen have treated the Sichuan market favorably. There is  good momentum for the development of Sichuan's economy. We must  seize on this favorable opportunity which is hard to come by in  history, and proceed from Sichuan's practical reality to speed  up the pace of reform in accordance with the requirements of  making unified plans, giving an overall impetus, making a major  breakthrough, and pursuing division of labor with individual  responsibility. We must make a big step in establishing and  improving the socialist market economic system to further  emancipate productive forces fettered by the old system, and  further arouse the enthusiasm of millions upon millions of the  masses in socialist modernization and construction. This has  demanded that party and government leaders at all levels  throughout the province must further emancipate their minds, and  inspire their enthusiasm to lead people of the whole province to  unite as one, struggle hard, explore the way forward, and  successfully accomplish tasks set by the central authorities,  and the second session of our Eighth Provincial People's  Congress as well, to make new contributions to Sichuan's  development. If we fail to do so, if we separate stability from  reform and development, or even set them against each other, if  we hesitate, or take a wait-and-see attitude, we are liable to  lose the favorable opportunity, and delay the great cause of  reform and opening up. Social stability will eventually be  affected.    In a word, our comrades must, at all times, never forget  that  "development is the last word." They must never forget that the  aim of deepening reform, expanding opening up, and maintaining  stability is to accelerate development. Only by understanding  and handling dialectical relations between reform, development  and stability in this way can there be a guarantee for our  province's more prosperous economy and more thorough social  stability.</p>

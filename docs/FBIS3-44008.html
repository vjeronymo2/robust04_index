The attackers, operating just hours before the start of a  Togolese legislative election campaign, managed to escape in a  mini- bus before soldiers could return fire, the source said,  adding that no one had been injured in the shooting.    Elections are scheduled for February 6 and 20 and opposition  parties have expressed fears that the poll will not be organised  fairly.    Earlier this month 67 people were killed in fighting that  broke out after an attack on Togolese President Gnassingbe  Eyadema and the barracks where he has his official residence.    The government attributed the January 5 attack to opposition  members in exile in neighbouring Ghana, who it alleged were  being backed by Ghanaian authorities.    Ghanaian leaders have repeatedly denied the allegations and  on Friday Ghana's foreign minister, Obed Asamoah, warned Togo  that his country would retaliate if Lome continued to accuse  Accra of supporting the assassination attempt.    "Any future deliberate and unprovoked aggression on Ghana by  Togo will be met with a commensurate response," Asamoah warned  during a meeting with diplomats and reporters. "There is an  extent to which Ghana can be patient to these attacks by Togo."</p>

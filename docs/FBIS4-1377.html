			<p>BFN     [Text] The Burundian people, especially those residing in  the capital, are concerned about the issue of disarmament. The  government announced that the disarming of the civilian  population was to begin on 25 April. Our colleague, Salvator  Nvuyekure, met the prime minister, who elaborated on this:    [Begin recording] [Nvuyekure] There is no question of  decreasing pressure on the suburbs, where the disarmament  operation currently is being implemented. After the ultimatum  expired on 24 April, military forces for carrying out the  operation were put in place. Since 24 April, efforts have been  made to minimize the damage, so that innocent people are not  victimized. Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko gave assurances  that the operation is continuing, that it has not been halted.  Military pressure continues so that, according to the prime  minister, people gradually will hand over their weapons. The  operation is related to re-establishing peace and security.  There will be no backpedalling.    [Kanyenkiko] Regarding this issue, the operation will  continue as planned. We would like to limit human and material  damage. This justifies the steps taken since 25 April to  establish contact with the people who are involved in this  issue, in order to make it easier to hand over the weapons. We  do not want innocent people to pay the cost if armed groups take  them hostage. If this peaceful method does not succeed, [words  indistinct] arms must be carried out.    [Nvuyekure] Some people say the armed groups and the  security  forces are negotiating.    [Kanyenkiko] There are no negotiations. Between who and who?  There are no negotiations at all. But as I told you, since  25-26 April we have been trying to talk to our representatives  so as to find the best way of getting the weapons without human  or material losses. There are no negotiations. This is just a  method chosen to carry out the operation without losses.    [Nvuyekure] [words indistinct] on the period that you will  have to wait, one week, two weeks.    [Kanyenkiko] You know, the management of a country calls for  some degree of calm. That means that we shall try all possible  means. After that, force will be used to maintain the law. [end  recording]    That should make it clear. There should be no more  speculation or false rumors. The disarmament operation is under  way. In principle, it must continue throughout the entire  territory of the Republic.</p>

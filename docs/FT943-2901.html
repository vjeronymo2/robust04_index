			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Whatman hampered by Cyclopore Whatman, the manufacturer of filtration and purification products, reported a drop in profits for the first six months of 1994, primarily attributable to losses from its recent acquisition, Cyclopore. However, the company expressed its confidence in future profits growth by raising the interim dividend by 9 per cent to 3.6p (3.3p). Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 4.56m to Pounds 4.41m, in spite of an 8 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 33.7m), but this was largely due to the impact of acquisitions. Cyclopore, a Belgian membrane manufacturer acquired in November, lost Pounds 200,000, while German molecular biology company Biometra, acquired for Pounds 3.5m last year, achieved only break-even. The company expected Biometra to produce 'good profits in the second half', as it has a seasonal business pattern. Cyclopore is not expected to make a positive contribution until 1996. Revenues, excluding acquisitions, increased by 4 per cent at constant exchange rates, with increases coming mainly from North America, where operating profit rose from Pounds 2.05m to Pounds 2.69m. The UK International region, mainly continental Europe, suffered from production problems, which have now been overcome, but this resulted in a reduction in operating profit to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 2.66m). The company is currently working on a rationalisation of its North American business in order to reduce its cost base, and this will impact on second half revenues. However, Mr Andrew Smithers, chairman, said: 'We anticipate that improved second-half trading in both North America and the UK International region will allow us to absorb the cost of this reorganisation.' At the half year stage, the company had net borrowings of Pounds 3m, representing gearing of only 6 per cent. It intends to make further acquisitions. Earnings per share fell from 12.91p to 12.36p.</p>

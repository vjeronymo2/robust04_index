			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Cabinet sets up inquiry into public sector building costs The government will this week announce a wide-ranging inquiry into construction ordering by government departments and agencies after a series of Whitehall building scandals. Civil servants in the Cabinet Office efficiency unit will investigate recent large public-sector building projects that have either cost much more than planned or been very late. They include the Pounds 450m British Library building at St Pancras in north London, where the first phase has cost more than double the original estimate and is still incomplete after 16 years. Other public-sector projects costing much more than originally planned include the Trident nuclear submarine base at Faslane in Scotland, where overruns in construction costs accounted for much of the 72 per cent overspend on the 10-year project. The inquiry will be supervised by Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's efficiency adviser, who completed a similar study in July on the government's use of external consultants. That study recommended changes expected to save Pounds 130m over three years. Sir Peter is chairman and chief executive of Canary Wharf, the London Docklands property development. In spite of subsequent difficulties in finding tenants, the construction phase of Canary Wharf was finished on time and within budget. 'If this can be achieved for one of the largest civil engineering projects in the country, I want to know why it cannot be done for large public-sector projects.' he said. As head of defence procurement in the 1980s, he shook up the Ministry of Defence's equipment purchasing policies, sweeping away practices such as cost-plus contracts and cosy relationships with contractors. Sir Peter believes that better government ordering practices forced the UK defence industry to become more competitive, helping it to win exports. He hopes that improvements in procurement practices will also improve the construction industry's competitiveness abroad. The construction inquiry follows publication in July of the Latham review into contract and management practices in the construction industry. The review recommended radical changes to cut costs. Public-sector work - excluding housing but including infrastructure construction - accounted for about a third of the industry's Pounds 46bn annual turnover in 1993.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Russia urged to call halt to dumping of nuclear waste THE JAPANESE government will demand that Russia stop pumping nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan immediately, it said yesterday, adding it had received no advance warning from Moscow of the operation, Reuter reports from Tokyo. 'We had been asking them to stop such operations from last year,' Science and Technology Minister Satsuki Eda told parliament. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said the government would lodge a protest, pending further checks. Tokyo might use part of a planned Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) grant in aid to Russia to help build facilities to dispose of nuclear waste, Mr Hideaki Kumano, Vice-Minister of International Trade and Industry, told a news conference. The Dollars 100m aid grant, included in a Dollars 1.82bn Russian aid package Japan pledged in April, is designed to help dismantle Russia's nuclear weaponry. The two sides agreed to set up a committee to decide how to use the cash when Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited Japan last week. They also signed an agreement on the problem of nuclear dumping. The pact called for a joint investigation of radiation levels in the Sea of Japan. The environmental group Greenpeace raised the alarm on Sunday after watching a Russian navy vessel pour liquid waste directly into the Sea of Japan off the Maritime Province in the Siberian Far East, despite a global moratorium. Gillian Tett adds from Moscow: Russian officials said yesterday they would press ahead with their dumping operation in spite of the strong Japanese protests. Mr Nikolai Ribelsky, deputy environment minister, defended the dumping and said the liquid radioactive material was being transferred between tankers in the second phase of an operation that started over the weekend. He insisted the quantity already dumped, some 900 cubic metres of waste, did not break accepted international standards.</p>

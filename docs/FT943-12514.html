			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / People: Still sitting tight in the electric chair - Seventy this week, Lord Weinstock explains to Bernard Gray why, as custodian of GEC's history, he is still shaping its future This Friday Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, will be 70. Yet there will be no great fanfare or party at GEC; no gathering of the great and the good. 'No, I shall enjoy a quiet dinner in Salzberg with my friend Riccardo Muti, the conductor. His birthday is the day before mine and we have done the same thing for the past 12 years.' The juxtaposition of calculating businessman and contemplative music lover is only one of the tensions in Arnold Weinstock's character. He is a cultured and retiring man who has taken difficult and painful decisions in a tough industry. He lives well but abhors waste in his business. He is an ardent racehorse-owner who is too busy working to watch them run. He keeps a vice-like grip on every important financial detail of GEC, yet is none the less prepared to put his most valuable assets into joint ventures when the strategic need compels. To him there is no contradiction between the private man and public manager. 'I do not see the difficulty. I enjoy living well but it would be wrong to waste the company's money.' He also has some singular ambitions. On Desert Island Discs last year he confessed that in his youth he had dreamed of being an ice hockey player, but now he wishes he were a conductor. For his sins, however, he is neither an ice hockey player nor a conductor but the custodian of a large part of Britain's electronics industry, and has been for a generation. His views about the company's future are inevitably tied to the way he has developed it since he brought together the three great UK electrical companies, GEC, AEI and English Electric in the late 1960s. At 70, he is well past the normal retirement age for a chief executive, but the board has just asked him to stay on as managing director for at least a further two years. As a result, the next phase of the GEC's development is in the hands of the man who has shaped its recent history. Weinstock's long occupancy of the British electric chair has sparked plenty of controversy, both by the aggression with which he formed the modern GEC, and his apparent stolidity since. Observers have lionised and vilified him in almost equal measure. To look back through the contemporary accounts is to watch an inexorably shifting pattern. Weinstock was the man with the marketing flair who would save consumer electronics, the man with the management vision to integrate Britain's sprawling hi-tech industrial base, the man with the grasp of detail to keep profligate engineers on the straight and narrow. But as the glow of technological promise faded, GEC seemed to fade with it. Arnold Weinstock was made to carry the weight of disappointed expectations. If only GEC had been more adventurous in cutting edge technologies. If only the company had not leaned so heavily on government contracts. If only GEC had used that legendary cash pile. If only Arnold Weinstock hadn't been so cautious. Weinstock turns aside brickbats in much the same way that he declines bouquets. There is, however, a tightness around his eyes when critics are mentioned which suggests that the barbs do strike home. 'These people do not understand our industry. We have taken some failing poor businesses which were deeply in debt and turned them into successful rich companies. And we do spend money. We have spent Pounds 2bn on acquisitions in the past seven years and Pounds 406m of our own money on research and development last year alone.' The arguments have become so entrenched on both sides that the battle takes on a weary familiarity. Critics say that GEC has abandoned the technological high ground; Weinstock argues that he will make anything for which there is a profitable market. The charge is laid that he has retreated from the market to cosy government contracts; he points out that external forces such as the relentless advance of the Japanese in consumer electronics have in part shaped the company's direction. Weinstock seems to feel the pain of criticism, and there is a hint of residual disappointment that the company's achievements, and his own lifetime's efforts, are not better recognised. For all that, his personal style has not changed in a quarter of a century. The functional office in Stanhope Gate. The telephone with a bank of direct dial lines to contact any of his senior managers instantly if there is a problem. The monthly reports from 150 subsidiaries which stress key financial ratios, all of which are scrutinised by the managing director personally; many are annotated in red felt tip pen, often with brutally direct comments. 'I'm not the kind of manager who can grasp a situation and make a decision in the same kind of very impressive instinctive way that Jules Thorn (founder of the now Thorn EMI) did. I must have the data to make a decision.' On the future of GEC and his own succession Weinstock is moderately candid. 'There are some things I still need to do. I need to sort out our mix of industrial businesses and put some more things into joint ventures. For that it is important to know the people who will be your partners.' His vision of the company in 20 years is a detailed development of the present, rather than a radical shift or a new strategy for a new millennium. 'In power engineering we are second only to ABB and we will prosper further. Electricity is not going to be replaced, and we can meet future demand.' The list continues. GEC has a good position in telecoms, albeit in a much smaller market than its partner Siemens. Defence electronics will hunker down for the tough times ahead - he still hankers after a joint venture to pool his business with BAe. And though Weinstock wants to keep working he accepts that he will eventually have to move over. 'There is enough talent in the businesses to take over. Other people will come forward with their own ideas, but I would like to retain some kind of consultative role, I think that would be useful.' There has been much speculation in the City that he would like his son Simon to replace him, though many investing institutions would strongly oppose the idea unless Simon could demonstrate that he was the best candidate. 'I did nag Simon to join the company when he was at Warburg. But I know he would not want to do the top job if there were opposition to it. He has a very different personality from mine and acts in a very different way.' Also in the race are the three men recently appointed to the board: Peter Gershon, who runs GPT, the telecoms business; James Cronin, managing director of GEC Alsthom power engineering; and Roy Gardner, head of GEC-Marconi, the electronics arm. The other much-touted contender is David Newlands, GEC's finance director. If one of the candidates rises above the others in the eyes of the board and the City, the succession may be smooth. But the company is not home yet. There are at least some signs of change at Stanhope Gate. Until recently a chipboard wardrobe which must have cost all of Pounds 50 at MFI stood in the corner of the modest waiting room. No-one in living memory had ever hung a coat in it. Now it has disappeared, though its imprint can still be seen clearly in the hard-wearing beige carpet. The room has even been painted and GEC's smart 1960s logo hangs on the wall. Some things, however, remain the same. Profile writers have always moaned that no matter how hot the day or how long the interview, they are never offered refreshments by Weinstock. They still go thirsty. As I left his office on a sticky July day Lord Weinstock wished me a speedy journey back to the FT. I explained that the train strike had emptied the streets - so much so that I had arrived for the interview 20 minutes early and had gone for a cup of coffee around the corner. Lord Weinstock misheard me slightly. 'You got a cup of coffee here?' he asked, his eyes bulging with astonishment. 'They should do a Bateman cartoon  -the man who got a cup of coffee at GEC]' Whatever else he lacks at 70, the custodian of Britain's electrical industry has a finely developed sense of self-parody.</p>

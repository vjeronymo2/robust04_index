			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / MPs criticise customs for VAT administration: Half of British traders underdeclare tax payments More than half of British traders are underdeclaring the amount of value added tax they owe, the Commons public affairs committee said yesterday in a report that strongly criticised the performance of HM Customs and Excise. Customs, however, chose to interpret the MPs' rebuke as a compliment to its improving efficiency. 'We would consider this as a tribute to our officers' alertness - it means that we are finding a great deal of the under-reporting,' it said. The Commons committee emphasised, as a matter of 'concern', findings in a recent National Audit Office report that the level of VAT undeclared by companies in 1992-1993 was Pounds 2bn. Some 55 per cent of traders were found by Customs officials to be underdeclaring VAT. About a quarter of the shortfall stemmed from 'genuine error or misunderstanding' and most of the rest from a 'lack of reasonable care'. Only 20 per cent of companies contacted had a 'full' understanding of the VAT system, although two-thirds said they had 'adequate' knowledge, the auditors' report said. The committee yesterday called on Customs and Excise to reduce the cost of VAT compliance for companies and to improve business understanding of the system. Customs said it was already seeking ways of improving its business contacts. The committee concluded that VAT was providing a 'heavy burden on business'. It expressed concern 'that there are 156 main regulations affecting the operation of VAT and that since 1985 there have been 209 regulatory changes'. It pointed out that the cost of complying with VAT regulations was Pounds 1.6bn for traders, nearly four times more than the cost of administering the system. Customs insisted that the report had been 'highly selective' in the presentation of the figures, and said 60 per cent of the new regulations since 1985 had been developed to reduce compliance costs. Tax accountants said that the Pounds 2bn underdeclaration figure did not necessarily reflect tax lost to the Exchequer.</p>

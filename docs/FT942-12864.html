			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (9): Shares and the Chinese - The stock exchange chairman talks to Simon Holberton This October Mr Charles Lee steps down as chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after a remarkable three years at the helm of Asia's most dynamic stock market. Mr Lee, who retires in accordance with exchange rules, has presided over the market during a crucial phase of its development. He will leave the colony's exchange immeasurably stronger than when he took up the first of three one-year terms in January 1992. Then the exchange was still recovering from the trauma of past events - notably the 1987 stock market crash and problems with senior management - and the ructions they caused to staff and membership alike. China was barely on the agenda. The introduction of new technology seemed far off. Not so today. The exchange has introduced paperless trading for the most important stocks in the market and further technological enhancements are planned. Moreover, Hong Kong has the opportunity within its grasp to become one of the most important sources of capital for China. In no small way, this is due to the drive of Mr Lee, 58. A quietly-spoken UK-trained lawyer, Mr Lee negotiated the agreement whereby mainland Chinese companies would list 'H' shares on the Hong Kong exchange. This was no mean feat, given that these talks coincided with the bitter dispute between Britain and China over Governor Chris Patten's plans for the colony's political development. 'The leaders in China are very pragmatic people,' Mr Lee said recently. 'They said they want long-term stability and prosperity for Hong Kong. The listing of 'H' shares benefits not only China but also Hong Kong. It puts Hong Kong on the map as an international financial centre. It makes Hong Kong the gateway to China. This is a good example of where they do separate economic from political issues.' Mr Lee was born in Shanghai to parents from Guangdong. By the time his family fled China for Hong Kong in 1949 he was tri-lingual - speaking Cantonese, Shanghainese and Mandarin, the language of education. In Hong Kong he attended a secondary school run by the Jesuits. After school he joined Peat Marwick Mitchell where he trained as a chartered accountant. Although the knowledge he gained was to prove useful in later life, 'I couldn't see myself doing audit all my life.' After a stint with the Hong Kong government, in 1965 he went to London to study law. He flirted with student radicalism - once lunching with 'Danny the Red', the German student who organised demonstrations at the Sorbonne in 1968 - but left the London School of Economics with a Master of Laws at the end of 1968. Back in Hong Kong, he rejoined the government and was made secretary to a committee examining securities regulation and company law. The committee's report led to Hong Kong's first unified securities law, addressing for the first time the issue of investor protection. Mr Lee set up on his own in 1970 and in 1973 formed the firm of solicitors Woo, Kwan, Lee &amp; Lo, of which he is still a partner. In 1988 he was asked by Sir David Wilson, then governor, to join the board of the stock exchange as an independent representative. The four stock exchanges had been unified in 1986 but the new exchange was brought into disrepute first by closing its doors for four days during the global stock market turmoil of October 1987, and then by allowing preferential share allocations to council members for new issues. All of that now seems a long way away. The listing of the first 'H' share in the summer of last year proceeded from a serious analysis by the exchange of its future prospects. According to Mr Lee, the exchange took a critical look at Hong Kong and concluded that the market was rapidly maturing, and the prospect of listing many more local Hong Kong companies appeared dim. 'So we looked for a different role for Hong Kong to play,' he recalled. 'We could be a major market for capital formation in China. And we could be the link between the Chinese issuer and international investors. We started looking at this in early 1992 soon after I became chairman.' Mr Lee sent a paper to the State Council (or cabinet) of the Chinese government. It was favourably received and persuaded Mr Zhu Rongji - a senior political figure who was later to assume far wider control of the Chinese economy - that Chinese companies should accept international financial standards. 'The key - I kept on emphasising - was that the issuers must comply with international standards. I was not happy with 'B' shares. I told them it was not in China's interest or in Hong Kong's interest for 'B' shares to be listed in Hong Kong.' The turning point came in September 1992 when the exchange held a two-week seminar in Beijing. In all, some 60 experts from Hong Kong gave presentations on what it means for a company to uphold international financial standards. Lectures included accounting, management, regulation and listing procedures. 'We got 200 hand-picked attendees,' Mr Lee recalled. 'That really opened their eyes to why things had to be done in a certain way.' Earlier this year the Chinese government said it would permit a further 22 state companies to list their shares on foreign stock exchanges. Although some, notably two large power companies and two airlines, may seek a primary listing in New York, Mr Lee is confident that all 22 will have their primary or secondary listing in Hong Kong. He also cites the performance of Chinese companies that are listed abroad as a compelling reason why Hong Kong is a superior market place for mainland companies. Brilliance Automotive, the Chinese auto company that is listed in New York, is today rarely traded, its share price languishing below the offer price. Similarly, the dual listing of Shanghai Petrochemical in New York and Hong Kong underlines the benefit of a Hong Kong listing. 'We trade four times the volume of Shanghai Petrochemical shares as does the New York stock exchange in spite of the fact that 70 per cent of the issue was first listed there.' Lining up behind the next 22 companies to list are many more - 'several hundred,' Mr Lee believes. China will underwrite the future of the Hong Kong stock exchange. Stock market, Page VI</p>

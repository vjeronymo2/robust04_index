			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Improvement at Reynolds Metals Reynolds Metals, the aluminium products group, has turned in second-quarter net income of Dollars 12m or 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 23m or 38 cents a share for the same period a year ago, Reuter reports from Richmond. Revenues in the latest period were Dollars 1.5bn, up from Dollars 1.4bn. Aluminium shipments were 406,000 metric tons, compared with 387,000 metric tons in the 1993 second quarter. Mr Richard Holder, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Reynolds' second-quarter results reflect significant contributions from previously announced acquisitions and restructuring activities, as well as the benefits of ongoing cost-reduction programmes.' He added that all-time record shipments for any quarter, combined with improving aluminium ingot prices and a shift in product mix toward the higher value-added market segments, also contributed to the company's results. For the first six months, Reynolds posted a loss of Dollars 9m or 41 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 56m or 93 cents in the 1993 first half. Revenues were Dollars 2.7bn against Dollars 2.6bn.</p>

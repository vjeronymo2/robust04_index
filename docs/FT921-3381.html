			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): New bond fills a gap - National Savings WITH the chancellor planning to double the public sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 28bn, National Savings will launch a new product from July to increase its contribution to government funding. The guaranteed growth bond will offer fixed rates of interest guaranteed for only one year at a time, although there will be no set limit to the life of the bond. This is a departure for National Savings, as its fixed-rate certificates and bonds normally require investors to hold the products for five years to qualify for the maximum returns. National Savings says the new bond is aimed at basic-rate taxpayers to fill a gap in its product range. Interest will be added to the bond annually after tax has been deducted at the basic rate. Non-taxpayers will do better with income or capital bonds both of which pay interest gross, while higher-rate taxpayers will be more attracted to National Savings certificates which are paid free of income or capital gains tax. The minimum holding for the new bond will be Pounds 1,000, with a maximum of Pounds 250,000. Investors can hold the bond for more than a year if they like the sound of the next annual fixed rate. But they will be penalised if they cash-in the bond before the year is up or between years, probably through a reduced rate of interest. National Savings says that those who fall into the new 20 per cent tax band will have to claim back from the Inland Revenue the 5p in the pound extra tax paid. This will affect those who rely solely on investment income, since those in employment will have already had their first Pounds 2,000 of income taxed at 20p in the pound through pay-as-you-earn. The guaranteed growth bond is the second new National Savings product in as many years after the launch last July of the children's bonus bond. The Budget makes another change to National Savings: the limit on the maximum holding of income bonds is lifted from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 50,000 from next month (the exact date will be announced later). The minimum investment of Pounds 2,000 remains unchanged; income bonds are sold in multiples of Pounds 1,000. National Savings contributed Pounds 2.26bn to government funding in 1991-92, up from Pounds 1.35bn the year before. It is likely that other changes - such as raising the ceiling on other holdings - may take place in order to increase this contribution.</p>

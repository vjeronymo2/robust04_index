			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> ONE PLAY'S TOO HEAVY, ANOTHER'S A SOUFFLE;  </P> <P> 'MISS MARY' IS BILLED AS A 'DRAMEDY,' BUT SOMETIMES ITS COMEDIC MOMENTS FALL  UNDER THE WEIGHT OF ITS DRAMA  </P> <P> Muriel Resnik Jackson's "Miss Mary," in its world premiere at Illusion's New  View Theatre in Fullerton, opens deceptively on a spry, optimistic high.  </P> <P> Mary's sister and two daughters flit through her Manhattan apartment, chatting  about the upcoming trip Mary and her husband are taking to Egypt. Romantic  cruises on the Nile, a moonlit stroll to the pyramids.  </P> <P> As they conjure images, Mary arrives with a smashing red dress she just bought.  Take a look at this, girls. See, I may be getting up in years, but I haven't  lost it. She parades around the room, showing off, then the phone rings. Oh,  what a nuisance.  </P> <P> The swirl of good vibes ends abruptly as she learns there's been an accident.  Her husband is in the hospital, on life support. Mary breaks down. And that's  only the start of her troubles.  </P> <P> For the next 3 months, Mary agonizes over the decision to take him off the  respirator. Then, after he's dead, she injures herself in a fall and loses most  of her independence. Six months later, she's paralyzed by depression. Another 6  months and she's begging her daughter to help with her suicide. Six months  after that, she's senile, unable even to recognize her children.  </P> <P> Wow. Even though Jackson describes the play as a "dramedy," there's not much  funny business here. "Miss Mary" is, basically, a tragedy with a few awkward  laughs weaved in to ease the otherwise unremitting pain. Jackson, an author  most familiar with comedy (she is best known for her 1964 Broadway success, the  helium-filled "Any Wednesday"), attempts to meld the two, but it doesn't work.  </P> <P> Given the weighty subject matter, most of the humor seems forced, even out of  place. And the few times it does click -- the wisecracks from Mary's sexually  liberated sister Emily (Ruth Cameron), for example -- it tends to trivialize  the play's serious intent. Director Beverly Arrowsmith is asked to keep  everything balanced, a more than daunting job.  </P> <P> Jackson should be praised, however, for trying to tackle issues that seem to  defy easy solutions. Through Mary, we are expected to examine a happy life  turned upside down: How can we cope with such cruel fate?  </P> <P> And through her family's reactions, especially the daughters', we must consider  what our obligations should be when a loved one becomes helpless, when the  child becomes the parent. What are the ethical limits of our responsibilities?  How much of ourselves should we sacrifice?  </P> <P> But "Miss Mary's" biggest flaw -- even more than its uneven tone -- is that in  trying to do so much, it leaves the philosophical landscape crowded, the  matters unresolved. The problem is especially apparent when Resnik delves into  the question of euthanasia.  </P> <P> There is charged desperation when Elaine Barnard, as Mary, pleads with daughter  Katherine (Carla Jones) to give her a lethal dose of sleeping pills, but the  writing seems incomplete, inauthentic. And manipulative, not to mention  confusing: Are we supposed to feel anger when Katherine takes Mary to the edge  but then refuses her? Or is this last-second denial a courageous act?  </P> <P> Jackson is better at getting us to understand her characters. Although Mary's  decline seems sudden (Barnard gives her so much vitality in that first scene,  it's hard imagining that her fall could be so quick), we do pick up on her  dependence on her husband and on the life they shared. We also have a pretty  good idea of Mary's pride and sensitivity.  </P> <P> There's yuppie self-absorption in both Katherine and the other daughter,  Margaret (Laura Hoffman) that exemplifies a certain type of modern woman.  Margaret has her own family and doesn't want it disturbed; Katherine is a  professional who only has so much time to give, and it's ironic when the care  of Mary falls to her.  </P> <P> The ending is also ironic, and more than a bit chilling. The life now left to  both Mary and Katherine is humiliating and undignified. Would it have been  better if Katherine had given her the pills? "Miss Mary" doesn't have the  breadth to say, but at least it asks the question.  </P> <P> 'MISS MARY'  </P> <P> An Illusion's New View Theatre world premiere of Muriel Resnik Jackson's play.

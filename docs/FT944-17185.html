			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Time Warner puts three titles on-line Time Warner, the media and entertainment giant, plans to put three of its best-know magazines - People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune - on CompuServe, the largest commercial on-line information service. The publications have a combined circulation of nearly 7.4m and are the biggest of their sort to enter the 'cyberworld' of interactive electronic distribution. About 200 special interest magazines are already available to computer users who connect to information services, according to Magazine Publishers of America, an industry trade group. However, the on-line editions of People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune will feature some innovations, including photographs and advertising, in addition to the full text of the print editions. Magazines are setting the pace in electronic publishing in the US because of their national readerships. Most newspapers, in contrast, are regional. The project is the latest of several experiments that Time Warner has made with electronic publishing. Time, the group's flagship magazine, went electronic in September last year via America Online, a fast-growing service. Over the past year Time Online has logged about 3m readers. Reading magazines on a computer screen is more expensive and cumbersome than purchasing the printed editions, but a big attraction seems to be the ability to engage in on-line discussion of articles and issues with journalists and other readers. For example, CompuServe members who access People, Sports Illustrated or Fortune will be able to participate in forums in which they can quiz the magazines' writers, exchange messages with news-makers featured in the magazines and chat on-line with other readers. For publishers, this presents many challenges. But the prospect of reaching tens of thousands of new readers on-line is too enticing to be ignored.</p>

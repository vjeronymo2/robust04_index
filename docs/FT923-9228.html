			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold struggles to stay above Dollars 350 an ounce GOLD STRUGGLED yesterday to stay above Dollars 350 a troy ounce, which some analysts described as 'a pivotal level.' If the precious metal breaks below Dollars 348 an ounce today, some dealers feel it will quickly fall to just above Dollars 340. Analysts suggested that gold's rise in the past three weeks reflected the work of professional operators who, once they could not push the price convincingly through Dollars 360 an ounce, decided to take their profits. 'The rise was inspired by the dollar's weakness but, apart from the professionals, there was no one out there buying. There appears to be little buying by investors at large,' said Mr Philip Taylor, analyst at SG Warburg, the financial services group. 'The investment funds are probably disappointed that the price did not move up further, but there is no compelling reason for buying gold just now.' Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Durlacher and Company, a stockbroking organisation, pointed out that operators found it very difficult in what was a holiday period for most countries in the northern hemisphere to boost gold past Dollars 360 an ounce. 'There was just not enough steam to take it through Dollars 361 in August, so they decided to take their profits and go on holiday themselves.' He pointed out that August was 'a difficult month for gold' and that even during the big bull run in 1973 the upward surge in the price halted in that month. Some London dealers suggested that early selling yesterday could have been as much as 250,000 ounces (nearly eight tonnes) to move the market as quickly as it did. Consistent and sizeable selling had also been evident at recent London price 'fixing' sessions and this gave the impression that central banks might have been selling from their stocks. Fears of central bank sales have been raised again this week by Uruguay's revelation that it sold 50,000 ounces of gold in July to raise about Dollars 17.9m and as part of a new policy of converting its gold reserves into dollar fixed-term deposits. Gold closed in London last night at Dollars 350.35 an ounce, down Dollars 2.40 from Tuesday's close. But after the European close the price dipped again to Dollars 349.75 at one stage. On the New York Commodity Exchange dealers at midday were quoting bullion at Dollars 349.55 an ounce.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Mr Graham Shear: Correction IN YESTERDAY'S report of the collapse of the trial in which Mr Graham Shear, a London solicitor, was acquitted of insider trading, we incorrectly reported that Mr Edmund Lawson QC, prosecuting counsel, alleged that Mr Shear bought shares in International Media Communications, a USM-quoted company, and sold them after the price rose. In fact, Mr Shear had sold his shares at a loss after the share price had dropped.</p>

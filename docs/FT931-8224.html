			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Job losses to mount in French industry JOB losses will mount across France in the first half of this year as industry continues to cut costs and prune investment, according to the latest business survey by Insee, the state statistics institute. The rise in unemployment, after last year's 5 per cent increase to 2.98m people, will keep consumer confidence and spending depressed, the survey says. There is also little hope of a recovery in industrial expenditure. The 2,000 companies questioned by Insee expected an overall cut of 4 per cent in industrial investment this year after last year's 6 per cent reduction. French industry has just emerged from a bruising 1992, when companies struggled against a combination of sluggish consumer spending, high interest rates and a strong currency. Yesterday's announcement confirms the gloomy tone of the Bank of France's business survey published on Monday and follows Thursday's news that the Insee industrial production index fell in December to its lowest level for four years. The threat of further industrial cuts comes at a sensitive time. France's socialist government, which faces defeat by a conservative coalition in next month's elections, is anxious to paint a positive picture of the economy to avert further attacks on the franc. However, the Insee survey points to another difficult year for French companies. Most respondents expect the overall level of activity in the first half of 1993 to match the corresponding period last year.</p>

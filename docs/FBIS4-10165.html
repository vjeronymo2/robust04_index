			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ruben Dario Diaz] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential  candidate of the "National Consensus Alliance," said the United  States has assumed an irresponsible attitude by saying Panama  has not cooperated in the antidrug-trafficking struggle.  Galindo said efforts are being made in Panama to cooperate in  the antidrug-trafficking struggle, and the United States has  exaggerated in saying the contrary. "We are all intent on ending  drug trafficking and money laundering once and for all in our  country because it is difficult to say it will end, but it is  incorrect to say nothing has been done," he said.    The presidential candidate said there are authorities who  are  trying to fight narcotrafficking, but he added there are groups  of criminals who attempt to evade the security system because  Panama is a country with long coastlines on both oceans, which  makes it even more difficult to control.    Galindo also mentioned the charges against the former  government. He said Panamanians cannot live permanently in the  past but must learn from experiences from the past and look to  the future; otherwise, "we will be living in the past, and the  future will be the one that is lost."</p>

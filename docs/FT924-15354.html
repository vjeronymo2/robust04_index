			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / W Midlands orders 'take a nosedive' ORDERS, deliveries and confidence in the West Midlands 'took a nosedive' between July and September, Mr Andrew Millward, chairman of the West Midlands regional group of Chambers of Commerce, said. Mr Millward, commenting on the chambers' latest quarterly economic survey, said, 'The post-election euphoria disappeared as companies realised the recession was deepening. The events of the past few weeks have made the picture even more unclear.' The survey, covering 700 companies in both the manufacturing and services sectors of the region and published today, took place shortly before sterling was taken out of the ERM.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 11 -- Presidential Spokesman Andrzej  Drzycimski on Wednesday [11 May] accused public television of  "skewing information on the functioning of supreme state organs"  in a letter addressed to the National Radio and Television  Council (KRRIT). In the letter, addressed to head of the KRRIT  Ryszard Bender, Drzycimski wrote: "After having watched  Tuesday's main news bulletin (on public TV channel 1, ed.), I  came to the conclusion that I can no longer remain silent."    In his opinion, the lack of television coverage of Walesa's  return from his official visit to Estonia and his press  conference at the airport, infringed not only the law on radio  and TV but also "all principles that public television should  adhere to." Terming as "scandalous" the treatment of the head  of state by Polish television on Tuesday, Drzycimski also  recalled a "superficial coverage" of Walesa's visit to India, a  tendentious selection of fragments of Walesa's recent talks with  the Democratic Left alliance (SLD) caucus and serious mistakes  in reports on his visit to Lithuania.    Drzycimski expressed the hope that the KRRIT would take  measures to prevent "such scandalous incidents" from happening.  The KRRIT on Wednesday discussed Drzycimski's letter.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an initial reaction, the joint command of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has  strongly condemned today's ugly crime at Ibrahimi Mosque in  which many defenseless Palestinian citizens were killed by the  armed gangs of settlers under the very eyes and ears of the  occupation forces.    In the name of the Red Star and Red Eagle Battalions and on  behalf of the militant nationalist forces, the joint command  pledged to the martyrs and the Palestinian people in the  occupied territores to take revenge on the occupation and the  settlers.    The two fronts appealed to the international community to  act  immediately to secure peace and protection for the Palestinian  people under occupation, and called on the PLO command to learn  from what is taking place in the occupied territories and to  suspend the separate negotiations and the destructive partial  deals which have catastrophic results on the Palestinian people.    The two fronts hold the Israeli Army responsible for this  crime.</p>

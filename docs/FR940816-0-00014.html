Species for which such trade is controlled are listed in Appendices I, II, and III to the Convention. The countries participating in this treaty, including the United States, have adopted species amendments to Appendices I and II. The United States did not enter a reservation on any of these listing amendments approved at the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties. This document incorporates these amendments into the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's regulations implementing the Convention. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments set forth in this rule entered into effect and became enforceable on June 11, 1992, under the terms of the Convention.

Species for which trade is controlled are included in three appendices. Their inclusion in Appendix I or II is by agreement of CITES Party countries. Appendix I include species threatened with extinction that are or may be affected by trade. Appendix II includes species that although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in them is strictly controlled. It also lists species that must be subject to regulation in order that trade in other currently or potentially threatened species may be brought under effective control ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., because of difficulty in distinguishing specimens of the currently or potentially threatened species from the specimens of other species). Appendix III includes species that any Party country unilaterally designates as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for purposes of restricting or preventing exploitation, and for which cooperation of other Parties is needed to control trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any CITES Party may propose amendments to Appendices I and II for consideration at meetings of the Conference of the Parties. The text of proposals must be communicated to the CITES Secretariat at least 150 days before a meeting. The Secretariat must then consult the other Parties and appropriate intergovernmental agencies, and communicate responses to all Parties no later than 30 days before the meeting. Amendments are adopted by consensus or a two-thirds majority of the Parties present and voting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Actions of the Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES was held on March 2&hyph;13, 1992, in Kyoto, Japan. At the meeting (COP8), the Parties considered 81 different proposals to amend the appendices for animals and 27 different proposals for plants. The 108 proposals were described in earlier  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice; and addressed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 4, 1992, for proposals submitted by the United States (57 FR 7719) and by other Parties (57 FR 7713). the proposals that were approved by this Conference of the Parties were announced in a May 13, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (57 FR 20443); note this clarifying correction to 57 FR 20445, that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anthracoceros  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spp. (hornbills) also were proposed for addition to Appendix II by the Netherlands (and approved). As also announced in that May 13, 1992, notice, some proposals were withdrawn by their proponents or rejected by the Parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> That notice (57 FR 20443) requested comments from the public on whether the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) should recommend that the United States enter reservations on any of the listing amendments. The effect of a reservation would be to exempt this country from completely implementing the Convention for the particular species. More comprehensive discussions of any practical effects of entering a reservation and reasons for or against entering reservations are contained in November 22, 1985, and December 15, 1989,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices (50 FR 48212 and 54 FR 51432, respectively). Changes to the CITES appendices as a result of the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties that are incorporated into the U.S.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Code of Federal Regulations  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are printed as the conclusion of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Related Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Namibia and Zimbabwe proposed to transfer the cheetak ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acinonyx jubatus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) populations of Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe from Appendix I to Appendix II, with export quotas. In the March 4, 1992,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 7713), the United States opposed this amendment, since the Service had not received the proponents' supporting statement from the CITES Secretariat prior to COP8. The proposal was redrafted at COP8 as a resolution [see Doc. 8.22 (Rev.)] retaining the species in Appendix I and establishing the following quotas (for trophies and skins: 2 per person): Botswana, 5; Namibia, 100; and Zimbabwe, 50. However, such a resolution was deemed to be unnecessary, and the quotas have been reflected in the Secretariat's annotations to the appendices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The original proposal to transfer the sub-Saharana population of leopards ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Panthera pardus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) from Appendix I to appendix II, with export quotas, was redrafted as a revision of resolution Conf. 7.7, with the quotas (for trophies and skins: 2 per person) increased for Malawi (50) and South Africa (75), and initiated (new quota) for Namibia (100). the Service supports the continuation of this quota system for leopard trophies and skins for personal use as previously provided for in resolution Conf. 7.7 and now in Conf. 8.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resolution Conf. 8.18 adopted a nomenclatorial reference as a guideline for cacti (Cactaceae); therefore, several less familiar names are added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing listings. Also, by an amendment at COP5 and Resolution Conf. 6.18, the flasked artificially propagated seedlings of all Appendix II species are excluded from regulation. Resolution Conf. 8.17(c), by interpretation of CITES Article VII(4) and Article I(b)(iii), exempts the flasked artificially propagated seedlings of Appendix I orchid species (details are in the March 4, 1992,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; 57 FR 7774). A subsequent postal-procedures amendment also addresses this topic (details are in the November 6, 1992,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; 57 FR 53090). All the flasked artificially propagated orchid seedlings (Orchidaceae) thus are not regulated by CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Thinking small gives 600 Group a cutting edge - A look at new expansion opportunities which are being created in traditional markets / Tackling Asia's Tigers Humidity can be a problem for both man and machine in Singapore, which is why the local subsidiary of 600 Group opened a new air-conditioned showroom there earlier this month to help boost sales of its machine tools. However, in contrast to the climate created, Mr Richard Verrier is far from cool on the prospects for the machine tool and materials handling group in Singapore and neighbouring countries. Markets may vary considerably from country to country but there are plenty of opportunities, said Mr Verrier, director and general manager of both George Cohen Far East and George Cohen (Malaysia), based in Singapore and Selangor, Malaysia, respectively. Mr George Cohen was the founder of 600 Group. Along with many UK engineering companies, 600 Group has had a presence in the region for decades, but has recently reorganised its management to improve the performance of the businesses. Its activities in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand have been placed under the overall control of Mr John Leverett, managing director of 600 Machinery Australia. In its most recent annual report, 600 Group said the change had led to significant cost savings and 'we are now well positioned to exploit the many expansion opportunities which exist in the countries of the Pacific Rim'. Mr Verrier said sales from Malaysia and Singapore, along with Hong Kong, were running at Pounds 6m-Pounds 7m a year. 'But I have no doubt they will increase, following the restructuring.' The company's aim is to expand its Asia Pacific activities into new countries and territories, starting this year. On a longer-term basis, Mr Verrier said Singapore would be the nucleus for exporting to Thailand, Sri Lanka, Burma and Indonesia, and he would also be looking at trading with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. But he is not ignoring Singapore, as the new showroom testifies. The group's machine tool sales effort for the island state was strengthened significantly in May with the arrival of Mr David Gibney to head the local machine tools division. Both Mr Gibney and Mr Verrier believe that, for perhaps the first time, 600 Group has the opportunity to take on the Japanese and Taiwanese lathe producers through the new range of Tornado machines produced by its Colchester Lathe offshoot. The small, 'no frills' computer controlled CNC lathes, launched in April following an unprecedented market research exercise among small engineering companies, have proved an immediate success. In Singapore, the machines are being aimed at 'apartment factories', subcontractors which are demanding increasingly sophisticated CNC machines. But Mr Verrier is also hopeful of winning big orders for machine tools from Singapore's fast-growing engineering education sector. Elsewhere in Singapore, the main prospects are in the company's emerging high-technology businesses, such as its laser marking system which has applications in the electronics industry. The system was launched in Singapore late last year, while the 600 Group electro-optical products have yet to be launched there. Mr Verrier sees these products supporting sales in Singapore as the focus of the company's more traditional industrial products shifts to Malaysia, reflecting a transition apparent at other UK engineering companies operating in Singapore. 'The hub of machine tools sales is going to be Malaysia in the next few years,' he said. In machine tools, 600 Group is well established in Malaysia's education sector, but needs to penetrate better the industrial sector. Again Mr Verrier hoped the company could achieve this with the Tornado range and 'hit the Japanese where it hurts'. His target is the country's small machine shops. The projected growth in Malaysia's automotive industry and plans to subcontract more machined automotive parts, make this an attractive sector. And, like its Singapore counterpart, it is looking at buying CNC rather than manual machine tools. But the big opportunity for 600 Group in Malaysia is for sales of its materials handling equipment to the palm oil industry. A shortage of labour in parts of the country is encouraging plantation owners to look at mechanised methods of collecting the fruit. Mr Verrier is working hard to promote 600 Group's Hiab truck-mounted cranes for the job of hoisting 600kg bunches of fruit on to trucks, and said the cranes needed to be tough to do that 60 times a day. That is one reason why there is less competition in the Malaysian materials handling than in its Singapore counterpart, where Mr Verrier said 28 companies offered truck-mounted cranes. Of these, half were serious rivals, and most were Italian producers which 'really undercut on price'. Mr Verrier also sees other opportunities in Malaysia for sales of materials handling equipment to a commercial and construction sector for which this kind of equipment is relatively new.

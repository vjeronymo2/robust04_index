			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Gaullist tension on presidency mounts THE UNEASY jostling over who will carry Gaullist colours into France's 1995 presidential election looks set to increase after a weekend rally confirmed Mr Jacques Chirac's strength within the party, as distinct from an electorate increasingly seduced by his prime ministerial protege, Mr Edouard Balladur. At a Strasbourg rally of young Gaullists marking the start of the political year, Mr Chirac paid loyal tribute to Mr Balladur, for 'governing France well' over the past five months, and pledged 'unfailing and unreserved support' to his 'friend of 30 years'. But Mr Chirac made clear that he has not presided over the Gaullist RPR party for nearly 20 years just to act as king-maker for someone else. Other speakers, particularly those outside the Balladur government, stressed their undimmed desire to see Mr Chirac in the Elysee. Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the national assembly, hailed Mr Chirac as the chief architect of the conservatives' success. Only Mr Chirac's 'personal charisma' could carry the presidential election, Mr Seguin suggested. This hardly concurs with last week's Louis Harris poll that some two thirds of French thought Mr Balladur had a better chance of winning in 1995, and would make a better president, than Mr Chirac. But it may move Mr Chirac towards Mr Seguin and the latter's scepticism about the Maastricht treaty and criticism of the government's financial orthodoxy at the expense of employment - a direction in which the Gaullist party leader would probably like to move anyway. So far, Mr Balladur, whose standing may well dip if economic recovery is slow, has resisted any temptation from the polls to declare an interest in the Elysee. But if he does so, France's fractious conservatives still have not organised a way of fielding a single presidential candidate. Two years ago, in opposition, the RPR and the centre-right UDF formally promised to do this by means of a US-style presidential primary election. Now, in the comfort of power, they have taken no action to make this a reality.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / World Trade News: PBN boosts aerospace tie with Romanian company Pilatus Britten-Norman (PBN), the manufacturer of maritime patrol, surveillance and small commuter aircraft, is planning to strengthen its ties with the Romanian aircraft industry by either forming a joint venture or taking a stake in Romaero, the Bucharest-based aerospace company. Romaero has been the main subcontractor of PBN, the Isle of Wight-based company owned by the Swiss Oerlikon-Buhrle group since 1979, for 26 years. It builds the basic airframe of the Islander and the Defender, the military version of the twin engine propeller aircraft. Mr Anthony Stansfeld, PBN's chief executive said PBN was about to launch a larger version of its Defender surveillance aircraft at next month's Farnborough Air Show. The launch comes at a time when governments are stepping up their fight against illegal immigration and narcotics and are showing increased interest in patrol aircraft to monitor fishing zones. The fishing dispute in the Bay of Biscay has highlighted the role of maritime patrol aircraft. Demand is also expected to increase with the ratification next November of the Law of the Sea Convention, which will encourage maritime countries to step up protection of their 200-mile so-called Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). PBN is also attempting to penetrate the Russian and Chinese markets by negotiating manufacturing agreements with Russian and Chinese aerospace companies. The company believes there is strong potential for its short take-off and landing commuter aircraft in both those markets. 'The idea is for our aircraft to be built in Russia and China,' Mr Stansfeld said. Although PBN now employs only about 190 people, its Islander aircraft has been one of the best-selling commercial aircraft produced in western Europe. Since it was launched in 1967, more than 1,200 aircraft have been sold in 120 countries and about 1,000 aircraft are still in service. The Defender was subsequently developed to expand the Islander's market base into the government agency and military markets.</p>

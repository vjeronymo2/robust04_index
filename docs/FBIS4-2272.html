			<p>BFN     [Text] Chongqing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Chongqing, a major  industrial city in southwest Sichuan Province, has reported  rapid expansion of its telecommunications network in recent  years.    Officials from the telecommunications authority said the  city's telephone lines had increased from 20,000 in 1988 to  200,000 by the end of last year.    In 1993 alone, near 40,000 lines were installed at an  investment of 510 million yuan. The figure equals the total  number installed in the previous 40 years, according to the  sources.    With the new opening of fiber optic lines to Wuhan and  Chengdu and a satellite ground station, telecommunications  between the city and the outside have become much easier, the  sources said.    Nearly 95,000 direct call lines now connect the city with  over 700 domestic cities and 185 countries across the world.    Meanwhile, the city's telecommunications network has become  more diversified. It now handles more than 6,000 mobile phones  and some 100,000 wireless pagers.    The sources said that, as the telephone network expands,  applications for household telephones are piling up.    The sources disclosed that the city will invest a record one  billion yuan this year to add another 210,000 lines to its  telephone network.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond sales record reported De Beers, the South African group that controls more than 80 per cent of the rough (uncut) diamond market, surprised analysts yesterday by reporting that diamond sales this year by its London-based Central Selling Organisation reached a record USDollars 4.366bn. This was well ahead of most forecasts, 28 per cent up on last year's Dollars 3.417bn and 5 per cent above the previous record of Dollars 4.172bn in 1988. De Beers warned, however, that there were some signs of over-supply in the lower and cheaper quality range of rough diamonds following sales from strategic stockpiles by the Russian and US governments. There were also worrying sales of larger-sized, gem-quality diamonds from Russia's treasury in the past two weeks which were in clear breach of the republic's 1990 agreement with De Beers which gave the South African group exclusive marketing rights to 95 per cent of Russia's rough diamond output. Diamonds were set aside by the US and Russian strategic stockpiles for industrial and technical use but the subsequent development of the Indian industry, which can economically cut and polish very small stones, means that today many of the stockpiled diamonds are cutable. For example, in two tenders, the US stockpile not only sold 1.15m carats of industrial diamonds for Dollars 6.5m but also 1.35m carats of small gem diamonds for Dollars 111.41m. De Beers said retail diamond jewellery sales had held up well, given the weakness of the global economy. If the Christmas selling season turned out as expected, retail diamond jewellery sales this year would be marginally higher than in 1992 when 55m pieces worth Dollars 41bn were sold. There was strong retail sales growth this year in the US and east Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and China). Sales in Japan, which vies with the US to be the biggest market, each accounting for about a third of western world sales, were down in local currency terms but, because of the yen's strength, up in dollars. Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, part of the French financial services group, said that even though diamond sales beat best estimates it did not mean the market was particularly buoyant. De Beers had been re-filling supply pipelines, he suggested, and consequently it would have difficulty reaching Dollars 4bn of sales in 1994. Also De Beers' attributable profit was unlikely to show as substantial an increase as its diamond sales.</p>

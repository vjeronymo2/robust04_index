			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Birgitt Riese: "Disarmament in the Soil: </F> Discarded Munitions Now Recognized as Environmental Hazard"]    [Text][First para is editor's summary] VDI-N,  Duesseldorf--Over 7,000 sites in the Federal Republic are  suspected of being polluted with weapons and munitions from two  world wars and with toxins from military exercises. The road to  cleaning them up is a long one--indeed, the authorities have  only begun to find all the sites. There is a lack of tested  methods for dealing with the poisoned inheritance.    Mustard gas, Tabun, Clark, phosgene: chemical weapons are a  chapter of German history that is still far from being closed.  "Munitions dumps in the Federal Republic were not recognized as  an environmental problem until the 80's," as Andre Dahn of the  BC Berlin Consult GmbH in Berlin recently explained at a  professional meeting of the Offenbach environmental instititute.  On 13 January 1993 the Federal Republic signed the international  chemical weapons convention, which among other things also  requires the destruction of chemical weapons.    But it is not only wars which left explosive traces in the  soil. Over 1,000 Soviet army properties and almost 2,000 posts  of the former National People's Army are heavily polluted with  all kinds of military discards, such as munitions, kerosene and  oil. NATO troop exercise locations which are to be used by  civilians can be added to the list.    It took a long time for the Federal government to consider  the legacy of two world wars. It was the end of 1993 before the  Federal Environmental Department in Berlin (UBA) published a  study in which sites in Germany suspected of having discarded  munitions were included. The list gave 4,336 sites on which  discards from munitions production or unsecured storage places  for war material could be located. But the experts of the UBA  are far from being able to say which materials are polluting the  soil and the groundwater and to what degree. "The study is based  on researches in archives and thus represents a purely  historical and descriptive summary," as Manfred Kurka, expert  advisor on suspected toxic waste sites, explains.    Some Federal Laender have launched their own initiatives in  the meanwhile. In Lower Saxony, for example, an interagency task  force set up by the Land government presented an initial survey  as early as 1988. In mid-1989 the environmental agency in  Hannover began systematic risk evaluation, investigating more  than 400 suspected sites so far. The investigation itself  involves four steps. Preliminary research provides initial data  on the status of a possible munitions dump, including location,  use and owners. In checking and documenting, archival materials,  contemporary eyewitness reports, aerial photographs and  geological conditions are consulted, interpreted and evaluated.  Then in the preliminary investigation soil samples are taken and  groundwater measurement locations are set up. The last step is  the detailed investigation with increased sample density and  more precise anaylses. The final result of the investigations is  a status report which states the potential risk of a given site.    It turns out that in Lower Saxony the suspicion of toxic  waste was not confirmed in about half of the sites. The other  approximately 200 locations are more or less highly  contaminated; further investigations are planned. For five  suspicious sites it has been established that must be cleaned  up, secured or at least watched. According to Hans- Juergen  Rapsch, report leader for discarded munitions in the Lower  Saxony department of the environment, the risk evaluation alone  has cost the Land DM45 million so far. For the cleanup of  particularly problematic sites costs in the hundreds of millions  are anticipated. These are amounts which the Land cannot raise  alone. "But the Union does not feel responsible for discarded  munitions," Rapsch reports regretfully. A discarded munitions  financing law drafted by Lower Saxony which had clearly been  supported by the Federal Council died in the Bundestag at the  beginning of 1993. It provided for the Union participating more  in cleanup costs.    But financing is not the only problem. The question of how  discarded munitions can be cleaned up at all has not yet been  answered. Therefore, a model cleanup is to be carried out in  Stadtallendorf in Hesse which will be supported by the Federal  Research Department. At the site of the largest explosives  factory in the Second World War the soil is contaminated with  trinitrotoluene (TNT) and production chemicals. The Lurgi  Environmental Participation Company GmbH in Frankfurt wants to  use its Deconterra process, in which the soil is washed and the  toxic concentrate is then burned.    But the project, which was started in 1990, is suffering  delays. "The soil-washing plant probably cannot be started up  until the beginning of 1996," says Birgit Hofmann, press  spokeswoman in the Hessian department of the environment. She  says that at the moment another hazard evaluation is being  carried out for built-up parts of the area and a cleanup plan is  being set up.    The investigation and evaluation of suspicious sites is to  be  facilitated by special computer programs. Thus the Industrial  Plant Operating Company (IABG) in Ottobrunn has developed a  model for the evaluation of hazards posed by military sites and  discarded munitions (MAGMA). There is information stored in the  data bank about 227 chemicals, particularly those specific to  munitions. Both the toxicity of the substances and environmental  factors like precipitation, flora and soil type enter into the  evaluation. The result of the calculations is a socalled M value  between one and ten, which expresses whether the potential  hazard is small or a site must be treated urgently. MAGMA has  been used so far to investigate suspicious sites on the former  property of the western group of Soviet troops. At the moment,  according to Hoppe, it is still in the programming phase, but  within a few weeks it should be possible to install MAGMA in the  computer.    Since March of 1993, in a project supported by the Federal  Research Department at the former explosives factory at Tanne  near Clausthal- Zellerfeld, the IABG has been investigating  whether microorganisms can deal with TNT in the soil. The first  result of the investigations is that bacteria present in the  soil do metabolize TNT, but in the process they form substances  which either have not yet been analyzed or are equally poisonous.    For most war material the only method so far has been  burning. But so far there is only one plant for it. The military  science department (WWD) of the Federal army in Munster has been  running a two-chamber furnace since 1980 in which so far 75 tons  of pure war material have been destroyed. Since the furnace only  achieves temperatures up to 1200 degrees C, toxic arsenic is  only inadequately bound. Thus a second furnace is planned,  construction on which is to being this year, according to  Hermann Martens, group leader in the WWD. This furnace is to  operate according to the Swiss plasmox procedure. At  temperatures up to 1600C, which are achieved with the help  of an arc light, the arsenic-containing material vitrifies.  Toxins are then washed out in such small quantities that  according to Martens the slag can be used as a building material.</p>

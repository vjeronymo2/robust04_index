			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN INVOKES EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE TO RETAIN DIARIES  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan set the stage for a new constitutional challenge  over presidential privacy Wednesday when he invoked the doctrine of executive  privilege to avoid turning over excerpts of his White House diaries to  Iran-Contra defendant John M. Poindexter.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene has said he will hold a hearing to  consider Reagan's claim, almost guaranteeing that Poindexter's trial will be  delayed from its scheduled Feb. 20 start. Greene presides over Poindexter's  trial on five felony counts of obstructing Congress, making false statements  and conspiracy.  </P> <P> Greene has said he will apply a higher standard of confidentiality to material  covered by a claim of executive privilege than to material for which no such  claim is made. But he has made clear that he has not yet decided the issue, and  could order Reagan to produce the diary excerpts despite his constitutional  argument.  </P> <P> Late Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a separate brief with Greene  supporting Reagan's position. The department said the former President "has  validly and properly invoked executive privilege."  </P> <P> The department said last week that the court was facing a "potentially serious  constitutional confrontation" over the issue. It said the confidentiality of  the personal papers of President Bush and all subsequent presidents was at  stake.  </P> <P> Although Reagan's lawyers have cited presidential rights in trying to avoid  turning over the papers, they had tried to avoid using the phrase "executive  privilege." Many still associate that phrase with former President Richard M.  Nixon's attempts to disrupt investigations of the Watergate scandal of the  early 1970s. However, in an order issued earlier Wednesday, Greene made it  clear that he was unwilling to play semantical games.  </P> <P> He asked Reagan's lawyers if they intended to make "a formal claim . . . of  executive privilege, as that term is referred to in United States vs. Nixon."  If not, the judge demanded to know why the former President had failed to  deliver the diaries, as ordered earlier.  </P> <P> Responding a few hours later, Theodore B. Olson, Reagan's lawyer, said:  "Although the privilege for confidential presidential or executive branch  communications has been described by various courts in various ways, no court  has declared that the protections afforded the privilege . . . may be invoked  only by reciting the phrase 'executive privilege.' However, if this court  intended . . . that the privilege may only be invoked in that fashion, the  former President reaffirms that that was, indeed (his) intention."  </P> <P> So far, Reagan has claimed executive privilege only for his diaries. However,  Greene on Monday ordered Reagan to give videotaped testimony for use by the  defense in the Poindexter trial.  </P> <P> The judge gave Reagan's lawyers until Friday to decide if they wish to invoke  executive privilege concerning the testimony as well. It seems probable that  the former President will broaden his claim to cover his testimony, although  Olson declined to comment on his plans. Last week, Greene ordered Reagan to  surrender about 30 diary entries which the judge said were potentially useful  to Poindexter's defense. Poindexter's lawyers hope to use the papers to bolster  their claim that the retired rear admiral's actions were authorized by the  President.  </P> <P> At that time, Greene said he would reexamine the issue if Reagan claimed  executive privilege. The judge said that Reagan's lawyers and the Justice  Department would be given copies of Poindexter's memorandum stating how the  diaries fit into defense strategy. Previously, that memo was seen only by the  judge. Both Reagan's attorneys and the Justice Department will be allowed to  try to persuade the judge to reverse his order.  </P> <P> Quoting the standard set by the Supreme Court's decision in the 1974 case  involving Nixon's Watergate tapes, Greene said Reagan would be required to  comply with Poindexter's subpoena only if Poindexter's "need for the  information outweighs the claim of privilege."  </P> <P> The high court ruled 8 to 0 that Nixon had to comply with the special  prosecutor's subpoena for the White House tapes. The court's decision affirmed  that a President has a right to protect his personal communications, but that  the right is not absolute.  </P> <P> "The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated,  specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial," the court said.  </P></p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Campbell Soup to take Dollars 300m charge CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, yesterday said it would take after-tax charges of Dollars 300m, or Dollars 1.19 a share, to cover restructuring moves including closing two plants which together employ more than 1,300 people. The charges will be taken against 1993 second-quarter earnings. In the 1992 second quarter, to end-January, the company had after-tax earnings of Dollars 160.6m, or 64 cents a share. Campbell said the actions would allow the company to concentrate on core business and remain cost competitive. Mr David Johnson, president and chief executive, said: 'As we focus primarily on soup and biscuits - products which have the highest growth potential - we will phase out those businesses which sap management time and are not strategic.' The company will consolidate its frozen food operations by closing a plant in Maryland and another in Philadelphia. It will offer employment assistance packages to employees at those plants. It plans to sell several non-strategic businesses. Campbell recently acquired a 58 per cent controlling stake in Arnotts, the Australian cookie and cracker company, in a bitterly-fought takeover battle. Mr Johnson said the Arnotts stake would leave Campbell 'poised for expansion of our biscuit core competency in Asia'.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Metallgesellschaft - Other companies Tomorrow the troubled Frankfurt-based conglomerate will meet its bankers to spell out the extent of the liquidity difficulties arising from the futures trading activities of MG Corp, the group's US trading subsidiary. With gross debt for the group at DM8bn (Pounds 3.1bn), there are rumours in Frankfurt that Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new hard-hitting chief executive, will ask for a moratorium on debt repayment as a means of staving off insolvency. It may not go so far but the fact that the meeting has been brought forward from January 10 suggests that the problems are worse than originally expected.</p>

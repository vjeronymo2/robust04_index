			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK TO LOOK AT A LAW COVERING STATES OF UNDRESS  </P> <P> Burbank will never become the Naked City, if City Council members get their  way.  </P> <P> The City Council is scheduled to address undress in the city Tuesday when it  considers an ordinance that would make it illegal to appear nude in public --  for any reason.  </P> <P> Under existing city law, Burbank can only prohibit public nudity or disrobing  that is sexual in nature. With people who walk nude down the street, sunbathe  in parks or "streak," city police can do little more than ask them to put on  proper attire.  </P> <P> Assistant City Atty. Terry B. Stevenson said the ordinance was partially  inspired by a streaker who ran naked down an alley late last year. Although  police arrested the man, they were unable to file charges because he had not  committed a crime, Stevenson said.  </P> <P> "He hadn't broken any law so the police had to let him go," Stevenson said.  "Situations like this had happened at times in the past, so we wanted to get  something on the lawbooks before it became a real problem.  </P> <P> "Otherwise, a colony of nudists could show up one day at McCambridge Park and  there would not be anything we could do about it."  </P> <P> Police said four streakers were arrested last year. "These folks were not  psycho or anything, and it was very frustrating for our officers when they saw  someone walking nude down the street and they couldn't do anything," said Capt.  James Gibson.  </P> <P> However, police say there's no trend toward nudity in Burbank. "It's not like  there's an epidemic," said Police Chief Glen Bell.  </P> <P> State law prevents indecent exposure or lewd conduct with sexual intent, and a  city ordinance requires waiters and waitresses to wear clothes while serving  customers. These laws also regulate live nude shows of a sexual nature.  </P> <P> If approved by the council, the law would become effective March 10. The  maximum penalty for the misdemeanor offense would be a $1,000 fine or six  months in county jail -- clothed, of course.  </P></p>

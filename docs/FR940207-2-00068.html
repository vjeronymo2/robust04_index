			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rate proposal offers considerable discretion in the replacement budget area. This includes the time period over which the expenditure needs to be made and the necessity of certain expenditures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The justification for the replacement and addition program is that the P&hyph;DP is over 50 years old and is in the process of a major refurbishment and replacement program. A large portion of the system is deteriorating to the point where safe and continued operation to all customers is jeopardized. The Engineering Ten-Year Plan analyzes the activities with considerable scrutiny over a period of 10 years and will be updated annually. While developing the Engineering Ten-Year Plan, Western deferred certain replacement and addition activities until a later date. Overall, the Engineering Ten-Year Plan resulted in a refurbishment and replacement program that will improve reliability, improve personnel safety, increase capacity, and replace out-of-date equipment that cannot be repaired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The replacement expenditures after the 5-year evaluation period do not reflect the replacements scheduled during the evaluation period. As a result, the PRS may include costs for replacements during the study period which will actually be replaced during the evaluation period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The replacement study projects replacements after the 5-year evaluation period based on the total plant investment as of FY 1991. Projections during the cost evaluation period (FY 1994&hyph;98) are based on the replacements indicated in the Engineering Ten-Year Plan. Replacements projected during the cost evaluation period will not be duplicated in out years, as long as the replacement is made relatively close to the end of the equipment's service life. The replacement study is based on historic experience and service lives of each type of equipment and has proved to be an effective tool for projections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It appears to the customer that Western is, in effect, double covering future replacement costs by including the $4.3 million annual replacements estimate, notwithstanding the Engineering Ten-Year Plan, which includes a full planning horizon 5 years beyond the 5-year ratesetting period. The $4.3 million annual replacements projection should be eliminated from this rate before filing with FERC, in reliance upon the Engineering Ten-Year Plan process and as evidence of Western's full-faith commitment with its customers to the Engineering Ten-Year Plan concept.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western has the perfect opportunity here to submit this rate to FERC without the $4.3 million estimate on replacements in the future with the Engineering Ten-Year Plan as the appropriate rationale for any deviation from DOE Order No. RA 6120.2 that FERC might consider it to be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While it is the general intent of DOE Order No. RA 6120.2 that Western include allowances for replacements for the entire study period of the PRS, DOE Order No. RA 6120.2 also permits a deviation from this requirement in paragraph 1. It is recommended that Western adopt any reasonable approach to mitigate this large increase. FERC addressed the matter of replacements in Docket EF89&hyph;5041&hyph;000. While we may not necessarily agree with the FERC order in its entirety, we believe that Western has the ability to deviate from the requirements of DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. Therefore, Western should omit from its proposed PRS the currently proposed allowances for replacements in the amount of $217 million ($4.3 million per year) for years 1998&hyph;2047. The use of an average amount has helped minimize the rate impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the recent past, FERC has ruled on a P&hyph;DP rate adjustment that the PRS should show that revenue produced by the provisional P&hyph;DP rates is adequate to pay all of the project's annual costs, repay investment with interest of the project, and provide for payment of replacement costs over the life of the project. Docket No. EF 89&hyph;5041&hyph;000 states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Nevertheless, WAPA has failed to recognize replacement costs that will be incurred between 1993 and 2042. The draft PRS that WAPA provided in response to staff's request provides an indication of the extent of these replacements and their considerable costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WAPA has neither complied with Order No. RA 6120.2 nor asserted any basis upon which the Commission could find WAPA's interim rates ``consistent with sound business principles'' or ``sufficient to recover the costs of producing and transmitting electric energy . . . .'' Under these circumstances, the Commission will exercise its delegated authority to remand the interim Parker-Davis rates and to direct WAPA either to: 1) file substitute rates and accompanying documents in accordance with the terms of this order; or 2) alternatively, refile its proposed rates and clearly demonstrate that the omission of the replacement costs discussed herein from the proposed rates and the PRS has been ``specifically approved by the Secretary of Energy, authorized by statute, or identified and explained in a transmittal memorandum or in a footnote to the reports.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, Western cannot omit the allowances for replacements in the amount of $217 million ($4.3 million per year) for years 1998&hyph;2047. The use of an average amount has substantially mitigated much of the impact on rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

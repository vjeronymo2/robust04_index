			<p>BFN     [Text] Implementing the Prime Minister's directive, the  Ministry of Interior instructed police in localities to conduct  a survey on the number of cars imported illegally into the  country, including those imported without complying with the set  procedures.    According to a recent survey, 28 provinces and  municipalities  have imported 1,512 cars of various types without meeting the  set procedure requirements, mostly in Song Be, Tay Ninh, Dong  Nai, Vinh Long, Dong Thap, Binh Thuan, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City,  Long An, Lam Dong, and Ninh Thuan Provinces.    Quang Ninh and Gia Lai Provinces reported that they did not  register any new cars. A recent investigation found, however,  that Quang Ninh Province registered four cars with fake customs  clearance documents while the Pleiku City police of Gia Lai  Province coordinated with the Quang Ngai provincial police to  register 180 cars and motorcycles using fake customs documents.</p>

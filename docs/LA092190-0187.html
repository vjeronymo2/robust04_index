			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NBA NOTES;  </P> <P> INDICTED WINGATE WILL NOT RETURN TO SPURS  </P> <P> San Antonio Spurs officials said today that guard David Wingate will not be  back with the team after his indictment on rape charges in Maryland.  </P> <P> Wingate remains free on a $10,000 bond; a trial is expected in about four  months.  </P> <P> "The Spurs will honor our obligations -- if any -- to David Wingate," team  owner Red McCombs said in a statement, "but at this time there are no plans for  David being a part of our team."  </P> <P> McCombs said Wingate is likely to be spending his "primary energies" defending  himself against the allegations.  </P> <P> "We appreciate David's contributions to the Spurs last season and we have  sympathy for him and all others connected to the various allegations," the  statement said.  </P> <P> Wingate has been unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Forward John (Hot Rod) Williams said he will decide before the weekend is over  whether he will be playing the 1990-91 season with the Seattle SuperSonics or  Cleveland Cavaliers -- even if it means playing the 1991-92 season in  Minneapolis.  </P> <P> "In the next 48 hours, I'll make my decision," Williams said late Thursday  night.  </P> <P> Williams, 28, would be the major component of a deal that would send Xavier  McDaniel and Nate McMillan from the Sonics to the Cavs, while Cleveland would  send Williams and an undisclosed sum of money to Seattle.  </P> <P> "The Cavaliers have already told me if I don't accept this deal they're going  to trade me to Minnesota next year," Williams said. "But if that's what  happens, that's OK. . . . Nobody is going to tell me what to do."  </P> <P> Denver Nuggets point guard Michael Adams has agreed to terms of a  multimillion-dollar, five-year contract extension.  </P> <P> Adams had one year remaining on a contract that was to pay him $400,000 this  season. He would have been an unrestricted free agent at its conclusion.  </P> <P> Negotiations are not going as smoothly with Chris Jackson, the Nuggets' top  draft choice. Jackson is "tired of waiting" for the club to make a deal, his  agent, Eddie Miller, said.  </P></p>

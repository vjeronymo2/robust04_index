			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ARCADIA;  </P> <P> BOARD WON'T BACK GUN BAN  </P> <P> The school board has decided by a 3-2 vote not to back a resolution supporting  nationwide efforts to ban semiautomatic assault weapons.  </P> <P> A majority of board members believe that it would be inappropriate for the  board to take a position on a general issue such as a weapons ban, said Supt.  Stephen Goldstone.  </P> <P> In the past, board resolutions have dealt specifically with education-related  matters, Goldstone said, and board members did not want to dilute the weight of  any school-related resolutions they may adopt in the future.  </P> <P> The gun-ban resolution had been proposed at a March 6 board meeting in response  to a tragedy in January when a man with an assault rifle sprayed a Stockton  schoolyard with gunfire. He killed five children and wounded 29 others before  shooting and killing himself.  </P> <P> Since then, legislatures at all levels have been pushing to ban assault  weapons. In the San Gabriel Valley, the South El Monte City Council voted to  ban assault weapons in March.  </P></p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt preoccupied with Bayer's prospects INDIVIDUAL situations took the lead on a number of bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT heard talk that Bayer might cut its DM13 dividend for 1991 and the shares dropped DM6.10, or 2 per cent, to DM294.20. Hoechst and BASF followed with falls of DM3 to DM248, and DM1.60 to DM245 respectively. Mr Edgar Bennischeck, head of equity dealing at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that Bayer had been dealer-led this week, moving from hopes of a scrip issue on Monday, through Tuesday's shift from overweight to underweight by Deutsche Bank Research. Julius Bar likes Bayer for its pharmaceuticals content, sees a rise in earnings per share this year, and has it on an estimated DVFA p/e of just over 10, compared with over 12 for BASF and over 11 for Hoechst. The DAX index closed 2.47 higher at 1,681.39 after a 3.15 rise to 687.24 for the FAZ at midsession. Volume rose from DM5.8bn to DM6bn, Thyssen figuring among active stocks as it rose DM4.10 to DM226.40 on Thyssen Stahl's first product price rise since April 1990. Elsewhere Metallgesellschaft's DM6.30 drop to DM399 left it DM27.80 down this week. On Tuesday, it reported an earnings drop from DM23.50 to DM10.30 a share, a shock in spite of progressively bearish indications over the past 12 months. MILAN had a patchy day as traders completed their position squaring ahead of the close of the account today. Residual selling linked to the previous day's options expiry also had a depressing effect. The Comit index fell 4.38 to 533.95 in turnover estimated at around L110bn, unchanged from Thursday's higher-than-expected level. Banks fell 1.25 per cent as investors started to raise cash ahead of the large Dollars 1.5bn San Paolo share offering, details of which emerged yesterday. The offering of 125m ordinary shares in San Paolo, 20 per cent of its capital, is to take place between March 16 and March 20, lead managed by Mediobanca, with SG Warburg and Hambros joint leads in the UK. The shares are expected to be attractively priced between L12,000 and L14,000. Dealers expected the sector to weaken further. Among the larger stocks, Banca Commerciale Italiana lost L55 to L3,973 and Credito Italiano fell L33 to L2,115. Credito Varesino closed L420 or 7.6 per cent down at L5,080 following the previous day's news that it would be incorporated by its parent Banca Popolare di Bergamo. The insurance sector was also weak, with the exception of Alleanza, which rose L10 to L13,000 in good volume in anticipation of good results for 1991. Elsewhere, the retailer Rinascente eased L153 to L6,245 as the recent upward revisions of its investment plans made investors nervous. PARIS ended near the top of its recent trading range, the CAC-40 index closing 14.87 up at 1,876.47 in spite of the early fall on Wall Street. Turnover was reasonable at FFr2.3bn. L'Air Liquide was in demand on rumours of big buyers ranging from a UK broker to a Scottish institution wanting 1 per cent of the company. However, some dealers attributed the share's FFr25 or 3.6 per cent rise to FFr724 to the covering of a large short position. The day's biggest gainer was Worms et Cie which gained FFr20 or 5.6 per cent to FFr378 as several large blocs were put through the market. AMSTERDAM was supported by a stronger dollar although early gains were lost when Wall Street opened lower. The CBS Tendency Index closed up 0.2 at 122.10. Unilever's decision to move out of animal feeds took the shares up by Fl 1.70 to Fl 187.20. Food companies showed year highs, although Wessanen's Fl 1.50 rise to Fl 88.20 was partly attributable to the strong dollar. Hagemeyer, the trading group, rose Fl 2.80 or 2 per cent, to Fl 141.00 on expectations of good full-year results due next Thursday. DSM, the chemicals group, declined Fl 2.50 or 2.3 per cent to Fl 103.60. MADRID had already discounted January's CPI figure of 1.5 per cent when trading opened and there was little follow-through later in the day. The general index closed down 0.76 at 258.75. Volume was generally more active with a large put-through of 5m shares in Telefonica coming in the last minutes of trading: it closed up Pta5 at Pta1,240. Tabacalera was well traded, and popular with foreign investors: it climbed Pta90 to Pta6,080. Utilities enjoyed generally strong volume, while selling of bank shares late in the day depressed the sector. STOCKHOLM continued its slide in thin trade, led by Ericsson and Astra. Ericsson B slipped another SKr3 to SKr111 following Tuesday's results from the telecommunications group, which pointed to a gloomy outlook for 1992. Astra B fell SKr5 to SKr590, following talk in London that it might, after all, be a potential bidder for Fisons. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 5.1 to 948.5. Aga B closed unchanged at SKr308, and Gullspang B by SKr4 to SKr80 on Wednesday's news of a merger between Gullspang, an electricity producer, and the Aga's power generation subsidiary, Uddeholm. ISTANBUL rallied after the government raised the witholding tax on treasury bills by 5 percentage points to 15 per cent. The 75-share index closed up 127.03, or 3 per cent, to 4,393.65.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 13  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm      2 pm     3 pm     close 1137.47  1138.42  1137.79  1137.42  1138.03  *1138.71  1137.71  1136.68  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Day's High  1139.13    Day's Low  1136.68  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Feb 12    Feb 11    Feb 10    Feb 7     Feb 6    1136.12   1137.74   1137.68   1137.10   1138.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). *Indicative.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

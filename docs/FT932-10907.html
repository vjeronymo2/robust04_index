			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fiat chief sees profit of L500bn for year FIAT, Italy's biggest private company, will report net profits of about L500bn (Dollars 340m) for 1992, according to Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, The news came against figures which showed sales of new cars in Italy had plunged by 28.1 per cent in April, one of the steepest declines on record. The sales fall, which follows a drop of almost 21 per cent in March, is likely to prompt a lowering in expectations for Fiat earnings for this year and will fuel tensions between the group and Japanese importers, notably Nissan, which have been raising their market shares. Earlier this year, Mr Agnelli described the year ahead as being 'critical' for the Fiat group. Mr Agnelli gave no indication of Fiat's dividend, to be revealed, along with official earnings figures, after a board meeting on May 31. In 1991, net profits after minority interests dropped by more than 30 per cent to L1,114bn while the dividend was slashed by 37 per cent to L230 for each ordinary share. In spite of the poor outlook, Fiat's share price has been rising strongly on speculative buying based on rumours of an alliance with Renault of France. Both companies have consistently denied the rumours.</p>

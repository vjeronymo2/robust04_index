			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] At last, the secessionist gang fled Aden,  thinking that it has left behind it citizens and soldiers as a  sacrifice for its salvation from the people's grip. However,  the citizens in Aden, and in all adjacent villages and towns,  should know that the army of unity does not target citizens and  that citizens will not be harmed. This is because the forces of  unity protect unity and care for the safety of citizens, who are  the objective of unity and whose happiness is sought.    Likewise, misled soldiers and officers should know they will  receive much appreciation and respect once they join the forces  of legitimacy and stand with them in the trench to defend unity.    Yes, everyone knows this. It has been proven by experience  and events. It was confirmed by previous cases in al-Dali',  [word indistinct], Shabwah, Abyan, Lahij, Bayhan, and other  places. Citizens were safe and enjoyed care and respect.    Every soldier and officer who joined legitimacy enjoyed the  care and appreciation of all commanders in the forces of  legitimacy and all the noncommissioned officers, officers, and  soldiers of the army of unity. This is because they are  brothers in arms, comrades in struggle, the shield of the  homeland, and the protectors of Yemen. The entire Armed Forces  should remain as such, regardless of the attempts made by the  enemies of Yemen.    Thus, we can say that the citizens who welcomed and  cooperated with the forces of legitimacy, as well as the  officers, soldiers, and noncommissioned officers who joined  these forces, have infused new blood into the legitimate forces.  They have made an important contribution to their advance and  their victories. Hence, it is clear to everyone that the gang  of secession and apostasy, which left behind citizens, soldiers,  and officers as a sacrifice for its salvation from the people's  wrath, is demonstrating futile thinking and false delusions.  This is because the people's grip will continue to chase the  gang wherever it goes, follow it into any den in which it hides,  and remove it from any cave to which it may resort. [passage  omitted]    Once again we say: Blessed be the steps of the forces of  unity pounding the last strongholds of apostasy. Blessed be the  hands of the armies of legitimacy uprooting the dens of  secessionists. Welcome to the sons of the Armed Forces who were  misled by the renegade ones. Welcome to the brothers joining  the Armed Forces and the unionists who are biased toward both  the trench of legitimacy and the forces of the people and unity.  Peace to all citizens in Aden and in all the villages and towns  lying on the road of the victorious and trustworthy unionist  march.    These citizens will be safe as long as they support justice  and legitimacy. They will also be dignified and respected  everywhere and always, especially since they are the objective  and [word indistinct] of unity. Unity was achieved for them and  with their support. This unity will remain. It is for the sake  of these citizens and for their pride that the forces of unity  are marching against the gangs of apostasy. It is also for the  salvation of these citizens that the struggle is continuing  against the gangs of secession. Let the citizen be confident of  victory [words indistinct] safety. This is because the people's  forces are for the people and for their protection. The armies  of unity care for the masses of unity throughout great Yemen.</p>

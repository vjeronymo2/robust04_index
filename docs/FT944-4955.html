			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: CRT ahead sharply to Pounds 1.29m CRT Group, the training and recruitment group which bought Systems Resources in August, lifted pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 472,000 to Pounds 1.29m in the six months to October 31. The shares eased 2p to 82p. Operating profits advanced to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.64m) after a Pounds 220,000 contribution from the acquisition. Last year's figure, however, included losses of Pounds 635,000 from the discontinued Doctus Consulting Europe, now sold to management. Group turnover grew 30 per cent to Pounds 29.2m (Pounds 22.4m) including Pounds 5.2m from Systems Resources. In recruitment, turnover rose 90 per cent to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 9.75m) and operating profits more than doubled to Pounds 964,000 (Pounds 467,000). Stripping out the effect of the acquisition, which made a two-month contribution, the rises in turnover and operating profits were 37 and 59 per cent respectively. In training, turnover grew to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 9.46m) but operating profits fell to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.85m). Explaining the fall, Mr Karl Chapman, group chief executive, cited increased weighting to students completing courses in the second half, development of the Link Training Multimedia Learning Centre programme in schools, and investment in Link and Pitman. The group's second-half bias would be more pronounced this year, Mr Chapman said, because of the acquisition, the general improvement in the recruitment market and continuing weighting of that market to the second six months. There was a Pounds 300,000 integration and restructuring charge, and Mr Chapman said the total charge would not exceed Pounds 650,000 for the year. Earnings rose to 1.42p (0.56p) per share and the interim dividend is raised to 0.85p (0.75p).</p>

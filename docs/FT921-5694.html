			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sale of 'core business' marks end of mistimed break-up bid BOWATER'S purchase of DRG Packaging for Pounds 212m closes the final chapter on one of the most bitterly contested and mistimed of the break-up bids which dominated the 1980s. Mr Roland Franklin, a former associate of Sir James Goldsmith, put together a consortium of wealthy investors in 1989 to pay Pounds 697m for DRG, the Bristol-based paper and packaging group, which included brand names such as Sellotape and Basildon Bond stationery. Mr Franklin said he intended to unlock the unrealised value of DRG by disposing of peripheral activities and slimming it down to a core packaging business. However, the debt incurred was taken on just before the onset of the recession which slowed the rate of disposals. Yesterday's sale brought the declared total realised by disposals to about Pounds 622m, which is well short of the purchase price plus financing costs. Mr Franklin's son, Mr Martin Franklin, said yesterday that the privately-owned consortium, Pembridge Investments, had not published all of its disposals, but admitted: 'This is a deal which was not exciting from our shareholders' point of view.' Last year Pembridge was refinanced and control of the consortium went to Societe de Banque Thomson, the French finance house led by Mr Jean-Francois Henin. Pembridge originally raised Pounds 130m from 18 equity investors. The biggest stake was Pounds 60m from Mr Ted Field, the US millionaire. Four of the investors, including Mr Field, backed Sir James's unsuccessful attempt to break up BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group. Mr Roland Franklin's own company, Pembridge Associates, contributed Pounds 31m. Mr Franklin paid almost 15 times DRG's last audited earnings. After the takeover, DRG's stationery group, which included Basildon Bond, Lion and Challenge, was sold to Biber Holding, a Swiss company, for an undisclosed sum in 1990. Last year Sellotape, Britain's best-selling adhesive tape, was bought by a team of French industrialists, backed by French bankers, for about Pounds 70m. DRG Packaging, which was sold yesterday, had originally been identified by Pembridge as the core business on which it intended to focus. A specialist in plastic packaging, it supplies the medical packaging market and is a leading supplier of rigid plastic food containers in the UK. Last year it made operating profits of Pounds 18.7m. Mr Martin Franklin said that after yesterday's sale, Pembridge retained the Strachan Henshaw machinery business in the UK, which has an annual turnover of Pounds 15m; some Canadian holdings in paper converting and packaging, which he said were worth about Pounds 20m; and property holdings, worth an estimated Pounds 30m.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Blair will warn of election danger Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, will warn the party's national executive committee today that the party is still at risk of losing the next general election in spite of its strong lead in the opinion polls. Highlighting the dangers of complacency, he will point to Labour's declining lead in the ICM poll published in today's Guardian newspaper which shows what may be the start of a Conservative recovery. Labour support has fallen from 55 per cent to 51 per cent since the last poll early last month while Conservative support has risen from 23 per cent to 27 per cent. The figures give Labour more than half the vote, and a massive 24-point lead over the government which would translate into a substantial Commons majority. However, ICM's adjusted figures, which take account of special factors, put Labour only 12 percentage points ahead on 45 per cent of the vote compared with 33 per cent for the Conservatives. Mr Blair will tell the committee that the figures support private research carried out for the party which suggests that much of Labour's support may not be as solid as some had hoped. He is worried that many activists underestimate the extent to which the improving economy may increase Tory support. The poll puts the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent, down from 19 per cent. Yet the party remains steady on 17 per cent on the basis of the adjusted figures.</p>

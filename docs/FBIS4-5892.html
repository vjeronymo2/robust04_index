			<p>BFN     [Text] Jayapura, April 15 (ANTARA) -- Papua New Guinea  (PNG) finally agreed to allow an Indonesian Government-designate  land survey team to clearly define the borders dividing the two  countries in preparation for the construction of lighthouses in  the island's coasts.    "Indonesia will build two lighthouses in the south and north  coastal areas of the island to prevent border violations with  PNG usually committed by local fishermen," head of Border  Affairs Department of the Jaya provincial administration M.D.  Lewar said Thursday.    The plan was discussed during the border liaison meeting in  1993 and was agreed in the first round of the meeting in March  21 to 23, 1994 held in Lorengau, capital city of PNG's province  of Manus, he said.    According to the Lorengau's agreement, the lighthouse in the  northern coastal area will be built in the border of Skouw  village, Jayapura regency and Wutung village, PNG's province of  Sandaun, while the lighthouse in the south will be built in the  borders of Irian Jaya's regency of Merauke and western province  of PNG.    Apart from building lighthouses, Indonesia will also build  five guard-houses as support facilities for the lighthouses,  especially in th remote areas, he said.    Lewar expressed hopes that with the lighthouses, fishermen  from Irian Jaya and PNG would better know which water they are  fishing.</p>

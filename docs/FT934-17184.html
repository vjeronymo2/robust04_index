			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Peru rebel chief 'seeks peace deal' MR Abimael Guzman, the jailed leader of the Maoist guerrilla group Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso), is offering to negotiate a peace accord with the Peruvian government, President Alberto Fujimori told the UN general assembly in New York yesterday. At a news conference after his address, Mr Fujimori showed reporters a hand-written letter which seemed to bear the signatures of Mr Guzman and his chief lieutenant, Ms Elena Iparraguirre, verified by their fingerprints. Seeming to abandon a long-maintained rejection of any political line but his own, Mr Guzman recognises Mr Fujimori as president and requests 'conversations which would lead to the conclusion of the war'. Thirteen years of conflict have cost 26,000 Peruvian lives and the equivalent of some Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14bn) in damage. The letter was written from the prison at the naval base at Callao, the port of Lima, where Mr Guzman and three other senior Shining Path people are serving life sentences. Mr Fujimori rejected any prospect of negotiating reductions in the leaders' sentences.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Bozidar Djokic, commander of </F> the Leskovac Corps, by R. Popovic; place and date not given:  "The Mistakes Must Not Be Repeated"]    [Text] [Popovic] General, was the youngest corps in the  Army of Yugoslavia [VJ], which you head, formed because of  experience in the last war, and what do you think as a fighter  and commanding officer about the applicability of that knowledge  in the everyday life of members of our armed forces?    [Djokic] The experiences in the last war certainly should be  appreciated; they can be used in training the men and the  commands, which does not mean that there will be a considerable  change in the general approach to training our armed forces.  That conflict on the space of the former Yugoslavia still  represents only one of the forms of military action typical of  civil war in which the initiative of individuals, small groups,  and units is prominent, which would not be the case should there  be aggression from outside. The Army of Yugoslavia must be able  to defend the country against an aggressor who is well-armed,  trained, and several times stronger. I think that the  experiences at the operational and strategic level are more  important than the "tactical experiences" gained in the war in  1991 and 1992; we learned through them that units at the front  cannot be commanded from a great distance and directly from the  Supreme Command. That is why at the beginning of the war,  wherever possible, temporary structures were formed which we  called operational groups. The commands of the operational  groups were made up of men who did not know each other well  enough, so that in the extreme case they were teams that had not  practiced together and frequently their results in direction and  command were poorer than results achieved by commands at the  formation level. We can no longer allow ourselves to make such a  mistake.    [Popovic] The formation of new units in the VJ is not the  only innovation in the process of transformation which has  spread through all the pores of military life. How do you look  on that process?    [Djokic] The transformation has two basic spheres. First,  the  material sphere, which pertains above all to changes in  organization and military structure taking place without major  hindrances; they soon will be completed, successfully I hope. In  the second sphere, the nonmaterial, political, and moral sphere,  a transformation is also taking place and has already been given  its framework, which is now clear to the immense majority of  members of the Army of Yugoslavia. That part of the  transformation requires changes in people's behavior, in the way  they think, in the way they regard their obligations and tasks.  That is the part that involves depoliticization of the armed  forces and professionalization of its members. It is quite  expensive and requires much more effort than transformation of  organization and military structure. We have had very important  results in this area, which shows that our people have already  cast off the burden of earlier political commitments, along with  many unnecessary tasks, so that now we can commit ourselves more  successfully and resolutely to modernization of the armed forces  and to professionalization, which should not be conceived as a  completely new phenomenon. Even earlier, in the JNA [Yugoslav  People's Army], we had active officers who were part of an army  which was highly professional. Now, we are increasing the number  of people who will defend the country professionally, including  in our ranks soldiers under contract, who already make up a  sizable portion of members of the Army of Yugoslavia.    [Popovic] Now that you are already talking about soldiers  under contract, how really professional are they?    [Djokic] Certain time is needed for soldiers under contract  to be turned into professionals, masters of the art of war. So  far, we have not had the time to achieve that result through the  process of training and screening of personnel. These are only  the initial steps, which in military police units, the  paratroopers, and other special-purpose units have already  produced the first contours of our professional soldier. In  other units, that process is going somewhat more slowly, and  minor mistakes have also been made. For example, assigning  soldiers under contract from border areas to border units  carries a high risk that individuals will abuse their position  and the duties they perform. The difficult conditions under  which we are living now make such doubts increasingly realistic.  In future, then, the number of soldiers under contract will be  reduced to a reasonable number, and they will be replaced by  soldiers serving their regular required military service, from  whose ranks we will later recruit professional border guards. In  any case, it should be said that most of the soldiers under  contract have been performing their wartime duties very  competently, and we can confidently say of them that they are  real professionals.    [Popovic] You have mentioned the border, could you say  something more about the situation at the moment on the border  with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia?    [Djokic] For more than two years now, we have been securing  the border with Macedonia under very difficult material  conditions. Our border units are mainly housed in old and  abandoned schools, by contrast with certain other services on  the border, which have new buildings with steam heat and all  other conditions for an extremely comfortable life and work. A  large number of our border guards lived until recently in tents,  and even now we are using them to store certain supplies and to  perform some of our regular activities. This certainly makes it  more difficult for us to secure the national border. Thanks to  the exceptional efforts we made in the last three months, with  support of authorities in the opstinas of Vranje and Bujanovac  and even from the Health Ministry of the Republic of Serbia, we  now have several abandoned outpatient clinics which were built  in settlements near the border, which we are going to adapt and  use as watchtowers.    For the moment, we have no very serious problems concerning  border security. There are very few with bad intentions, but on  the other hand there are many who are trying to cross the border  to smuggle fuel. The numbers of those smugglers and the poorly  marked or unmarked border resulted in the recent incident which  the Macedonian news media exaggerated somewhat, although in the  estimation of our border personnel their patrol did cross onto  our territory, which is why it was stopped and taken to the  watchtower, and from there, after a brief routine conversation,  it was returned to their territory.    [Popovic] General, some of the units in your corps are being  manned from the reserves. Can you say something about the  response of military registrants to the call-up for exercises,  and in that same context about the influence of party activities?    [Djokic] We have given very high marks to the mobilizations  which we have carried out up to now as an indicator of the  readiness of units to perform special-purpose missions. In  recent months, it can be said without exaggeration that we have  recorded a considerable growth in the responsibility of members  of our war units and an increased reporting rate, which now  ranges between 80 and 90 percent of military registrants called  up. There has also been an increase in the response of recruits  to do required military service, so that there is less and less  need to replace peacetime personnel with military registrants,  so that they are being called up less and less often and serving  less time in wartime units.    As for party activity and the influence of parties or their  attempt to have an adverse effect on the call-up of military  registrants, I must say that there was quite a bit of that in  the past. Over the last year, that influence has almost ceased,  or is at least negligible. It seems to me that now everyone has  understood that defense of the country is the patriotic  obligation of citizens and that this cannot be contrary to the  program of any party.    [Popovic] You say that there has also been an increased  response of recruits in the units of your corps; do you have  precise figures, for example, on how recruits from those areas  are reporting to do required military service?    [Djokic] The response of conscripts from the territory of  the  Nis Military District and military sectors in the zone of  responsibility of the Leskovac Corps was higher than 100 percent  in the September induction period; that is because quite a few  volunteers reported to do their required military service  because they wanted to do it earlier. The response of conscripts  from other areas to our units is somewhat below that, more  precisely about 95 percent. Thanks to additional efforts of our  unit, we nevertheless exceeded the number required to man our  units. These percentages do not apply to conscripts of Skipetar  or Muslim nationality, who still are responding to the draft  either scantily or almost not at all.    [Popovic] It is well-known, General, that you train  conscripts according to the drafts of the new training  curricula. How have they been accepted in your units, and how  are you getting along in the general lack of money?    [Djokic] Experience so far has shown that those curricula  provide good conditions for training men and officers  successfully and quickly to perform the tasks assigned them.  Further practice will certainly point up a need for minor  corrections, which will contribute still more to their quality  and adapt them to the real needs of units.    The shortage of supplies and funds has been adversely  affecting the process of combat training insofar as we are  unable to continuously renew certain expendable supplies such  as, for example, sources of electric power, for which fresh  financial resources are always needed. In no case can the  shortage of money stop the training process.    [Popovic] An unavoidable question in that connection is how  much the lack of money affects the soldier's standard of living?    [Djokic] We share the fate of all members of the Army of  Yugoslavia, and, as far as I know, most of our people. It is  hard to say it, but for several months we have been feeding the  soldiers only canned food. Whatever efforts we made, we were  altogether unable to buy fresh meat. Now, we have nevertheless  found some sources of our own for the supply of meat, fruit, and  vegetables, because last summer and fall we sent some of our  personnel to harvest crops in the work organization "Delises,"  and we also offered help to "Porecje" in Vucje. Now, we are  getting fresh fruit and vegetables from their coolers as we need  them. Thanks to cooperation with "Mesokombinat," we have  replenished our facilities for fattening hogs. We have also  gotten feed, and we will have larger quantities of fresh meat in  the spring, through an arrangement that is mutually satisfactory  and advantageous.    [Popovic] Are the officers also in a better position?    [Djokic] When it comes to the standard of living of  officers,  the situation is still more serious. Regardless of the efforts  we have made to provide winter supplies and fuel at more  favorable prices, some of the officers still have not managed to  prepare for the coming winter. Those officers and their families  who came to our units without anything from the secessionist  republics are in the most difficult situation. At the moment, we  have more than 260 families who do not even have housing.    [Popovic] In these confusing times, General, we very often  forget those who were our associates until recently. How are  "your" pensioners living, and how are they getting along?    [Djokic] We have not forgotten them. Nor have we forgotten  the disabled persons and survivors of those who were killed in  the last war. We provided winter supplies and fuel both for  ourselves and also for them. We delivered fuel right to the door  of disabled persons. Insofar as the law, and, of course, our own  capabilities, allow, we are also providing financial assistance,  but all of that, unfortunately, is less than modest. At this  point, it is difficult for everyone, but pensioners who were  awarded a well-deserved pension during this last year are in a  particularly unenviable position if they still have not managed  to get their bearings and find a way to supplement their small  pensions with any other sources of income.    [Popovic] There was a long wait for adoption of the new law  on the VJ. Has any significant change occurred since its  adoption?    [Djokic] We are inclined to justify all manner of things by  looking for an excuse even in the absence of a regulation so  that we would have a respite and justification for certain  oversights that certainly should not have occurred. The new law  has now created all the preconditions to rightly require greater  accountability not only of individuals in the Army, but also of  structures outside the VJ, which are also responsible for  defense of this country. Because, as I have said, we have been  forced into a difficult material situation, we are greatly  restricted in performing our obligations, which does not mean  that we are not where we ought to be and that our people are not  ready to perform their missions which the homeland expects of  them. The measures which are now being taken to straighten out  the situation with personnel are bringing about conditions for  full successful performance of all tasks assigned to our units.  This is a job on which up to now we have been rather sluggish,  slow, irresolute, and inconsistent. Now that the law has been  adopted, we need to adopt as soon as possible other regulations  and complete the process of straightening out the personnel  problems of units. The time in which we trained obedient  operatives is behind us. We must bring to the leadership of our  units and institutions brave officers who have initiative of  their own, who are ready to take a risk and complete their part  of the job, assuming full responsibility for what they have  done. The Law on the Army offers us that opportunity. If we take  advantage of it, each of us will precisely know and have his own  obligations and his own rights.    [Popovic] Will the incisions made in personnel policy leave  us without a bureaucracy or without field officers?    [Djokic] The bureaucracy is a product of the society in  which  we live. Just as it multiplied in society at large, so it has  also found fertile ground in the Army. During this time, we have  had numerous and cumbersome commands with many departments and  staff officers who were always thinking up new jobs for new  departments and new staff officers. We have had filing cabinets  full of all kinds of analyses and studies which never did anyone  any good. Because of the financial conditions we have been  facing, in the course of just a few restructurings we have made  a radical turnaround and considerably reduced that structure for  direction and command. I have the impression that at the same  time we have not reduced the amount of work as much as we have  the number of people, so that now we have a situation where some  essential staff officers are really burdened and cannot manage  to do all the work.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / ABB enters robot venture with Renault ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, yesterday strengthened its position in the market for industrial robots, by agreeing to acquire the robotics operations of Renault and form a joint venture in automated vehicle assembly with the French car group. The two companies said the 50-50 venture would employ about 290 people and have annual sales of about Dollars 80m. After the acquisition of Renault's robotic operations, ABB's French robotic operations will have annual sales of about Dollars 60m and employ about 200 people. Mr Stelio Demark, managing director of ABB Robotics, said that the deals with Renault were a central element in the company's strategy of shifting from a product supplier to a partner of industrial groups in the design and manufacture of automated systems. He said that the joint venture, which will centre on 'body in white' activities - where cars are assembled and welded together - would give ABB access to Renault's production line expertise and enable it to offer higher value-added products and services. The proposals, which require final approval by Renault employees, would give ABB its first joint venture project with a carmaker, the biggest market for robotics, and its first direct participation in the assembly stage of the production line. Mr Demark said that prices for industrial robots had fallen by between 25 and 30 per cent over the past few years, prompting the Renault sale. Renault's robotics operation, the largest in France, accounts for about 12 per cent of total sales of FFr1.4bn (Dollars 238m) from its automation division. The French group will retain management control of the separate joint venture for at least two years. According to Mr Demark, the market for industrial robots has strong growth potential, in spite of the fall in prices. He said that while in Japan there are 25 robots for every 1,000 manufacturing workers, the ratio is lower in Europe: in France, there are three robots per 1,000 workers. ABB estimates that it has about 20 per cent of the world market for robots with more than 33,000 currently in operation. Last year, ABB's robot division achieved sales of about Dollars 350m. ABB has worked with Renault on several automation projects, including the Twingo and Clio cars. It also supplies Volvo, with which Renault is planning to merge.</p>

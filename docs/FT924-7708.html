			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt continues to rise as sentiment improves A GROWING consensus that German equities had discounted a poor earnings outlook for 1992-93 lifted Frankfurt yesterday, while lower interest rates fuelled Milan's rise, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT ended off yesterday's highs but its strength this week was interpreted as the start of a pre-Christmas rally. After a day's high of 1,557.77, the DAX index closed 13.15 better at 1,548.52, a rise of 4.1 per cent on the week. Turnover rose slightly to DM6.7bn from DM6.5bn. The market was led higher by car and engineering stocks which were seen as oversold. Daimler rose DM11.20 to FFr554, BMW added DM3.50 to DM505 and Volkswagen gained DM6.30 to DM282. Preussag added DM4 to DM344.50 and Metallgesellschaft put on DM5 to DM338. Siemens continued to be heavily traded after its annual results earlier this week, gaining DM6.20 to DM578.70. Among smaller stocks, Bremer Vulkan added DM3.20 or 4.6 per cent to DM73.30 on news that its aircraft technology unit had won a DM250m order. Veba dropped DM1.50 to DM343 on news of a 14.2 per cent fall in its nine-month group net profit. MILAN was boosted by the Bank of Italy's one-point cut in its discount rate late on Thursday, and by speculative buying in Fiat and Fiat-controlled companies. The Comit index rose 12.77 to 460.96 in turnover estimated at a heavy L400bn after L287.2bn. Traders said buying was dominated by mutual funds covering short positions on the final day of the November account or increasing their portfolio's equity. Fiat advanced L393 or 8.8 per cent to L4,850 and Ifi, the Agnelli family holding company, rose L745 or 8.2 per cent to L9,800 on continued speculation, despite repeated denials from the company that the group would soon announce the sale of one of its non-strategic subsidiaries. STOCKHOLM advanced after a series of money market operations by the central bank succeeded in bringing down domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 6.3 to 720.8, little changed on the week, in turnover of SKr527m after SKr573m. Atlas Copco B unrestricted shares rose SKr9 to SKr227 after its nine-month report came in line with expectations and the group forecast an improved full-year pre-tax profit. AMSTERDAM closed mixed as some blue-chips ran into profit-taking after recent gains, and a lower dollar undermined currency-sensitive stocks. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.3 lower at 104.8, but was 1.4 per cent up on the week. Royal Dutch slipped Fl 1.40 to Fl 146.30 and Philips, which announced a programme to save over Fl 200m a year in personnel costs, rose 30 cents to Fl 19.40. BRUSSELS closed mixed in moderate trading as a 3.1 per cent decline in Petrofina pushed the Bel-20 index down by 4.30 to 1,138.53. It was 0.4 per cent higher on the week. Petrofina fell BFr250 to BFr7,820. HELSINKI fell on higher domestic interest rates and on uncertainty over the outcome of labour market talks between union leaders and the government. The HEX index fell 19.1 to 793.6, down 0.8 per cent on the week. ZURICH ended a moderately active session lower as the market consolidated its recent rise. The SMI index failed to break above the 1,960 level and closed 19.4 down at 1,930.8, for a fall of 1.4 per cent on the week. Bearers shares in the cement producer Holderbank topped the actives list, losing SFr33 to SFr496. After the close, the company said it had placed 500,000 bearer shares with banks. MADRID's general index rose 2.29 to 202.66, up 1.8 per cent on the week, as lower-than-expected October inflation figures improved the general economic outlook and raised hopes of interest rate cuts.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- November 13                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open    10.30     11.00    12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1057.85  1060.27   1062.31  1063.29 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1116.44  1119.47   1119.31  1118.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00    14.00     15.00    Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1060.99  1060.42   1060.68  1059.26 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1118.01  1118.23   1117.32  1114.93  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Nov 12      Nov 11   Nov 10     Nov 9     Nov 6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1059.91   1045.16**  1054.50   1043.29   1038.28 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1120.89   1108.98**  1117.70   1108.00   1111.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1063.92 ; 200 - 1120.34 Low/day: 100 -  1057.49  200 -  1114.93  **Partial  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: The currency factor The Bank of England seems concerned that companies may have used devaluation to boost margins rather than increase overseas sales, and recent trade figures give some support to that idea. Such windfall profits gains might also be expected to have an impact on earnings. The art is knowing in which sectors it has been strongly felt when in aggregate the currency benefit seems modest. Brokers' estimates for the non-financial part of the FT-SE-A All-Share index show that currency gains account for about 3.5 per cent of total earnings and around 10 per cent of the increase over last year. Hedging of currency risk may mute the impact, but even in 1994 currency gains are likely to be modest. The aggregate numbers may be misleading. The utilities and stores sectors are almost entirely sterling-based. Some sectors, notably pharmaceuticals, are, by contrast, strongly affected. Still, overall for 1993, falling interest costs have had almost twice the impact on earnings, and are likely to be an even more important factor this year. Currency and interest bills will moderately flatter the earnings recovery, but the bulk of the 18-20 per cent rises estimated for 1993 will come from productivity gains as slack is taken up. While the economy will expand faster this year, earnings rises are likely to remain around 20 per cent, and will be more dependent on volume increases. With such a marked variation in currency and interest effects, it would be worth taking a close look at companies' 1993 report and accounts as they plop through the letter box over the next few weeks.</p>

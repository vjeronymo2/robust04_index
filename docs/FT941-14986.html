			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Footwear workers set for 2.2% rise Wages in footwear manufacturing are set to rise by 2.2 per cent in March, following an agreement between the British Footwear Manufacturers Federation and the KFAT footwear and clothing workers' union, Paul Cheeseright writes. The rise, announced yesterday, is in line with lower settlements. The Confederation of British Industry said that in the three months to November average pay rises among manufacturing companies were 2.2 per cent, compared with 3.9 per cent in the third quarter of 1992. Union members will be balloted on the deal. Mr David Lambert, union general president, said he doubted whether there could be further gains by negotiation. The rise, covering the 20,000 union members, will be influential in settlements for the rest of the industry. Pay levels have been set against the background of harsh competition for the industry, where employment has fallen by about 10 per cent over the last year. Retailers are threatening to buy from importers in order to persuade domestic manufacturers to hold down prices.</p>

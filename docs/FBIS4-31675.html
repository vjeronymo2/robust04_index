			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Partisan Townspeople Are Fighting </F> Against the Regular Serbian Army"]    [Text] Tuzla--They are professors, students, workers, and  farmers. They are all dressed in the same uniforms, their shirts  are usually "civilian," and they wear handknit  sweaters--probably made by their mothers or wives. Those Muslim  fighters want to return to their families as soon as possible.  Although they rarely talk about revenge, they reject any  negotiations that would take away their land and houses. The  commander of the Blue Helmets in Sarajevo, Andre Soubirou,  recently described the Muslim fighters as "an army of  townspeople, partisans," who are fighting against "Serbian  professional soldiers." "It is the armed populace, as Tito  envisioned and wanted it," stated a certain military member of  the UN Protection Forces.    Thirty-two-year-old Kemal Hodzic was a driver before the  outbreak of the war, and now he commands a company on Mount  Kocar, which lies southeast of Tuzla, where the Muslim units  carried out a lightning offensive. He is from Bratunac, a  village approximately 30 kilometers away, which was "cleansed"  by the Serbs in May 1992. His mother and father were murdered by  the Serbs, and his wife and 10-year-old daughter fled to Tuzla.  Soldier Rafa Dzufic is fighting on the first front line near  Tuzla, in the vicinity of the strategic corridor near Brcko. The  ruins of his house are only about 200 meters away; he returned  from Austria "to defend his family and relatives."  Twenty-nine-year-old Nadja Otici from Brcko can only observe the  fields and roofs of his birthplace from a distance. He does not  hide his feelings. The front line is at the end of a valley, and  for more than a year he has not had any news about his family.  Hakia Hodzik, likewise 29 years old, was an officer in the  former Yugoslav Army. Now he commands the First Muslim Brigade  on Mount Podrina, and he also conducted an offensive near  Kladanj. Like all the others, he is also a volunteer, who fled  from the valley along the Drina together with his fellow  townsmen before the Serbian ethnic cleansing. One of his  soldiers acknowledges: "We will fight to the last man. We want  our land back. We will stop only when the bank of the Drina is  ours again." The Drina marks the border between Bosnia and  Serbia, and all the Muslims have been driven out of the villages  that lie along the river. The area is now in Serbian hands, and  the self-styled republic of Srpska is not prepared to give it  back.    "We will not accept any diplomatic solution that will  dictate  to us that we have to give up our land," Kemal says. He  resolutely adds: "We will remain armed and we will fight." His  fellow fighters also agree with him; they reject the  politicians' attempts to persuade them to accept a "realistic"  solution. The commanders of the units in this area complain that  they do not have modern weaponry, with which they could have  saved many of their fighters' lives. They can only attack the  armored Serbian units with obsolete antitank shells. Farmers  usually bring them food and ammunition with teams of horses.    "Every four days we get a loaf of white bread, and otherwise  we only eat black bread," said a gaunt soldier who is no more  than 20 years old. He interrupted his studies during the Bosnian  war, but he hopes that he will someday become a machinery  engineer.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Duty of inquiry.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The loss corporation must determine that indebtedness that the loss corporation treats as qualified indebtedness, other than indebtedness to which paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section applies, has been owned for the requisite period by the beneficial owner who owns the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change. The loss corporation may rely on a statement, signed under penalties of perjury, by a beneficial owner regarding the amount of indebtedness the beneficial owner owns and the length of time that the beneficial owner has owned the indebtedness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ordinary course indebtedness.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), indebtedness arises in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business only if the indebtedness is incurred by the loss corporation in connection with the normal, usual, or customary conduct of business, determined without regard to whether the indebtedness funds ordinary or capital expenditures of the loss corporation. For example, indebtedness (other than indebtedness acquired for a principal purpose of being exchanged for stock) arises in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business if it is trade debt; a tax liability; a liability arising from a past or present employment relationship, a past or present business relationship with a supplier, customer, or competitor of the loss corporation, a tort, a breach of warranty, or a breach of statutory duty; or indebtedness incurred to pay an expense deductible under section 162 or included in the cost of goods sold. A claim that arises upon the rejection of a burdensome contract or lease pursuant to the title 11 or similar case is treated as arising in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business if the contract or lease so arose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of certain indebtedness as continuously owned by the same owner <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a loss corporation may treat indebtedness as always having been owned by the beneficial owner of the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change if the beneficial owner is not, immediately after the ownership change, either a 5-percent shareholder or an entity through which a 5-percent shareholder owns an indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation (a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5-percent entity <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). This paragraph (d)(3)(i) does not apply to indebtedness beneficially owned by a person whose participation in formulating a plan of reorganization makes evident to the loss corporation (whether or not the loss corporation had previous knowledge) that the person has not owned the indebtedness for the requisite period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Operating rules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section: (A) If a loss corporation has actual knowledge of a coordinated acquisition of its indebtedness by a group of persons, through a formal or informal understanding among themselves, for a principal purpose of exchanging the indebtedness for stock, the indebtedness (and any stock received in exchange therefor) is treated as owned by an entity. A principal element in determining if an understanding exists among members of a group is whether the investment decision of each member is based upon the investment decision of one or more other members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If the loss corporation has actual knowledge regarding stock ownership described in &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(k)(2), the loss corporation must take that ownership into account in determining which beneficial owners of indebtedness are, immediately after the ownership change, 5-percent shareholders or 5-percent entities. The loss corporation is not required to take into account an ownership interest described in &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(k)(4) unless the loss corporation has actual knowledge of the ownership interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5-percent shareholder <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  includes any person who is a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation within the meaning of &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(g), without regard to the option attribution rules of section 382(l)(3)(A) or &sect;1.382&hyph;4(d) (or, if applicable, &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(h)(4)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to indebtedness if the loss corporation has actual knowledge immediately after the ownership change that the exercise of an option to acquire or dispose of stock of the loss corporation would cause the beneficial owner of the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change to be, after the ownership change, either a 5-percent shareholder or a 5-percent entity. An interest that is treated as an option under &sect;1.382&hyph;4(d)(9) (or &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(h)(4)(v) if applicable) is treated as an option for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Portugal launches Ecu750m global issue Portugal yesterday launched the first ever global Ecu bond, which benefited from scarcity of 10-year supply in the Ecu market combined with strong investor appetite for sovereign global debt. 'The issue was oversubscribed - we were sold out even before we issued invitations to co-managers,' said one of the lead managers, reporting strong demand from European and US accounts. The Republic of Portugal issued Ecu750m of global bonds due February 2004 via joint lead managers Dresdner Bank, Morgan Stanley International and Paribas Capital Markets. The bonds will be priced today at an indicated spread of 28 - 30 basis points over the 6 per cent Ecu OAT due 2004. 'Given the strong demand for the issue, I suspect that the spread will be at the low end of that range,' said one trader. While many participants felt that the pricing was aggressive, they said it was justified by the scarcity of long-dated supply in Ecu sector. It is also hoped that the issue will breathe new life into the slowly reviving Ecu bond market. According to Mr Manuel Pinho, director general at the Portuguese Treasury, favourable market conditions and Portugal's commitment to a single European currency prompted it to issue Ecu bonds. Investor demand for the issue was further boosted by talk that it could be Portugal's last foray into the international bond market this year. According to Mr Pinho, Portugal will not tap the Eurobond market as heavily this year as it did in 1993, when it issued three international bonds in yen, D-Marks and US dollars totalling the equivalent of Dollars 2.1bn. In 1994, it can borrow the equivalent of some Dollars 2.2bn on the international market, but according to Mr Pinho, 'our main priority now will be developing the domestic market - external borrowing will be marginal'. Among other domestic market reforms, Portugal plans to abolish withholding tax on non-residents this year. Elsewhere, Rabobank Nederland issued Dollars 100m of the first foreign-exchange range floating-rate note via Samuel Montagu. The one-year notes pay a coupon of three-month Libor plus 50 basis points, but interest accrues only on days when the spot D-Mark/dollar exchange rate lies between DM1.6200 and DM1.8800. The notes work on the same principle as the recent interest rate range floaters, where interest accrues only on days when the Libor fixing falls in a specific interest rate corridor. Other structured deals included Dollars 100m of one-year range floaters for the Council of Europe via Salomon Brothers and CDollars 150m of 10-year floored FRNs for Goldman Sachs Group. In the Yankee market, the Province of Quebec launched Dollars 1bn of 30-year bonds via Merrill Lynch, due to be priced at a spread of 81 - 83 basis points over the old long bond. The Republic of Italy expects to issue bonds on foreign markets worth the equivalent of Dollars 10-Dollars 12bn this year, according to a Treasury statement, Reuters reports. Issues in 1994 would be in the major international currencies and would be fixed or floating rate, according to market requirements and investors' preferences, the Treasury said. In 1993, the Treasury returned to non-domestic markets after a two-year break and issued some Dollars 12bn of Eurobonds, samurai bonds and dollar-denominated global bonds.</p>

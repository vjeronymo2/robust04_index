The death rate in hospitals has risen by up to 30 percent  since the introduction of sanctions, the statement said.    Statistics from the Yugoslav Institute for Preventative  Medicine showed that cases of chicken pox had risen from 694 in  the first half of last year to 14,940 in the same period this  year, of which 44 were fatal.    Belgrade's Tirsova Children's Hospital, which operated on  500  children with heart defects last year, could this year manage  only 150 operations. Clinic Director Dusan Scepanovic said:  "Children will die waiting for their turn."    Infant mortality has risen from 1.4 percent in 1991 to 1.7  percent during the first six months of this year, the statement  said.    By April, Serbia was spending annually only 20 dollars per  resident on health care compared to 150 dollars in 1983.</p>

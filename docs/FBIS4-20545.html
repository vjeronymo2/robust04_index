			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "AGF and Renault on Fast Track"] </F>   [Text] Are AGF and Renault next in line for privatization?  That was the distinct impression left by Economic Affairs  Minister Edmond Alphandery on Friday 18 February when he  appeared as a guest on "Forum RMC-L'EXPRESS": It's clear the  government has no intention of sitting on its hands. "After UAP,  which is already in the pipeline, we will announce other  privatization projects in the weeks to come," he indicated.  Commenting on the separation of Renault and Volvo (LE MONDE of  19 February), the minister added that "the way was now open for  privatization of Renault." "AGF and Renault are definite  candidates," confirmed Mr. Alphandery, explaining that the  government "likes to keep several irons in the fire."    No reference was made during the program to Bull Group, the  computer manufacturer whose new CEO, Jean-Marie Descarpentries,  had announced the previous day plans to open the group's stock  to the public this year. A visibly irritated Bercy [i.e. the  Economic Affairs Ministry] issued an official clarification in a  communique Friday evening. "No decision has yet been made" on  the timetable or modalities for [privatization of] the computer  builder, the ministry said. The privatization commission has not  yet considered the Bull dossier, it also noted.</p>

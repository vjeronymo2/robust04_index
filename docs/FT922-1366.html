			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market fears further central bank selling - The main issue worrying delegates to the FT international conference in Montreux FEARS THAT central banks would sell off their gold reserves with devastating effects on the price dominated the first day of the Financial Times World Gold Conference in Montreux, Switzerland, yesterday. Central banks control about 30,000 tonnes of gold compared with the 1,782 produced by the world's mines last year and questions about their attitudes to these reserves were raised again by the recent sale of 202 tonnes by Belgium. As Mr Robert Guy, a director of NM Rothschild and Sons, told the conference, the central banks are 'the most powerful influence at work in the market today'. But the banks seemed to have no strategic, long-term thinking about their gold reserves. He pointed out that the issue was particularly important in Europe where a European central bank, when it was set up, would hold about 40 per cent of all official gold reserves. 'Clearly central bank policy toward gold is a sensitive issue but sensitivity should not be an excuse for continued inaction,' said Mr Guy. 'Lack of clarification and explanation is only serving to undermine the value of member states' gold reserves.' He added: 'Members of the European Community might consider two options. One is to follow the example of the Swiss National Bank and state that they have no intention of selling their gold'. Otherwise, Mr Guy suggested, the central banks should take up an idea put forward by Mr Ricky Hall of the Bank of International Settlements and create their own European Mutual Gold Fund into which they could put a proportion of their own gold reserves. 'In the event that individual members needed additional foreign exchange reserves they could draw down currency up to 75 per cent of their initial gold subscription. In this way the value of gold reserves could be mobilised without depressing the market.' Two of the central bankers present suggested that in desperate times it was useful to hold some gold reserves. Mr James Cross, general manager of the South African Reserve Bank's gold and foreign exchange department, pointed out that gold had proved invaluable when his country faced international economic sanctions. He said his bank followed a 'lean-into-the-wind' market strategy, occasionally intervening in the market to buy gold 'without presuming to influence longer term price trends'. During 1991 South Africa's gold reserves had increased by 2m troy ounces and buying continued this year. At the end of May it had 6.8m ounces in its reserves. 'With South Africa's debt profile improving it is unlikely that significant additional bullion sales will take place and the policy of the bank is to increase its gold holdings still further.' Mr S. Venkitaramanan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said his country's deposit of 46 tonnes of gold in London last year as collateral for loans during a short-term liquidity crisis had shocked many of his countrymen but it had brought home to them the extent of the crisis. He described how India was attempting to cut gold smuggling by allowing some official imports. These efforts were already having an impact because in May India's official gold imports shot up to 10 tonnes compared with less than half a tonne a month in previous years. Eventually, India would allow a free flow of gold imports and exports as part of a policy to liberate its financial markets, but Mr Venkitaramanan would not indicate when this might happen. Mr Terry Smeeton, chief manager of the Bank of England's foreign exchange division, pointed out that European economic unity is likely, for practical purposes, to reduce the major investment currencies to only three: the dollar, the yen and the European currencies. Against this background the relative attractions for central banks and investment managers of having another string to their bow in the form of a gold portfolio of some type seemed to be much greater. As for the possible behaviour of the European central banks in the run up to monetary union, Mr Smeeton said it was unlikely that any central bank would hand over its gold reserves before the end of the century when the European System of Central Banks came into operation. 'My own view is that this body would be likely to be wary of making any major changes in an area as sensitive as gold and much of it may well remain with national central banks. All that said, as we have seen recently with Belgium, the run-up to monetary union may cause participating central banks to examine their policies towards holding gold much more closely than has been the case in the recent past.' Forward sales of gold and hedging by producers has also been blamed for holding down the gold price in recent years, but Mr Ted Reeve, gold equity analyst at First Boston Canada, said he believed the industry was now past the point where hedging added to the gold supply and could be cited as a negative factor for the price. He gave up to date estimates of gold hedging by North American, South African and Australian producers and said it totalled 1,000 to 1,100 tonnes. The question of whether cuts in gold production would help the price to recover was raised by two speakers. Mr Stewart Murray, chief executive of Gold Fields Minerals Services, said that Russian gold output was bound to fall again this year, perhaps by 30 per cent, because of the lack of equipment and even roubles to pay the workforce. However, in the long term, the CIS countries might become net importers of gold rather than suppliers. Mr Mark Keatley, senior investment officer at the International Finance Corporation, an affiliate of the World Bank, said countries in sub-Saharan Africa had the potential to double annual gold output to 165 tonnes, almost the same as Canada's production today.</p>

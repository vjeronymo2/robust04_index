			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drought threatens Ghanaian aluminium smelter Drought conditions in Ghana have caused power authorities in the Volta Lake region to declare force majeure on its supply contracts to the Volta Aluminum Company (Valco) smelter, which this year was projected to produce 140,000 tonnes of aluminium. The smelter is 90 per cent owned by Texas-based Kaiser Aluminum, with the minority interest held by Reynolds Metals. Kaiser officials are negotiating with the government of Ghana to avoid the power cut-off, but at present are facing at September 10 shutdown date. If the negotiations are unsuccessful, Kaiser faces the loss of nearly one-third of its current global production. Kaiser has global capacity to produce 508,000 tonnes of aluminium annually, but has been operating at about 77 per cent of that capacity, or about 390,000 tonnes per year. It cut output at the Valco plant by about 30 per cent this spring, because of the low water conditions. Mr Robert Irelan, a Kaiser spokesman, said the company was examining its options for replacing metal lost if Valco were shut down. Those options included restarting idled potlines in the US Pacific north-west, where low water has also interrupted the supply of cheap hydro-electric power. Kaiser's Mead smelter in Spokane, Washington, is operating at only 75 per cent of its annual 200,000 tonne rated capacity. The Ghanaian smelter was last shut by drought in 1983, when it remained idle for two years. The Valco plant employs about 1,600 people, most of whom are Ghanaian nationals, and is an important source of foreign exchange for Ghana.</p>

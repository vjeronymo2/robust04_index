			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "jaf": "So Far, the Christian Democratic Party </F> Does Not Intend To Criticize the Department of Justice"]    [Text] Prague--So far, the Christian Democratic Party  [KDS] does not intend to specify its exceptions to the operation  of the Department of Justice. According to KDS Deputy Chairman  Vaclav Benda, it will do so after "all coalition mechanisms are  exhausted," in the form of publishing a series of articles in  the press.    The KDS deputy chairman also told DENNI TELEGRAF that the  party leadership is interested "neither in the ministerial post  nor in Minister Novak's head but, rather, in the correction of  the situation in the department." According to the KDS, the  remaining "coalition mechanisms" are discussions of its  objections to the operation of the Ministry of Justice at the  level of the coalition four. Another alternative is a meeting  with Minister Novak on the ground of his deputies' club in the  parliament. Benda considers the discussion in front of  television cameras proposed by [Justice] Minister Novak another  form of presentation of the aforementioned objections. "If none  of these approaches leads to the correction, there is nothing  left for the KDS and myself but to publicly point out the  specific shortcomings that affect the interests of the general  public," Benda said. To the question of whether the KDS has any  hard evidence, he replied in the affirmative.</p>

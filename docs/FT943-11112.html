			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Not all gloom and doom in Italy - Capital &amp; Credit Investing in Italian government bonds has never been for the faint-hearted, given the country's tradition of political turbulence, so the latest drop in the market should come as no surprise to the seasoned investor. Ever since the fledgling government headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi started to crack under the combined weight of the premier's embarrassing climbdowns and the allegations of corruption, Italian bonds and the lira have been on a slippery slope. By the end of last week, the yield spread on 10-year Italian bonds stood at 412 basis points over their German counterparts. In late April, the post-election euphoria had caused this spread to narrow to around 250 basis points. Meanwhile, the lira has been hovering around L1,000 to the D-Mark, close to its all-time low of L1,006. There are signs, too, that international investors have been voting with their feet. 'The last five weeks have seen a large shift out of Italian bonds by foreign investors into other high-yielding markets such as Spain or Denmark,' says Mr Andrew King, investment manager at Swiss fund managers, Lombard Odier. He cites Italian Ministry of Finance figures which show a 1 1/2 per cent drop in foreign holdings of Italian government debt to 9 per cent from May to June. The chances are that the June-July figures will show a further decline. However, in spite of the mood of animosity towards the Italian market, there are several factors which could prompt a sudden turnround in sentiment. 'Italy is a market which goes in peaks and troughs, and we are undoubtedly in a major trough,' says Mr Darren Williams, European fixed-income analyst at Merrill Lynch. 'However, unless you are assuming a total disaster scenario, things will improve.' Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at Midland Global Markets, says the market could recover quickly once investor attention shifts from the government's woes to Italy's positive economic outlook. Inflation in Italy is now at its lowest level since late 1969, and at 3.7 per cent is not far above Germany's 2.9 per cent. 'Italy's inflation rate is much better than the market was expecting but so far the news has been over-ridden by the political situation,' says Mr Wattret. Another factor in Italy's favour is that the domestic situation has not caused the yield spreads on its foreign-currency bonds to widen significantly and its credit rating has not come under threat. 'The feeling is that the rating agencies went too far last time, so this acts as some sort of cushion,' says Mr King. However, he adds that the rating agencies would take a dim view if the government fails to take steps to correct the country's enormous budget deficit. In this respect, the Italian Treasury would do well to persuade Mr Alberto Giovannini, the academic credited with restoring Italy's credibility in the international bond market, to stay on after his two-year consultancy period expires. There has been speculation that Mr Giovannini will return to Columbia University in the autumn but last week the sphinx-like professor was giving nothing away. Although there is still a danger that Italian bonds will fall further over the summer as the corruption bandwagon rumbles on, analysts are confident that the brave will be rewarded in the long term. Mr Wattret forecasts that the lira will recover to L940 to the D-Mark by the year-end and that the spread over German government bonds will narrow to 270 basis points by February next year. Mr Williams believes the spread will come below 350 basis points and that the lira will rebound by as much as 20 per cent once the political situation stabilises. In spite of their defensive attitude towards the Italian market, international investors know that they cannot boycott it for long. Because of its large weighting in the global bond indices against which their performance is measured, they need to hold Italian bonds or find a proxy for them. Italy accounts for just under 7 per cent of Salomon Brothers' world government bond index and is the fourth-biggest component after the US, Japan and Germany. Unlike Spanish and Danish bond markets, where they exert considerable influence, international investors are not such big players in Italy where the domestic investors still call the tune. 'And the Italians are still prepared to believe that Berlusconi will be a a winner,' says Mr Wattret.</p>

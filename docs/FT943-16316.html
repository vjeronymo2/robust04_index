			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Retailers reshuffle top jobs Two of the UK's largest clothing retailers reshuffled their top executives yesterday as Mr Richard North resigned as finance director of Burton group, to be replaced by Mr Andrew Higginson, finance director of Laura Ashley. In a separate move, Laura Ashley appointed Mr Graham Searle, currently non-executive deputy chairman, as managing director. Mr North, hired by Burton in 1991 from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said he was leaving because his task of sorting out Burton's financial problems was complete, and he wanted a new challenge. Sir John Hoskyns, Burton's chairman, emphasised that Mr North's departure had been mutually agreed, and he was receiving a non-contractual bonus of 12 months' salary - close to Pounds 250,000. 'We always knew Richard was a special horse for a particular course,' Sir John said. Mr North retains a 12-month consultancy contract, worth Pounds 60,000, with Burton. 'I only wanted to go when I had completed the job, and was seen to have completed the job,' he said. That job involved reducing debts of Pounds 800m three years ago to Pounds 50m, and gearing from 100 per cent to 6 per cent, through two rights issues, the sale of Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge for Pounds 60m, and other property deals. The last was the sale in May of Burton's four remaining shopping centres to Prudential for Pounds 153m. Mr North is credited with having improved both the 'reality and perception' of Burton's accounting, as one analyst put it. His successor Mr Andrew Higginson, 36, has 14 years' experience at Unilever, Guinness and Laura Ashley. Mr Higginson's departure contributed to a 5p fall in Laura Ashley shares to 68p yesterday, as it announced it was appointing Mr Graham Searle - who joined only last month as non-executive deputy chairman - as managing director. Mr Searle, formerly managing director of Dunhill, will hold the position until a chief executive is found to replace Mr Jim Maxmin - a process Ashley believes could take up to a year. Mr Geoff Haslehurst is being promoted from deputy to acting finance director. Ms Ann Iverson, former chief executive of Mothercare and now with US retailer Melville, was appointed a non-executive director, along with Mr Richard Wakeling, until recently chief executive of Johnson Matthey.

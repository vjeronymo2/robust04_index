			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Peng Dejian [l756 l795 1696]: ``China Puts into </F> Operation First Ozone Laser Radar'']    [Summary] Hefei (ZHONGGUO KEXUE BAO wire report) -- The  nation's first ozone laser radar (LIDAR) was put into operation  on 28 December 1993. In the 2-odd months since then, this ozone  LIDAR has provided a set of data on the vertical distribution of  the ozone concentration in the 15-4O-km altitude range. The  results obtained by the researchers so far coincide with those  obtained by scientists in the U.S., Japan, and other countries.  This ozone LIDAR was developed by CAS Anhui Institute of Optics  &amp; Fine Mechanics (AIOFM) Research Fellow Hu Huanling [517O  2970  7117], supported by grants from the 863 Program and the NSFC.  Researcher Hu used AIOFM's independently developed excimer  laser and a double-wavelength operating system with a YAG  [yttrium-aluminum garnet] frequency tripled output to conduct  differential absorption LIDAR (DIAL) measurements of the ozone.</p>

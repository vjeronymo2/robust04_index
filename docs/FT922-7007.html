			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Show trial of Croats by Serb military FRANZ KAFKA would have felt at home yesterday in the first floor courtroom in Belgrade's main military courthouse. Seven pallid prisoners, all looking bewildered and one obviously mentally disturbed, sat facing five military judges, whose uniforms were decorated with from two to five stars. Above them the eternal flame, the communist emblem of the defunct Yugoslav federation, was still firmly fixed to the wood-panelled walls. A row of seven clean-cut military policemen in camouflage uniforms separated the defendants from the spectators and some scowling Belgrade journalists. The main witness, who was present at the hearing, cursed and jeered at the seven: 'Ustashe animals', using the Serbian epithet for Croats. The men, Croat nationals, who are accused by the Yugoslav army of war crimes and taking part in an 'armed uprising against Yugoslavia,' are the principal players in what may herald the start of a series of show trials. The seven are Croats from a village near Vukovar, the devastated city in eastern Croatia. They are accused of crimes last autumn at the height of the army siege of the town. The crimes range from murder to 'endangering the security of the Socialist Federated Republic of Yugoslavia'. The defendants, who face the death penalty, are being tried by a military court although they are all civilians. A guilty verdict looked predetermined as most of the defendants were not allowed to choose their own defence lawyers. Instead they were awarded 'defence' counsels from the ranks of embittered Serb refugees from Croatia. Mrs Nadezhda Danilovic, a defence lawyer from Belgrade, yesterday raised objections to the military tribunal, saying that the court was not authorised to try Croat, now foreign, citizens. Defence lawyers fear that Serbia's state-controlled media will use this and other trials to pump up hatred of Croats in order to channel popular resentment at the collapsing economy. The official media spew a steady stream of racist propaganda about non-Serbs. A western diplomat said: 'We are not questioning the right of Serbia to try war criminals if it is based on real evidence. But there is also a legal and moral responsibility to try criminals from their own side.' Mrs Danilovic says the trial may mark the beginning of a wave of show trials. She says the defendants are being tried for heinous war crimes, although Yugoslavia was never officially at war with Croatia. But if a wave of trials begins in Serbia, it is likely to be matched in Croatia, where resentment of the perceived seizure of its territory by Serbia, runs high. Serbs living in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, have expressed fears that the government will use them as scapegoats.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED TAPE SNAGS GREEN CROSS STATUE;  </P> <P> LANDMARKS: THE MONUMENT HAS KNOWN BOTH FAME AND OBLIVION SINCE IT WAS DEDICATED  62 YEARS AGO. NOW ITS RESTORATION HAS ENCOUNTERED A SETBACK.  </P> <P> Her face is scarred and her arms are gone. She can no longer stand up without  help. She spent years lost and neglected in an obscure Brand Park canyon, where  vandals took potshots at her and the elements eroded her features.  </P> <P> But Glendale officials say better days are ahead for Miss American Green Cross,  a 62-year-old statue that was erected amid great fanfare by American Green  Cross, a now-defunct organization committed to saving the nation's forests.  </P> <P> City leaders say the statue has historic value, and they plan to spend  thousands of dollars to restore her arms, refinish her bronze skin, rebuild her  pedestal and put her back on public display.  </P> <P> Support for the project remains strong, but the restoration of Miss American  Green Cross suffered a slight setback last month.  </P> <P> Glendale parks officials had chosen for the project local sculptor Ron Pekar,  who said he could complete the work by November for $25,000. He said he would  use modern materials that are more durable and vandal-resistant than the  concrete-like substance originally used to form the cross behind the statue and  the cluster of logs at her feet.  </P> <P> But the Glendale Historic Preservation Commission gave the proposal a cool  reception at its Sept. 17 meeting.  </P> <P> "The commission prefers to see it restored to its original condition in both  materials and design," Commissioner William E. Dodson said. "We're to protect  what is historic in the city and try to retain it as much as possible in its  original condition.  </P> <P> "To do less, you're really not restoring, you're creating something new. We  wouldn't have Miss American Green Cross. We'd have a new project," he said.  </P> <P> A further complication arose shortly before the meeting, when a Glendale  history buff unearthed some old photos of the statue at the Los Angeles  Library. They showed that it originally stood upon a six-foot-high base, with  inscriptions proclaiming the importance of forests.  </P> <P> "Obviously, it was a surprise to us," said Nello Iacono, the city's parks and  recreation director. "We had never seen that base."  </P> <P> Artist Pekar suggested that the mammoth base, if rebuilt, would dwarf the  delicate five-foot-tall statue and detract from her beauty. Its size would also  spoil a plan to put the statue in a small landscaped area near the Brand  Library.  </P> <P> But the Historic Preservation Commission urged that the large base be rebuilt  because it was part of the original monument. "It's not so much the artistic  quality. It's the history behind it that's important," Dodson said.  </P> <P> Iacono has asked Pekar to draw up a new budget and schedule for rebuilding the  base and restoring the statue with original materials. The new budget is  expected to be higher and the project may not be completed until next spring,  the parks director said.  </P> <P> Dodson is not worried about the delay.  </P> <P> "Time is not of the essence here," he said. "The quality is more important than  the time element."  </P> <P> Although she was briefly the center of civic attention, time has not been kind  to Miss American Green Cross.  </P> <P> Thousands of cheering onlookers attended her unveiling at the Glendale High  School campus on April 23, 1928. On May 4, California's governor at the time,  C. C. Young, placed a strongbox filled with mementos in the monument's  cornerstone after being escorted to the campus by a parade of more than 100  cars.  </P> <P> The statue was a focal point for American Green Cross, but little is known  today about the organization. Glendale officials have been unable to find any  chapters that still exist.  </P> <P> According to old news articles, the group was founded in Southern California on  Dec. 3, 1926, as a successor to the American Reforestation Assn. It promoted  the conservation of timber and other natural resources. Its leaders said the  destruction of forests, which absorb rain, had contributed to serious flooding  problems nationwide.  </P> <P> One early Green Cross committee chairman urged that the group's national  headquarters be established in his hometown, Santa Barbara, "because there are  so many people here who have time to think about the important things of life."  </P> <P> Instead, the headquarters was established in early 1928 at Glendale's Sparr  Heights community center, which was donated to the group. On April 5, 1928,  Glendale also became the site of the nation's first local Green Cross chapter.  </P> <P> The organization made plans to place its first Green Cross monument at Glendale  High School. Little is known about its sculptor, Frederick Willard Potter, or  his model, Verlyn Sumner, although they were on the speakers' platform during  the unveiling of Miss American Green Cross.  </P> <P> A Times report on the event said, "The monument portrays America as a woman  standing before a green cross with outstretched arms amid ruined stumps crying,  'Help Save Our Trees.' "  </P> <P> Beneath that plea was the inscription: "The Forest Is the Mother of the  Rivers." Other conservation messages also appeared on the base.  </P> <P> In the years that followed, American Green Cross' popularity apparently waned,  as did the city's enthusiasm for the statue. According to old news reports, art  critics of the era dismissed the statue as "an abortion." One report said its  base was damaged when "a wildly driven car banged into it."  </P> <P> Sometime during the early 1930s, Miss American Green Cross was spirited away  from the high school campus and deposited in the remote canyon area.  </P> <P> She briefly re-entered the limelight in 1954, when reporters hiking in the  Brand Park canyon stumbled upon the statue and dubbed it the mysterious "Green  Cross Woman." The mystery was solved a few days later when the Glendale City  Council, accompanied by civic activist Essie Morris Hughes, journeyed into the  brush to inspect the find.  </P> <P> "There's my statue!" exclaimed Hughes, who had founded the Junior Green Cross  chapter for Glendale's schoolchildren many years earlier. Council members joked  about who had removed the monument, "but not one suggestion was heard that she  be returned to her place on Glendale High School grounds," the Glendale  Independent reported.  </P> <P> Miss American Green Cross remained in the canyon and was heavily damaged by  vandals. Glendale's Historic Preservation Element, adopted in 1977, designated  the statue as a landmark piece that should be relocated to a prominent place in  Brand Park.  </P> <P> By the early 1980s, her arms were gone, and her cross and logs had crumbled,  parks director Iacono said. Since 1981, she has remained in storage at Brand  Park's maintenance yard.  </P> <P> In 1985, the Historic Preservation Commission was formed to take a more  aggressive role in saving important Glendale buildings and artifacts.  </P> <P> During an Arbor Day speech last March, Iacono said the city's goal was to  complete the monument's restoration by the end of the year, to coincide with  the renovation of the park. He said the founders of American Green Cross were  visionary and their message more timely than ever, in view of the current  international concern over the loss of rain forests.  </P> <P> "Let the restoration and permanent placement of Miss American Green Cross  reaffirm our commitment to trees and the integral part they play in our  environment," Iacono said.  </P></p>

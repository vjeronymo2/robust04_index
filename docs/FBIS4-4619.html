			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Many delegates to the  national conference of party cell secretaries including those  who were awarded the title of labour hero of the DPRK and  honored with letters of commendation from the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il, met here Sunday with Yi In-mo, a former  war correspondent of the Korean People's Army and veteran party  member who is widely known as the incarnation of faith and will.    Upon meeting them, Yi In-mo recalled the days right after  the  liberation of the country when he was making strenuous efforts  to rouse people of broad strata to the struggle for democratic  reforms including the agrarian reform, upholding the line of  nation building set forth by the great leader President Kim  Il-song.    He said he told his comrades who were with him in South  Korea  and visitors that his birthday is October 10, the founding  anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea. "I did so," he went  on, "not because I forgot my birthday, but because I wanted to  celebrate the party founding anniversary together with the  people of the homeland, remembering at any time and in any place  that I am a member of the Workers' Party of Korea, and always  thinking of the party."    He said each time the enemy tried to force him to write a  "paper of ideological conversion" he tore it to pieces and threw  them at their faces, his mind crowded with thought of our  general and consciousness of being a party member.    Noting that the great leader and the dear leader are the  greatest in the world, he asked the party cell secretaries to do  a lot of more work, remaining loyal subjects who uphold Comrade  Kim Chong-il with unquestioned worship.    The visitors vowed to hold President Kim Il-song and Comrade  Kim Chong-il in high esteem and follow them, build their party  cells well and constantly strengthen and develop them, as Yi  In-mo asked them to.</p>

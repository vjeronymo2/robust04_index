			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP!: SHE CAN'T STAND THE HEAT IN THE KITCHEN  </P> <P> Frances Vose of Moorpark is looking for a small electric ice crusher; she's had  no luck in department or hardware stores. Can you give Vose a chance to cool it  soon, or will she be crushed because she seems to have been frozen out of the  market?  </P> <P> So that she can pick her high-growing tomatoes, Ruth Stern of La Jolla needs a  two-step garden stool with a flat top for standing on -- and wide legs that  don't sink into the soil. Can you help Stern reach out and touch something, or  will she always have that sinking feeling because she has no leg to stand on?  </P> <P> Pearl Wernick of Diamond Bar wants disposable bags No. 44 or No. 5502 for a  Shetland-Lewyt canister-type Model A-2865 vacuum cleaner. Wernick realizes that  the cleaner is no longer made, but perhaps the bags are. Can you dispose of  this matter for Wernick, or will she be left holding the bag because nobody  wants to call her on the carpet?  </P> <P> Leona Current of Rialto is in the market for a doughnut maker that can make six  doughnuts at a time. (It looks like a waffle iron but has round holes.) Can you  help without waffling around too much, or will Current never get out of the  hole because there isn't enough dough around?  </P> <P> Reader-to-Reader Help Line: Lyn at (213) 944-6930 would like to find an  electric roasting pan with a blue liner and a domed lid; these were popular in  the '50s, she says, but are impossible to find now. Please see to it that this  burning request pans out quickly. . . . Elyse at (213) 473-5581 has been  searching for the original Wishnik Troll dolls that were popular in the '60s  and were made by Uneda. Please make sure that the bell trolls soon for Elyse. .  . . Speaking of dolls, Marjorie at (818) 246-7942 is interested in a Kermit the  Frog muppet that's about 19 inches high and has a green felt collar around the  neck; evidently these are no longer made. If you could help, Marjorie would  jump a mile.  </P> <P> Note: The Reader-to-Reader Help Line is only for one-time items or for products  no longer available in stores. And you must give us written permission to  publish your telephone number, so that others may contact you directly.  </P> <P> For Toby Ann Kelson and others interested in table-top hair dryers, we also  have some private sources: Almost a dozen readers said they might be willing to  part with a hair dryer. If you send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to this  hair address, we'll dry our best to accommodate you.  </P> <P> For Anna Carlton of Las Vegas, who wanted Daniel Green bedroom slippers, we  have one source, but Carlton shouldn't try walking there, with or without  slippers. Marianne Balcom of Carlsbad says to contact the Daniel Green factory,  Main Street, Dolgeville, N.Y. 13329.  </P> <P> For Nancy Bird of Laguna Beach, who wanted "chicken" earrings, we have quite an  earful. Almost in her back yard is Alice Zemojda, who designs and distributes  Barbara Barnett's Hooker earrings. She works out of her studio in Laguna Beach  and can be reached at (714) 497-9697; the mailing address is P.O. Box 1070,  Laguna Beach, Calif. Muriel Campbell of Westminster also told us about Barnett.  Also, thanks to Ethel Sirote of Los Angeles for the information about the  "convertible" earrings, which we have forwarded to Bird.  </P> <P> For Marilyn Casady of Oceanside, who was after panty hose made of cotton or  silk, we have a number of sources. Kathy Falkenberg of North Hollywood says to  look for Hue-brand stockings in places such as Bullock's and Nordstrom. The  others are all mail-order firms: Garnet Hill, 262 Main St., Franconia, N.H.  03580, telephone (800) 622-6216 (from Kathy Weber of Culver City); Showcase of  Savings, L'eggs Brand Inc., P.O. Box 1010, Rural Hall, N.C. 27098-1010 (Francis  Peterson of Desert Hot Springs and Mary Thomas of La Puente); Wittman Textiles,  Department 125, Hobe Sound, Fla. 33475 (Pauline Dods of Harbor City and Audrey  Meitz of Santa Barbara), and National Wholesale Co. Inc., Lexington, N.C. 27294  (Mrs. A. L. Britz of Encinitas).  </P> <P> Hain cannot answer mail personally but will, space permitting, respond in this  column to readers who need -- or have -- helpful information. Write (do not  telephone) to You Can Help!, You section, the Times, Times Mirror Square, Los  Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Paisley obstacle to Ulster talks EFFORTS TO re-start the political dialogue in Ulster received a blow yesterday when the Rev Ian Paisley said he would not meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary. Sir Patrick invited the leaders of the four main constitutional parties to meet him for separate talks over the next two weeks to discuss ways of getting the inter-party discussions going again. But the Democratic Unionist party leader told the Northern Ireland Office he was not interested in discussion until the Irish Republic removed its territorial claim over Ulster. He also said he would not talk until Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, ended discussions with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. Rev Paisley said he had told the Northern Ireland Office he wanted Sir Patrick 'to tell us why he wants to see us, what documents he is going to place before us and then we would consider what we would do'. Mr Hume is to meet Sir Patrick tomorrow and the Ulster Unionist party has indicated Mr James Molyneaux, the party leader, will meet him next week.</p>

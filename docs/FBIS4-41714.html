			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Leonid Burovets from the "Fax News" roundup in </F> the "Russkoye Oruzhiye" section: "That's All. We Would Seem To  Have Run Aground"]    [Text] Vladivostok -- The two and a half years of life  under a so-called market economy have been sheer torment and  torture for our ship repair plant. In the first five months of  this year alone, the Pacific Fleet has run up debts to the plant  in the order of 13 billion rubles [R]. This, in turn, includes  R525 million in administrative fines and penalties which the  plant owes to the state budget, the pension fund, and  enterprises keeping us going on a day-to-day basis. Workers  have not received their pay for three months running, and any  attempt to explain to people why this is happening immediately  turns into a spontaneous rally. Today, the plant's debts come  to R2.5 billion.    Another few days of operation, and then we will grind to a  halt. We have run aground. The main directorate is asking that  production continue even at the cost of halting military ship  repairs altogether and occupying production capacities with any  output. But how long will these measures last?</p>

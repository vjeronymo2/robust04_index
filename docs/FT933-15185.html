			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: BA savaged Shares in British Airways lost ground after US investment bank Goldman Sachs weighed in with a savage profits downgrading. The stock had eased with the market, but news that Goldman's US based airlines specialist had cut his forecast sent the shares further into retreat, ending 10 lighter at 297p after trade of 3.8m. Mr Glenn Engel at the investment bank reduced current year expectations by Pounds 100m to Pounds 175m, but only shaved the figure for the year to March 1995 by Pounds 20m to Pounds 285m. He said: 'I remain very concerned about the passenger and cargo yields. There is no growth in Europe, yet the supply (of seats) is increasing, which will lead to pressure on prices.' In addition, he thought that with corporate budgets still under pressure, the recovery in premium traffic would be slow.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Turkey in fourth Gima sell-off attempt TURKEY'S privatisation agency has embarked on its fourth attempt to sell Gima, the country's second largest supermarket chain. The PPFA, the government agency entrusted with selling state assets to the public, announced that 94 per cent of Gima would be offered by block sale. Bids have to be submitted by January 18. The agency has set a minimum price of TL88.7bn (around Dollars 10m) above which negotiations can begin. It is to sell both its own shares and those of the co-operatives, an issue which was the main stumbling block on three previous attempts to sell the company. Food and beverages is seen as one of the most attractive sectors. Carrefour, the French foods group, is already in negotiations to set up a local operation. Koc, Turkey's largest industrial group, has a joint venture between its Migros subsidiary, Turkey's biggest supermarket chain, and another French concern, Prisunic, with two shops in Istanbul. Gima owns 58 stores in Turkey, selling food and beverages. The company reported net sales of TL580bn in 1991, although high operating expenses reduced pre-tax profit to TL2bn. The PPFA owns 50.5 per cent of Gima. Some 10 agricultural co-operatives own 43.6 per cent. The PPFA sold 4.3 per cent by public offering in 1991.</p>

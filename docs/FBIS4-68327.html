			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yaropolov, doctor of technical </F> sciences, under main headline of "Space Ark. Who's At the  Helm?": "Of the Competitors, We're the Assistants..."; first  paragraph is source introduction before Yaropolov's piece]    [Text] The negotiations between Russia and the United  States on cooperation in space may wind up with a decision to  create a joint orbital space station. That aim evokes differing  assessments from specialists.    The capabilities and infrastructure of the domestic space  sector could be destroyed if Russia accepts NASA's proposal with  regard to an international space station project. The  development of the Alpha station, mainly with U.S. equipment and  in cooperation with Europe, Japan, and Canada, could reduce us  -- with two modules and a transport craft -- to a "second-string  player." But it is Russia who is creating a space infrastructure  for the United States, and that 3-3.5 years earlier than they  had planned to do it on their own. But their attempts, which  have cost them almost $10 billion, have not been successful.    The future station, built and serviced with the American  space shuttles, can fly with an orbital inclination of 57,  and maybe even 51. Consequently, it will not fly over all  of Russia, as had been planned for our Mir-2 station. Recall  that Mir-2 was supposed to lift off in 1997, to an orbit of  65, which would make it possible to continue remote sensing  of the ground. The Alpha enables survey of no more than 5  percent of our country.    The United States will have the opportunity to use the  orbital complex in its entirety. But no one knows yet whether  Russian cosmonauts will get to operate the Alpha at all. The  fact is that all the know-how with regard to the development of  the orbital station has been valued at $800 million. Even though  Russia herself invested tens of billions of rubles in that  technology at a time when the ruble and the dollar were almost  equivalent.    But since the whole station will go for roughly $40 billion  and will be operated by the project participants on a percentage  basis, according to how much was contributed, Russia's operating  time will be no more than 10 days a year. When you recall that  we have obligations to France in the manned program, then it's  not clear at all for whom or for what purpose we will be  creating Alpha.    Besides, Russian industry will lose vitally important  orders.  And the unique Cosmonaut Training Center in Zvezdnyy Gorodok  will become virtually unnecessary -- the crews will start  training in the States. And the Flight Control Center, with all  its expensive equipment and highly skilled specialists, will  lose its significance.</p>

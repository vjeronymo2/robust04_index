			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US farmers cheesed-off over plan for imports AMERICAN DAIRY farmers are up in arms over a Bush administration plan to promote capitalism in Hungary by making room in the US market place for goya cheese. The proposal - to eliminate the import duty for goya under the US Generalised System of Preferences - would be 'simply the straw that breaks the dairy farmers backs', insists Congressman Jim Moody of Wisconsin, the number one US dairy state. As efficient at lobbying Congress as they are at overproducing, dairy farmers turned out en masse yesterday for a hearing of a House agriculture subcommittee where the proposal was predictably decried. Unwilling to attack a new democracy, the congressmen argued that giving GSP to goya would open the way for a flood of new duty-free imports that would chiefly benefit Argentina and Uruguay. They said imports of goya would rise by up to 100,000 tonnes. Goya can be used as a substitute for Parmesan produced in the US. This, in turn, would drive farmers into manufacture of cheddar, which is purchased by the US government (when in surplus) and dumped on the world market. 'In our zealousness to help the newly democratic states, we need to proceed with at least enough caution to ensure that we do not undertake proposals that hurt ourselves more than they help the nations on whose behalf they are intended,' Congressman Moody said. Farmers thought they had won this point when a petition to admit goya to the GSP was rejected by the US Trade Representative last year. However, it is now being reconsidered after President Bush waived the three-year limit on resubmitting rejected petitions and raised the issue again. A final decision is due by the end of the month. Meanwhile, Congressmen have mounted an attack against the State Department, which they claim is once again using agriculture 'as a tool of foreign policy'. They said that without a duty, imported Goya would sell in US food stores at 30 cents below the US price. 'If we can find ways to effectively help countries like Hungary develop market economies, we should do so,' said Congressman Moody. 'But this particular prescription won't help the patient and will most certainly hurt the doctor.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Admiral Lanxade, chief of staff of the French Armed  Forces, who is commanding the French operation in Rwanda from  Paris, spoke to Laurent Boussie about the difficulties lying  ahead of the mission to evacuate foreign nationals:    [Begin recording] [Lanxade] As things stand, we hold Kigali  airport in liaison with the Rwandan Armed Forces. This means  that we are able to land planes and bring in units, which we  will be continuing to do in the afternoon. We will then proceed  to transfer expatriates from their homes in the city to the  airport. You must realize that there are great difficulties at  the moment. There is fighting between the town and the airport,  so we need extra forces, which are on their way, in order to  ensure the security of this transfer.    [Boussie] What are you most afraid of in the coming hours?    [Lanzade] We fear an extension of the trouble in Kigali. In  the slightly longer term, we are very worried about a possible  resumption of fighting between Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  forces in the north of the country and the Rwandan armed forces.  We are worried that this fighting might take place near or even  in the city itself, and with a much higher level of fighting  than we are currently seeing. [end recording]</p>

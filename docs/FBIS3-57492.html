Meanwhile, combat operations also took place in the  northeast  of the front line. Azerbaijan's military forces tried to  penetrate the inner areas of Mardakertskiy and Kelbadzharskiy  Rayons. The NKR forces stopped them. The clashes elsewhere on  the front line took the form of positional fighting.  Azerbaijan's aircraft tried to violate NKR airspace yesterday.    The NKR freedom fighters hit six enemy armored vehicles in  the clashes in Mardakertskiy Rayon last night and destroyed two  of them. The enemy units left the bodies of their dead  colleagues and fled the battlefield.

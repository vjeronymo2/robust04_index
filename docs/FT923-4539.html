			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Time to inspire a palace revolution: Malcolm Rutherford thinks Britain should show its leadership qualities by creating an art park in central London based around Kensington Palace more ambitious than has gone before - to greet the approach of the second millennium. Here is a modest proposal which might go even further and create a market for art as well. There should be an art park, a mixture of public and private interests, stretching across a large part of some already established international art capital. The aim would be to bring artists, collectors, sellers and buyers more closely together. The idea is developed later in the article, but first some background. The underlying thesis - impossible to prove conclusively, but even harder to refute - is that demand for art will always exceed supply. You can see that in many ways. At the top end of the market Christie's can still sell a Titian for nearly Pounds 7.5m in spite of the recession. New galleries continue to open in different areas as recession hits the more traditional establishments. The paintings and drawings strung along the railings of London's Hyde Park on Sundays are a sign that interest is always there. Demand for viewing art, rather than buying it, also goes on rising. Official figures are not up-to-date, but show that the number of visitors to the main national museums and galleries in London went up from 10.3m in 1979 to 12.1m a decade later. Figures from the Policy Studies Institute suggest much higher increases in some of the regions. Anecdotal evidence would include the high attendance at the small, selective Manet Exhibition 'The Execution of Maximilian' at the National Gallery and the Magritte Exhibition at the Hayward. Others can supply their own evidence from Paris or New York, and note that where admission is free, not everyone is counted. Almost anything to do with art has a tendency to arouse public passions. The long-running dispute over the rights and wrongs of museum charges is one example. Another is the perennial argument over whether privately-owned paintings which come up for sale should be 'saved for the nation', and how. A new dispute has broken out over proposals by Nicholas Serota, gallery director, to split the Tate collection into foreign and British works. At first sight, this outline of rising public interest fits ill with the reports of falling profits and turnover at the main auction houses of Sotheby's and Christie's and the closure or financial difficulties of a growing number of private galleries in London's West End. There is clearly a price adjustment under way, but I suggest a deeper explanation: the demand is there, but the supply side isn't working. In broad terms, art holdings fall into the following categories: museums or other official institutions, such as churches and palaces; private galleries, which exhibit, buy and sell; corporate collections held, for example, by Pearson, Reuter and Robert Fleming; private collections, some of which are on show or on loan to exhibitions; random private holdings, mainly inherited, but sometimes bought ad hoc and occasionally a gift from the artist or a friendly gesture of encouragement by purchase. Leaving aside the right of an individual to collect and hold whatever piece of art he or she chooses, provided it is legally acquired, all those categories have their deficiencies. The problem of museums is well-documented. Essentially they hold more than they can show. Recall the story of the Corots in the Louvre - kept in an upstairs gallery and only brought to wider attention when exhibited elsewhere in Paris. The same could be said about Britain's Turners. The Tate can only show about one quarter of its collection at any time. The problem of private galleries, certainly in central London, is not dissimilar from that of other businesses in a recession. They may carry excessive overheads, be in the wrong place, open at the wrong times and be inaccessible to a new public. There is no reason why new galleries should not open elsewhere in line with the earlier revolution in the retail trade. Some have already done so. Corporate collections are a much under-studied and under-catalogued subject. Suffice it to say that some companies have made a point of collecting art and do not know what to with it. Private holdings are, of course, a private matter. Yet, it is striking in major shows that so many of the exhibits come from private collections or simply private owners. In the big Magritte exhibition at the Hayward, more than half the works fell into that category. Of the 108 paintings in the Allan Ramsay exhibition at this year's Edinburgh Festival, more than 30 were from private owners. There were 76 exhibits in the same festival's 'Dutch Art and Scotland'; 34 were privately held. Sometimes the owners are willing to be identified; sometimes, not. In the two Edinburgh cases cited, a majority withheld their names. The Queen lent to both. It is also clear from social observation that a sizeable number of people have works of art which, although they may not amount to a collection, are interesting or possibly valuable in their own right. Often the potential value was not and could not have been known when the piece was acquired. More of these private owners might like to have their paintings shown; some might like to consider selling. In theory, the auction firms exist as a clearing house when art changes hands. Yet one doubts how far they are an adequate means of developing a wider and more active market. Witness, by contrast, the success of The Guardian's 'Art for Sale' which puts artists in touch with potential buyers. The newspaper has found that it can hardly cope with demand: sellers and buyers rate it highly. It is the peculiar mix of public and private ownership that makes art different from other commodities. If there is to be a greater movement in the market - more on show, more to sell and more to buy - there will have to be some rearrangement of public and private interests. This is germane to the question of a new modern art gallery and underlines the need to be ambitious. Where should it be and how should it be run? The location will make sense only if it is close to, and can evolve from, an existing international art centre where museums, galleries, auction houses, a viewing and a buying public are already part of the tradition. It will also require space - masses of it. As it happens, there is an obvious candidate: London. By the standards of Paris, Rome or even parts of New York, London is not the most beautiful metropolis in the world, but it does have one superb, large and conveniently empty site. It stretches, with only a few obstacles, from St James's Park, Green Park, through Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens and, pushing it only a bit, on to Holland Park. It is already ringed with galleries, small and large, public, private and royal. The Queen's paintings, now partly open to the public, are nearby. The Royal Academy almost faces Green Park. There are some splendid galleries in the Mall, and the Royal College of Art looks on to Kensington Gardens. On Sundays the surroundings are full of artists peddling their wares. The great bulk of the parkland is untouched but not immune. There is the odd Henry Moore, the greatly under-used and under-ambitious Serpentine Gallery in the middle, and a few tiny galleries in and around Holland Park at the western end. In between there is the supreme prize of Kensington Palace which, with official permission, could be turned into a major gallery in its own right - almost the hub of the concept. Someone would have to co-ordinate the project, so let me define it more closely. A new gallery of modern art is too small a definition. A more accurate term would be a modern gallery of art, containing old as well, and not just one gallery but a string of them, indoors as well as out (for sculptures and itinerant artists). It would combine exhibiting and selling. That is why, however infelicitous, I have chosen the term art park. The co-ordinator would be appointed by the government. He or she would require wide powers - a bit like those for the opening up of Docklands. There would have to be co-operation with all sorts of bodies: the Queen (if Kensington Palace is to be secured), the local authorities, the trustees of existing museums who like to keep art rather than trade it. Some, although not many, new buildings will be needed. There might be a gallery to show corporate collections, and perhaps a place for private owners to exhibit their holdings. Smaller galleries could proliferate - as to some extent they have - in the areas round about. To help the co-ordinator, there must be a company in this country capable of running a theme park, and leasing galleries as franchises. There may also have to be changes in the law: some are on the way. Just before the last general election, Tim Renton, then arts minister, put through Parliament the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 which empowers the Tate to sell paintings and sculptures from its existing collection. Renton would have liked the Act to have gone further and extended to the National Gallery, but it is at least a start. The power to dispose does not, of course, rule out the power to acquire. On the contrary, the change in the law helps to create a market and provides greater freedom for gallery directors. I have deliberately said nothing in this article about the aesthetics of art: that is a matter of taste and fashion. Nor have I mentioned public funding: there is no reason to suppose that what I suggest would cost much additional money. It is more a question of better co-ordination and a change in attitudes. The opening up of a market would help artists and purchasers alike. The timing is ripe: not only the approach of the millennium, but the creation of the ministry of national heritage, which has been given an empire but not yet found a role. Should the area around the Serpentine prove too small, there are others available. Why not put paintings and sculptures in Regent's Park as the animals depart from the zoo? There could be no clearer acknowledgement of changing tastes. Renton has thoughts about Butler's Wharf, in London, where there is space aplenty, then on into Docklands. One final thought: if London does not take up the idea, somewhere someone else will. The outstanding candidate is Berlin, which has lots of money, lots of space, lots of art, and masses of ambition. Must the Germans lead?</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Northern rises to Pounds 39.5m and cuts tariffs - Two regional electricity companies report profit increases of more than 50% NORTHERN Electric, the Newcastle-based electricity company, yesterday became the first of the regional groups to announce a reduction in electricity tariffs for its 1.4m customers. The move came as the group reported a better-than-expected 52 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 and raised its interim dividend to 6.3p (5.55p). Northern's electricity tariffs will fall by an average of 2.7 per cent from the new year, with the domestic tariff cut by 3 per cent. Mr David Morris, chairman, rejected suggestions that the tariff reduction was designed to head off pressure from Offer, the industry regulator. Instead, he said the price cuts represented 'the first fruits of our sound management' which were being shared between customers and shareholders. He said the 'encouraging performance' in the first half 'has given us the confidence and security to pass on the benefits.' Interim pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 26m to Pounds 39.5m on turnover 9.5 per cent ahead at Pounds 394m (Pounds 360m) despite overall flat electricity unit sales. Earnings per share increased by 48 per cent to 23.8p. The year-on-year profit increase was mainly due to the absence of the 'unusually high' electricity purchase costs from generators in the first half last year. However, Mr Morris said the group's underlying profit growth 'remains in line with our expectations for the full year.' In the core electricity distribution business sales to domestic and commercial customers rose by 1.5 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. However, sales to industrial customers fell by 2.6 per cent, mainly in the mining and chemicals sectors, partly offset by modest growth in the engineering and manufacturing sectors. Operating profit in the distribution business improved to Pounds 43.6m despite a reduction in charges for use of the distribution system in April. COMMENT Northern's share price has begun to reflect the increased confidence investors now have in the new senior management team. Costs continue to be cut in real terms, its investment in the gas-fired power station being built at Wilton on Teesside looks sensible, and the balance sheet is in good shape with the Pounds 49.2m net cash inflow in the first half reducing debt to a modest Pounds 10m and gearing to 2.6 per cent - although this will rise at the year end. The biggest risk is that Northern will catch the regulator's eye. However, its return on assets is not out of line and a combination of tariff cuts and its enviable reputation for service performance should help keep customers sweet. Pre-tax profits this year could reach Pounds 115m-Pounds 120m, with earnings of 70p a share. Given the run-up in the share price, to 453p yesterday, this stock is not a bargain, but is still a buy.</p>

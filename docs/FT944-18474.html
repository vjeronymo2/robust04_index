			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Bonds, dollar fall on US inflation fears Financial markets took fright again yesterday as another economic indicator fuelled fears that the US economy was still growing faster than it could sustain without provoking a surge in inflation. The National Association of Purchasing Managers said its index rose from 56.2 per cent in August to 58.2 per cent in September, a level that usually indicates a strongly expanding economy. Mr Ralph Kauffman, head of procurement and materials management at Oryx Energy and chairman of the association's survey committee, said that on past experience an index level of 58.2 per cent, if it were sustained, would be consistent with an overall growth rate of around 4.9 per cent. The survey of purchasing managers also showed that almost all sectors of manufacturing industry were having to pay higher prices for their raw materials. Treasury bonds fell quickly in response to the NAPM results, and the dollar also slid against most major currencies. Many dealers believe the Federal Reserve has already been too slow to raise interest rates to choke off the expansion to a growth rate below 2.5 per cent, which the economy could absorb without succumbing to faster inflation. Among professional economists, however, more are inclined to believe that the Fed, by raising short term interest rates by 1 3/4 percentage points so far this year, has already done enough to engineer a 'soft landing,' steering the economy back to a sustainable pace of growth. Mr Kauffman said the NAPM's production index improved from 58.1 per cent in august to 61.2 per cent in September, while the new orders index rose from 60.7 per cent to 61.6 per cent. The leather, apparel, paper, fabricated metals, printing and publishing industries showed the biggest gains in September. The NAPM's price index rose from 74.5 per cent in August to 77.1 per cent in September, its highest level for six years. Of the 20 manufacturing sectors covered by the NAPM survey, 19 reported paying higher prices for their raw materials.</p>

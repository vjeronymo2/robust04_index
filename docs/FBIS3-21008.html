			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: "First Airplane Telephone Communications </F> Using the TFTS System"]    [Text] Paris--On 3 December, France Telecom sent its first  telephone communication using the European system TFTS  (Terrestrial Flight Telephone System) from a Paris-Athens flight  on Air France, according to a statement from the telephone  carrier.    The TFTS system makes it possible to establish telephone  communications--or to send faxes and data--from a plane to any  country by means of automatic dialing. The air-ground link is  directly established through specialized equipment aboard the  aircraft and a cellular network of stations on the ground, each  with a range of 240 km linked to the stationary telephone  network.    At the end of 1990, France Telecom joined with several  European telephone carriers to create a TFTS network that would  gradually cover all of Western Europe by 1994. The telephone  carriers are also working with six European airlines (Air France  for France) which will begin full-scale testing early next year  aboard their planes.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard cuts prices Hewlett-Packard, the US electronics manufacturer, is cutting the price of some of its desktop personal computers by up to 26 per cent. The move is seen as innovative for the company which, as one of the smaller producers of PCs, has previously taken the lead on price from its larger competitors. Hewlett-Packard said it was cutting prices across its Vectra range of PCs, and claimed it would undercut rivals Compaq and IBM by as much as 40 per cent for comparable machines. It is also cutting prices on its servers, used to link office PCs, by up to 22 per cent. The company said the cuts were made possible by increased manufacturing volume, distribution efficiencies, lower component prices and newly-expanded distribution channels. Last month, Hewlett-Packard announced a 60 per cent jump in fourth-quarter earnings, to Dollars 476m, on sales up 23 per cent. Chairman Mr Lew Platt cautioned that this exceptional rate of growth might not continue. The shares fell Dollars 3 to Dollars 95 yesterday.</p>

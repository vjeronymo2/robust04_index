			<p>CSO     [Text] The cable television (CATV) industry and new common  carriers will collaborate in experiments to integrate  broadcasting and communications, an effort which is considered  to be a precursor to multimedia. Twenty-two firms, including  CATV firms such as Tokyu Cable Television and new common  carriers such as DDI [Dainidenden], electrical equipment makers,  and trading companies will organize a consortium this week and  conduct experiments over a two-year period to identify potential  problems associated with commercialization of the concept. This  will be the first case in which CATV and new common carriers  interlink to form a combined communication network. Intracity  telephone networks are currently controlled by Nippon Telegraph  and Telephone (NTT), but if the new common carriers collaborate  with CATV firms with circuits reaching individual households and  establish nationwide networks, there is the potential to build a  system that rivals that of NTT. It appears that the broadcasting  and communications industries are about to reorganize based on  deregulation.    Aside from major CATV firms and the new common carriers,  firms participating in the experiments will be Kokusai Denshin  Denwa (KDD), manufacturers such as NEC and trading companies  such as Mitsui &amp; Co. and Secom, which has an interest in  remote  medical services via CATV. The Cable Television Conference, a  CATV industry organization, established a "full-service network  committee" as part of the conference on the 24th. The committee  will serve as the administrative arm of the conference to manage  the two-year experiment and will solicit participation by CATV  firms on a nationwide basis.    The experiments will consider links between CATV networks  and  communications networks of new common carriers. The results will  be used in the development of combined networks for use by fixed  telephone instruments, personal handyphone systems (PHS),  personal computer communications, and television shopping. Even  the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] is promoting  the concept.    Next-generation CATV that integrates broadcasting and  communications is considered one of the infrastructures  envisioning implementation of multimedia, and there are  scattered moves to commercialize the concept. A CATV firm in  Nagano Prefecture is experimenting with telephone services via  CATV and in Kansai the MOPT-sponsored conference is planning to  start a systems integration experiment using optical fiber  networks beginning this summer.</p>

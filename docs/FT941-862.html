			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Foster's nets ADollars 200m from Beswick Foster's Brewing, the Australian brewer which owns Courage in the UK, is to net a ADollars 200m (USDollars 142m) profit from a complex restructuring of its investment in Beswick, the joint venture company which holds 322m shares in Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest industrial group. However, the deal will also reinforce the Beswick arrangement, to BHP's longer-term benefit. Nearly one-fifth of BHP's equity will continue to be held through the joint venture, and Foster's will pledge to retain its 49.9 per cent voting interest in Beswick until the year 2010. BHP itself, which has a 50 per cent voting stake in Beswick, also 'intends to retain all of its interest'. Beswick was born out of the various bid plays which surrounded BHP in the late-1980s, and involved entrepreneurs like Mr John Elliott and the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court. Ahead of the restructuring, the BHP shares held by Beswick equalled about 19 per cent of the steel and natural resources group's equity. In turn, Beswick was 50 per cent-owed by BHP (in terms of voting rights). Foster's held 49.9 per cent and the residual interest was owned by ANZ Executors and Trustee Company. Due to the appreciation in BHP shares since 1988, the value of the Beswick holding has increased significantly. Foster's, which has sizeable borrowings, has been keen to realise this value. BHP, however, was unwilling to alter the Beswick ownership structure. The restructuring accommodates these conflicting desires. Beswick has issued new convertible redeemable preferences shares to all three ordinary shareholders, on a one-for-10 basis. Virtually all the 'economic value' of the Beswick stakes has transfered to the new preference shares, so that the only real significance of the ordinary shares in the future is their unchanged voting rights. Beswick plans to sell about 15m BHP shares on the stockmarket, in order to redeem the bulk of Foster's preference shares. This will result in a cash payment to Foster's of around ADollars 245m, and a net profit to the brewing group of about ADollars 200m. Foster's will continue to hold a small number of Beswick preference shares, plus the original ordinary shares. The value of that remaining holding will be ADollars 73m, equal to Foster's initial investment in Beswick back in 1988. Foster's will commit itself to retaining its ordinary shares in Beswick until 2010 - compared with the previous agreed date of 1996 - but will be able to sell more of its remaining preference shares at five-year intervals. Beswick, meanwhile, will retain 307m BHP shares. BHP said that it intended to retain all of its interest in Beswick, both ordinary and preference shares.</p>

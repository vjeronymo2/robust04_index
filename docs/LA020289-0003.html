			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDING NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION  </P> <P> Christopher's column makes a compelling case for halting further proliferation  of nuclear weapons. Regrettably, he overlooks one obvious recommendation: Our  government should accept Mikhail Gorbachev's standing offer to immediately end  all further testing of nuclear warheads. In fact, we and the Soviets promised  we'd do just that when we signed the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  </P> <P> The truth is that we lack authority to bring about an end to nuclear  proliferation when we continue to test these hideous weapons.  </P> <P> LARRY AGRAN  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

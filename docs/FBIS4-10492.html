			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former General Jesus Armando Arias Cabrales </F> by Sandra Vergara; place and date not given; from the "Noticiero  Nacional" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Vergara] Do you feel responsible for the civilians  reported missing or killed in the Justice Palace takeover?    [Arias] I do not feel responsible, nor do any of my men. We  have never felt responsible for the situation. The  responsibilities we assumed were determined by operational  directives and dictated by our commanders. Of course some  people died, but everyone tends to forget or they neglect to  mention that the public forces' actions allowed us to rescue  more than 250 hostages.    [Vergara] Do you feel like the scapegoat for this whole  thing?    [Arias] Yes, I think so, judging from the results of the  Attorney General's Office investigation, meaning the resolutions  issued in 1989 implying that Colonel Edilberto Sanchez and  General Arias were the only ones at the Justice Palace. This is  not a matter of blaming someone else. The investigation should  have been more thorough and decisions should have been based on  the facts.</p>

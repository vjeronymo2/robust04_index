			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Kugelfischer to cut workforce 40% FAG Kugelfischer, the large German ball-bearings manufacturer, yesterday announced a major restructuring plan in the face of serious liquidity difficulties and large losses. The company is planning to cut its workforce by more than 40 per cent, from 31,000 to 18,000. It aims to do this by selling off non-core businesses with turnover of DM800m (Dollars 506.3m) and by cutting 6,500 jobs from the remaining businesses. The company disclosed that it made a loss of DM330m last year on turnover of DM3.6bn, down from DM3.9bn. It blamed 'the most intense and prolonged worldwide economic downturn since the (second world) war,' exacerbated by weakness in demand for investment goods, the collapse in demand from the former Soviet Union, and the problems of the German car industry. A special factor was the catastrophic acquisition of an east German ball-bearing business from the Treuhand privatisation agency in late 1990. Kugelfischer disclosed that Chemnitz-based DKFL Deutsche Kugellagerfabriken lost DM142m in 1991 on turnover of DM113m, and last year made similar losses on scarcely increased sales. Kugelfischer is more than 100 years old and is still controlled by the Schafer family. It came to the stock market in 1985, after which it pursued an aggressive acquisitions programme. It now plans to reverse this strategy and concentrate on the core roller-bearings, textile and extraction technologies. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the former chief executive of Hoesch, is to be appointed as supervisory board chairman to oversee the restructuring. He has been acting as 'company doctor' for some months and has led negotiations with the company's banking creditors, believed to be owed hundreds of millions of D-Marks. Mr Neukirchen said that banks had agreed to provide liquidity support. He predicted the level of operating losses would be cut substantially by the end of the current year and that the group would again be making an operating profit.</p>

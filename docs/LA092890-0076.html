			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TAKEOFF PATTERN MAY MUFFLE JET NOISE IN EL SEGUNDO  </P> <P> El Segundo residents hope to get relief from jet noise at Los Angeles  International Airport when an experimental takeoff procedure starts next month.  </P> <P> The new procedure, directed at airliners that make early turns on takeoff, will  require departing pilots to delay the start of their left-hand turns until they  are nearly one mile offshore. In the past, turns have been initiated  approximately at the shoreline.  </P> <P> The flight procedure takes effect Oct. 18 and will continue through February.  </P> <P> Airport officials contend that fewer than 4% of the daily takeoffs turn over El  Segundo or the adjoining Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. El Segundo, however,  has long complained about the noise problem, which occurs as planes departing  westward from the airport head for destinations to the south or east.  </P> <P> The plan adds one mile to the point at which planes are required to have  completed the turn. That distance has been increased from two miles to three.  </P> <P> Hours for the test are 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 3 to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> According to LAX noise abatement officer Robert Beard, this will be the fifth  attempt to solve the early turn problem since 1986. The new procedure  supersedes a current test, which began Aug. 23, in which turns are initiated  shortly beyond the shoreline but still must be completed within two miles.  </P> <P> El Segundo Mayor Carl Jacobson said all previous attempts were "doomed to  failure" because they had the two-mile limit for completing turns.  </P> <P> "This one has a chance of working," he said. "If they go out one mile (before  turning), they will not turn over the city."  </P> <P> As a gesture of optimism and good faith, the city will cover up its hillside  "Unsafe Area for Jets" sign that was put up at the end of 1988 to discourage  early turns. "We're not removing it," Jacobson said. "This is a test."  </P> <P> Fred O'Donnell, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, said that at the  end of the test period, the agency will look at results of both the test that  began in August and the new one starting in October.  </P> <P> He said the agency will determine "which one can be safely done . . . in regard  to managing aircraft and satisfying" the needs of El Segundo.  </P> <P> Both LAX and El Segundo hope the test extending turns by one mile proves  successful and that the FAA approves it as part of the permanent takeoff  procedure.  </P> <P> Beard said the airport's informal noise abatement procedure has been for  aircraft taking off to the west to fly past the shoreline before beginning  turns. However, the procedure has been visual and some pilots have said they  could not see the shoreline.  </P> <P> Under the October experiment, a signal will alert them to start the turn when  they are nearly a mile offshore.  </P> <P> In another development relating to airport noise, El Segundo will buy a  $245,000 house in the neighborhood closest to the airport runway to use as a  demonstration project for residential soundproofing. The city entered into a  60-day escrow Sept. 15 to purchase the Hillcrest Avenue home.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are apprehensive about sound treatment, particularly the  aesthetics of it," said Don Harrison, assistant to the city manager. He said  the house will allow "people to see what it is they would be getting" if they  soundproof their homes using current technology.  </P> <P> The $511,000 demonstration project includes the cost to purchase the home and  do soundproofing. Harrison said that, if there is money left over, other homes  may be soundproofed. The city on Monday will receive a $408,800 FAA grant and  provide the remainder of the funds to reach the project total.  </P> <P> The money is the first installment in a long-term FAA matching grant for which  the city has applied. All told, El Segundo is seeking $23 million to soundproof  up to 700 homes.  </P></p>

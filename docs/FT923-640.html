			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / EC leaders warn UK over ERM re-entry: Call for reform of monetary system rejected by European partners CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany and four other European leaders last night warned Britain it will have to negotiate with its EC partners on a suitable parity for sterling, should it wish to re-enter the European exchange rate mechanism. After talks in Brussels, the leaders also rebuffed the British government's calls for reforming the ERM and declared they were determined to press ahead with monetary union for all 12 EC members and ratification of the Maastricht treaty, 'if possible by the end of the year'. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has blamed 'fault-lines' in the ERM for the withdrawal of sterling. He intends to present a case for EMS reform at the European Council summit in Birmingham next month, but last night's meeting of influential Christian Democrats in Brussels suggests he will get a frosty reception. The meeting was a gathering of Christian Democrats from across the Community. It included Mr Kohl, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, Luxembourg prime minister Jacques Santer, Greek prime minister Constantin Mitsotakis and Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. Mr Wilfred Martens, the former Belgian prime minister, speaking on behalf of his colleagues, said: 'The EMS is not deficient. You have to accept the logic of the system. Sometimes a realignment is necessary.' In a joint 10-point statement clearly aimed at Britain and Italy, which also withdrew from the mechanism, the leaders said the EMS 'should be maintained and its rules applied correctly'. Italy has pledged an early return to the EMS, but Mr Major told the British parliament this week that: 'I do not believe that we shall be able to go back into the mechanism soon or into the same mechanism we left'. Mr Martens confirmed that the joint statement meant that Britain would have to renegotiate terms of re-entry into the ERM. The UK would also have to take into account its real competitiveness - something which, he implied, the UK had failed to do when it decided unilaterally to enter at DM2.95 to the pound, a level which many judge to have been to favourable to sterling. Earlier Chancellor Kohl warned in a speech to the Bundestag that no European country could 'go it alone' without putting their monetary and economic stability at risk. In a thinly veiled reference to British ambivalence to the Maastricht treaty and its withdrawal from the ERM, Mr Kohl declared: 'No-one in Europe - and I repeat, no one - should labour under the illusion that he is in a position to go it alone.' The Chancellor won support from Germany's leading political parties for moving ahead as planned to ratify the Maastricht treaty by the end of the year. On arrival in Brussels, Mr Kohl dampened recent speculation of a possible Franco-German initiative to accelerate moves European monetary union and form a club which would include the Benelux countries. Earlier yesterday it was announced that Mr Major would hold bilateral talks with Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, sometime later this week, but no date seems to have been fixed. The summit of Christian Democrat leaders from Belgium, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg and the Netherlands rejected talk of a 'two-speed' Europe. In their joint statement, the leaders said that 'all EC member states' needed to take the necessary measures to meet the strict criteria for monetary union laid down by the Maastricht treaty. Mr Martens pointedly reminded journalists at a news conference that as a member of the EMS, Belgium had taken 'courageous' steps in 1982 and agreed to devalue the Belgian franc. By taking these measures, Belgium had regained its competitiveness and its credibility as a member of the EMS, he said. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, warned earlier this week that Britain would have to bargain before re-entering the ERM. During the Bundestag debate, Germany's leading political parties showed unusual unity and agreed to meet the December deadline for treaty ratification. set in Maastricht last year. However a member of the central council of the Bundesbank warned that European union could not be achieved as was scheduled before the end of the century. Although Mr Nolling was expressing a personal view, his intervention on the day the Bundestag and the Bundesrat met to start ratification debates suggests continuing tensions over European union between the hard-headed pragmatists in Frankfurt and politicians in Bonn.

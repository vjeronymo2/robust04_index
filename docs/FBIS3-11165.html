What follows is a conversation between CLARIN and CILFA  [Argentine Pharmaceutical Laboratories Industrial Center]  Director Pablo Challu, former secretary of commerce in the  Carlos Menem administration.    [CLARIN] In view of the latest U.S. pressures, will CILFA  continue to oppose the patents law, or will it advocate a  negotiated solution?    [Challu] The climate for a patents law has changed  dramatically, because at the end of 1993 Argentina, the United  States, and other countries signed the GATT agreement which  includes a chapter dedicated to pharmaceutical patents.  Argentina will honor and fulfill that international agreement,  as it should, and will have a patents law by the end of 1994.    [CLARIN] We no longer have any conflict, then.    [Challu] It is not that simple. We (CILFA) ask countries  that have signed the agreement -- and among them the United  States and its laboratories -- to respect the agreement.    [CLARIN] You want Argentine laboratories' acquired rights  recognized?    [Challu] The agreement recognizes the exclusive rights of  the  laboratory that develops a drug. We accept this. The agreement  also establishes a series of exceptions and the possibility of  granting licenses. This provision will guarantee, through the  appropriate legislation, the existence of sufficient competition  in the market. The agreement also establishes a transition of  11 years for developing countries before the full implementation  of the measure. This is natural, because developing countries  were granted a period of transition of between 30 to 40 years to  end their agricultural subsidies.    [CLARIN] Which is the main hurdle blocking a solution to  this  conflict?    [Challu] The problem is that we accept the GATT agreement,  with all its consequences, but foreign laboratories do not  understand it that way. That is the problem. There is haste,  and we suffer pressures. Why do they refuse to wait until the  end of the year, and want a law now? Because they have the  possibility of threatening us with unilateral economic  sanctions. At the end of the year, when all congresses in the  world approve a similar law, the possibility of imposing  economic sanctions will end.    [CLARIN] Is one of the sanctions the refusal to let  Argentina  join NAFTA?    [Challu] We understand it to be an unacceptable argument. It  would be reasonable to expect concessions in exchange for  something else within NAFTA. But it would be absurd to accept  what they are requesting without offering anything in exchange.    [CLARIN] Will you continue to work on the issue at  Government  House and in Congress? Six months ago you met with the  president.    [Challu] They heard our arguments carefully. But now things  have changed, because we signed the GATT agreement. This is why  we are today telling the United States and foreign laboratories,  which are always telling us to continue on the legal path, that  today the legal path is to respect GATT.    [CLARIN] Is it necessary to introduce changes into the draft  bill now in Congress in order to accommodate the GATT principles?    [Challu] We must introduce a series of changes in the bill  to  include the transition period and the flexibility to grant  licenses.    [CLARIN] What will happen if Congress approves a law that  meets all U.S. requirements?    [Challu] Consumers will foot the bill. Medicine prices will  increase between 250 and 300 percent, not in the long term but  immediately, as happened in Italy when a patents law was  approved. Besides, the bill will affect the balance of payments,  because we will have to pay some $500 million annually to the  United States over patents, instead of the $30 million we  currently pay. Besides, at this time we have a balance of trade  deficit of $3 billion with the United States.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Brigadier Tryggwe Tellefsen, </F> UNPROFOR commander in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,  by Aleksandar Damovski, place and date not given: "NATO Base --  A Threat to Peace"]    [Text] The fifth month of Norwegian General Brigadier  Tryggwe Tellefsen's command of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] has passed. Unlike his predecessor, Gen. Tellefsen gives  the impression of being a real soldier for whom the "Holy Bible"  is the performance of his orders. In a steadfast military  atmosphere, backed by a framed tourist propaganda advertisement  for Macedonia and the horns of a reindeer from his homeland, we  had talks with the general.    He is far more retired from the public than his predecessor,  but Gen. Tellefsen considers the preventive mission of the UN  peacekeeping forces in Macedonia to be a very wise solution.  From the discussions he has held with the state authorities of  Macedonia, he concluded that they also consider the UNPROFOR  presence to be a stabilizing factor in the country.    [Tellefsen] The development of the UN mission so far has  been very positive and I am really glad to inform you that the  situation in the regions of the borders with Serbia and Albania  is calm and stable.    [Damovski] Knowing the Macedonian neighborhood, there are  continual scenarios for the spread of the war. Is Macedonia  threatened with war from any direction?    [Tellefsen] For the time being, I can see no signs of a  possible military threat to Macedonia from the regions under our  observation. The challenges and problems we are facing are  related to the border with Serbia. Lately, we have noted  increased military activity on the Serbian side of the border.  The Macedonian authorities have been informed about all that on  a timely basis, as well as our Command in Zagreb. We have noted  small groups of soldiers of the Serbian Army moving around the  Macedonian border region. This is something that worries me.  <H5>  Stabilizing Factor </H5>   [Damovski] In your latest statement for Macedonian  Television, you said that there are 140 km of border between  Macedonia and Serbia that are disputable. At least for now,  both sides, that is the Macedonian authority and the previous  UNPROFOR commander for Macedonia have said that only some minor  sections of the border with our northern neighbor are  disputable. Why do you think that such a great part of the  border is disputable?    [Tellefsen] The peacekeeping forces in Macedonia operate on  the border in conformity with the border that was agreed as an  inter-republic border in the former Yugoslavia in 1945. We  started our operation knowing that only a small part of that  border was disputable. However, our observations say that,  until now, 140 km of the border has been infringed by Serbian  soldiers. In that context, I visited Nis [in Serbia] recently,  for a second meeting with the Serbian military representatives,  in order to ask about the Serbian activities on the border. We  had a really fruitful discussion with the Serbian military  commander, who told me they were holding military exercises of  the reserve staff. According to what he said, the presence of  the reserve staff, who do not know the terrain well, was the  reason for an increased number of border incidents.  Nevertheless, it is clear that those exercises are not meant  for any kind of preparations for military activities in  Macedonia. Therefore, according to those incidents, it emerges  that 140 km of the border are disputable. From my point of  view, as well as from the point of view of the Macedonian  authorities, there is only a small section of the border that is  disputable.    We reported all such border incidents by the Serbian  soldiers  on time, but our mandate does not give us the right to arrest  those soldiers, therefore we only followed them and then we  reported in detail to the Macedonian authorities. Of course,  the fact that the border line has not been marked represents a  problem to my soldiers, too. Our task is to avoid any critical  situation on the border. We also agreed that the Serbian  commander will inform me about any military activities in the  border region on a timely basis.    [Damovski] Did you inform the competent Macedonian bodies  about this meeting?    [Tellefsen] Yes, the Macedonian defense minister [Vlado  Popovski] was informed about it, before and after the meeting.  Perhaps we shall have to meet the Serbian side on other  occasions. The military exercises are still under way, and if  they do not stop soon I shall go to Nis again to ask about the  exercises and about the possibility of establishing telephone  contact.    [Damovski] If you agree with the assessment that there is a  great difference between the assignments of the peacekeeping  forces on the territories of former Yugoslavia, what is your  opinion about a change in the UNPROFOR mandate for Macedonia?    [Tellefsen] The ways we operate in Bosnia, Croatia, and  Macedonia are based on resolutions. The first resolution  implied a traditional peacekeeping mission in Croatia in four  zones, then the humanitarian operation in Bosnia followed, and  then the preventive assignment, to stop the spread of conflicts  to Macedonia. If we are looking for possible successes, I  consider that we have learnt a lot from the UN operation in  Macedonia. We have learnt that this is perhaps the ideal way of  solving the problems.    At the same time, a UN operation in former Yugoslavia  without  particular mandates would have its advantages -- the possibility  of moving troops from one area to another, if necessary. For  instance, every week, we send military observers from here to  Bosnia, depending on the situation.    Our mandate here is to be a stabilizing factor and to  demonstrate the presence of UN forces. The presence of the  multinational structure of UN soldiers in Macedonia demonstrates  to the world and the neighboring countries that the world  community wants Macedonia to be independent. Therefore, our  stay here represents a great experience for us.    [Damovski] Have the Macedonian Government or UNPROFOR  Command proposed a change to the mandate of the peacekeeping  forces in Macedonia?    [Tellefsen] We are holding continual discussions about the  mandate, particularly before the end of the six months' period  of the agreement with the country. The last time was in March  when we extended the mandate of 1 April in conformity with the  situation in Macedonia -- by Article 12 of Resolution 908, Mr.  Akashi has the authority to use his "good services to contribute  to the maintenance of peace and stability in this republic."  This is a somewhat broader than the operation of the military  forces on the borders with Serbia and Albania. From my meetings  with representatives of the Macedonian authorities, I can  conclude that their opinion is that the mandate should remain  unchanged.  <H5>  I Do Not See a Threat From Greece </H5>   [Damovski] We have heard several requests by the Democratic  Party of the Serbs in Macedonia for the arrival of Russian  soldiers within the framework of the UN forces in Macedonia.  What is your opinion about this request?    [Tellefsen] According to the present UNPROFOR mandate in  Macedonia, the present number of troops is quite sufficient.  The combination of the troops from the Nordic countries  together with the U.S. contingent, from what is probably the  most powerful military force in the world today, is really good.  I do not find it necessary to change the configuration of the  UN force.    [Damovski] The same party recently released some  "confidential information" about the arrival of 2,000 Turkish  troops in Macedonia, again under the command of the United  Nations!?    [Tellefsen] Nobody has discussed that with me. I have no  information about that.    [Damovski] I can conclude that, for you, it is very  important to maintain the multinational structure of the blue  helmets in Macedonia. Yet, after the arrival of 500 U.S.  troops, that structure has been quite disturbed.    [Tellefsen] That proportion has been now balanced -- we have  around 500 U.S. troops and the same number of soldiers from the  Scandinavian countries. We should maintain that proportion.    [Damovski] Are there any problems with the U.S. troops in  the coordination and command?    [Tellefsen] No. I am impressed with the way the U.S. troops  succeeded in fully accomplishing the UN peacekeeping mission.  Usually, a soldier is trained for work in war conditions.  However, it is even a greater challenge for each soldier to  operate in a peacekeeping mission.    [Damovski] With the arrival of the U.S. troops there were  rumors about the establishment of a NATO base in Macedonia. The  great size of the U.S. military delegations just heated these  stories. Is there any truth in these rumors?    [Tellefsen] As far as I know -- no. After taking over the  command in Macedonia, I have had meetings with quite a number of  U.S. delegations. We never mentioned such a possibility during  those discussions.    [Damovski] Do you find it necessary to construct a NATO base  in Macedonia?    [Tellefsen] Knowing the situation here -- no. Tension  should be decreased here, not increased.    [Damovski] Does it mean that, in your opinion, the  establishment of a NATO base in Macedonia would increase tension  in the region?    [Tellefsen] In the present situation -- yes.    [Damovski] Why?    [Tellefsen] Aware of the fact that the 250 km of the border  with Serbia is related to a state that does not recognize  Macedonia, the construction of a NATO military base here could  be taken as a threat. We know that the Macedonian military  forces are not capable of facing the Serbian military....  Therefore, I think that it would not be a wise action. As far  as I know, the Macedonian authorities are directed toward the  CSCE and to Macedonia's membership in the European structures.    [Damovski] Macedonia has not been recognized by Greece yet.  Does it mean that military threats can be also expected from  that side? Have you ever viewed the possibility of shifting a  number of your soldiers to the Macedonian-Greek border?    [Tellefsen] No. I see no military threat from Greece. So  far, there have not been any discussions about shifting the  peacekeeping forces to that part of the border. I see the  problem with Greece as an economic problem and a problem related  to the name and flag. Such problems should be solved by  diplomats and politicians, not by soldiers.    [Damovski] Here is a hypothetical question. If Macedonia is  attacked militarily, what will your orders to your soldiers be?    [Tellefsen] If I am the commander in such a situation, I  would like to see another kind of UN military forces. However,  today we are a tiny blue line drawn alone the border region with  Serbia and Albania. We are here to observe and inform, not to  arrest, fight, or defend the borders of Macedonia. If we are  faced with such a situation, then some other UN military forces  will be present here. I cannot see anybody preparing to attack  Macedonia. If there are such preparations, there will be many  signs of that. However, for the moment, there are no such  signals. Any attack against Macedonia would also mean killing  soldiers from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the United  States, and from 25 other nations.... Everybody should take  that fact into account!</p>

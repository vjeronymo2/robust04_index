			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Smart card takes charge of meter EVEN THE traditional British gas meter looks set to be replaced by a high-tech alternative. British Gas, together with Landis &amp; Gyr Energy Management, of Telford, has developed a smart card system, called Quantum, which is now on trial and looks set to replace the coin meter. To use the system the gas consumer takes a gas card to a newsagent or convenience store where the shopkeeper credits gas on to the card through a counter-top charging unit - a minimum of Pounds 1 or a maximum of Pounds 9 can be put on the card. Information from the newsagent is collected by the British Gas regional accounting centre over the phone network on a daily basis. By inserting the card in the 'slot', the user can see the amount of gas credited on a liquid crystal display incorporated into the unit. As gas is used, the amount credited drops.

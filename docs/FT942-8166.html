			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Markets: Equities fail to respond to good news - London Having raised expectations of the positive effects of a tightening of US interest rates, the City appeared rather underwhelmed when the Fed obliged by lifting its short-term rates by the full half-point which the markets had sought. One reason was that the continuing weakness of the dollar will postpone the arrival of stability in global bond markets, which seems a necessary condition for a significant advance by equities. News that average earnings growth had risen to 4 per cent last month also killed any lingering hopes of an early cut in UK interest rates, even although the increase from the previous month's level of 3.75 per cent largely reflected bonuses and overtime payments. However, most of the week's economic indicators were positive. Unemployment fell last month to 2.68m, its lowest level for two years, and the underlying rate of growth in retail prices also came down unexpectedly, from 2.4 per cent in March to 2.3 per cent. Consumers appear to have coped - so far - with the impact of last month's tax increases. Barclaycard said spending had begun to rise again following a slight drop when customers received their pay packets last month. A rise in retail sales to 4.4 per cent, year on year, also suggested that consumer spending was proving robust, although analysts cautioned that it would be summer before the real impact of the tax increases was clear. A longer-term concern was highlighted by news that the ratio of savings to gross domestic product last year fell to the lowest level since the second world war - putting the UK at the bottom of the 24-nation OECD league for national saving ratios. Although the level of private sector savings has been increasing recently, this has been more than offset by the sharp deterioration of public sector finances. Robert Fleming Securities warns that this debt level is likely to undermine hopes for an investment-led recovery. The stockbroker says it is complacent to assume that the UK can run a perennial current account deficit, increasingly financed by bank borrowing from overseas. 'Such money flows are notoriously fickle . . . Competition for variable short-term funds depends critically on currency expectations. This inter-relationship between exchange-rates and short-term interest rates could easily turn the tide of short-term UK base rates, even though inflation remains low.' The results front was generally upbeat, with BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group, reporting that economic recovery in the US and Australia had boosted sales. Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, gave the market a surprise by raising its interim dividend, from 2.85p to 3p. Lord Hanson, chairman, said 'our return to profit growth at the operating level is now established.' While some analysts welcomed this demonstration of confidence, others fretted that the group was further stretching its already low dividend cover. Some suspect that Hanson is anxious to push up its share price, to fund new acquisitions. Hanson's dividend generosity was put into perspective, however, by National Power, the UK's biggest electricity generator, which raised its pay-out by a hefty 18 per cent. In spite of a sharp decline in its market share, National Power said the recent cap on prices in the electricity pool would not be material. A less blase view of regulatory pressures came from British Telecommunications, which saw its annual operating profits increase by less than 3 per cent, in spite of a 6 per cent increase in inland call volumes. Turnover rose only 1.9 per cent because BT was obliged last year and this to cut its prices by 7.5 per cent, after allowing for inflation. Concern over regulatory pressure and competition meant BT's share price had declined by nearly 20 per cent against the FT-A All-Share index over the last year. The shares closed 16 1/2 p higher on the week, as the market concluded these fears may have been overdone. Growing regulatory pressure and competition led to a drop in British Gas's first-quarter profits, from Pounds 650m to Pounds 634m. Richard Giordano, chairman, warned again that full-year profits were likely to be below 1993 and said uncertainty over the regulatory environment made it inappropriate to comment on dividend prospects. The brewers' reporting season continued with Whitbread managing to increase pre-tax profits by 32 per cent. Lower beer sales were offset by a strong performance from its pub food, restaurant and leisure operations. Bass, the UK's biggest brewer, is more exposed to the beer market and it said the amount of beer sold through Bass Taverns fell, as did the group's brewing volume. However, the group also benefited from increased sales of food and a profits recovery in the Holiday Inn hotel chain. Gains in spirits and retailing helped Allied-Lyons to offset a weak performance by the Carlsberg-Tetley brewing joint venture, formed in 1992. One spirit did particularly well: there was a 25 per cent increase in sales of Beefeater Gin, which the group has kept at its full strength of 40 per cent alcohol by volume - in spite of a decision by most other gin makers to reduce the strength of their domestic gin to 37.5 per cent, saving 34p a bottle in excise duty. Beefeater's market share increased last year from 5.6 per cent to 6.6 per cent, while the share of Gordon's - the Guiness brand which is the market leader - slipped from 48 to 47 per cent. In days of yore brewers and publicans were sometimes suspected of watering the workers' beer. It appears that diluting the executive's G &amp; T is no less hazardous.</p>

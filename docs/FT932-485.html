			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / US Supreme Court rules in favour of trial for Lloyd's underwriters THE US Supreme Court yesterday ruled that Lloyd's underwriters and US insurance companies should face trial over allegations brought by 19 states that they colluded to boycott certain types of insurance, write George Graham in Washington and Louise Kehoe in California. The court rejected by a 5-4 vote the insurers' argument that the US could not extend its antitrust jurisdiction to the London underwriters, and ruled that the boycott alleged by the states would remove the insurers' exemption from antitrust laws.</p>

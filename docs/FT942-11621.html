			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Venezuela dollar auctions: Move aims to stabilise foreign exchange market Venezuela's central bank yesterday initiated an auction system under which commercial banks and exchange houses can obtain dollars from the government through a daily bidding process. The system, aimed at stabilising the foreign exchange market, falls short of direct controls on exchange transactions but nonetheless represents a restriction on sales of dollars by the government. It was implemented after several days of heavy dollar purchases and an 8.6 per cent fall in the Venezuelan bolivar between April 26 and May 3. In the auction, the dollar was sold at 129.39 bolivars, implying a further 0.7 devaluation of the currency from Tuesday, the smallest daily decline in the past week. No details about the amount sold were available, however. Until April 26, when Mrs Ruth de Krivoy shocked investors by resigning as president of Venezuela's central bank, the bank openly sold dollars under a crawling peg system. After Mr Antonio Casas was named to replace her, the bank began restricting dollar sales, provoking a new wave of nervousness in the foreign exchange market and renewing fears of exchange controls. Some bankers fear that dollar sales over the last week may have reached Dollars 600m or more, compared with total dollar sales of Dollars 327m in March. The bank has not yet published figures on dollar sales and the international reserve position for April. The bolivar's sharp devaluation over the past week is already creating problems for the government of President Rafael Caldera, which is trying to hold down price increases. Businessmen say prices will rise for any products that have imported components.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / 'We found the dogs and are burning them' THE SMELL of roasting human flesh hung in the air. A crowd of 20 with spears, axes and stones gathered round three burning bodies lying behind refuse bins. 'Sizitholile Izinja. Siyazitshisa,' they chanted. 'We found the dogs and we are burning them. Viva, ANC Viva.' The victims - two men and a woman - were supporters of Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Shots and screams indicated more killings nearby. There was no sign of police. I have lived in the township of Kathlehong for all my 36 years, but I have never seen such savagery as I witnessed on Monday night and yesterday morning as I went to rescue my sister, who was trapped in her home deep in the battle zone. It is impossible to keep track of casualties in Kathlehong and nearby Thokoza. Police say 69 have died in three days. Residents speak of hundreds. To get through the carnage I had to plead with armed youths, many no more than 16, who wanted everything - my car, money and petrol to make bombs. 'Tell the world there is also a Sarajevo here,' said one when I said I was a journalist. 'It is a shame that we are made to go through this,' my sister said when I reached her. 'This country boasts some of Africa's most enlightened leaders, but where are they when people die like flies?' Violence exploded in the townships near Johannesburg following last Friday's announcement of a date for an election which is meant to liberate blacks from 350 years of white domination. The immediate cause appears to have been the ambush of a funeral procession when it passed a hostel populated by Inkatha supporters on Saturday. But the political tensions building ahead of next April's elections are such that it needs only a spark to ignite a conflagration. Black leaders such as the ANC's Nelson Mandela blame apartheid for much of the violence that has claimed 9,000 lives since the white minority government began dismantling racial segregation in 1990. Residents say the police have done nothing to halt the killings. They abandon the townships as darkness falls, and only return at dawn to collect the bodies.</p>

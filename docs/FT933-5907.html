			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Print union responds to pay threat AN END to all national agreements in the printing industry next year is being threatened by the main print union. Mr Tony Dubbins, the Graphical Paper and Media Union's general secretary, warned yesterday that if the employers body, the British Printing Industries Federation, decided to opt out of industry-wide wage bargaining for 1994, as it has done this year, the union would pull out of all national-level deals. This would mean the end of the union's participation in existing arrangements with the employers' federation on training, efficiency and productivity, disputes procedures, and health and safety. 'If the federation do opt out, then next year's campaign will make this year's look like a picnic,' Mr Dubbins said. 'The employers can either return to the stability of a national agreement which has served the industry so well in the past or they can opt for the uncertainty of another year of plant-by-plant haggling.' This year the employers' federation, which represents 2,600 printing companies and negotiates directly and indirectly over pay for an estimated 80,000 workers, decided for the first time not to have a national wage agreement with the union. What concerns the union is that the federation might not return to a national pay agreement for 1994. The federation has just sent out a policy document to its affiliate companies to explain the advantages and disadvantages of national pay bargaining for the printing industry. It argues that 'more and more companies want to make their own decisions about pay and conditions and not leave it to the federation's negotiating team'. The document also suggests that union demands for longer holidays and higher minimum wage rates might produce national deals at a level member companies can neither afford nor accept. It adds that strategic objectives such as a widening of pay differentials, the creation of more flexibility in the workplace and cuts in unit labour costs can no longer be dealt with at national level. The federation says, however, that national deals have brought stability to the printing industry and have enabled companies to save resources by negotiating pay for them. Such deals have also prevented wage undercutting between companies and achieved wage settlements that have prevented wage escalation. But the document makes it clear that the federation's industrial relations strategy review group is not in favour of returning to a national pay agreement next year. Mr Colin Stanley, federation director general, denied that the document was biased against national wage bargaining. 'We have been very careful to produce a balanced document for our members,' he said yesterday. 'This is not a campaign for a 'no' to a national agreement.' He added that the federation's governing board would decide what to do on September 28 after more than 46 district meetings across the country had sounded out company opinion. Yesterday the federation said just less than half its members had reported details of their pay agreements for this year. It said that two thirds of its membership had settled for less than the union's claim of Pounds 6.50 a week plus an extra day of holiday. The union said, however, that 1,800 companies had met its demands in full.</p>

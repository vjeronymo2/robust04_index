			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: BUILDING ON OLD IDEAS FOR NEW TRACT  </P> <P> Driving the streets of San Diego's newest tract neighborhoods, one gets a sense  of something missing.  </P> <P> Sidewalks seem barren without the tree-lined, grass median strips common to  older neighborhoods. Most of the new homes don't have porches, lessening the  sidewalks' once-integral role in the social scene.  </P> <P> And stylistically, the Mediterranean look has been done to death.  </P> <P> But David Minter wants to change that.  </P> <P> Three years ago, the architect and developer moved here from Austin, Tex., and  one of his first projects was a speculative house in La Jolla. He chose the  predictably safe Mediterranean approach, and the home sold quickly.  </P> <P> But, during his first months in San Diego, Minter developed a love of the  city's older neighborhoods and wanted to save that look and feel. He chose the  developing community of EastLake as his venue.  </P> <P> "The primary concept is that the street is part of the neighborhood and part of  the house," Minter said. "We didn't want to turn our backs on it."  </P> <P> The idea was to create a warm, traditional streetscape, with a progression of  inviting landscape elements between the curb and front door: grass medians  planted with trees (in this case magnolias), sidewalks, large front lawns,  prominent porches.  </P> <P> When he bought eight lots in Chula Vista, he and executives at EastLake  Development Co. decided to try to capture some of this traditional warmth in a  small new development called Augusta Place.  </P> <P> Rather than hiring one of San Diego's top tract architects to do a few standard  designs, Minter commissioned five of San Diego's best young architects.  </P> <P> Because Minter was relatively new to town, he asked San Diego Home/Garden  Editor Peter Jensen to recommend a few architects. From that list, Minter chose  Ralph Roesling, Lee Platt, Mark Christopher, Barry Bell and Marc Tarasuck.  </P> <P> Initial designs were finished during the summer, and Minter hopes to have the  first homes -- with an average price of $500,000 -- on the market by fall next  year.  </P> <P> What's innovative is the concerted effort to create a strong sense of place in  a brand-new development.  </P> <P> He asked the architects to try to capture some of the charm of older houses.  </P> <P> "We weren't after architectural masterpieces, but a series of compatible  homes," Minter said.  </P> <P> Although the resulting designs are all distinctive, they share a sense of '30s  traditionalism.  </P> <P> "We're calling our design a 'super bungalow,' " Roesling said. "There's a  strong emphasis on the porch and the connection of rooms."  </P> <P> Though original California bungalows were less than 1,000 square feet and  Roesling's house is more than 3,000, certain design elements have been  effectively re-interpreted. Gabled roofs will have prominent eaves and exposed  rafter tails. Indoor spaces will be married to porches, patios and views  through the sensitive placement of windows and French doors.  </P> <P> Minter asked each architect to give his home a signature design feature on the  second floor, and Roesling responded with a pair of wide, curved dormer windows  -- windows placed vertically on a sloping roof and with a roof of their own.  </P> <P> Platt said his house is more of a blend of Prairie and Mission influences. It  has exaggerated eaves like those used by Prairie movement founder Frank Lloyd  Wright and smooth, stucco walls with carefully placed, deep-set window openings  which echo the forms of California's missions.  </P> <P> Front porches were mandatory, but Platt's is minimal, serving as a dramatic  entry. Roesling's is the largest, in the tradition of San Diego's great  Craftsman bungalows.  </P> <P> With this project, Minter has made a progressive step by bringing fresh talent  to a spec-built project.  </P> <P> Though Minter's project is a breakthrough, it is also a disappointment in the  limitations imposed on the architects. What could happen if the limits of  creativity were stretched even further?  </P> <P> Jensen, the editor, said, "There's a side of me that wants to see things pushed  a little, to accept a window that's way too small, but it looks real good. Or a  roof that kind of reminds you of 50 years ago, but it's very different. That's  what art in architecture is all about, to show us something we haven't seen  before, or to re-interpret it. I'll be interested to see if that happens here."  </P> <P> "I'm fascinated by David's (Minter) approach," Platt said. "I could see more of  this in the future as people want more character in new communities. But  marketing is not conducive to creative work. It tends to repeat past designs  which have sold well.  </P> <P> "I've thought for years that there's an unfulfilled demand for merchant-built  housing that's not so traditional and directed. But that won't come out of the  retroactive thinking which is a response to past projects."  </P> <P> Roesling agreed.  </P> <P> "I sort of wish we hadn't been working in such a traditional mode. I wish we  had had more flexibility in the home's outward appearance.  </P> <P> "What would happen if a developer said, 'I want you guys to do real nice  prototype tract homes,' and left it at that? What if he just let us work with  the execution of the forms and materials? Why couldn't there be a modern house  amongst traditional ones?"  </P> <P> Minter's homes are still only in the paper stage. He's been pairing designs  with lots and deciding which homes should be built next to each other.  </P> <P> Landscape architect David Reed was hired to design an entry gate and a small  park at the end of this cul de sac. This should serve as the neighborhood's  focal point, a place for casual social gatherings.  </P> <P> The architects were hired to do preliminary designs. Minter and his staff will  translate these to working drawings and supervise the construction. Some of the  architects fear that the fine materials they have specified -- ceramic tile,  wood windows, heavy wood beams, interesting wooden doors -- will be axed when  hard budgets are set, or that design details will be altered.  </P> <P> Besides the actual quality of the individual homes, the final form of the  entire 40-lot development remains to be seen. Minter's initial eight homes will  seed the project, and he has an option on eight more lots. He'd like to design  several more houses himself.  </P> <P> It would be a positive step if the other five architects could also do  additional homes, and if the 24 lots not controlled by Minter don't receive the  kind of poorly designed speculative homes that have characterized places such  as Fairbanks Ranch in North County.  </P> <P> Detailed design guidelines being developed by EastLake and Minter will assure a  certain level of quality, but good designs come from good architects, not  speculative builders who might arrive on the scene hoping to turn a quick  profit.  </P> <P> The community of EastLake will eventually have about 9,000 homes. EastLake  Greens -- the third phase, which includes Augusta Place -- will be formally  announced today. It will include 2,700 to 3,000 homes by about a dozen  builders.  </P></p>

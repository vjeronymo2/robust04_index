			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / 'The plan is perfect. But does anyone believe it?': As the rouble plunges, Leyla Boulton assesses Russia's crisis package THE rouble's plunge to a record low on Tuesday, the day the government published details of its anti-crisis programme, underlined the dilemma of Russian economic reformers. The symptoms of crisis could not be clearer; the government now has to show it can apply the impressive set of remedies it has promised on paper. The rouble's 15 per cent plunge to Rbs568 to the dollar was largely the consequence of a loose monetary and credit policy for which both the government and central bank share the blame. With inflation at 10 per cent a week and the bank's discount rate at 80 per cent a year, banks and enterprises scrambled to dump their roubles for dollars. The package drawn up by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the new deputy prime minister for economics and finance, includes detailed measures to fight inflation and defend the rouble. It even revives an ambitious target, agreed with the IMF but missed last December, to cut the budget deficit to 5 per cent of GDP by the end of this year, compared to 15 per cent last month alone. 'The plan is so perfect that it could almost be agreed with the International Monetary Fund as a standby programme tomorrow: the question is, do we believe it?' asked one western diplomat, referring to a so-far elusive IMF accord to underpin economic reforms. Some of the package's detailed technical reforms, such as moving away from inflationary credit emission by greater reliance on state borrowing to finance the budget deficit, is already under way. The Finance Ministry is due in March to issue its first short-term government paper. The west is expected to help. Conclusion of a debt rescheduling agreement, which would help relieve Russia's acute balance of payments problems, is likely as soon as Russia can overcome Ukrainian resistance to Moscow's plan to assume sole responsibility for the Dollars 80bn foreign debt. Mr Fyodorov also intends to ask for the unblocking of a promised Dollars 6bn fund to stabilise the rouble. Other measures, such as fighting the dollarisation of the economy and capital flight, may prove difficult to deliver given the lack of confidence in the authorities. But the programme's key anti-inflationary strategy - reviewing subsidies to inefficient enterprises and getting the central bank to restrict the growth of money supply - can come about only if there is a consensus between the government and the central bank. Mr Fyodorov said yesterday he had reached a tentative agreement with the central bank on the need to increase interest rates to the level needed to fight inflation and to limit the distribution of credits to enterprises. The central bank, which has often been unfairly blamed by a free-spending government, is to present its proposals on credit policy in two weeks. A senior bank official said he believed Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the bank chairman, could strike a deal with the government 'as long as it was made to look attractive politically' - referring to the free-spending parliament he is answerable to. But even as Mr Fyodorov was meeting central bankers, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, was promising lots of money for agriculture - a reminder that the government must practise the restraint it preaches. One expert forecast yesterday that no progress would be made until the rouble hit the humiliating threshold of Rbs1,000 to the dollar. This in turn would prompt either implementation of the plan's key tenets, or an attempt to reimpose an old-style command economy. Commodities, Page 34</p>

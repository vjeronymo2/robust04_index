			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine has achieved some economic stabilization and  stepped up the pace of privatization in recent months, a  Ukrainian representative in the EBRD (European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development) told an annual meeting of the  Bank's board of directors in St. Petersburg on Monday [18 April].    Aleksandr Savchenko said that inflation had dropped to 8  percent in March from more than 50 percent last December, 19  percent in January, and 12 percent in February.    He put the number of state companies now in private hands at  more than 3000 or 4 percent of the total. He said that 10  percent of the industry had already been privatized with the  privatization figure for the light, timber and wood processing  industries running at 30 percent. The same indicator for the  services sector reached 20 percent.    A total of 88 percent of collective farms have been  transformed into cooperatives, partnerships and stock-holding  companies. The number of private farms runs at 30,000.    At the same time, Savchenko said that nothing short of  financial aid from EBRD, IMF and the World Bank could help Kiev  cut its budget deficit, halt inflation and speed up the  privatization of large enterprises.    He pointed to EBRD's involvement in a project to promote  Ukrainian exports and attract private investment to develop  Ukrainian port facilities on the Black Sea coast. The updating  of 1200 gas pumping stations and a length of more than 2,500 km  gas pipelines is one other possible area of cooperation,  Savchenko said.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Commodities fund launch delayed Unexpectedly strong interest from Japanese investors in a commodities fund which is about to be launched by BZW Investment Management (BZWIM) has prompted a delay in the publication of the pathfinder prospectus to allow time for it to get clearance from Japan's ministry of finance. To tap Japanese demand, BZWIM needs to register the closed-end fund as a private placement with the MoF. The process includes translating the document into Japanese and answering MoF queries. Mr Ronald Gould, the BZWIM managing director in charge of setting up the Jersey-based investment company, said the prospectus, due to be published next Monday, would now be released a week later. The strong economic rebound in the US and parts of Europe, coupled with signs of a resurgence in inflation, has aroused investor interest in real assets, such as commodities, because of their characteristics as an inflation hedge and a play on economic growth. 'You will dampen risk and volatility in a portfolio by introducing commodities as an asset class,' said Mr Gould. In his view, an allocation of 3 to 5 per cent of total assets to commodities would achieve the best results. However, he estimates that in the UK, only a tiny amount is invested in commodities, while in the US, where investors are more comfortable with commodities, they only account for 1 per cent of pension fund assets. BZWIM, which has around Pounds 50bn under management, will be investing in the fund, which is expected to attract at least Pounds 100m from institutional investors. The benchmark for the fund will be the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index. Mr Gould hopes to outperform the index by up to 10 per cent by giving a greater weighting to industrial materials and energy, which should benefit the most from stronger economic growth. The fund will use exchange-traded futures contracts to gain exposure to commodities but they will be re-packaged in the form of notes issued by highly-rated banks or through swap agreements with banks. This buffer is designed to counter any discomfort among investors to direct exposure to futures and to allow institutions that are not able to buy futures to invest in the fund.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / High Court overruled on Bank demand A BANK OF England notice requiring production of documents overrides a High Court injunction that the documents must not be disclosed, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Mr Justice Hirst said the documents were relevant to an investigation by the US Federal Reserve Board and he described as 'unreal in the banking world of the 1990s' a suggestion that it was not part of the Bank of England's function to act as an information-collecting agency for a foreign regulatory authority. 'In the world of international banking today supervisory authorities can, should, and no doubt do, regularly co-operate on matters of mutual supervisory concern,' he said. There was clear evidence, he said, that the Bank required the documents for its own supervisory functions. The judge's ruling was in a case in which the plaintiffs were referred to as 'A and others', and the defendant, an institution authorised under the Banking Act, as 'B bank'. He said a New York grand jury had issued a subpoena requiring 'B' to produce documents relating to the accounts of 'A and others'. Last August the plaintiffs obtained a High Court injunction restraining 'B' from complying with the subpoena or disclosing the documents to any third party. On April 26 the Bank of England served a notice under section 39 of the Banking Act requiring 'B' to produce documents covered by the injunction. The Bank of England said it required the documents, which related to the acquisition of three US banks by a US bank holding company, for the performance of its supervisory function. The plaintiffs and 'B' opposed the Bank of England's contention on the basis that its notice overrode the injunction. The plaintiffs also contended that the notice had not been issued for the purpose of the Bank of England's supervisory function but to enable the Federal Reserve Board to pursue its own inquiries.</p>

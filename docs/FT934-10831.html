			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Attacks on Agip halt oil output AGIP'S Nigerian oil operation has lost more than 270,000 barrels of production since October 22, when attacks by local communities forced the company to close its Obama and Clough Creek flow stations. Agip says the violence stems from mishandling of compensation for the local communities by a development commission set up by the Nigerian government. The company has asked the oil minister, Mr Don Etiebet, to take action over this and other disputes in Rivers state, Nigeria's main oil-producing region. 'We need to make the government aware,' a company spokesman said. He said some of the local communities' demands for compensation 'bear on revenue allocation yet the commission has no programme which is binding'. Agip operates five oil fields in the Niger delta, producing on average 150,000 barrels a day. It owns 20 per cent of the venture, along with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (60 per cent) and Philips Petroleum, and plans to open a new 20,000 b/d field next year. The trouble at Obama started when the development commission awarded money from Agip, which was intended for the chief of the community, to a former official of the government. The money was to compensate for pollution of the water through dredging the local swamp. Although Agip provided water and electricity for the area, villagers loyal to the chief marched on the flow station, forcing Agip to close it with the loss of 205,000 barrels by Monday. When a negotiation team arrived by helicopter, the pilot was attacked and badly injured. The dispute at Clough Creek is also over demands from rival communities. When Agip built a school for the local village another community demanded a health centre. The threat to oil workers led to a loss of production of about 73,000 barrels last week. Police were handling the dispute yesterday and Agip expected to resume operations within 24 hours. However, the company said there had been 'some agitation' at the Tebibada flow station, but no loss of production. There had also been 'numerous problems' at the Obrikom-Obiafu gas re-injection plant.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Interest on late debts attacked THE CAMPAIGN in favour of giving businesses an automatic legal right to charge interest on overdue debts will make the difficulties of late payment worse, the Credit Protection Association warned yesterday. Businesses charging interest would be lending money where the banks would not, according to Mr David Lee, sales manager of Credit Protection Association, a company providing credit management advice and debt chasing services. Pressure for a change in the law has been led by the Forum of Private Business, which has 18,000 members. British businesses normally expect to be paid within 30 days of making a delivery or sending an invoice, but they have to wait, on average, 78 days for their bills to be settled. German companies wait only 48 days. The company said businesses were being led to believe that charging interest would overcome the difficulty, but customers who had no intention of paying would be only too delighted to get their hands on extended credit. 'By giving extended credit, companies are actually increasing their risk with non-payers. The answer is not to add interest but to recover the money that is rightfully yours.' It advised companies to state terms of trade at the outset, to act as soon as payment became due and to be firm in pursuing claims.</p>

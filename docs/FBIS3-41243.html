			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Annerys Gonzalez; from the "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Narcotics Division of the Judicial Technical  Police [PTJ] made the headlines this week by seizing 1.5 tons of  very pure cocaine thanks to outstanding intelligence work. The  seizure has alarmed all drug traffickers, mainly due to the  large sum of money involved. The cocaine consisted of 1,771  individual packages, which were camouflaged to resemble spools,  and was found in a warehouse in Maracay. Another 60 kg in 48  additional packages was found in a warehouse belonging to  Expriven Company in Guarenas. Finally, three more kg in six  packages were seized in an apartment in the Santa Cruz  neighborhood in Maracay.    [Begin recording] [PTJ Chief Orlando Jordan Petit] There are  some spools around which one can wrap anything, such as wires,  paper, and so on. A number of rolls, for lack of a better  description, of the drug were wrapped around it ...    [Gonzalez, interrupting] To make it resemble what, Chief?    [Jordan Petit] The idea is to place the drug there to make  it pass for the content of a spool, normally something else, any  other product. This is perhaps one method they used nationwide  to export the drug from Colombia and to distribute it  nationally. This was also perhaps the mechanism they were using  to ship it to the United States. [end recording]    The names of the six persons who were arrested are: Agustin  Leon, a Venezuelan businessman; (Minges de Leon Janit), an  American citizen and manager of Baduca Company; Pedro Julian  Rosas, a Venezuelan driver for Expriven Company; Erlis Delgado,  a Peruvian woman in charge of that company; Pedro Jose Rosas, an  employee; and Carlos Ordones, businessman and local drug  distributor.    [Begin Narcotics Division Chief Nerio Rengifo recording]  This  is one of the most important cases the PTJ, specifically the  Narcotics Division, has worked on. It is the result of long  months of hard work and follow-up and surveillance operations by  members of the division. Their investigation of a number of  companies with prior drug trafficking records in the United  States led us to identify its members, and later, led us to  discover and seize this large amount of cocaine. [end recording]    Thus, the Narcotics Division of the PTJ dealt a heavy blow  to  international drug trafficking. To finish dismantling this  organization four persons belonging to one family are also being  tracked down. They are Aurelio Carmelo, Ivan Mauricio, Harold,  and Nabal, all members of the Villamizar family. They carry  Colombian, Venezuelan, and U.S. identification documents.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Laker guard Michael Cooper seems to have one foot in Italy and the other in the  NBA.  </P> <P> "We must only wait for a few days for the actual signing," Valerio Bianchini,  coach of Il Messaggero of Rome, told a sports newspaper in Milan. "Cooper is  practically in our hands."  </P> <P> But the Lakers said no decision on Cooper has been made. Last week it was  reported that the Lakers are planning to put Cooper on waivers Wednesday. Any  NBA team would have 48 hours to claim him at his salary of a little more than  $600,000. If all teams pass, Cooper would be free to accept the Il Messaggero  offer.  </P></p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Foreign companies report easier staff recruitment MOST OF the 450-plus foreign companies that have moved into the Yorkshire and Humberside area appear to be finding it easier to recruit managerial, professional and skilled staff than their homegrown competitors, a survey released yesterday says. They have also carried on investing throughout the recession and many have created jobs. More than 90 per cent say productivity is 'excellent' and has increased in recent years. Further investment is planned by 95 per cent of them during the next 18 months. The survey of inward investors' workforces was carried out by Acas, the conciliation service, for the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association. The region has about 200 north American companies, 80 from Germany, more than 40 from Sweden, 40 from France, 35 from Switzerland and nearly 30 from the Far East. Between them they employ 50,000 people. Only one in five of the 100 foreign companies surveyed said there was poor availability of managers, technical and skilled labour. Similar figures from all companies in the area are usually higher - sometimes by more than twice as much. Such surveys have also shown falling investment and few plans to increase it. The number of companies seeking graduate recruits during the 'milk round' at universities is likely to fall sharply this year, according to the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services. Almost 30 per cent fewer companies will attend this year's spring round of presentations to students, the association said yesterday. The survey of 77 higher-education institutions found a drop of 5 per cent in the number of companies attending the smaller autumn round last year, mainly because accountancy firms reported an overall 20 per cent fall in vacancies.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Malaysian mobile phone group surges to MDollars 105m Technology Resources Industries (TRI), the holding company for Cellular Communications Network (Malaysia), Malaysia's largest mobile phone carrier, has announced 95.6 per cent year-on-year growth in pre-tax profits, to MDollars 105.97m (USDollars 40.9m), for the first half of 1994. The results were well within market expectations of between MDollars 95m and MDollars 120m. Group turnover grew 49 per cent to MDollars 367.1m compared with a year ago, and after-tax profits were up 120 per cent to MDollars 69.9m. The stock does not pay a dividend. The company recorded an extraordinary gain of MDollars 126.1m on the sale of its non-telecommunications subsidiaries. Cellular Communications (Celcom) contributed the bulk of profits, supplemented by smaller contributions from the Malaysian Helicopter Services (MHS) subsidiary. Analysts were pleased with the results, but expressed concern about the company's disclosure policies. Earlier this year, UBS (East Asia), a member of the Union Bank of Switzerland group of companies, had to postpone an international offering of USDollars 400m in TRI euroconvertible bonds, after European fund managers objected to discrepancies in profit forecasts. In the accompanying prospectus, TRI had forecast MDollars 128m in pre-tax profits for the full year 1994. However, many securities houses were anticipating a figure of more than MDollars 300m, based on analysts' meetings with the company. Yesterday, the company told analysts it would not raise its full-year profit forecast, citing growing depreciation expenses. Many analysts, however, are still forecasting a full-year figure close to MDollars 200m. TRI's chairman and majority shareholder is Mr Datuk Tajudin Ramli, a Malay businessman and protege of the influential former finance minister Mr Tun Daim Zainuddin. TRI and MHS are near completion of a demerger exercise, after which MHS will purchase a 32 per cent stake in Malaysian Airlines.</p>

Deputy director Chintay Shih of the governmental  Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) revealed plans  to establish a new DRAM-producing company. The Electronics  Research and Service Organization (ERSO), one of ITRI's  departments, will be the parent body of the new manufacturer. It  has completed the development of a new 16-MB DRAM chip using  0.5-micron technology. The process will use 200-mm wafers. The  production line created by ERSO for trial production of the chip  will be expanded for full-scale production purposes. The  manufacturing facility is located in the Hsinchu High-Technology  Park. The name of the company, the size of its investment, and  the annual output, are still undecided. The possibility of a  funding consortium consisting of several manufacturers is now  being explored.    ERSO is one of 11 subdivisions of ITRI. Its Submicron  Project  includes 0.5-micron CMOS (16 MB DRAM) development and also  0.35-micron and smaller CMOS development by National Nanodevice  Laboratories, established in 1992.    The 0.5-micron 16-MB DRAM chip was designed by Etron  Technology of Taiwan. Etron's founder, Nicky C. C. Lu, is a  former IBM DRAM designer. According to Mr. Lu, the 16-MB DRAM  chip is a first-generation chip, with an area of 100  mm[.sup]2[/], in a 400-mil package. A stacked memory cell  design will be used. The technology for the more recent trench  process is not yet available in Taiwan. The second-generation  chip will be a synchronous DRAM for high-speed data  transmission. An attempt will be made to use the  ``lead-on-chip'' (LOC) technology. The search for an existing  manufacturer who can implement this technology is now under way.    The TI-Acer company of Taiwan is now producing 4-MB DRAM. In  Phase 1 of the Fab 1 stage, 1500 units a month of 0.8-micron  technology 150-mm equivalent chips will be produced. Phase 2 is  scheduled to get under way in 1995. The total output will be  24,000 units per month. Mosel Vitelic, a DRAM-oriented company  that produces for the Taiwan electrical engineering industry, is  setting up a clean room to meet 0.5-micron standards. Operation  is expected to begin this year. Taiwan's largest LSI producer,  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC), plans  to produce DRAM under the Fab 3 stage, which began in December  1993.    Taiwan's Department of Economics is backing this effort to  create a DRAM project from existing enterprises and government  research organizations. In December 1992, the ministry  designated 66 systems and components as key projects for  stepped-up effort in order to replace imported products. The 66  designated products are grouped into three ranks. Rank A  consists of products for which the Department of Economics has  created a technology development project team and is carrying on  the R&amp;D. Rank B consists of technologies for which a  subdivision  of the Industrial Office has created a development plan for  joint implementation by two or more enterprises. Rank C consists  of projects in which enterprises are investing, with government  support in order to facilitate production.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Revised expectations THE STERLING cash and futures markets yesterday reined in expectations of another cut in UK base rates before the March Budget after the UK government mounted a concerted campaign to restore confidence in the pound, writes James Blitz. On Monday, Downing Street denied weekend reports that the prime minister was about to drive interest rates lower to stimulate economic recovery. The comments from Mr Major's office had little effect on sterling markets on Monday, but there was a sharp change of tone to dealing yesterday. The March short sterling contract dropped 24 basis points in the early part of the day, falling as low as 94.28, a level which prices three-month money at Budget time at 5.72 per cent. It only recovered a small amount of lost ground in the afternoon, finishing at 94.33. The revised view on rates was also felt in the cash market. Three-month money closed more or less unchanged at 6 1/4 per cent, helped by a comparatively small shortage of Pounds 750m forecast by the Bank of England in the morning. However, six-month money rose on the bid side by about  1/16 percentage point to end at 5 7/8 per cent. With the bid rate for one-year money closing at 5 3/4 per cent, the money market yield curve appeared to be levelling off yesterday. A rising yield curve would indicate that dealers believe 5 per cent could be the eventual floor for base rates in this cycle. Trading in French franc markets was extremely calm when set against the volatility of Monday. The franc barely moved on the foreign exchanges and three-month money fell back to around 12 1/2 per cent from Monday's 13 per cent. The March French franc contract climbed 32 basis points, finishing at 85.55, following Monday's 23-point decline. The market will scrutinise today's Bundesbank interven-tion in the money markets for any sign of policy easing, although expectations of this are low. There is a heavy call on funds because of the German tax season, and call money finished a little higher at 8.66 per cent. One money market analyst was yesterday expecting the lowest accepted repo bid for today to be on the high side, possibly in the area of 8.61 or 8.62 per cent.</p>

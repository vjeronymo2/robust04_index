			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUTTING SURTAX ON MEDICARE  </P> <P> First, you accept the concept that the beneficiaries should foot the bill. This  is the first time in our history that the cost of a program has not been spread  over the whole population. Removing the cap on income taxable by the Medicare  tax portion of the Social Security tax would be a more equitable approach.  </P> <P> Second, it should be pointed out that the vast majority of the 40% of the  seniors with enough income to pay income tax are most likely low-middle income  people. The surtax, scheduled to rise to 28%, means a drastic cut in their  living standards.  </P> <P> Finally, the benefits of the bill affecting only a small percentage of the  elderly, are minimal due to the very large deductibles. As regards President  Bush, he would much rather cut the capital gains tax for the rich than ease the  burdens of the poor and middle-income Americans.  </P> <P> SOL LONDE  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

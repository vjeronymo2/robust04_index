			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Bonn condemns US policies for dollar weakness Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, yesterday blamed a lack of consistency in US government policy as an important factor behind the dollar's recent weakness, and stressed that his government did not want to participate in concerted market intervention. Mr Rexrodt's sharp criticism comes just before the Group of Seven summit in Naples, and President Bill Clinton's subsequent visit to Bonn. He also condemned US policy towards Japan, which he said had been inconsistent and not conducted 'particularly cleverly'. The dollar fell to a 14-month low against the D-Mark in late European trading yesterday as markets reacted to Mr Rexrodt's comments and awaited news from a meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee, which ended without announcing a change in short-term interest rates. Fed governors and regional presidents had debated whether a further increase in short-term interest rates was needed to prevent still-robust US economic growth putting upward pressure on inflation. US policymakers have been unsettled by the dollar's fragility in recent days, but traditionally put relatively little weight on currency fluctuations when setting monetary policy. Markets had interpreted the Fed's adding of reserves to the banking system overnight as a signal that it would not raise interest rates immediately. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5685, down from DM1.5826, and dipped close to its post-war lows around Y97.70 but rallied to finish at Y98.125 from Y98.825. In New York it recovered further, rising to DM1.5788 and Y98.9. In Tokyo this morning the dollar opened at Y98.98 against yesterday's close of Y98.3. In an interview published by the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Mr Rexrodt claimed that the Bundesbank had opposed the last concerted central bank intervention to defend the dollar. He argued that the dollar rate was influenced above all by the sharp outflow of long-term capital from the US, and in particular by the outflow of Japanese capital. The US was dependent on inflows of capital, because of its low domestic savings ratio, which was 'a deep-seated structural problem'. Mr Rexrodt, in criticising the US conduct of trade negotiations with Japan, said the US had initially aroused the impression that it wanted to compel the Japanese to accept a rising yen exchange rate, and then had argued against the sharp drop in the dollar. 'The German view that intervention cannot succeed against the market trend was once again proved correct.' In the US, analysts are divided over the domestic merits of raising rates for a fifth time this year. Some argue that past increases, taking the key federal funds rate from 3 per cent to 4.25 per cent, are sufficient given tentative signs that economic growth is moderating. Other analysts say further action is needed to prevent the economy overheating.

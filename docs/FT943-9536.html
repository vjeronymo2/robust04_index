			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Warning note as weak bonds pressure equities Pressure on bond markets left bourses lower, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, sounded a warning note about recent bourse gains. German and French equity markets had seen rises of 7.9 and 11.4 per cent in the five weeks since June 30, regaining much of the ground they had lost - falls of 10.7 and 16.6 per cent respectively - in the first six months of this year. Many commentators were consigning the depressing first- half performance to the history books, said Mr Edwards, who contended that the fear of higher US interest rates and global inflation, which drove markets down in the first six months of this year, would continue to be a depressing influence in the second half. FRANKFURT's Dax index declined 20.47 to 2,164.20 after pressure on bund futures and conflicting theories on interest rates. Turnover stayed low at DM5.4bn, after DM4.7bn. Ms Barbara Altmann said the accelerated economic growth which excited equities last week was used yesterday to support theories that the decline in interest rates was coming to an end. Kidder Peabody, meanwhile, said on Monday that interest rate cuts were likely after Germany's federal elections in October. Financials reflected the weakness in bunds, with Allianz DM44 lower at DM2,428. Degussa produced a 54 per cent rise in profits, compared with Metzler's expectation of a 60 per cent gain, but the shares still rose DM6.50 to DM513.50. AMSTERDAM was generally disappointed by Polygram's first-half results, which came in at the lower end of analysts' expectations. The shares fell to a session's low of Fl 77.10 before picking up a little towards the end of the day, closing off Fl 3.30 at Fl 77.90. In spite of yesterday's setback, analysts at Kleinwort Benson in London remained broadly positive on the company and remarked that the recent success of its film unit would make a significant contribution to second-half earnings. The market would now be looking ahead to results from its parent group, Philips, off 60 cents at Fl 55.80, due to be released tomorrow. The AEX index, down 4.53, or 1 per cent, at 416.83, was affected by bond weakness, as well as sharp corrections in a number of leading stocks which had been performing well in recent days ahead of results. Unilever, for instance, dipped Fl 5.30 to Fl 194.80, erasing all of Monday's gain. After the market closed, Fokker, off 30 cents at Fl 16.20, announced that it would not after all be publishing its first-half results this Friday as had been expected. The aircraft manufacturer was expected to reveal a further deterioration in earnings. PARIS stayed in the doldrums, with the 1.5 per cent fall in the CAC-40 index occurring amid very low turnover, estimated at FFr2.7bn. The index lost 31.86 to 2,074.48 as the equity market took its cue from weakness in the Matif. In a session devoid of major features, Rhone-Poulenc slipped FFr2.40 to FFr140.60. James Capel maintained its hold recommendation on the chemcials group following last week's results. Capel said that since the shares had lost most of the strength built up during March and April, a period of relative outperformance could be expected, particularly in light of the economic recovery under way in Europe. ZURICH dealers said that trading was largely driven by derivatives as the SMI index finished 32.0 lower at 2,585.5 following thin volume. In financials, where existing pressure after first-half results was heightened by bond market worries, UBS fell another SFr23 to SFr1,117; CS Holding lost SFr10 at SFr550. Industrials were relatively strong, but Roche certificates lost SFr30 at SFr5,670 after their recent gains, and Brown Boveri fell SFr17 to SFr1,272. MADRID said that the weak bond market led to a bout of profit-taking but the obvious stocks did not suffer. In banks, fairly flat as a sector, Popular and Bankinter actually managed to rise. Recently the subject of buy recommendations, the shares put on Pta40 at Pta15,880 and Pta30 at Pta12,470 respectively. The general index receded 2.49 to 320.99 in turnover of Pta21.30bn. Losers included the recently ebullient construction sector, with Cubiertas down Pta200 at Pta11,130 and FCC Pta370 lower at Pta14,700; and the US-quoted Telefonica, Repsol and Endesa off Pta15 at Pta1,825, Pta75 at Pta4,200 and Pta60 at Pta6,230 respectively. MILAN was easier, with losses seen especially in the telecoms sector. The Comit index shed 6.42 to 689.33. Some brokers remarked that a further brake on activity was the approach of the end of the account. Among telecoms shares, Stet slid L120 to L5,150 while Sip, the domestic telephone operator, fell L90 to L4,390. TEL AVIV continued to strengthen, the Mishtanim index gaining 3.93, or 2.1 per cent, at 194.19. Political progress between Israel and Jordan, favourable second-quarter company results and improving investor confidence were the main driving factors. Mr David Duke, a consultant at Israel and Overseas Investment in Tel Aviv, suggested that since the market's falls at the beginning of the year, investors had been waiting for it to stabilise. He said that increasing market trading volume reflected greater investor confidence and added that many individual corporate difficulties which had troubled the market had now been cleared.

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Standards in insurance industry rising as result of self-regulation Sir, I am sure your readers would be pleased to know that the experiences related in Peter Marsh's article, 'Short Lautro test that 'a monkey could pass'' (March 24), are virtually things of the past. This is just the sort of practice which Lautro has put enormous resources into stopping. In April 1993 Lautro was the first 'retail' self-regulating organisations to put into force a new and demanding training scheme, beating the others by nearly a year. In June 1991 we had considerably tightened up recruiting procedures and the result today is that firms now have to take particular care to recruit only suitable sales staff and to train them thoroughly. One result of these measures is that the total number of sales people employed by the firms we regulate has dropped from 200,000 in 1990 to 105,000 today, and is still falling at a rate of about 2,500 per month. The new training requirements demand a minimum of 6-8 weeks training for new recruits and require a recognised test of knowledge (Financial Planning Certificate Part 1) and a tough and objective assessment of the skills required to give sound financial advice by trained and assessed supervisors. By April 1993 Lautro had vetted the plans of all firms intending to recruit sales people. Since then no salesperson should have been appointed without satisfactorily completing a Lautro-accredited training course, and all existing sales people were required to be assessed against the new standards by January 1994. The penalties for failing to meet these requirements are that sales people trained or assessed under unsatisfactory schemes must be suspended from business until they have satisfactorily completed an accredited training course. For nearly a year now Lautro has been carrying out detailed inspections of the schemes which its member firms have put in place following approval of their plans. So far we have completed 53 inspections. Of these, few escaped some minor criticism and changes necessary to comply with the high standards we have set. Three firms have been required to retrain and reassess some sales people as a result of defects; and three firms have had their accreditation withdrawn and have been required to suspend all those trained under their schemes and to submit new proposals for an acceptable scheme. Until satisfactory proposals have been put into effect these firms will be unable to appoint any more sales people, and until those trained and assessed under the defective scheme have been through a Lautro-approved process they will have been suspended too. The assertions made about the standards in 1991 being those laid down by Lautro are totally misleading. As explained, our scheme became effective in 1993. The sort of experience recounted by Ms Hurley, Ms Trimmer, Mr Butler and Mr Evans was precisely that which led us to initiate work on a radical shake up in the industry's selection and training practices back in 1990 and it should not surprise your readers to know that not one of the Lautro regulated firms mentioned in the article has escaped our attention. All of them have had to undertake expensive corrective measures to deal with sub-standard practices of one sort or another and one of them was recently publicly reprimanded and fined. You and your readers will no doubt be comforted to know that there is rapid change under way and the experiences of employees and customers of the industry of even a year ago are probably anachronistic.

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCGRIFF, WHITE SOX KEEP BLUE JAYS ALIVE  </P> <P> The Toronto Blue Jays did what they had to do to keep their title hopes alive,  then waited about 90 minutes to see if their 2-1 victory over the Baltimore  Orioles meant anything.  </P> <P> Did it ever.  </P> <P> After Fred McGriff hit a tie-breaking home run with two out in the ninth inning  to give Toronto a victory it had to have Tuesday night, the Blue Jays gathered  in the clubhouse to watch Boston play Chicago.  </P> <P> When the final out of Chicago's 3-2 victory was recorded, the dozen or so  players remaining in the Blue Jays' clubhouse let out a collective cheer.  </P> <P> The American League East race boils down to this: Boston needs a win or a  Toronto loss. If Toronto beats Baltimore on Wednesday night and Chicago beats  first-place Boston, the teams will meet for a one-game playoff in Toronto on  Thursday.  </P> <P> Were it not for the superb pitching of Bud Black and McGriff's 35th homer, the  Boston-Chicago game wouldn't have meant a thing.  </P> <P> With the score 1-1, McGriff hit a 2-and-2 pitch from Baltimore's Dave Johnson  (13-9) over the right-field wall. Tom Henke pitched the ninth to earn his 32nd  save and keep the Blue Jays alive.  </P> <P> It was Black's second victory in three appearances since the Blue Jays acquired  him from Cleveland on Sept. 17. He will not be eligible should Toronto qualify  for the American League playoffs.  </P></p>

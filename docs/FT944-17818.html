			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Brussels' foot on the brake In proposing to renew the block exemption of motor industry distribution practices from EU competition law, the European Commission says it aims to balance the interests of all involved. But that balance remains tilted far too heavily in favour of producers, at the expense of the interests of consumers and economic efficiency. Furthermore, the Commission's approach raises disquieting questions about its attitude to the single market. Yesterday's decision preserves the central principles of the existing exemption. Manufacturers will continue to be able to choose which dealers they supply and to limit them to selling only one brand at one location, while permitting dealers exclusive franchises within designated territories. Most of the amendments proposed amount to tinkering, not fundamental reform. Some merely formalise practices already common, notably in the UK. They include the right of dealers to stock competing brands at separate outlets and to advertise outside their franchise territories. Other changes seek to tackle some of the more pernicious abuses of the existing regime. For instance, Brussels aims to loosen manufacturers' monopoly over spare parts and to reduce obstacles to cross-border car purchases, repeatedly blamed by consumers' organisations for creating gaping differences in car prices across the EU. However, many of these obstacles are already supposed to be illegal. Brussels' failure to correct them in the past inspires little confidence that the new rules will be enforced any more vigorously. Radical approach A much more radical approach was needed. The Commission should have started by questioning the scope of the exemption. It was originally granted on the grounds that cars are complex products which require big investments in after-sales service facilities. Yet it also extends to new vehicle sales. No convincing economic case has been made for treating the two businesses as one. Doing so impedes efficiency by encouraging cross-subsidies between them. Equally, continuing restrictions on multi-brand dealerships deter innovation in retailing and deny car-buyers the convenience of comparing a wide range of competing models in one showroom. Abolishing these curbs need neither affect manufacturers' power to discipline wayward dealers, nor lead to unhealthy concentration of distribution, provided competition policy were applied effectively. Probably the proposal's biggest weakness, however, is that it relies too much on vaguely worded prohibitions of abuses by manufacturers. It would have been far more effective to have spelt out clearly specific rights to which consumers were entitled. Nowhere is this more so than in the freedom to take advantage of price differentials by shopping across borders. Price convergence Price convergence is one of the crucial tests of a unified market. Car manufacturers have long protested that it has not been achieved because of currency fluctuations and differences in national taxes and costs. But their argument is perverse. Only when producers are compelled by strong cross-border competition to treat Europe as one market will there be effective pressure to abolish regulatory and fiscal obstacles. That is the central purpose of the EU single market programme. The Commission's timid remedies to the obvious flaws in the block exemption suggest that it is reluctant to subject Europe's biggest manufacturing sector to the logic of the single market. Its hesitation is not altogether surprising. For Brussels is itself engaged in the business of using the exemption to manage trade in cars within the EU. The exemption provides the Commission with a convenient backdoor way to limit free trade in Japanese cars between individual EU countries. Brussels defends these import controls as a necessary evil, insisting that they were the price for getting governments to agree to open the EU market fully to competition by 1999. But the Commission has also paid a heavy price by colluding in such practices. By doing so, it calls into doubt the sincerity of its commitment to free competition in the car industry and diminishes its authority to enforce single market rules on recalcitrant EU member states.</p>

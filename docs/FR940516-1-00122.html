			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Impact on Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA estimates that the proposed emission standards can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met with the identified engine emission control technologies with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimal impact on equipment design. However, EPA also believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that to propose more stringent emission standards in today's rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than those already proposed would necessitate equipment redesign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to accommodate more sophisticated technologies, such as high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency catalysts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been EPA's past experience that, given the latitude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to change either the engine or equipment, most manufacturers will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose to modify the engine. EPA estimates that most engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> models will require only internal modifications (such as tighter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tolerances and fuel mixture enleanment strategies) to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standards. These modifications will have little, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any, effect on equipment design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA estimates that few engine models will be discontinued as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a result of the proposed standards. Models that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discontinued represent older engine designs and low volume sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this market generally has a large number of engine models,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutions should be readily available for these few incidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of model discontinuation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Catalytic converter use is not predicted for the Phase 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. However, if catalysts should be used on a small percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of equipment, EPA has estimated the equipment impact of catalyst  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in terms of additional shielding as a result of higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust skin temperatures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft RSD summarizes EPA's estimates of equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts as a result of this rulemaking. EPA requests comment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information with respect to the estimations concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of the proposed standards on equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Energy, Noise, and Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 213(a)(3) of the Act requires that EPA also give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate consideration to energy, noise, and safety factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the application of technologies. Energy factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include engine fuel consumption and power. Noise factors are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self explanatory, and safety factors include safety for the user  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as compliance with other existing regulations in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country and abroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Chapter 1 of the draft RSD, EPA has analyzed the likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average fuel consumption change considering all factors that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would impact the final figure in actual use. EPA estimates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a reduction in fuel consumption is likely to be seen in actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use and will average approximately 13 percent for handheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines and 26 percent for nonhandheld engines. Since this is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desirable impact, little additional design effort will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expended to optimize fuel consumption effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers will also optimize final designs such that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected power loss on resulting production engines will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimized. Based on analyses in Chapter 1 of the draft RSD, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates that the resulting average power change in actual use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be a gain of approximately five percent for Class I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines and a three percent reduction for Class III&hyph;V engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major contributors to this gain for Class I and II are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in technology for Class I side valve engines which make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up a large majority of engines in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although overall power may increase, some engines may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience a decrease in power availability. However, real time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data collected on equipment in actual use demonstrate that many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines do not need their full power capability in actual use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is especially true in the case of nonhandheld engines. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators of these engines will likely experience no performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact as a result of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engine noise level is expected to stay at current levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further discussion of this issue can be found in ``V.O. Cap on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Noise.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many safety regulations and recommendations have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established for small engines and their related use in equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations will affect the feasibility of using some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies on handheld engines. One example is a regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring spark arresters on equipment used on certain federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands. See 36 CFR part 261. The regulation results in a temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit on exhaust and exhaust surfaces which, to date, has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulted in a limitation on the feasibility of the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalysts for handheld engines due to the high heat levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emitted during conversion of pollutants as seen when applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety recommendations and regulations also have an impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the end use of the engines. Some small SI equipment have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating restrictions of certain speeds and loads. One example  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is ANSI standard B71.1 which contains information for measuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mower blade tip speed and a description of the use of safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake systems. A summary of safety regulations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations is presented in the draft RSD. EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further information on additional safety regulations or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements which may impact engines covered by this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Per Engine Cost Estimates Due to Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The technical solutions required to meet the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards proposed in this notice will be cost-effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further discussion is presented in ``IX. Cost-Effectiveness.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this summary presents only aggregate costs for nonhandheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and handheld engines, the draft RSD gives cost estimates by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology and by engine displacement class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The retail price of equipment which uses nonhandheld engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranges from $90 to $9,000. On average, the cost to the engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer to install the necessary emission control technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on these engines will be approximately $0.80 to $1.13 per engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The retail price of equipment which uses handheld engines ranges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from $60 to $1,000. On average, the cost to install the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary control technology on all handheld equipment engines,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hardware variable costs, and production costs will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $2.05 to $2.20 per engine to the engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer. Tables in the draft RSD list the Agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated variable hardware and production cost broken out by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine technology for each engine class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

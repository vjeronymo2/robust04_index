			<p>BFN     [Text] At a news conference on the national financial  situation in the first six months of the year, Ministry of  Finance representative revealed that the budget's revenue  collection is so far progressing on schedule, but that the  sources to subsidize the deficit are still limited.    Domestic savings are insignificant and foreign funds are not  yet available. This limits spending to urgent and regular items  and debt repayment only, while spending on capital construction  has been low. By 10 April, the funds actually allocated for  capital construction projects reached only 21.4 percent of the  planned targets, with tardiness being the result of difficulties  in with income sources.    Many projects are also suffering from a cessation of funds  as  they cannot meet fund allocation requirements. Of the 5,460  investment projects this year, about three-quarters of them have  not been able to fulfill requirements for capital allocation.  Altogether, they represent six trillion dong in capitalization,  and are mostly for projects initiated by the ministries of  transportation, water conservancy, energy, culture and  information, and banks.</p>

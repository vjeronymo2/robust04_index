			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHERLIVES: GRETZKY: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY WAYNE GRETZKY WITH RICK REILLY  (HARPERCOLLINS: $19.95; 258 PP.)  </P> <P> It's unlikely we'll ever see a deal in sports to compare with the one that  brought Wayne Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988. Gretzky so dominated  the National Hockey League that he had won its Most Valuable Player trophy  eight of the previous nine years; he had not only set but obliterated every  previous offensive record in the book.  </P> <P> So why was Gretzky traded? Money, he says here, in his first extended comment  on the deal; the trade had nothing to do with his marriage to aspiring actress  Janet Jones and everything to do with the financial straits of Edmonton Oilers  owner Peter (Puck) Pocklington. Gretzky didn't want to leave Edmonton, he says,  expecting to win the city a few more Stanley Cups -- the Oilers won their  fourth in five years just two hours before Gretzky first learned of the trade  talk -- but Pocklington had to break his personal-services contract with the  player before he could take the Oilers public and stave off possible  bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Few athletes can claim to dominate a sport the way Gretzky has dominated. How  many have won their lifelong epithet -- Gretzky's is "The Great One" -- at age  10? That's when he scored 378 goals in 69 games in Little League play (the  next-highest scorer tallied 140), and it was only the beginning of a long  string of triumphs. Gretzky turned pro at 16, landed in the NHL -- his third  pro league -- at 17, and thereafter let his stick do most of the talking. In  the book, he does criticize the occasional coach, but rarely other players, and  is careful not to boast. He says he looks "like the guy who bags your groceries  at the local supermarket," he always finished dead last in the Oilers' strength  tests, and, amazingly, he has poor peripheral vision.  </P> <P> Gretzky tiptoes around his experiences to date in Los Angeles. He heaps praise  on the Kings' owner, Bruce McNall; hints at minor problems with coaching and  management, and talks of bringing the Stanley Cup to the city, but says he  still wants Edmonton "to be a home." Hockey fans will get a kick out of  Gretzky, for the author is more voluble here -- credit co-author Rick Reilly --  than his reputation would have us believe.  </P></p>

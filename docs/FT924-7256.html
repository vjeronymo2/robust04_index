			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (19): Driving a hard bargain - Car rental CUSTOMERS renting cars have never had it so good. It is now quicker, easier and cheaper than ever before to rent a car. A combination of the recession and new market entrants has brought innovation and more competitive prices as car rental supply now outstrips demand. All the leading companies - and there are six significant players in the UK market, Avis, Hertz, Europcar, Budget, Eurodollar and Alamo - have introduced one or all of the following: express desks to save queueing, virtually inclusive prices to eradicate those surprising extras on the bill, speedier reservations and reward schemes for frequent users. American car hire giant Alamo's foray into the UK market probably started the price war. Although it is one of the smallest operators in the UK its aggressive pricing has been successful at its 17 locations in the country. Some are off-airport. 'We're value for money, it's a realistic price we offer,' explains Alamo UK marketing manager Janet Ball. Alamo operates on a national tariff, whereas some of the other car rental companies have different prices for airport and central London rentals. Like its competitors, Alamo has an express product for corporate users. This includes an express desk to avoid queueing, upgrades, guaranteed rates, special offers and discounts. Next year will see the UK launch of its charge card in a further bid to speed up the payment procedure. The equivalent express product is Club Gold at the much larger operator, Hertz. Geared to the frequent user, it offers no queues, no form-filling or signatures and personal recognition at the counter. It was launched in Europe 18 months ago and is now available at 50 airports in Europe and at 170 in North America. Avis goes one better, as befits the UK market leader, with an Avis Club umbrella product driven by a personal ID number. This has several benefits. One is a reward scheme called Avis Options launched in May this year with low attainment levels. For example, rent once and receive free parking at Heathrow. Also launched this summer was Best Deal Promise, which triggers the best price from wherever you rent as long as you are an Avis Club member. Preferred Service is geared to a paperless transaction. By signing a direct debit no paperwork is necessary and you go straight to your name box and collect the keys to your car. Also a queue bypass facility called Avis Express has been running for some years. 'You could argue that the recession has brought this on,' says Bruce Tranter, sales and marketing director of Avis UK. 'People have been educated to think about bargains and prices are being driven downwards.' Book a Group A car (the lowest category rentable car) and drive away in a Group B car at no extra cost, book a Group B car and drive a Group C car instead. And upgrades are not the only perks. Since the recession started, time and mileage tariffs have been substituted by an all-inclusive tariff (CDW - Collision Damage Waiver) but you will probably still have to purchase PAI, Personal Accident Insurance. Europcar Interrent UK has probably suffered more than most during the recession but has responded with innovation. In autumn it launched an all-inclusive rate called UK Traveller starting at Pounds 39.50 a day for a Group A vehicle. But it is not available to the casual walk-up customer;the car must be booked through central reservations to ensure the rate and it is inclusive of unlimited mileage, CDW and value added tax. The only extra is PAI. UK Traveller is one of four products the company launched in September to simplify car rental. 'They aim to take the mystery out of car rental rates. It's one of the biggest issues facing our industry,' says Tim Harford, managing director of Europcar Interrent UK. 'We've got to be a little bit different from Hertz and Avis. The industry leaders have adopted gimmicks, like theft protection at Pounds 2, Pounds 3 or Pounds 4 per days but our CDW includes loss arising from accident, damage or theft,' says Mr Harford. The other three products launched in the autumn are UK Traveller Plus, designed for small to medium-sized corporate users spending under Pounds 75,000 a year on car rental, which will trigger an unlimited mileage rate. The third product is Local Traveller designed for the leisure user and starting at Pounds 32 a day inclusive of CDW and VAT. The last product is Weekend Rates, including unlimited mileage, CDW and VAT on two, three and four-day weekend rates from Pounds 53 a day. Budget pipped Europcar to the post as regards its rates-driven launch this year. Budget launched fully inclusive rates in July, valid until the end of the year for business travellers at 3,600 locations in 46 countries. The lead-in booking time has been reduced from 24 hours to just 12 hours. (Book through central reservations or on its freephone number.) The minimum rental period is one day. The rate includes unlimited mileage, CDW, all taxes and, unusually, PAI. 'Businesses are really looking more closely at what they're spending their money on,' said a Budget spokesperson. 'Some companies are taking out the pool car and substituting a rental car as and when required. It's far cheaper that way.' The Dollars 64,000 dollar question is how long can it last? More and more car rental companies are now located on-airport, which has intensified competition and driven down the margins. 'Margins are not good in the short term,' admits Mr Tranter of Avis, 'but we're offering better products so we'll get bigger volume.' "The industry is not in the medium term going to be able to offer the same level of deals,' believes Europcar's Harford. He believes that as car rental companies have to start to absorb the residual values of second-hand cars so rates to corporate customers will increase, by around 10 per cent. 'The margins are very thin on major accounts,' says Mr Harford. 'We're under great pressure.'</p>

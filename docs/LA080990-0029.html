			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SANTEE, COUNTY TAKE THEIR BATTLE OVER TEMPORARY JAIL TO LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE  </P> <P> Bad blood between San Diego governmental officials boiled over Wednesday during  a legislative committee hearing on whether the state should intervene in the  controversy surrounding the temporary men's jail in Santee.  </P> <P> The East County municipality wants lawmakers to step in and force San Diego  County officials to the negotiating table to haggle over a date when the  temporary 600-bed facility will be shut down and moved out of town.  </P> <P> The county is crying foul, accusing Santee of trying to use the Legislature as  an unnecessary cudgel in a local dispute.  </P> <P> As of late Wednesday night, lawmakers had yet to decide whether to step into  what one of them called a "cat fight."  </P> <P> At issue is a bill sponsored by Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) that would force  officials from the county and Santee to enter into "voluntary" mediation and  come up with an agreement by February for the dismantling of the temporary  jail, which was built next to the Los Colinas Women's Detention Facility to  house an overflowing prison population. Originally, county officials said the  jail would be removed by 1996. But, with plans going slowly for permanent  replacements elsewhere, Santee residents are afraid the county will want to  push back that date or renege on the pledge altogether.  </P> <P> Bob J. Wilson, one-time state senator representing Santee and now a Sacramento  lobbyist, testified that the city is anxious to get rid of the men's facility.  The county has concentrated 28% of its prison population into one of its  smallest cities, and the jail is only 500 feet from private residences and two  blocks from an elementary school, he said.  </P> <P> Since the jail was erected last year, there have been four escapes, a  20-prisoner riot and an influx of prison visitors and drug dealers in the area,  he said.  </P> <P> "Santee is one of the less glamorous places in the county," said Killea,  explaining why there may not be enough local sympathy to uproot the temporary  facility. "It's not the beautiful, affluent North County . . . and the county  comes along and slaps it in the face."  </P> <P> "We're telling them you have to voluntarily get together," Killea said about  the bill. "It's a slight contradiction, but it is saying you have to sit at the  table and work this out."  </P> <P> But County Supervisor Brian Bilbray told the panel that passing the bill would  be "immoral," since it favors Santee over other cities with jails -- such as  Vista and Chula Vista. He said the county cannot commit on a date to get out of  Santee because it is negotiating to build permanent replacement jails in  Clairemont Mesa and East Otay Mesa.  </P> <P> "This is a Pandora's box you don't want to open," an animated Bilbray warned  the committee.  </P> <P> Bilbray said later that lawmakers should stay out of local disputes, especially  since county officials are willing to stick their necks out and make some  unpopular decisions.  </P> <P> "If Sacramento is going to get involved in this, then why don't they site the  jails? Why don't they site the landfills? Then the local officials don't have  to take the heat."  </P></p>

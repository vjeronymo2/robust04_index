			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST PERSON: TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A TOY CAN RUIN YOUR HOLIDAY SPIRIT  </P> <P> Now I know what the writers of tax forms do for a living during their  off-season: They write instruction manuals.  </P> <P> It's that time of year when unsuspecting consumers are off to buy holiday  presents that sprout the phrase "assembly required."  </P> <P> Sometimes the words are boldly displayed; but often the phrase is lettered in  tiny print, somewhere below "Made in Czechoslovakia."  </P> <P> Beware of the modifier "some." What is the difference between "some assembly  required," and "assembly required"? Perhaps the manufacturer is trying to  convince you, in using the word "some," that only a little bit is left to do.  This is not necessarily so.  </P> <P> Sometimes the carton will state the time needed for assembly. "Takes only  minutes to assemble" is an indicator of trouble. Why wasn't the manufacturer  more specific? Minutes lead into hours. Hours lead into days.  </P> <P> I purchased a swing set for my kids, and on the box it said, "three-minute  frame assembly." It took three days for my father-in-law (who is an engineer)  and me to put the thing together. The frame may have taken only three minutes;  but the swings, ladder, slide, glider and "sky shooter" required the other  4,317 minutes.  </P> <P> Another indicator of potential trouble is a listing of tools needed for  assembly. If nothing is said about tools, you can assume that you will need a  complete workshop because they didn't have the room to list all the tools that  are necessary.  </P> <P> If the label calls for a hammer, then assume that none of the parts really fit  together, but will require smashing into place. One set of directions I have  calls for a hammer and a block of wood. The manufacturers apparently didn't  want the buyer to mar the finish on the metal while pounding the bolts through  the holes that didn't quite match up.  </P> <P> Watch for tool lists that say "adjustable wrench." "Adjustable" hints that  assembly requires a variety of nuts and bolts, none of which fit any  standard-size wrench or socket set.  </P> <P> Be aware that if the tool list specifies both a slotted-tip and a Phillips  screwdriver, then the makers also expect you to know the difference between  things like axle bolts, shoulder bolts, carriage bolts and hex bolts.  </P> <P> Never purchase anything that comes with its own "Special Tool." The "Special  Tool" will bend.  </P> <P> Above all, remember that locking nuts come loose easily.  </P> <P> If you get as far as opening the box and finding the instruction manual, watch  for these pitfalls:  </P> <P> I bought an outdoor gas barbecue grill that came with two instruction booklets.  On the front of instruction Book "B" was a big rectangle with the words: "READ  INSTRUCTION BOOK 'A' FIRST!"  </P> <P> Were they afraid to give away the surprise ending? Needless to say, the tools  needed included an adjustable wrench, slotted and Phillips screw drivers, and a  hammer. Any fool could have seen that the summer would be over before I could  get that grill together.  </P> <P> Look at the manual. Is it larger than the telephone book?  </P> <P> Does the manual have the words caution or important printed in bold letters?  These are put in to specify paragraphs that are garbled or misprinted, so that  you can't feel confident about what you are doing.  </P> <P> If the instructions are printed in four languages, and the German is more  understandable than the English, return the item before any further unpacking.  But I have to give the German instructions credit. They don't make up words,  like "bell-shaped washer." They call a wassergeschutzten a wassergeschutzten.  </P> <P> If the instructions say that this manual contains assembly instructions for  more than one model, assume that every picture or illustration is for the model  that you don't have. After spending more than one hour trying to locate Slot D,  take the asterisk seriously and read at the bottom of the page in small print  that your model does not come with Slot D.  </P> <P> Does the manual have a parts list? Does the list have more parts than the  corner hardware store?  </P> <P> Are there full-scale drawings of the parts? Do the parts included in the  unopenable plastic bag look anything like the pictures?  </P> <P> Does the instruction manual have "exploded" drawings? These are drawings that  show each part with a dotted line leading to where it theoretically should end  up. Does the exploded drawing have smaller close-up exploded drawings of  "special assemblies?" That means the draftsman could not figure out where the  parts fitted onto the whole. (If a separate instruction book is included for a  "special assembly," then stop payment on your check.)  </P> <P> Never attempt to assemble a product that has a toll-free number to call for  help. If you couldn't understand the instructions while looking at the manual  and parts, how do you think you are going to communicate your problem over the  phone to somebody in Illinois?  </P></p>

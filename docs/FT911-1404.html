			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Dillie's back in town DILLIE KEANE is on the road again. Packing her piano, and occasional accompanist Sarah Travis, on her back she is taking her mordant songs of post-Thatcherite Britain, and the travails of a post-thirty woman, to the more discerning small venues of the land. Citizen Keane is at the Drill Hall off London's Tottenham Court Road until the end of May. Nothing changes. Yuppies, now 'ageing and downwardly mobile'; a rather touching Requiem for Mrs T, seen snipping the dead heads off her garden roses while muttering 'Howe' and 'Heseltine'; and the inescapable nuns, still come within Ms Keane's caustic but somehow kindly satirical fire. Perhaps it is time for her to move on. The influence on her Irish Catholic childhood of Sister Mary of the Angels, here giving advice on sex, obviously weighs heavily on Dillie but is starting to be a burden to her audience. A new character, Dorothy, a retired Manhattan fashion shop assistant, was a more original creation and points to a cosmopolitan future. There are really two Dillie Keane's - the actress and the performer of heart wrenchingly sad songs. Sometimes the two merge into one, in 'Dear Mr Brownlow' where the 35 year old spinster writes a letter that will never be posted, and 'Ealing Broadway Baby', a revived favourite in which a smiling through the tears rested actress reaffirms her faith in an unfulfillable destiny. The ending is slapstick, with Sir Walter Raleigh confusing tobacco with tabasco and causing all sorts of problems for Good Queen Bess. Only Dillie Keane can find fun in soft-core porno movies, with their ambitions towards pseudo-intellectualism, and her solo recreation of troilism will cheer the nation, but performing a one-woman show no longer really stretches the potential in this enigmatic figure, with her hangdog face and her loosely hidden emotions.</p>

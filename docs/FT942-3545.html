			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Old Mutual to launch first UK S African trust Old Mutual, the life company which is South Africa's largest institutional investor, is to launch the UK's first South African investment trust. The Old Mutual South Africa Trust is hoping to raise about Pounds 50m to invest in a range of South African companies, with a bias towards smaller and medium-sized companies and the financial and industrial sectors. The fund will be managed with a bottom-up, stock-picking style. The fund's managers say that South Africa combines much of the growth potential of an emerging market with the developed infrastructure of an advanced industrialised economy and a stock market more than 100 years old. The ending of sanctions and improved political stability provide encouraging opportunities for growth. The fund's bias towards smaller companies is intended to avoid duplicating investment in areas which are easily accessible to foreign institutional investors, focusing instead on areas of the market for which research is not widely available overseas. South Africa is due to be included in the IFC emerging markets index, where it will have a weighting of about 13 per cent. This is expected to lead to heavy inflows of overseas money into South Africa, and the Old Mutual trust hopes to appeal to institutions looking for a quick way to increase South African exposure in line with the index. The fund is mainly targeted at institutional investors, but there will also be a public offer to allow private investors a chance to participate. Lord Tombs, former chairman of Rolls-Royce, will chair the trust, with other board members drawn from Old Mutual and the UK investment trust sector. Shares will be issued at 100p with one warrant attached to every five shares. The public offer opens on June 23, and closes on July 1.</p>

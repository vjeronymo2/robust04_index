			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPULIST PRIEST WINS IN HAITI, IS BACKED BY U.S.  </P> <P> Unofficial returns Monday swept the populist priest Father Jean-Bertrand  Aristide to a landslide victory in Haiti's presidential election, bringing an  immediate pledge of support from the United States.  </P> <P> "We congratulated him on his victory and told him the U.S. fully supports the  democratic process in Haiti," said Assistant Secretary of State Bernard  Aronson, representing President Bush's official observer delegation to the  remarkably peaceful Sunday election.  </P> <P> Aristide's radical posture and anti-American rhetoric had initially worried  U.S. officials. Before becoming a candidate, the charismatic priest continually  called on his nation's poor to take matters into their own hands rather than  trust to elections. After joining the race for president, he took steps to  moderate his platform and tone down his sermons, but questions remained Monday  as to the direction his government would take.  </P> <P> "We fully respect him as the apparent president-elect of Haiti and look forward  to working closely with his government," Aronson said. He indicated that U.S.  financial aid to Haiti will resume as soon as the new Aristide government, to  be inaugurated Feb. 7, makes clear "its plans and policies and its needs."  </P> <P> Former World Bank President Robert S. McNamara, a member of another observer  delegation led by former President Jimmy Carter, said he is "certain" that the  bank and other international financial institutions also will offer assistance.  </P> <P> Aristide had campaigned against foreign aid as a panacea for Haiti's massive  economic and social problems.  </P> <P> The streets of the capital were engulfed for much of the day by torrents of  impoverished but joyous supporters of the 37-year-old slum priest, tens of  thousands of them dancing, singing and waving tree branches symbolic of  victory.  </P> <P> One act of violence marred the citywide celebration when a member of a police  patrol fired into a crowd of chanting demonstrators, killing a pregnant woman,  then drove a pickup truck across her body, according to eyewitnesses.  </P> <P> The killing took place directly in front of St. John Bosco Church, where  Aristide used to preach before he was expelled from the Salesian order two  years ago after upsetting the Catholic hierarchy with his tirades against  authority and outside influences -- including the U.S. Embassy here.  </P> <P> One of several failed attempts to assassinate Aristide took place in the church  in September, 1988, when 13 of his parishioners were hacked and clubbed to  death by a still-unpunished band of thugs operating under Haitian army  protection. Witnesses identified the attackers as former strong-arm men of the  Tontons Macoutes, the ruthless private militia that kept the Duvalier family  dictatorship in power for 29 years.  </P> <P> But aside from the one incident, police and army troops maintained polite  security, and there were no signs of the Macoute thugs.  </P> <P> A spokesman at Aristide's political headquarters said the priest would have no  comment on his victory until it is officially confirmed by Haiti's Electoral  Council, the constitutional body that organized and conducted the long-delayed  first democratic election in Haiti's 186-year history. The council said it  would be releasing results piecemeal over the next two days.  </P> <P> But as Aronson's early congratulations suggested, there was no doubt concerning  the final result. A senior member of the 202-person observer team from the  Organization of American States said data collected by OAS and U.N. experts  gave Aristide 60% to 70% of the total vote. His nearest competitor in the  11-man race was Marc Bazin, 58, a former World Bank official, who polled less  than 20%, the OAS source said.  </P> <P> The single partial result released Monday night by the Electoral Council showed  Aristide with 70.6% to Bazin's 12.6% of a small cluster of precincts totaling  27,227 votes.  </P> <P> The estimated 1,000 international observers from Carter's group, the OAS, the  United Nations and other organizations appeared to be unanimous in certifying  the elections as free, fair and credible. Carter said there were  irregularities, mainly delays in distributing ballots and other election  materials, in only 4% of the more than 14,000 polling places around the  country. He said that was insignificant "even in nations that have been  conducting democratic elections for generations."  </P> <P> Aristide's stunning victory left Haiti's traditional social and financial power  structure, as well as foreign governments that had long urged democratic  elections here, feeling vaguely uneasy concerning the direction his government  will take.  </P> <P> The wispy, bespectacled priest has been an emotional and often mystical  champion of Haiti's downtrodden poor, often urging them to take justice into  their own hands to eradicate Tontons Macoutes and others with links to the  oppressive Duvalier dynasty. For months he opposed democratic elections as a  trick of the conservative Establishment designed to further oppress the poor,  who flocked to him as to a new messiah.  </P> <P> But after entering the presidential race, Aristide moderated what seemed to be  class-war elements in his version of liberation theology and his vaguely  socialist, anti-American rhetoric. Instead, he offered an imprecise program of  "justice, participation and transparency."  </P> <P> Conservative critics fear that his mass of poor followers, if not Aristide  himself, may have in mind the same kind of street justice that during the past  five years has repeatedly seen mobs kill suspected Duvalierists and storm their  houses and businesses.  </P> <P> They also fear that Aristide's idea of mass participation in government may be  to appeal to the mob rather than work through the constitutionally elected  legislature after he takes power. Legislative opposition appears inevitable  because Aristide's party fielded only a few candidates for the Senate and  National Assembly in Sunday's election, virtually guaranteeing that the  majority of both houses will represent the parties of his election opponents.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleg Zolotov under the "Such News: TRUD and News </F> Agency Correspondents Report" rubric: "`Immigrants' Run Wild"]    [Text] Russia is becoming a center of illegal immigration.  According to information at the disposal of the MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs], various international criminal organizations  are using our country's territory to get their people into other  states. This was reported yesterday at a news conference in the  Russian Federation MVD.    Militia Lieutenant General Vladimir Kolesnikov, Russia's  chief detective, said that Moscow is becoming a main center  where such "refugees" gather from all over the world. Illegal  immigrants come to us mainly from Vietnam, Taiwan, and China.  Moreover they do not turn to the Russian authorities for  assistance but register directly with the UN mission in Moscow  -- after which it is very difficult to expel them from Russia.    For information: Whereas 530 crimes committed by foreign  citizens were recorded in 1992, more than 15,000 were recorded  in 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 3 June, Japan and the United States resumed  negotiations on government procurement under the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks. During the negotiations, U.S.  negotiators did not drop the U.S. proposal to discuss expanding  the procurement of equipment by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Corporation (NTT). Why is the United States taking a tough stand  on the NTT's procurement of equipment? As one of reasons for the  United States taking such a tough stand, an official familiar  with telecommunications projects has cited the fact that the NTT  and the private sector are set to take the lead in promoting the  project for building Japan's next- generation telecommunications  network (the optical fiber communications network). The United  States therefore has to attach great importance to selling its  telecommunications equipment to NTT. Japanese negotiators are  agonizing over how to deal with the U.S. proposal, claiming "It  is not rational for the governments of the two countries to  discuss the Japanese private sector's procurement."    The project for building the next-generation  telecommunications network is aimed at installing optical fiber  cables and replacing the current telephone switchboards with  digital-type telephone switchboards across Japan by the year  2010 and the new telecommunications network will make it  possible to transmit a large volume of information including  clear live visual images at a high speed. It has been pointed  out that the next-generation telecommunications network will  become an important infrastructure to shore up the multimedia.  Japan is expected to invest 75-95 trillion yen to build the  next-generation telecommunications network, and the project for  the network will provide American corporations with great  business opportunities.    Which organizations will take charge of building the next-  generation telecommunications network? This question has so far  been a focal point. At first, the idea surfaced that a  corporation should be established to build the network. The  Telecommunications Council (an advisory body to the minister of  posts and telecommunications) compiled a report in late May  asserting that "the NTT and private enterprises should take the  lead in building the next-generation telecommunications  network." The report drew a conclusion on the question of which  organizations should take charge of building the network. The  report made the assertion after concluding that using the  private sector's vitality can better contribute to building the  next-generation telecommunications network. The task for the  United States has become more how to sell American  telecommunications apparatus to the NTT than to the Japanese  Government.    The negotiations on government procurement under the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are mandated to discuss ways  to increase the government's procurement of foreign equipment  and materials. The U.S. attitude is that "the Japanese  Government holds a stake in the NTT and the NTT is a  semi-official organization. The two countries can discuss the  NTT's procurement at the negotiations on government  procurement." The Foreign Ministry is not hiding its  embarrassment.    The prevailing view is that behind the U.S. proposal is a  concerted strategy charted by the U.S. Administration and the  private sector that aims to establish American superiority over  Japan in telecommunications and information technologies. Some  Japanese Government officials, who want to move the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks forward one way or other, have begun  voicing the need to hold another Japan-U.S. governmental parley  to discuss the "NTT issue."</p>

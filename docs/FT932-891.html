			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Government to back early start for N-plant: Further public consultation likely over Thorp THE GOVERNMENT will throw its support behind British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp reprocessing plant on Monday. It is also expected, however, to announce a further round of public consultation, which might delay a final decision for months. The Pounds 2.8bn plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, which environmental pressure groups call Britain's biggest white elephant, is waiting for a licence from the Department of the Environment to begin operation. The government will call for the Commons to support 'the commissioning of the plant at the earliest practicable date', its most forthright endorsement in the year-long debate over Thorp's future. The wording is contained in a draft amendment to be offered by the Department of Trade and Industry, BNF's shareholder, to a motion from the Liberal Democrat leader attacking Thorp. Monday's motion from Mr Paddy Ashdown says: 'There are increasingly strong economic, environmental and (nuclear) proliferation reasons why it would not be in the interests of Britain or the rest of the world for the government to bring Thorp into operation.' The DoE's expected second round of public consultation follows advice from the attorney-general that it needs to consider the wider diplomatic, economic and environmental issues raised by the plant if it is to avoid the risk of judicial review. Environmentalists last night accused the government of pre-empting the DoE licensing decision with the amendment. Greenpeace, the pressure group, said: 'If the government does not call a full public inquiry, we will see them in court, and press for a judicial review.' The draft amendment includes the words 'subject to receipt by BNF of such consents as are required by law', which appears to leave the way open for a public consultation or inquiry. Swiss and German customers of Thorp wrote to Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, this week, to express their concern at the delay in starting up the plant, which was originally planned for January this year. The DoE is also expected to announce on Monday the publication of the long-awaited report by the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee, which predicts that large amounts of nuclear waste from Thorp's foreign customers will remain at Sellafield permanently. BNF has agreed to keep much of the bulky low and medium-level waste produced by reprocessing foreign customers' nuclear fuel, and to send them back a smaller volume of highly radioactive waste.</p>

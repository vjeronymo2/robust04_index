			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from New York] </F>   [Text] The United States and North Korea held a  working-level contact in New York early this morning and  intensively discussed the presence of an International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team when North Korea replaces  nuclear fuel rods, the additional inspection of a radiochemical  experimental power station in Yongbyon, and the creation of  conditions for holding a third round of U.S.-North Korean  high-level talks.    Kim Chong-so, deputy ambassador at the North Korean mission  to the United Nations, said that a contact with the U.S. side  will be held today, and confirmed that dialogue between the  United States and North Korea has been resumed.    Today's working contact is to be held after two months since  the last U.S.-North Korean contact was held on 25 February, when  the two sides agreed on the principle of inspecting declared  nuclear facilities in North Korea.    Tom Hubbard, deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state, and  other officials attended the contact for the U.S. side, and Kim  Chong-so, deputy ambassador, and Han Song-yol, political  councilor, represented the North Korean side.    At the contact, the U.S. side urged North Korea to allow an  additional inspection of the radiochemical experimental power  station and to create conditions for a third round of talks,  stressing that the ROK side already withdrew the demand for the  exchange of North-South special envoys--a condition for the  third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks--and showed  flexibility.    The United States also pointed out that North Korean nuclear  activities should be frozen while the U.S.-North Korean dialogue  is ongoing, and asked the North Korean side not to load  [changchak] fuel rods again in the five-megawatt nuclear reactor  in Yongbyon. The United States requested that the presence and  inspection activities of the IAEA inspection team be  sufficiently guaranteed.    The North Korean side, however, claimed that it kept all of  the promises it made previously, including allowing all  inspections to ensure continuity of safeguards of nuclear  facilities. Thus, North Korea showed the position of resolving  the issue of additional inspections, the issue of supporting the  work of turning North Korean nuclear facilities into light-water  reactors, and the issue of improving U.S.-North Korean  relations, in a package, by convening the third round of  U.S.-North Korean high-level talks at an early date.</p>

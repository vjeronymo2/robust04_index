			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Seoul takes action to cool raging bourse Share prices on the Seoul bourse fell sharply yesterday as the South Korean government proposed measures to dampen what it feared as destabilising speculation in the stock market. Although the 28 per cent rise in the Korean share index last year was modest compared to other booming Asian markets, government officials have expressed concern in recent weeks that the stock market was becoming overheated. Measures announced by the government yesterday include requiring institutional investors to make a 20 per cent deposit on stock purchases and discourage banks and other financial institutions, which operate under state supervision, from buying shares. It will also lift a ban on selling short on stock, which will enable investors to borrow shares from brokerage houses and sell them. The ban was introduced four years ago in an effort to revive the then-ailing bourse. The government is also demanding that the country's three big investment trust companies sell stocks to pay back loans from the central bank. If the measures fail to cool the market, more companies will be allowed to go public and issue new shares to soak up liquidity. News of the measures, which will go into effect on Monday, sent the Korean general share index down by 19 points to 879, slightly above the year-end closing figure of 866. 'It's disappointing news after the government has tried to build up the market during the last four years,' said Mr Peter Thorn, chief representative for WI Carr in Seoul. Many international institutional investors have predicted that Korea would be one of the leading global bourse performers in 1994 since its shares are still considered undervalued. Some analysts believe that the measures are being taken to slow down sizeable capital inflows from foreign investors, which the government regards as potentially destabilising since it would increase the money supply and led to higher inflation.</p>

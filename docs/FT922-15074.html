			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Green issues high on opposition agenda LABOUR'S first Budget would be accompanied by a 'green book' setting out the environmental impact of the measures proposed - the environmental equivalent of the traditional red book, which outlines the financial consequences of Budget measures. Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's environment protection spokeswoman, said yesterday that the environmental implications of all other proposed legislation would also be clearly set out. Labour wants to make environmental considerations part of the machinery of government. Measures of this type have long been advocated by 'green' pressure groups. The undertakings are in Labour's environmental programme, A Clean Start, published yesterday. It lists 18 proposals the party would put into action in the first 50 days in office. It is proposed that the regulators of the gas and electricity companies would impose obligations on them to become 'energy services companies rather than businesses whose profits come from maximising energy sales.' Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, promised a new environmental protection agency to set and 'rigorously enforce' pollution standards.</p>

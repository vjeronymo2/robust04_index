			<p>BFN     [Text] Representative of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  in Brussels have called on Rwandans to mobilize against France.  The call, he said, concerns Rwandans in the country as well as  those throughout the world. Mobilize to defeat the French  treason plan, Jacques Bihozagara -- who is a member of the RPF's  political desk -- said. You have to live or die in Rwanda, and  nowhere else, he said. Today, I quote, France, completing its  plan, is flying to the aid of the executioners in their  desperate plight.    The RPF delegate also warned those African countries which  might be tempted to take part in the French-led intervention,  and called on the international community not to be accomplice  to a project over which it was not consulted.</p>

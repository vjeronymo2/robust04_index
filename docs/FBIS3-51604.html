In a joint session held in the San Lazarus  legislative chamber, the senators and deputies declared the end  of an extraordinary session of Congress.    At this moment, the legislators are on their way to Los  Pinos  official residence to inform President Carlos Salinas about the  end of this extraordinary session.

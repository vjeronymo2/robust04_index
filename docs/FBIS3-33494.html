The  agreement will be implemented in March and Brazilian  entrepreneurs say problems will probably begin to get serious  within three or four years. The entrepreneurs explained that  the Mexicans will have to streamline their industries and  improve their competitiveness in various areas. Nearly one  fifth of Brazilian exports are sent to the United States.    Spare-part manufacturers are studying possible associations  with Mexican companies. Textile industries are investing in new  technology. Orange juice and shoe producers are seeking new  markets in other areas, among them the EC and Mercosur [Common  Market of the South].    Claudio Vaz -- the president of the Vehicles Spare-Parts and  Components Industry Union, Sindipecas -- said Brazilian  companies may lose more than their markets, they might also lose  investments if U.S. head offices spend the funds assigned for  their Brazilian branches in Mexico.    For this reason Vaz wants to close some industrial  cooperation agreements with Mexican companies before March, as  it was done in Argentina. Of the total exports of spare parts  producers, 38 percent -- or $871 million worth -- go to the  United States, the largest importer of Brazilian spare parts.  Mexico, meanwhile, takes 11 percent, or $250 million worth.  Vaz anticipates the industry will export at least 10 percent  more this year, and total sales are estimated to reach $2.5  billion.    According to news that leaked out last week, the Mangels  company, a wheel manufacturer, is planning to invest nearly $15  million in the purchase of a U.S. company. Directors of the  company believe the deal is the best way to increase its  competitiveness when NAFTA starts operating.    Orange juice exporters believe NAFTA is just one more reason  for companies to seek new markets. Orange juice producers  export nearly 30 percent of their total output to the United  States. At the beginning of the 1980's, orange juice exports to  the United States represented 50 percent of the industry total  output but for some time now producers have increased their  sales to European countries.    Orange juice entrepreneurs believe the United States will  always be an important Brazilian orange juice client. One  Brazilian exporter said orange plantations in Mexico are not  well developed and their processing methods need to improve. He  added that the quality of the Brazilian product has been tested  and approved by the U.S. market.    Another factor favoring Brazil is low production cost.  Brazil spends a lot less on labor, irrigation, and drainage. A  box of orange costs nearly $1 in Brazil. In the United States  the same box costs at least $2.20.    Sebastiao Burbulhan, president,of the Sao Paulo State Shoe  Industry Union, has said that shoe exporters will also invest  more in new markets, such as the Mercosur market. The largest  share of their exports -- 69.3 percent of the $2 billion  exported annually -- go to the United States. Burbulhan said  the industry is most concerned about U.S. threats of sanctions  due to the problem of patents. "Sales enquiries are less  frequent," Burbulhan said.    The textile industry is also preparing to face competition  from Mexican products. Luis Americo Medeiros, president of the  Sao Paulo State Textile Industry Union, has said that last year  companies invested $600 million in importing machinery and  equipment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zlin, South Moravia, May 6 (CTK) -- Environment  Minister Frantisek Benda expressed his support of nuclear power  today at a technical college in Zlin. The consumption of  non-renewable fossil fuels is "barbarianism," he said, but  emphasized that safety principles had to be respected in nuclear  power plants.    Benda has been opposed to putting into operation the nuclear  power plant now being under construction in Temelin, south  Bohemia, until a "nuclear" law is passed by the parliament. The  law is to clearly define the plant operator's responsibilities  and address burnt-out fuel dumping.    The "Velvet Revolution" did not solve environmental  problems;  in fact, the environment is being destroyed now even more than  in the past, Benda said. "Let us not delude ourselves by  thinking advanced European countries do not overexploit the  environment. At home they keep everything neat and orderly, but  their waste often ends up in developing countries," he cautioned.    In Germany, the government subsidizes waste treatment, and  waste is sold to the Czech Republic for low prices, Benda said,  adding that this had led many Czech waste treatment plants to  started buying waste from Germany.    The problem will have to be solved by the proposed law on  waste. The passage of that bill has been delayed in part because  the Trade and Industry Ministry has not yet prepared a bill on  packaging, Benda said.</p>

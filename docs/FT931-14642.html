			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: Controller time - Radio WE USUALLY have the Controllers in their duty phone-ins at this time of the year, though if they have important decisions to disclose this is hardly where we shall hear them. Radio 4 in Call to Account last Saturday gave no fresh news of the 24-hour news-coverage, but wise advice on hearing FM. Callers to Radio 3 on Sunday were so relentlessly talkative that the Controller could hardly get a word in. Radio 1's callers, also on Sunday, may have liked as I did the Controller's wisdom on promotion and presentation but mostly what they wanted was less chat and more variety. Radio 2, on Tuesday of last week relied on Brian Hayes, and I missed him. We still have to wait for Radio 5. It was worth reviving Peter Buckman's dramatisation of Virginia Woolf's Orlando (Radio 4, Monday), but how much less exciting the story seems today than we thought in the 1930s. The adventures of Orlando, who lived from the 16th century to the 20th, changing from man to woman halfway through, was derived from the character of Vita Sackville-West. Presenting them by way of a narrator (Vivian Pickles) deprived them of some dramatic power; Jenny Stoller did well in the name part, though detectably a lady throughout. Penny Gold directed. We should now have Edna O'Brien's Virginia, about the same great ladies but more sympathetic. Radio 3's Sunday play was Tom Stoppard's Undiscovered Country, adapted from Schnitzler. It opens on the death of a duel victim and ends on the victor of another duel, each quarrel resulting from the infidelity of the same woman, wife of the ultimate winner. Duels and infidelity are small-talk among the wealthy Viennese on holiday in the Dolomites at the start of the century, but the tale, hinging on the concept of honour, is not quite worthy of either Schnitzler or Stoppard, and the dialogue has an oddly everyday flavour. Maureen O'Brien and Ronald Pickup, though, were touching enough as the liberally married pair, under Martin Jenkins's direction. Woman's Hour is currently allowing Maureen Lipman to chat every day about her life. Anyone who has seen her in Lost in Yonkers or answering long-distance telephone-calls in television ads, will know something of Maureen Lipman's peculiar charm; but what is so special about her life? Precisely that it is like the lives of so many of us, and that in 'When's It Coming Out?' she recounts it so delightfully. The series ends on the 18th, but you can buy it on a BBC Radio Collection cassette and hear the lot. I was unfair last week to label Craig Brown's and Myles Kington's new series 'unpromising' after hearing only one day's worth of each. Having heard two more of both, I confirm my judgment. Brown's lines for veteran broadcaster 'Wallace Arnold' in Welcome to my Wireless are quite bare of wit, and Harry Enfield's funny voices add nothing. Kington interviews the famous dead, this week Robinson Crusoe (next, Mona Lisa). The dodge is to ask about the matters they are reputed for and find that they do not want to discuss them. Kington has an amusing manner, but his thrusts are often predictable. I must also be unfair to Roger Graef's five-strong series, Living Dangerously, which began last Sunday. He interviews young criminals, and I can't tell if the next four will be as interesting as the first was. Bobby, its subject, came from a rough, broken family, lived in sundry homes, stole cars, thieved to buy 'grass' (he needed about Pounds 30 a day), only burgled 'rich' houses, carried a knife but never used it. After a course at Sherborne House under the Probation service, he thieves no more, has begun a computer course. It would at least be unfair not to draw attention to such things.</p>

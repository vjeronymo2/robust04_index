			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Haiti pullout before February 1996 US officials assured Congress yesterday they expected American forces to leave Haiti by February 1996 at the latest, but the White House said it was relieved Capitol Hill had not set a definite pullout date, Reuter reports from Washington. 'We fully expect that the entire operation in all of its phases will be over by February 1996, which is the date specified in the relevant UN resolution,' defence undersecretary Walter Slocombe told a hearing of the House of Representatives armed services committee. 'We are very conscious of the risk of getting sucked into things that seem like good ideas at the time that get us deeper and deeper in,' Mr Slocombe said. 'And we are going to resist that temptation.' The White House said President Clinton wanted to withdraw US troops as soon as possible, but was pleased Congress had not demanded it by a certain date in a resolution passed on Thursday calling for a quick pullout. 'I think the president is obviously gratified that they did not include a certain date' for removing the troops, White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said. 'And the president certainly agrees with the notion that the troops ought to be withdrawn as soon as possible,' she said. The Senate and House voted Thursday to approve a non-binding resolution urging a prompt, orderly pullout of US forces, but didn't set a date. The Senate resolution also chided the president for refusing to seek congressional authorisation for the September 19 military intervention in Haiti. Ms Myers said it was 'no secret' that many lawmakers had wanted Mr Clinton to ask for congressional approval prior to the intervention, and that he had a 'longstanding disagreement' with Capitol Hill on the subject. 'I think he (Clinton) has outlined what the conditions for withdrawal are - a secure environment that allows us to turn the situation over to the UN,' Ms Myers said. Mr Slocombe said the US military operation is limited to restoring President Jean Bertrand Aristide, assuring parliamentary elections this year and presidential elections by the end of next year.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: ABB plans to sell off telecoms equipment unit Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-based industrial group, is planning to sell off its telecommunications equipment manufacturing arm, ABB Nera. An initial placing will be made with a group of institutional investors before the rest of the company is floated on the Oslo stock market early in the new year. ABB has been progressively concentrating on its core business of electrical engineering. Mr Asbjorn Birkeland, Nera's managing director, said yesterday the sell-off was in the interests of both companies. The unit would retain its existing management and would find it easier to raise funds for expansion as an independent company. Formed in 1987, Nera has been growing at an average 20 per cent a year, he said. Based in Bergen, Norway, Nera employs about 1,450 people and claims to be one of the largest manufacturers of equipment for satellite-based mobile communications. Last year it turned over NKr2bn (Dollars 29.8m), with profits before tax of about 5 per cent of sales. Some 80 per cent of sales are made outside Norway. It has manufacturing agreements with AT&amp;T of the US and has worked on projects with Sweden's Ericsson.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Sears Sears, it seems, cannot kick its addiction to extraordinary items. Unlike Tarmac and its torrent of red ink, Sears has not yet summoned the will to embrace fully Professor Tweedie's reforms. As well as taking losses below the line Sears showed a Pounds 14.6m profit on property disposals which would have been a loss of Pounds 5.2m on the new basis. Some Pounds 4.8m of provisions against the housebuilding business were also released - reducing the interest line - while a further Pounds 28m of extraordinary costs were taken against its closure. This effectively increases reported profits by almost Pounds 5m and is disappointing in a company which argues that old habits are on the way out. About the best that can be said is that 1991-92 was worse, with larger property gains and interest reductions. Tricks of the accounting light to one side, the new management is making some progress with operations. British Shoe has perked up as better retailing discipline is applied to stocks, product ranges and relationships with suppliers. There is more margin improvement to come and a revamp of the well-worn shoe shops is promised for 1994. Yet there were setbacks elsewhere. The newly-acquired Dutch mail order business made a loss, as did Olympus. Shoes and womenswear are doing well from the upturn, but mail order, sportswear and Adams children's clothes are struggling in tough markets. Those holding on for the recovery must hope that Sears' reputation for being asset-rich but accident-prone goes the way of extraordinary losses.</p>

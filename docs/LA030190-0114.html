			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDERS AND UNIONS REACH ACCORD ON DRUG TESTING  </P> <P> Four Southern California construction associations and four building trades  unions representing more than 100,000 workers said Wednesday they have reached  agreement on drug testing of workers who are observed to be acting suspiciously  on the job.  </P> <P> The agreement, spearheaded by the Associated General Contractors of California  and covering union construction jobs in 11 counties, is among an increasing  number of multi-employer pacts in the United States that are gradually breaking  down union resistance to drug testing by assuring safeguards against arbitrary  use.  </P> <P> Glenn Rothner, a labor law attorney who represented the Southern California  District Council of Laborers in negotiations leading to the agreement, said it  offers more protection of worker rights than numerous drug-testing programs  that have been instituted by individual contractors.  </P> <P> The agreement allows contractors to require drug tests for "reasonable cause,"  based on observation of on-the-job behavior. It requires a second, confirming  test of all samples and allows employees discharged for positive tests to  appeal through the union grievance process.  </P> <P> "We feel it's a major step," said Ken Perry, the Associated General  Contractors' industrial relations director for Southern California, who  negotiated the agreement. "There is recognition among unions that what we're  talking about is job-site safety."  </P> <P> Private employers are free to require any drug testing they want. More than 20%  of all companies now test for drugs, according to a 1988 Labor Department  study.  </P> <P> But in unionized companies, the National Labor Relations Board has ruled that  employers cannot begin drug-testing programs without first negotiating the  subject with their unions. (Drug testing of job applicants does not require  such negotiation.)  </P> <P> Unions have complained that many drug-testing programs demanded by employers  lack protection of employee privacy, do not require adequate confirmation of  the tests or permit testing in too many circumstances, including periodic  random testing without cause. In some cases unions have alleged that employers  began programs without consultation.  </P> <P> These objections are increasing because more private employers are introducing  drug testing as government agencies begin to require it. "Private employers are  getting into the act, saying they're doing it defensively, because all of the  druggies -- applicants who can't get past the government tests -- are now  coming to them for jobs," said an official of the United Brotherhood of  Carpenters' national office.  </P> <P> The Southern California agreement, which Rothner said is the first agreement on  drug-testing standards reached between coalitions of management and labor in  the region, takes effect today.  </P> <P> It will be used by members of the Associated General Contractors, the Building  Industry Assn. of Southern California, the Engineering Contractors Assn. and  the Southern California Contractors Assn. The four participating unions include  the council of laborers, the Southern California Conference of Carpenters, the  Eleven Southern California Counties Cement Masons and Teamsters Joint Council  42. Unions representing ironworkers and equipment-operating engineers also were  solicited but chose not to sign the agreement.  </P> <P> A key compromise in the agreement was the willingness of the contractors groups  to not require the right to test workers randomly. Testing will be restricted  to workers whose behavior gives a supervisor and a second observing individual  reasonable cause to suspect the worker is "impaired from performing" his or her  job. This standard also will be applied to decisions on whether to test for  drugs in the wake of accidents. Some employers have preferred to test all  employees involved in accidents, regardless of circumstances.  </P> <P> Workers taken off the job after testing positive will be rehired if they go  through a rehabilitation program and if work is available in their specialty.  </P> <P> "I don't think you'll find anybody in our unions opposed to drug testing," said  Jerry Cremins, president of the California Building and Construction Trades  Council. "What they're afraid of is abuses in the system."  </P></p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Commission plans will loosen carmakers' grip on dealers - John Griffiths explains the impact of changes to EU regulation of vehicle sales The European Commission yesterday dismayed consumer groups and brought relief to car manufacturers by proposing yesterday that the motor industry keep its selective and exclusive distribution networks for another 10 years. In a long-awaited draft regulation, the Commission cited the complex nature of cars and their safety implications as a major reason for continuing to exempt car manufacturers and their dealers from normal EU competition rules governing the sale of goods. After a fierce internal fight between the competition and industry directorates, the Commission plans to renew, with some alterations, the so-called block exemption first granted to the European motor industry for 10 years in 1985. The current exemption expires at the end of next June. There will be a discussion period of several months. But given the mass of evidence collected during preparation of the draft document, it is unlikely to change much before being formally adopted by the Commission - early in the new year at latest. The main changes compared with the previous exemption are intended to achieve several objectives. These include improving the functioning of the internal market, ensuring a balance between the interests of the parties concerned and encouraging manufacturer-dealer relations based on partnership. In a statement likely further to irritate consumer groups, the Commission also acknowledged that a factor in retaining the exemption was that the existing distribution structure allows easy monitoring of Japanese vehicle movements - and thus helps Commission bureaucrats manage the EC-Japan 'understanding' under which Japanese car imports to the EU are monitored during the transition to an open EU market for cars by 1999. The main changes to the exemption affect the balance of power between manufacturers and their dealers, rather than consumers, although they hold out the prospect of considerably sharpening competition in the repairs and service aftermarket. The changes include: Allowing a dealer to distribute and sell more than one make of vehicle. This, however, is subject to conditions likely to be found far from satisfactory by consumer groups. There is no prospect of customers being able to compare, say, a Fiat Punto with a Ford Fiesta on the same showroom floor. The draft directive requires separate premises, even if on the same site, with separate management and 'no possible confusion between the makes'. Manufacturers will be able to terminate a dealer's contract if the dealer wishes to distribute other makes, but only if the termination is based on 'objective criteria'. Arbitrators would be available to settle any disputes. Allowing these multi-dealerships will help give dealers greater independence vis-a-vis manufacturers, claims the Commission. In some continental European markets such as France, where there are no large, multi-outlet dealer groups, this change could have considerable effect. However it will have relatively little impact in the UK, where most manufacturers have already begun to relax their opposition to multi-franchising and a number of multi-franchise sites have already appeared. The setting of sales targets only by mutual agreement between manufacturers and dealers: This represents a small but significant shift in the balance of power between manufacturers and dealers. Currently, manufacturers have the power effectively to impose sales targets. Frequently dealers have regarded such targets as unrealistic, and as placing them under excessive pressure to 'move metal'. Again there is provision for arbitration in the event of disputes, but the precise form of such arbitration last night remained unclear. Allowing dealers to obtain spare parts other than those of the manufacturer, provided they are of equivalent quality: There is an intensively competitive market for spare parts, with many independent suppliers undercutting original equipment prices. However, the provision requiring 'equivalent quality' would appear to give manufacturers considerable leverage over dealers seeking alternative parts sources. Allowing independent garage owners access to the technical knowledge required for repairing vehicles: This measure should act as a benefit to consumers in stimulating after-sales competition. But manufacturers will hand over such information very reluctantly and there would appear to be considerable potential for foot-dragging. Freedom for dealers to advertise out of their own sales territories: In effect, the draft merely formalises a practice which is increasingly widespread, with big dealer groups already advertising in national publications. Extension of the minimum duration of agreements between manufacturers and dealers from four to five years and minimum notice of termination from one to two years; A ban on anti-competitive clauses in contracts, on pain of the manufacturer forfeiting its own exemption from competition rules. Banning practices designed to discourage consumers of one EU country buying a new car in another EU state, such as differences in the manufacturer's remuneration to dealers depending on the place of destination of the vehicle.

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NASA'S CONTINUING PROBLEMS  </P> <P> The article is generally correct in its assessment that "Shuttle fixation lies  at the heart of NASA's bureaucratic miasma."  </P> <P> However, Easterbrook is incorrect in suggesting that U.S. scientists have been  remiss, compared to scientists in the Soviet Union, by failing to criticize the  Space Shuttle as impractical.  </P> <P> I was a member of the National Academy of Sciences' Space Sciences Board in  1972 and in 1986, and know that the strong consensus expressed at both times  was that the Space Shuttle was an inefficient means to do science compared to  expendable launch vehicles.  </P> <P> The reason why this consensus of space scientists is not often heard is because  scientists are human, and don't take much satisfaction in talking to a brick  wall. Scientists in the United States have much less prestige and influence  than those in the Soviet Union due to a variety of factors, most important  being the relative power of other institutions, particularly the press and  industry.  </P> <P> WILLIAM M. KAULA  </P> <P> Professor of Geophysics, UCLA  </P> <P> Member, National Academy of Sciences  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / BR franchises right on track Private bidders for British Rail franchises should not be deterred by the apparently high track access charges, Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, which will take over BR's track, said yesterday. He told the Railway Study Association that commentators had suggested that high track charges would mean that a significant proportion of the operating companies' costs would be outside their control. But this should not be a problem: 'In many businesses controllable costs are a relatively small proportion of total costs. Some of our most successful retailing companies have made a fortune from very narrow margins. Even the oil companies exist on the narrowest of margins, paying most of their rent to governments and royalty owners.' The argument that franchisees needed to be able to control their costs had been used to back calls for train operators to be allowed to own the track. But the network could not be broken up into self-contained vertically integrated franchises because many different services used the same track, he said.</p>

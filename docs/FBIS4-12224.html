			<p>BFN     [Text] Security Council's speedy action in condemning the  martyrdom-seeking attack by a Palestinian youth in the town of  'Afula in northern Palestine yesterday has caused the reactions  of Palestinian party and organization leaders. Dr. Fathi  Shaqaqi, general secretary of the Islamic Jihad in Palestine  spoke to our colleague in Beirut few hours ago:    [Begin Shaqaqi recording, in Arabic with superimposed  Persian  translation] The stance taken by the UN general secretary and  the head of the Security Council in condemnation of the  martyrdom-seeking operation in 'Afula practically proves that  the UN and the Security Council are controlled by U.S. policy.  It took the Security Council three weeks of negotiations and  great doubt to issue a resolution in condemnation of the Zionist  regime in the al-Khalil massacre. But only several hours after  the martyrdom-seeking operations in 'Afula, which was carried  out in revenge for the al-Khalil killing, the Security Council  and the UN general secretary speedily condemned the operations.  This indicates the height of conformity of the UN and the  Security Council to U.S. policies.    Yesterday's martyrdom-seeking operations against the  Zionists  is a legitimate right of the Palestinians because according to  international law, residents of occupied lands have the right to  operate against the occupiers. [end recording]    Dr. Shaqaqi referred to the signed agreement between PLO and  the Zionist regime and said:    [Begin Shaqaqi recording] Such an agreement will not lead to  peace. On the contrary it will further inflame war because this  agreement will legitimize the Zionist occupation and the  Palestinian people will fight this design in whatever form they  can. The continuation of anti-Zionist operations in occupied  Palestine is in fact an indication of people's opposition to  deals with the occupiers. [end recording]</p>

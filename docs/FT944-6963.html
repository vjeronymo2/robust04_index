			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How To Spend It (The Electronic Age): Paging is perfect and small is beautiful - A variety of fads are catching on around the world. FT writers report on what is happening where New Yorkers are no techno-freaks. This is a city, after all, where the latest in retro-fashion dictates that owning a rotary telephone is hip. This low-tech approach to life might explain why the humble pager is so popular among Wall Street's top traders and investment bankers. Admittedly, today's pagers, with their liquid crystal dials that transmit detailed messages and information are no longer quite so humble. Yet, Wall Streeters seem to prefer the pager over the mobile phone because of its lack of inter-activity. A quiet buzz and short message seem less intrusive than a shrill tone and long conversation. The sight of millionaire bankers using pagers still surprises some people, however. As one bemused executive at a top bank said recently: 'You see guys walking in here wearing a Dollars 2,000 suit and a pager clipped to their belt.' You can, of course, still spot the occasional Armani-suited executive with a notebook computer, but the more tuned-in techno-freaks will probably be armed with the new line of personal communicators such as Sony's Magic Link or BellSouth's Simon. These hand-held contraptions are a phone, fax, pager, E-mailer, scheduler, address book, calculator and note-pad all rolled into one small, if slightly bulky, box. The Simon costs around Dollars 600 and the Magic Link Dollars 900, and both are becoming popular in the media and fashion businesses. Gothamites, however, are not immune to the lure of the high-tech gizmo if it allows them to enjoy a little 'down-time' now and then. The SoHo art crowd probably gets a kick out of Brooklyn artist Todd Robbins' Sound Toy, a software program which allows art-lovers to inter-act with his work via their computer screens, creating their own mix of music and images from an electronic canvas. Then there is personal projection television, the latest fad among those who cannot bear to leave the box. PPTV consists of a pair of glasses with built-in headphones. A signal from a TV-tuner belt pack projects an image on to the inside of the glasses. The technology most eagerly awaited in New York is the in-car navigation system, on test in California. It is intended to ensure that drivers never get lost. Once it is in place, all that will be required is a product that translates the cabbie's words into English - and provides automatic change for a Dollars 20 bill.</p>

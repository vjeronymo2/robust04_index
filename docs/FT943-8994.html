			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Loan stock and CGT I understand that the capital gain/loss on index-linked investment trust loan stock is exempt from CGT. I have difficulty in appreciating why a financial instrument can behave like a share index and yet be treated differently for tax purposes when compared with a balanced equity portfolio (where CGT applies). 1. Is this because the capital uplift/fall is neither allowable/taxable in the hands of the trust for corporation tax? (If so, it appears to me that, in the long run, the ordinary shareholder will lose out as equity markets outperform fixed interest investment). 2. Does the interest received come with a 25 or 20 per cent tax credit? 3. Where is the price of the loan stock quoted in the FT? 4. Why don't emerging market trusts issue this type of stock? 5. Why is there so little of this type of stock around? 6. Why should a discount imply a greater risk? After all most investment trusts (and shares) trade without a discount and no one mentions risk (apart from the usual market risk) there. 1. We do not believe that investment trust loan stock is exempt from capital gains tax. If it was, there would certainly be a lot more trusts. 2. The interest received comes with a 20 per cent credit. 3. The price of the loan stock is not quoted in the FT. You will find it only in the stock Exchange official list. 4. Emerging market trusts do not issue this type of stock because it is very difficult to index emerging markets. 5. If these stocks are held to redemption, they are an effective method of indexing both capital and income stocks. They are an interesting investment from this point of view. But they are, in effect, a form of management gearing and only the most efficient managers (those who beat the index continually) can afford to take part. Otherwise, there would be a dilution of the ordinary shares. 6. We would have thought this type of investment carried less risk than ordinary investment trust shares. One ought to mention, nevertheless, that there is a risk element because of their poor marketability. (Answer by Murray Johnstone).

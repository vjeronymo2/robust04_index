			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Preference shares General Accident's proposed fixed-rate preference share issue prompts the thought that, at the level of simple arithmetic, either the company or investors in such paper seem to get a bad deal. When Commercial Union raised Pounds 100m preference capital in May its ordinary shares were yielding 6.2 per cent. The prefs were priced to yield 11.6 per cent gross. On these numbers, they looked like expensive capital for the company and a good deal for investors. But on even modest dividend growth assumptions, prefs start to look a poor equity investment over the longer term and, conversely, cheap capital for companies. Assuming annual dividend growth of 8 per cent, Commercial Union ordinary shares will offer a higher return than the prefs from the tenth year. This does not neccessarily imply that buyers of prefs are extraordinarily gloomy on dividend growth. Instruments which offer a high yield and a known cash flow have value as a match for fixed liabilities such as annuities. The choice for most institutions is not between equities and preference shares, but between preference shares and gilts. Preference shares look like cheap equity for companies because they are not really equity at all. For example, some preference shares are cumulative - missed interest is rolled-up for payment at a later date. For insurers and banks this debate is of little concern. The instruments are recognised as core capital by their regulators. For non-financial companies the question is more serious. If auditors or the market refuse to recognise preference shares as equity, why not raise long-term debt and pay a lower interest rate instead?</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): In a good year the worst blows came from abroad AS THE UK stock market moved into the final trading quarter of 1991, fund managers and analysts agreed that the best of the year was over, and that there would be less to go for in the three months to December 31. In broad terms, this view proved correct, though reality turned out to be more painful than envisaged. Few commentators had anticipated the degree of volatility which left the market down by 4.9 per cent on the FT-SE index, the widely-used benchmark, and yet more than 6 per cent above the low point for the quarter. Few had predicted that the economic recession would prove as deep and enduring as it has. Hardly anyone foresaw the rash of corporate setbacks and, in the case of the Maxwell saga, the scandals that would fall on the City before the end of the year. The hardest blows for the UK market came from developments elsewhere in the financial global community. The sudden fall on Wall Street and in Tokyo in mid-November jolted London, as it did the other European markets. But London held up relatively well, and confidence was not badly shaken. More damaging to UK investment confidence has been the upward movement in European interest rates, led by the Bundesbank just before Christmas when it reacted vigorously to the challenge from France. The Bundesbank's move effectively put an end to hopes of another early cut in UK base rates, which had been sustaining UK equities. Moreover, the blow to interest rate hopes brought domestic politics to the front of the UK investment stage. Interest rate worries, spelled out by rising house repossession rates, suddenly cast a cloud over the re-election prospects of John Major's government, which must face the polls this year, perhaps in May. The Bundesbank's move put sterling on a razor's edge, where it has since remained. The possibility that either UK interest rates might have to be raised to protect the pound, or that sterling might be devalued within the ERM, shook the stock market in December. The question remains on the table, even though devaluation has been firmly rejected by the government. If the fourth quarter had ended before Christmas, the Footsie, crushed by this range of adverse factors, would have been more than 10 per cent off on the period. But matters then took a surprising turn for the better as London decided to put its faith in the authorities in the US and Japan, who had reacted to recessionary pressures by cutting their respective interest rates decisively. The final week of the year saw the London market rise by nearly 150 points on the Footsie, in response to Wall Street's sudden leap to successive peaks on the Dow Average. But, with half the market on Christmas holiday, there was little genuine institutional business to support the swing to confidence. The UK stock market had a good 1991, with the Footsie rising by just over 16 per cent and total return just exceeding that on government bonds. But as the new year dawned, analysts sounded very cautious. Prospects for an early end to the recession remain doubtful, and a question-mark hangs over sterling. Add to this the possibility of a change of government, implying a probable change of attitude towards privatisation and public financing, and it is not hard to see why the analysts are cautious.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) also operated a wood stove change-out loan program, which ran from May 1987 to May 1993. 186 uncertified wood stoves were changed-out with cleaner heating devices during that period, with a majority of the replacements occurring during 1988&hyph;1993. Again, IDEQ did not take credit for these PM&hyph;10 emission reductions. Both the Boise and IDWR wood stove change-out loan programs strengthen the SIP and further assure that these wood smoke sources will not contribute to a future PM&hyph;10 exceedance. Accordingly, EPA proposes limited approval of the wood stove change-out loan program because it strengthens the SIP and enhances PM&hyph;10 air quality protection for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Other Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted, RACM does not require controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and does not require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment and the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13540&hyph;13544). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IDEQ has determined, through its analysis of the nonattainment area, that road dust contributed 15 percent of the PM&hyph;10 concentration on the worst case day in base year 1987. IDEQ did not propose controls for road dust. Rather, the State relies on wood smoke controls to demonstrate timely attainment of the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 standard, concluding that the implementation of additional control measures for road dust would not expedite attainment. However, the State's control strategy assumes the timely adoption and submittal of effective and enforceable mandatory wood smoke curtailment ordinances for the remainder of the nonattainment area. While such mandatory wood smoke curtailment ordinances, in conjunction with the other wood smoke controls described above, may demonstrate attainment of the standard, all of these control measures have not in fact been submitted. Thus, RACM is not met because it has not been demonstrated that the implementation of available control measures could not expedite attainment or that the implementation of such measures is technologically or economically unreasonable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is EPA's view that RACM does not require the implementation of controls for prescribed silvicultural and agricultural burning for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area because the area is not significantly impacted by those activities. Similarly, EPA believes that RACT does not require the implementation of control technology for stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 in the nonattainment area, because the area is primarily characterized by commercial, residential and light industrial uses. There are currently no major stationary sources operating in the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area and large stationary sources do not contribute significantly to the PM&hyph;10 air quality problem in Boise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, EPA is proposing to approve, under the authority of sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Act and for the limited purpose of strengthening the SIP and making such control measures federally enforceable, the control measures that have been submitted to date as part of the PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area. These measures include the voluntary episodic wood burning curtailment program for the entire nonattainment area, the mandatory episodic wood burning curtailment program for the City of Boise, the wood smoke public education/awareness program, the wood stove certification program and the wood stove change-out program. A final limited approval of these existing control measures would not mean that EPA has approved these control measures as satisfying the specific Act requirement for the State to implement RACM (including RACT) in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). Rather, limited approval of these measures by EPA means only that these control requirements become part of the applicable implementation plan and are federally enforceable by EPA (see, e.g., sections 302(q) and 113 of the Act). EPA is concurrently proposing to disapprove the RACM (including RACT) element because the State has not adopted and submitted to EPA all of the mandatory wood smoke control ordinances on which it relies in its SIP submittal. A final disapproval of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP RACM (including RACT) element would start the 18 month clock for the imposition of mandatory sanctions under section 179 of the Act and the two-year clock for the promulgation of a Federal Implementation Plan under section 110(c)(1) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

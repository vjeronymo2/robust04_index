			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo eases rules on shelf registrations THE JAPANESE Ministry of Finance (MoF) is to ease shelf registration rules for domestic bond issuers, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Issuers will be allowed to use credit ratings as a criterion. Companies with ratings of single A or better from two or more designated domestic or overseas credit rating agencies will qualify for shelf registration. Stock market listed companies with an average Y500bn (Dollars 4bn) in shares outstanding for the past three years will be able to make a registration. Under the current rules, companies must have Y500bn in share value at the time of registration. There is no change in the current requirement that unrated companies wishing to make a registration must have a minimum three year's financial disclosure on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Sale of gold fixers shakes up old club WHEN two out of five members of an exclusive club want to quit, questions are inevitable. That is what is happening at the London Gold Fixing whose five members fix the gold price twice daily. Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, said on Friday that it hoped to buy Sharps Pixley, a bullion house that is one of the five gold fixers. A month ago, Republic National Bank of New York, part of the international group controlled by Mr Edmond Safra, the Swiss-based Lebanese banker, revealed it planned to buy Mase Westpac, another member of the fixers' club. It was widely known that Sharps, owned by the Kleinwort Benson merchant banking group, was for sale. Similarly, London dealers were concerned about Mase Westpac, owned by Westpac, Australia's biggest bank which has been restructuring. There is relief that powerful new owners are ready to stand behind these long-established businesses. London boasts that it does more physical gold business than any other financial centre. But that business has slowed to a trickle and, without activity, bullion houses have little chance of making profits. The recent gold price surge was mainly based on options-related activity. Higher prices depressed demand for physical gold in key areas such as the Middle and Far East. The rally took gold from a seven-year low of Dollars 327 a troy ounce in January to Dollars 406.70 on August 2, its highest since the Gulf war in 1991. Another sell-off last week sent the price back to Dollars 364.25 in London on Friday. There are fears that disillusioned New York investors will drive gold down further after today's Labour Day holiday. Such movements matter little to Deutsche Bank. It claims to be one of the three largest traders in South African gold bullion, to have 50 per cent of Germany's gold trading business and an important position in the Australian gold market. If it acquires Sharps, it will add market-making in London where it now only trades precious metals. Also, for what promises to be a relatively small price, Sharps will give Deutsche a ring-dealing membership of the London Metals Exchange, where base metals prices are fixed, and membership of the New York Commodity Exchange.</p>

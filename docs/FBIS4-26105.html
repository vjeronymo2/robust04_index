			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, June 15 (XINHUA) -- More than 300,000  families of farmers and herdsmen in northwest China's Xinjiang  Uygur Autonomous Region have eliminated poverty in the past few  years thanks to scientific progress.    According to statistics from the region, it had 353,700 poor  families comprising more than 1.6 million people by the end of  1985.    To help these people shake off poverty, the region put more  efforts into teaching them agricultural technologies and  techniques rather than simply giving them money as before.    The regional commission of science and technology, the  regional women's federation and the agricultural department of  the region have composed a complete program to aid the poor by  setting up evening schools and training classes and offering  correspondence courses and hands-on teaching.    By now, about 85 percent of the poor farmers and herdsmen  have mastered one or two practical techniques.    The region has also sent thousands of scientists and  technicians to the grassroots level to help the poor people.    As the region suffers from a lack of rain, the regional  government began to build 90 irrigation works in 1986. Now it  has poured 300 million yuan into these projects, among which 46  have been completed.    These projects have increased the reservoir water reserve of  the region by 90 million cubic meters and irrigated more than  80,000 hectares of farmlands and grasslands.</p>

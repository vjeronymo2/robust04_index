			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday met in his  office in Jerusalem with Slovenian President Milan Kucan and  turned down his request to buy weapons from Israel. Rabin  explained to Kucan that Israel will continue to abide by the  international arms embargo on the former Yugoslav republics and  will not sell weapons to Slovenia at this stage.    The Slovenian president told Rabin his country is  experiencing great difficulties due to the war in neighboring  Bosnia, as well as the sanctions and the embargo on the region,  and asked him to enhance security relations between Slovenia and  Israel.    The prime minister told Kucan that Israel understands and  supports the desire of small nations to conduct an independent  life. Israel will be prepared to hold contacts on  security-related issues and examine various proposals for  cooperation with Slovenia, but will under no circumstances  whatsoever violate the sanctions and the embargo, Rabin said.  "Once the embargo and the sanctions are lifted, we can  definitely discuss the strengthening of security relations," the  prime minister promised the visitor. I hope our two countries  will strengthen their relations and will soon be able to sign  cooperation agreements on economic issues, investment  protection, and tourism.    Slovenia has over the last few months been in contact with  Israeli elements to buy antiaircraft systems. [passage omitted]</p>

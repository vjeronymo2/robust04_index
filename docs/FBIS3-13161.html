			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Last week the Jerusalem District police arrested  three East Jerusalem Arabs affiliated with Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement]. The three had planned to stab Jews and  stage a big terror attack in downtown Jerusalem. Our police  affairs correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that the three  admitted they had planned to stab a settler, a policeman, or a  soldier and that they had thrown stones at policemen and  worshipers at the Western Wall. The police investigation  revealed that 24-year old Jamal Basti and his two cohorts, whose  names were banned from publication, had planned to steal an  Israeli car and use it to smuggle arms out of Tulkarm in order  to stage a terror attack in Israel. The Jerusalem Magistrates  Court remanded the three in custody until the end of legal  proceedings.</p>

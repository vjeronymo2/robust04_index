A group of professional people  have banded together in what they are calling the National Unity  Party.    The announcement was made at a press conference called here  Thursday [3 February] by Raffaele D'Ambrosio, a doctor and  secretary of the new movement; Franz Ciminieri, a literature  professor and president of the movement; and Pasquale Ciampa, a  criminal lawyer and a member of the group's political office.  There are a lot of people in the country who are fed up with  the old way of doing politics, the sectarianism and politics  treated as entertainment, and who instead believe that politics  is meant to be the maximum expression of social and economic  requirements, D'Ambrosio said.    National Unity has been created as an alternative to those  that call themselves "progressive" and as a counter to any kind  of separatism, as the real political problem in Italy is the  threat of national disunity, he continued.    The group's platform will rest upon the defense of the  nation  against international specualtion, and the refusal of state  interference within a framework of social justice, D'Ambrosio  went on. On the economic front, National Unity is for the  defense of small- and medium-sized private companies and the  defense of agriculture as an essential element of the economy.    The new party is not nationalistic in a cultural sense, but  only insofar as economic needs must be met, D'Ambrosio explained.    National Unity intends to appeal to all the forces of the  liberal-democratic pole to rediscover politics in terms of  national unity and above all, economic unity, he concluded.</p>

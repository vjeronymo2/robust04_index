			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Further talks held in railway signals dispute Exploratory talks were held yesterday to try to settle the railway signalling dispute and avert a second 24-hour stoppage planned for Wednesday. Railtrack said it had given the RMT rail union a package of proposals designed to settle the pay problem of the signalling staff. Mr David Armstrong, human-resources director, said: 'We await a response from the union now.' Negotiators from RMT and Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible for running the railway infrastructure, have met officials of Acas, the conciliation service. The RMT said later that its meeting with Acas had been 'helpful'. Further talks at Acas can be expected over the next few days. Both sides in the dispute appeared to be in a conciliatory mood yesterday. Mr Armstrong has written to Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, saying that Railtrack 'recognised the need to address the specific difficulty surrounding the pay and conditions of the signalling grades'. He said: 'I know we both accept a restructuring package is necessary. From the outset we have made it clear that the content of this package is for joint development and we have confirmed we would welcome your input in shaping the final arrangements.' But Mr Armstrong also conceded yesterday that there was a large gap between Railtrack and the union over the signalling staff dispute. The company insists it is not prepared to make an interim pay award for past productivity improvements. However, he said talks on future pay and job restructuring would lead to many signalling staff rises of 'not less than 11 per cent'. The company made clear there would be no extra money in its Pounds 85m annual pay budget to fund any negotiated changes, which had to be self-financing.</p>

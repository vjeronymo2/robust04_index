			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Smaller Cos Trust placing Smaller Companies Investment Trust, which is managed by Abtrust Fund Managers, is attempting to raise Pounds 21.25m via a placing with clawback. UBS is placing 3.6m units at 590p each with existing investors able to clawback on the basis of one unit for every five ordinary shares. The units will be converted into ordinary shares and warrants at the undiluted net asset value on June 16. The trust believes the time is right to increase its investments in small companies. It has also declared an unchanged interim dividend of 1.2p per share for the six months to June 30.</p>

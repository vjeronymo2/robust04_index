			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to an FCC recommendation on director reporting requirements, &sect;612.2155 is expanded to require the Standards of Conduct Official to determine whether any reported transaction or activity is, in fact, a conflict of interest and what controls are necessary to ensure that there is no appearance of a conflict of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter noted that for new employee reporting requirements it is unclear whether 1 month refers to the time an employment offer is extended and accepted or 1 month after the employee commences work. The final regulations have been revised to make it clear that a newly hired employee must report the required matters within 30 days after accepting an offer for employment. However, under the final regulations, the institution may establish a reasonable period for such new employees to terminate such transactions, activities, or relationships not to exceed the period provided for existing employees to terminate conduct prohibited under the institution's policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA believes that these changes, together with the greater flexibility in defining exceptions to prohibited lending and borrowing relationships, will enable institutions to fashion standards-of-conduct programs that are more focused on areas in which the potential for conflict is most significant without imposing ineffective, burdensome, and costly reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although enhancing the disclosure of financial information and reporting of conflicts of interest was the purpose of section 514 of the 1992 Act, the experience of the FCA in implementing Uniform Standards of Ethical Conduct for Executive Branch Employees is that training employees to recognize situations that present conflicts of interest is also an effective use of resources to prevent conflicts of interest. The FCA strongly encourages each System institution to conduct effective periodic training programs to ensure that employees are informed of the requirements of the regulations and the institution's policies and are sensitive to circumstances that give the appearance of a conflict of interest. Although the FCA believes that the responsibility to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest rests primarily with the individual director or employee, the institution has a responsibility to develop policies and procedures that monitor compliance with the regulation and avoid the appearance of conflict. Providing guidance and training concerning appropriate and inappropriate behavior is an effective way of achieving that end.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612.2157_Joint Employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC questioned the advisability of having the supervising bank's Standards of Conduct Officer contract with an association in the district to comply with these requirements on behalf of the association and be accountable to the association's board. The FCC stated that it is not clear whether this arrangement is possible since the Standards of Conduct Officer is an officer of the bank as defined in &sect;612.2130(m).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Standards of Conduct Officer does not come within the definition of ``officer'' in &sect;612.2130(m), unless the individual designated to perform the duties of the Standards of Conduct Officer satisfies the definition because of other duties. Therefore, for clarity, the position is referred to in the final regulations as the ``Standards of Conduct Official'' rather than ``Standard of Conduct Officer,'' but in no way is this action intended to diminish the importance of the position. In addition, the final regulations do not require an association to contract with the bank's Standards of Conduct Official. An association may contract with the bank for these services to be performed by an individual whom the bank has designated as the bank's Standards of Conduct Official. The final regulations also include reference to an agricultural credit bank in addition to a Farm Credit Bank to provide for the situation in which an association is supervised by such a bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612.2160_Institution Responsibilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No comments were received on this new section and it is adopted as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612.2165_Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC suggested that the regulations require an institution to provide a reasonable period of time for new directors and new employees to terminate transactions, relationships, and activities that are prohibited by the regulations and the institution's standards-of-conduct policies. The Board agrees with this suggestion and adds a new paragraph (b)(9) requiring a System institution to provide a reasonable period of time for new directors and new employees to terminate transactions, relationships, and activities that are prohibited. The purpose of this revision is to clarify that a new director or employee involved in a prohibited transaction prior to election or hiring is not prohibited from accepting the position. However, such persons are required to terminate any transactions subject to prohibitions within such time period as established by institution policy, beginning with the commencement of official duties, except that such period may not exceed the period established for existing directors and employees to terminate transactions, relationships, or activities prohibited by the institution's policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612.2170_Standards of Conduct Official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to changing ``Officer'' to ``Official,'' as discussed above, the final regulations add a requirement that records be maintained for all determinations made by the Standards of Conduct Official and for resolution of each case reported pursuant to this part. Also, the office within the FCA designated to receive reports under part 612 is changed to the Office of General Counsel, which also receives reports relative to part 617 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

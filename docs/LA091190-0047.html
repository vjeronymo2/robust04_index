			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> OPEN FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> STRANGE SPECIMENS EMERGE FROM 'POOL'  </P> <P> Where do choreographers go when they lack places in which they can afford to  perform? Back to their studios, apparently, where they keep inventing and  honing dances until an opportunity like Dance Pool comes along.  </P> <P> An Open Festival sharing of resources, Dance Pool enabled local artists and  visitors from other California centers, to mount three evenings and three  matinees at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Joan Nicholson, Michelle Berne and Nancy Fassett shared Friday's opening  program. In "Grandma," Nicholson, a migrant actress-writer-dancer, spoke  eloquently of her grandmothers while Stella Matsuda and Sissy Boyd depicted the  crotchety women she found "hard to love."  </P> <P> A second monologue, "Rented Rooms," set her memoirs of a life lived in  temporary quarters against a recorded score of overwhelming John Coltrane jazz;  one struggled to hear the witty commentary. Poised with her notebook at a cafe  table, she talked while Boyd filled the stage with decorative movement.  </P> <P> Combining dance with text is always tricky; Nicholson succeeded because she is  a real poet, able to construct economical language that travels well from the  stage.  </P> <P> Fassett, using the same device of a single personality represented by two  performers, fell into the trap of psychologizing and described what she was  already showing, snapshots of a woman driven by the expectations of others.  Perhaps useful therapeutically, this process flops onstage.  </P> <P> Berne's wordless duets were dramatic; in the first, a man and woman struggled  on a table while Jane Ira Bloom blew her soprano sax into the body of a grand  piano. In the second, a woman-in-white midwifed the emergence of a sea spirit  from a bundle of rags. Berne has studied Butoh; sustained dramatic imagery is  her strength.  </P> <P> Saturday evening's program included familiar works by Heidi Duckler, Donna  Sternberg and Jill Jacobson-Bennett, as well as a few premieres, all short.  </P> <P> Sternberg performed "Who are Your Heroes," a promising solo sandbagged by its  moralizing text but cheered along by Jaston Nishizaki live on harmonica.  Jacobson-Bennett, a good dancer, offered diverting phrases of movement to such  trendy accompaniment as the Gipsy Kings and Paul Simon.  </P> <P> A promised premiere from Duckler did not materialize; in its place was "Your  Knees Are Friends," a 1985 spoof of debutantes by Mary Reid.

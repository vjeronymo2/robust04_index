			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baku, March 9 (TURAN)--Informed sources from the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told TURAN that a meeting of  the heads of the governments of Azerbaijan and Armenia and the  representatives of the Armenian Community in Nagorno-Karabakh is  expected to take place during the second half of March in Moscow.    The meeting will provide a concrete step towards the  adoption  of a peace settlement plan of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.    According to the plan, after a ceasefire and withdrawal of  troops from both front lines, the Armenian troops must free all  occupied territories outside of Upper [Nagorno] Karabakh, except  Lachinskiy district. Following that, direct talks must commence  between Baku and Khankendi (Stepanakert) over the status of  Upper Karabakh.    It has been suggested to Azerbaijan that a treaty be signed  with Upper Karabakh that would give the status of autonomous  republic to the region with Azerbaijan. In addition, the  creation of a demilitarized zone around Upper Karabakh has also  been suggested. This plan also provides for the maintenance of  the Lachin corridor as a means of communication between Armenia  and Upper Karabakh.    The fate of Shushinskiy district of Upper Karabakh and the  question about the Azeri population returning has not come up in  the settlement proposal. These questions are to be discussed at  a later date. It has been conveyed that Moscow is pushing for a  quick implementation of the plan.    TURAN news agency was informed that this plan was discussed  in the meeting between the Deputy of Foreign Affairs of Russia,  Anatoliy Adamishin, and the Speaker of the Azerbaijani  Parliament, Rasul Guliyev. Russia's envoy Vladimir Kazimirov  and Russia's Ambassador to Azerbaijan, Valter Shoniya, also took  part in the meeting.</p>

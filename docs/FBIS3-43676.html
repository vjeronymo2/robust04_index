			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>   [Excerpts] Customs officials in Plymouth Harbor, in  southern England, have detained a cargo ship suspected of  carrying an illegal consignment of weapons destined for Angola.  The ship, called [name indistinct], was registered as carrying  agricultural equipment, but tanks were seen on board. The  British authorities are now checking the ship's documentation to  decide whether a license will be needed. The canvas covers did  not manage to disguise the cargo, including tanks and artillery  weapons believed to have been made in Russia and to be on their  way to Angola. [passage omitted]    The customs authorities at Plymouth Harbor suspected that  war  materiel was intended for Angola. Now the British authorities  must make sure that those weapons are not meant for the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which is  facing a UN arms embargo. The Angolan Government's army is  mainly equipped with war materiel made in the former Soviet  Union and it is no longer under an arms embargo. In any event,  it needs a (?transit) license, which appears not to be among the  documentation. The authorities must establish the source, the  destination, and the use that will eventually be made of the war  materiel. [passage omitted]</p>

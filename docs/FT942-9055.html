			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Russia warns on debt payment The minister in charge of debt negotiations with Russia's sovereign and commercial creditors said yesterday he believed he would conclude deals with the Paris and London Clubs. However, interest repayments on the Dollars 80bn-plus debt could be no more than Dollars 4bn this year. This would be the limit the budget could stand, said Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy premier for the economy, but it represents only a fraction of the total debt service obligations for this year. According to the US investment bank J P Morgan, Russia owes around Dollars 21bn this year, of which Dollars 6.7bn is interest and Dollars 14.6bn is principal. Mr Shokhin said Russia had asked for a delay in meeting the Paris Club in order to work out 'a new draft on repayments' for the present year. The talks are due to begin in Paris on June 2, and Mr Shokhin said 'we would like to solve the issue before the (Group of Seven) Naples summit' in July. His optimism stems from the agreement in March between the Russian government and the International Monetary Fund on the second tranche of a Dollars 3bn loan - a move which has increased international confidence in the government's policies.</p>

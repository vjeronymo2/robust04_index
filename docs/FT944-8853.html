			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Germany's five wise men urge deregulation The German economy is set to grow by 3 per cent in 1995, but any sustained and export-led recovery must be coupled with more deregulation, liberalisation, and a more competitive cost structure, the 'Five Wise Men', an independent panel of experts and economists, warned yesterday. In their annual report, the wise men estimate that pan-German gross domestic product will grow by 3 per cent in 1995, the same as the German government's forecasts but 0.5 per cent more than expected by the Organisation for European Co-operation and Development. The west German economy will grow by 2.5 per cent while in east Germany GDP will grow by 9 per cent. Recovery in the eastern states is coming from a very low base, having fallen by 30 per cent between 1990 and 1992. The main engine for growth remains exports, which according to the wise men will increase by 5.5 per cent next year, a considerable increase from 1993, when exports fell 7 per cent. They suggest that unemployment, which will fall by 30,000 to 2.53m in west Germany and by 60,000 to 1.09m in the east, can only be tackled through reforming the wage and social benefit structure. The wise men propose excluding those with few qualifications from certain wage negotiations in order to reduce companies' social welfare, unemployment and health payments. The savings could encourage employers to create more jobs. Already, some industries are negotiating wage rounds independently of unions to try to retain competitiveness and save jobs. The report coincided with the appointment of a new cabinet by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, all retain their posts. Mr Kohl appointed Ms Claudia Nolte, 28, a former engineer, as minister for family, elderly, women and youth. These were formerly two separate ministries. Ms Nolte, a catholic activist in the former east Germany, succeeds Ms Angela Merkel, another east German, who takes over the environment ministry, while Mr Klaus Topfer moves to construction and housing. Mr Jurgen Ruttgers, 43, heads the newly merged ministries of research and development, and science and education.</p>

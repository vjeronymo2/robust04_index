			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / O&amp;Y to raise CDollars 160m from sale OLYMPIA &amp; York, the property developer owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, is to raise about CDollars 160m (Pounds 78.4m) by selling its controlling interest in Interprovincial Pipe Line, which operates the world's longest network of oil pipelines. Separately, O&amp;Y has redeemed CDollars 240m of a CDollars 500m commercial paper programme, after some investors stopped reinvesting in the issues following its downgrading last month. The Dominion Bond Rating Service cut the rating from R1 middle to R1 low, which is towards the bottom of its investment grade ratings. The downgrading resulted from the weakness of the shares on which the programme is secured - namely Trizec, the property company, Trilon, the financial services holding company, and GW Utilities, a holding company. Over the next two to three months, O&amp;Y will wind up the programme which is used as a source of general funds. O&amp;Y's subsidiary, GW Utilities, said yesterday it was selling its 63.5 per cent stake in Interprovincial to an underwriting group led by ScotiaMcLeod of Toronto for CDollars 26 a share, or CDollars 655m. Most of the net proceeds of CDollars 625m will be used to pay down debt. GW Utilities said it also plans to declare a special dividend of about CDollars 4.50 a share. O&amp;Y owns just over 35m shares in GWU, or 89 per cent. The Interprovincial sale marks the latest in a series of cash-raising measures by O&amp;Y to offset financial strains in its property operations, which include London's Canary Wharf project as well as large holdings in New York and other North American cities. O&amp;Y is a private company and declines to disclose details of its financial situation. It received special dividends of CDollars 175m last month by spinning off much of Interprovincial's US assets into a limited partnership. Interprovincial's shares were trading at CDollars 27.75 before yesterday's announcement. The underwriting group plans to offer the shares bought from GW Utilities to the public on an instalment basis.</p>

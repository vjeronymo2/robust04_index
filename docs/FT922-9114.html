			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: Petrofina sees 'marked drop' PETROFINA, the Belgian oil, gas and petrochemicals group, is likely to suffer a 'marked drop' in profits in the first half of 1992, its chief executive warned yesterday. Mr Francois Cornelis told shareholders that although medium-term forecasts on the company's different activities were good, short-term improvements would depend on an increase in the price of gas in the US, improved refining margins and the absorption of excess capacity in the petrochemicals sector. Speaking before the shareholders' meeting, Mr Cornelis also confirmed that Petrofina, Belgium's largest industrial group, was in talks with Hoechst, the US chemicals company, about buying its high-density polyethylene activities in the US. Hoechst has a capacity of 150,000 tonnes a year in polyethylene. Mr Cornelis refused to expand on the progress of the talks. Petrofina suffered a 25 per cent decline in net consolidated profits last year - to BFr16.3bn (Dollars 478m) from BFr21.7bn. In the first half of 1991 it made BFr10.26bn, marginally up on 1990. Mr Cornelis said the group was well-positioned for the future, and he placed particular emphasis on the likely impact of the BFr29bn investment to improve the efficiency of Petrofina's Antwerp refinery. 'From the middle of 1994, (the investment) ought to put our refinery at the leading edge of our business in terms of added value (oil products) and the environment,' he told shareholders.</p>

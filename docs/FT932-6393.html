			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Clinton economic package wins backing from House PRESIDENT Bill Clinton bounced back yesterday after a week of mishaps and false steps by winning a victory for his economic package in the US House of Representatives. In the end, the result was less of a cliffhanger than predicted; the vote was 219-213, but many of the 36 Democratic defectors delayed casting their votes against the budget bill until they were sure it had passed. Victory in the House does not, however, ensure final success for the budget package. The toughest battle will now come in the Senate, where the Democrats enjoy a much slimmer majority and where rebel Democratic senators have much greater leverage to win concessions from the administration. Senator David Boren, from the oil-producing state of Oklahoma, is leading efforts to eliminate the controversial energy tax from the budget package. His vote alone is enough to hold up the bill in the Senate finance committee. But some congressional staffers believe Mr Clinton might have won enough momentum to carry his budget package, with perhaps some small modifications, through the Senate. Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House, acknowledged in a final plea for Mr Clinton's budget plan that it 'is not comfortable, and it is not universally popular', but said it was necessary to cut the federal government's deficit by Dollars 500bn (Pounds 330bn) over the next five years from the levels it would reach if left unchecked. The bill passed by the House last night incorporates the bulk of the budget proposed by President Bill Clinton, with some significant modifications to the tax components made by the Ways and Means committee. The principal budget measures would raise Dollars 115bn over five years by increasing personal tax rates on the wealthiest individuals; Dollars 16.4bn by lifting the corporate income tax rate to 35 per cent; and eliminate a number of deductions and loopholes.

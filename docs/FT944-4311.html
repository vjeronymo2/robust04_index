			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Gonzalez to 'take hostages' on fish issue Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, has thrown his weight around before at European summits but never has he pushed brinkmanship quite so far as he will today at Essen. When Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, criticised national governments on Wednesday for 'taking hostages' in order to get their own way in the Union, he had Mr Gonzalez in mind. Mr Gonzalez's offence is that he served notice in a letter to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl last week that Madrid would block the EU's enlargement (to incorporate, Austria, Finland and Sweden next month) if Spain, together with Portugal, failed to obtain legal guarantees on its inclusion in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) by January 1 1995. The Spanish premier is now poised to repeat his threat verbally to Mr Kohl in the presence of Mr Delors and of the others meeting in the central Ruhr town. Although the CFP is not on the Essen agenda, 'the issue is very likely to come up,' said Mr Miguel Gil, the Spanish government spokesman. A veteran of a score of European summits, Mr Gonzalez dug his heels in over revenue raising at Maastricht in 1991, over structural funds at Edinburgh a year later and most recently over qualified majority voting during the Greek presidency earlier this year. On this occasion, however, Mr Gonzalez has a powerful legislative back-up to his obstinacy. In October the Spanish parliament voted not to ratify the accession of the three new members unless Spain first obtained guarantees lifting restrictions on its fishing rights in EU waters. 'The prime minister wrote to Chancellor Kohl that the vote had been unanimous and unequivocal and that he (Mr Kohl) should therefore concentrate on the fishing issue,' said Mr Gil. Mr Carlos Westendorp, Madrid's EU secretary of state, was more emphatic: 'Our position is well entrenched. Parliament has closed off any retreats.' Mr Kohl may be irked by the sight of a Spanish deep-sea trawler muddying the clear waters of enlargement. Madrid, however, insists that it is up to the German presidency to break the deadlock at the EU's fishing council, where a series of bitter arguments continue to hold up what the EU had agreed in principle months ago as part of the enlargement package. In a concession allowing Norway to preserve its own fishing grounds, the Twelve agreed in March to bring forward the entry of Spain and Portugal to the CFP from 2003 to 1996 and to settle the terms of their inclusion by the end of this year. The fact that the Norwegian people in a referendum rejected joining the Union does not in Madrid's view, alter a single sentence of the March commitment. But the EU's council of fishing ministers meets on December 19-20 amid strong disagreements over what the CFP will look like with the inclusion of Spain and Portugal and the fear that an 11th-hour consensus may prove impossible. 'This month's council is the last cartridge because we've used up all the others,' said Mr Westendorp. 'It has to receive a clear message from Essen.' Clarity is all too necessary because the fishing council has become confused over the Commission's proposals to use the extension of the CFP to introduce stricter rules on where and how trawlers operate. The new rules are disliked by Spain, which has been subjected to similar restrictions ever since it became Europe's 12th member in 1986, as much as by the rest who view them as intrusive and unworkable. In addition, Ireland and the UK have not abandoned their hopes of keeping Spain's 200-strong fleet of large trawlers out of the 'Western Waters' on the grounds that the 'Irish Box' is a sensitive zone requiring biological protection. The Irish-British objections cause considerable anger in Madrid, where officials say the insatiable Spanish demand for fish has revitalised the industry in the EU. 'Ireland exported 600 tons of fish to Spain in 1985 and last year it exported 6.5bn tons, all of them high price and high quality, ' says Mr Rafael Conde, Madrid's director general of fishing. At issue, in Spain's view, is whether the EU has a genuine common fishing policy or a set of national ones and, specifically, whether the Union is prepared to end the discrimination that it imposes on two of its present members before it accepts any new ones. 'We must have an internal house-cleaning over the fishing business before enlargement,' said Mr Conde.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / UK Gilts: Novel borrowing plan eases pressure THE gilt-edged market has had an agonising summer, worried sick by the two bugbears of sterling weakness and funding pressure. Last week, the government succeeded in dispelling those fears in one fell swoop: it announced that it would borrow the equivalent of Ecu10bn in D-Marks and a range of other foreign currencies, using the funds to support sterling in the foreign exchange market and to fund government spending. The borrowing plan consists of a three-year multi-currency revolving credit facility with a group of international banks and a longer-term multi-currency note issue programme. The Treasury said the government would borrow about DM5bn 'over the next few days', converting the proceeds into sterling, and that a further DM5bn would be drawn in the same way later this month. The second part of the borrowing operation is due to begin next month when the multi-currency note issue programme comes into play. The Treasury's plan sent three important signals to the gilt-edged market: it emphasised the government's commitment to supporting sterling; it removed the threat of an imminent hike in the base rate; it cut the equivalent of about Pounds 7.3bn from the government's gilt funding programme. The recent weakness of sterling against the D-Mark has been a source of considerable worry in the gilt-edged market and had left many investors worried about the possibility of a sterling devaluation. In the days before the Treasury made its borrowing announcement, sterling had come close to scraping its DM2.778 floor in the European exchange rate mechanism. By the end of last week, sterling had strengthened to DM2.80. 'The government has removed all doubts in the minds of the foreign exchange market that sterling will be devalued, at least in the near term . . . As a result, sterling should trade at above DM2.80, at least ahead of the French referendum (on ratification of the Maastricht treaty) and we anticipate a trading range of DM2.80-DM2.85,' says Mr Steven Bell, economic adviser to Deutsche Bank Gilts. Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities adds that the Treasury's borrowing plan demonstrates the strength of the government's resolve to avoid a sterling devaluation, regardless of the outcome of the French referendum. By removing the threat of a devaluation, the government may woo some foreign investors back to the gilt-edged market. Bank of England figures on gilt sales over the last few months show that the bulk of the sales have been to domestic investors. 'We've seen heavy selling of gilts by foreign investors recently - they have no problem believing the UK can manage meeting the convergence criteria implied by the Maastricht treaty but they are terrified of a realignment of currencies in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS,' says one fixed income analyst. By showing the government's determination to support sterling, the borrowing plan also helps to reduce the risk of a base rate rise. The weakness of the lira last Friday meant the Bank of Italy was forced to raise domestic interest rates again, having only recently lowered the discount rate - and clearly Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, does not want to be put in the embarrassing position of raising UK interest rates in order to defend sterling. There is still a risk that UK interest rates may be forced upwards if the French vote against the Maastricht treaty and set off another bout of turbulence in the financial markets. But for the moment at least, the borrowing plan buys time for the government - and if France votes in favour, then the prospects for the gilt market should improve as most economists expect Germany to start lowering interest rates next year. The third way in which the gilt-edged market benefits from the Treasury's novel plan stems from the fact that the financing will be used to fund government spending, significantly reducing the level of funding that the government will need to do in the gilt market. The Ecu10bn is equivalent to about Pounds 7.3bn - or roughly three gilt auctions. According to Mr Shepperd, estimated gross gilt sales for 1992/93 have been reduced from Pounds 37bn to Pounds 29bn as a result: since the Bank of England has already secured about Pounds 19bn of funding, this leaves only Pounds 10bn to be funded in the rest of the financial year. 'At only Pounds 1.4bn a month, this implies a major deceleration in the pace of funding,' says Mr Shepperd. Other economists believe the funding requirement may be even smaller than this. But the important point is that the Bank will be under far less pressure to issue gilts. Over half of the gilt issuance so far this year has been at the long end of the market, and not surprisingly this is the area which has showed the strongest gains on the basis of the lower funding requirement with long-dated gilts jumping up to two points on Thursday after the announcement. Early on Friday morning, the Bank decided to take advantage of the gilt market's buoyant mood to issue four tranches of existing stock amounting to Pounds 750m and covering a range of maturities. One of the tranches - Pounds 150m of the 8.75 per cent gilt due 1997 - was exhausted on the same day. The Bank's action was reminiscent of its behaviour at the time of the general election when it seized the opportunity to sell gilts during the night as soon as it became clear that the Conservatives had won another term in office. Clearly, the Bank will use any favourable opportunity to issue gilts, leading some economists to suggest that even though the government's funding requirement has been reduced by the foreign currency borrowing, the Bank could use the favourable market conditions to bring forward some of the funding for the next financial year.</p>

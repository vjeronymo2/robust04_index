			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Hata in first overseas visit Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday left for Europe on his first official visit abroad after taking office last Monday. Mr Hata will be visiting Italy, France, Germany and Belgium, and is scheduled to meet the heads of government of those countries as well as Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. Discussions between the Japanese prime minister and his European counterparts are likely to centre on furthering bilateral and regional ties. During his meetings with European leaders, including French President Francois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mr Hata is likely to explain Japan's efforts to deregulate its markets in an effort to reduce its massive trade surplus and help boost international economic activity. The European Union has expressed concern about Japan's current account surplus, although discussions on the issue have been overshadowed by recent fraught exchanges regarding trade between the US and Japan. The Japanese prime minister is also expected to confirm Japan's support for UN-led peace efforts in the former Yugoslavia. The trip, which was planned by his predecessor, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, will provide the new Japanese prime minister with an opportunity to get to know his counterparts in Europe before the Group of Seven summit meeting in Naples in July. The Golden Week holiday period, when most of Japan shuts down, has usually been a convenient time for the country's prime ministers to travel abroad.</p>

Main St.  </P> <P> Site manager Richard Senate will lead the tour through the remnants of ancient  Indian civilizations and Chinese habitats from the 1800s.  </P> <P> "We will discuss the cultures that prospered in the area and the reasons why  they eventually died out," Senate said.  </P> <P> Tour participants will get a special look at the foundations, discovered in the  early '70s, that once housed Spanish missionaries.  </P> <P> "Regular visitors to the museum would not otherwise come in contact with these  sites," Senate said.  </P> <P> Sunday is the day to see historic plants at the Olivas Adobe Historical Park,  4200 Olivas Park Drive, Ventura, during a walking tour from 1 to 2 p.m. with  conservationist and botanist Susan Stephenson.  </P> <P> Flowers, vines and cacti, along with the mightiest tree and the smallest  sprout, will have their "roots" traced back to 19th-Century rancho days.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By David Wallen in London and Andy Gilbert] </F>   [Text] Britain has submitted plans to build a military  base in Malaysia to allow troops still to operate in the region  following the withdrawal from Hong Kong.    The base at Mersing on the southeast tip of the Malaysian  peninsula, is being linked to the controversial 243 million  (HK$2.77 billion) aid package for the Pergau Dam power project,  which a former British defense secretary has linked to a 1.3  billion arms deal with the Kuala Lumpur Government.    There is also speculation that the base could become a new  home for the General Communication Headquarters listening post  at Chung Hom Kok near Stanley which is expected to close before  the 1997 handover.    Chung Hom Kok is a key site for Britain's security  establishment and has been used to eavesdrop on electronic  communications throughout the region.    The SAS [Special Air Service], Britain's primary special  forces unit, is based periodically in Hong Kong and is known to  take part in jungle warfare exercises in Brunei and elsewhere in  Southeast Asia.    The current Commander British Forccs in Hong Kong,  Major-General John Foley, is intimately acquainted with both  operations since before taking up his Hong Kong posting he was  the director of the SAS Group and Deputy Chief of Defence  Intelligence.    The SAS also has an antiterrorist role, and vetted security  at Government House and Fanling Lodge before Governor Chris  Patten, a potential target for the IRA, arrived in Hong Kong in  1992.    The British Garrison currently around 8,000 troops and  civilians, is set to decline dramatically this year. The 600  soldiers of the Black Watch regiment leave this year, and  Stanley Fort will be vacant by September. By the end of 1994  the Garrison is expected to be 3,000 strong.    A spokesman for the Garrison said they had no knowledge of  any plans to develop a base in Mersing. "Our only  responsibility in the region is to Hong Kong, Brunei and Nepal,"  he said. "We do use Malaysia as training facility for British  forces but that is in Sabah, at the other end of the country.    "In any ease, we would not expect to be routinely informed  about government-to-government contracts."    John Laing International, the British construction company,  said yesterday it had recently submitted a report with detailed  plans to the Malaysian Government, but would not comment  further. "It would be for the Malaysian Government to tell you  about the report," said a spokesman. The Malaysian High  Commission in Britain refused to comment on the deal but the  Ministry of Defence in London confirmed that the original  specifications were for barracks, infrastructure and electronic  equipment. The specifications are also believed to include  submarine docking facilities, a landing strip, and reinforced  hangars for Hercules transport aircraft.    Mersing has existed as a military base since British rule in  then Malaya but it will be almost entirely rebuilt under the new  plans. As a signatory to the Five Power Defence Agreement with  Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, Britain will be  able to station troops there during joint exercises. Britain  has close defence co-operation with Malaysia and officers are  routinely seconded to Kuala Lumpur.    Mersing was first raised during the deal to finance a 1.3  billion pounds British sale of arms to Malaysia in 1988 which  included the purchase of Hawk fighters and two frigates.    A senior banker involved in arranging the finance of the  deal  was quoted yesterday as saying: "It was on a menu of  transactions drawn up by the Malaysians. They'd selected a site  and they wanted our help. It would be operated by the  Malaysians but would contain our troops when Hong Kong goes."</p>

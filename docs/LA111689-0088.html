			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CENTINELA SUPT. TO RETIRE IN 1993  </P> <P> Centinela Valley Union High School District Supt. McKinley Nash, who was  sharply criticized during the recent school board elections, announced Tuesday  that he will retire when his contract expires in 1993.  </P> <P> Nash, whose four-year contract was renewed in July, said at a school board  meeting that he is "not interested in rolling over the contract, and it has  nothing to do with the new board members."  </P> <P> Nash has been criticized by incoming board members Jacqueline Carrera and Pam  Sturgeon, who said the 56-year-old administrator wields too much power. Both,  however, have stopped short of saying they will seek to replace Nash.  </P> <P> As a result of last week's elections, Carrera and Sturgeon will replace two  longtime Nash supporters, Aleta Collins and Ann Birdsall. Herbert D. Bartelt,  another Nash supporter, will be replaced by Amparo Font, who has voiced no  criticism of Nash.  </P> <P> Collins said she asked Nash to address the matter as a response to rumors that  the new school board was planning to replace him.  </P> <P> Nash, who holds a doctorate in educational administration from the University  of Illinois, Urbana, earns $89,326 a year. His annual salary has been increased  $24,106 since he was hired in 1984.  </P></p>

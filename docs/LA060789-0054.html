			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> West Germany scrapped plans for a costly nuclear power plant, and two firms in  Munich said they will build a solar-cell factory on the site. The decision not  to build the controversial facility at Wackersdorf, in Bavaria, had been  expected, since utilities had backed out of it for cost reasons. Siemens, an  electronics company, and Bayernwerk, a utility firm, said they will invest $50  million in the solar-cell facility, which will employ about 400 people and  produce 20 megawatts of power annually, beginning in the early 1990s.  </P></p>

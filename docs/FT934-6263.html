			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (6): The market moves ahead - The Stock Exchange In a small alley off Istanbul's dockside, young share traders stream through the doors of a tattered building each morning and head for the trading floor, writes Sheila Jones. They work shoulder to shoulder, ducking past each other to buy and sell shares in the 156 companies quoted on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. Conditions are cramped in the market's temporary home. Yet the Istanbul exchange has produced the best performance among the world's emerging markets so far this year. Istanbul's 60-share composite index has scaled new heights this month. It has climbed from 4,000 at the start of the year to around 16,500 today. The Istanbul Stock Exchange, a baby among emerging markets, is growing up. Ten days ago, the Istanbul market joined the 21 exchanges around the world granted 'designated offshore securities market' status by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This means the procedure for companies seeking listings overseas can be simplified, in recognition of the market's own regulatory system. Daily volumes on the exchange have tripled since 1991 to average Dollars 75m this year, with 120m shares changing hands each day. Foreign investors now account for 25 per cent of total volume. Market capitalisation, which had reached just over Dollars 2.2bn by the end of the first-half this year, is now estimated by the Stock Exchange to be close to Dollars 3bn, helped by sales of shares in companies being privatised. Like many emerging markets, the Istanbul exchange has been fuelled by foreign interest in countries enjoying stronger economic growth rates than in the developed economies. And while Turkey is grappling with a huge budget deficit and inflation of around 65 per cent, the corporate sector is producing healthy profits. 'There's no real connection between the macro side and the performance of companies, which are continuing to do well into the third quarter this year,' says one London broker. 'Economic growth is up 12 per cent in the second quarter and up more than 9 per cent year on year. Annual growth will be at least 7-7.5 per cent, so companies are thriving.' The market is due to switch to computerised trading on December 3 with 50 less active shares and the whole market should be screen-based within 12 months. Mr Yaman Toruner, chairman of the Istanbul exchange, believes the switch to an automated trading system will lift volumes substantially. 'We can double volume within a year,' he says. The exchange has been further stimulated this year by legislation introducing substantial tax incentives for mutual funds with 25 per cent of shares in Istanbul-quoted companies. This has attracted more investment from the institutions. 'Since January, the market has moved ahead mainly because of encouragement for institutional investors, and improvements in legal procedures,' says Mr Ozkan Gokdemir, of Carsi Securities in Istanbul. 'Many shares were undervalued with price/earnings ratios of under 10. So the market was cheap.' Mr Korhan Kurdoglu, of Ata Securities, also believes Istanbul shares are undervalued. He adds that company procedures could be further improved to encourage investment in the market. 'Accounting and reporting procedures could be improved, and so could the control of insider trading although there is no system that works 100 per cent.' The market's bull run has continued this month, helped by an easing in interest rate policy and by the government's pledge to press on with privatisation. Brokers say the market is eager for new issues and ready to take whatever the government can get to the market in coming years. While some brokers fear the market has reached the top and might be vulnerable to profit-takers, many believe it is heading yet higher. 'There has been a tremendous run this year with the index rising fourfold,' says Mr Emre Yigit, of Global Securities in Istanbul. 'At these levels the majority of shares are fairly valued and the prospect of a significant run-up in prices is not that bright. But a number of stocks are undervalued and there are still bargains.' Mr Yigit believes the fundamental health of corporate earnings could underpin the market for some time. 'The corporate situation is good - some companies are regularly clocking up earnings growth of 20 per cent,' he says. 'And in the long run, inflation can be brought down - the causes are not insurmountable  .. people will continue to invest in Turkey.' Mr Atilla Yesilada, of Karon Securities, shares a belief in the market's long-term strength, but he is cautious about the market's immediate direction. 'My gut feeling is that it has to go down, though I don't see it going below 12,000. But long-term prospects are tremendous  .. corporate sector earnings are robust and the economy's growth rates are unbelievable.' The exchange is due to move to its new Istinye premises in the business district of Istanbul in April next year. By then, trading should be fully automated and perhaps operating on higher volumes than ever before. Its direction depends in part on the outcome of municipal elections next March, and whether or not Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, can strengthen her position, and push through privatisation and radical restructuring of industry. It is likely the stock market will look to the corporate sector for direction in the meantime. And it will watch the progress of its footballers. On November 4, the Istanbul index jumped 500 points the day after Galatasaray knocked Manchester United out of the European Cup. Like stock markets the world over, the Istanbul exchange enjoys a bit of good news.</p>

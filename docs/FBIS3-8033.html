Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and his Croatian  counterpart Franjo Tudjman will sign the document, following the  accord reached Tuesday [1 March], Silajdzic said from Washington.    The accord calls for a federation of Bosnian Croats and  Moslems, comprising a number of cantons. The cantons would have  equal rights, with a central government in charge of foreign  affairs, defense and trade. Bosnian Serbs are not included in  the deal.    Silajdzic added that experts from the two sides would in the  meantime work on a new constitution, both for Bosnia-Herzegovina  and for a future confederation of the Bosnian and Croatian  republics. These experts would meet in the U.S. embassies in  Vienna, he said. Silajdzic said he would shortly travel to  Moscow.</p>

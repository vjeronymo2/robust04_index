			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: TUC boss scorns jobless schemes MR Norman Willis, TUC general-secretary, yesterday said the new package of measures for the jobless was 'derisory'. But Mrs Gillian Shephard, the Employment Secretary, said the schemes focused on individuals, the long-term unemployed and on new ideas. The package, with a gross cost of Pounds 225m and a net cost of Pounds 125m, contains five main elements. The measures include: Tec challenge. Training and Enterprise Councils will be invited to bid for Pounds 25m to develop and run innovative new ways to tackle unemployment. The new fund will be welcomed by Tecs, which are starved of cash, to pilot radical new ideas. Workstart pilots. Employers will be given a financial incentive of about Pounds 60 a week - part of the benefit of the long-term unemployed person they take on. Four pilots will be run to test the market, two by Tecs and two by the Employment Service. The pilots will concentrate on those unemployed for two and four years respectively. Community Action. This scheme, a re-run of the Voluntary Projects Programme set up in 1982, will offer 60,000 places a year to those unemployed for 12 months and more. The scheme will be run by the Employment Service and will provide part-time work on large-scale projects run by voluntary organisations. The Employment Service will help with job-hunting during the rest of the week. The scheme will offer benefit plus Pounds 10 a week and thus could suffer the same unpopularity as Employment Action, a similar-size scheme, which was run by Tecs and which is to be amalgamated this April with Employment Training. Learning for work. Some Pounds 67m will provide up to 30,000 places for people unemployed for 12 months plus allow them to pursue full-time vocationally related courses. No alteration has been made to the so-called 21-hour rule which limits part-time study for the jobless. Business start-up. This scheme, run by Tecs, offers financial incentives to unemployed people wanting to set up their own businesses. An extra Pounds 21m will be provided for 10,000 people.</p>

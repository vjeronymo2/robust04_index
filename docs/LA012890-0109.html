			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIRROR, MIRROR, LET US SEE WHO IS PUREST OF THE THREE?;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE RACE FOR STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER SETS OFF INFIGHTING WITHIN  CONSUMERIST CIRCLES.  </P> <P> Who's the purest consumer advocate in the land?  </P> <P> That's how Harvey Rosenfield, Voter Revolt chairman, wants to cast the race for  the state's first elected insurance commissioner, judging by a memo he wrote.  Purity concerns may also be behind Bill Press' decision to stop his commentary  on television and radio and begin running full-time for commissioner. Tomorrow  is his last day on the air.  </P> <P> Rosenfield's internal memo to Voter Revolt staffers makes the case for state  Board of Equalization member Conway Collis to be insurance commissioner.  Collis, the memo argues, is the only candidate with a "commitment" to defend  Proposition 103, the successful insurance-reform measure authored by  Rosenfield. Many Voter Revolt staffers are expected to take leaves of absence  to campaign for Collis.  </P> <P> Then the memo moves on to examine the consumer-advocacy credentials of Press  and Walter Zelman, executive director of Common Cause and also candidate for  insurance commissioner. Rosenfield reminds his readers that neither Press nor  Zelman supports the 103 enforcement initiative that Voter Revolt is trying to  qualify for the November ballot.  </P> <P> Press gets a backslap for backing Proposition 103, though he came late to the  cause. He's faulted for lacking experience on insurance issues. He's chastised  for reportedly trying to parlay his support for Proposition 100 into  trial-lawyer backing for his candidacy. The trial lawyers were the chief  proponents of that losing measure. Press' campaign manager, Rick Taylor, calls  the charge "hearsay."  </P> <P> Rosenfield's memo is far more critical of Zelman. The Common Cause director is  accused of attempting to derail Proposition 103 before eventually backing it.  Most galling to Rosenfield is Zelman's claim of responsibility for originally  drafting 103 -- and for calling himself the California equivalent of consumer  icon Ralph Nader.  </P> <P> In response, Zelman has said that Rosenfield has "exaggerated" his previous  statements.  </P> <P> Will California be the site of the 1992 Republican National Convention? The  last time Republicans came West was in 1964, when they nominated Barry  Goldwater for President at the Cow Palace in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Diego and San Francisco are among the California  cities being mailed convention specifications this week. Scouts for the  Republican National Committee have already visited the cities.  </P> <P> Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater has the final say in where  the convention will be held. But helping the state's chances is an emerging  electoral fact. California's electoral votes are no longer available for  Republican taking. George Bush barely carried the state in 1988.  </P> <P> State GOP Chairman Frank Visco favors San Diego because of its mild August  climate. But convention scheduling conflicts could hurt the city's chances.  </P> <P> The California Teachers Assn. appears ready to drop its threat to remain  neutral or oppose Senate Constitutional Amendment 1. The measure, which will be  on the June ballot, would hike the state gas tax and raise the Gann spending  limit. The revenue would be used to upgrade the state's transportation system.  </P> <P> California's most powerful teachers' group has criticized the measure because  it lacks a firm guarantee that the public schools will continue to get their  share of the budget as specified in Proposition 98.  </P> <P> But after closed-door meetings with Mike Frost, Gov. George Deukmejian's chief  of staff, and legislative leaders, the CTA's president, Ed Foglia, said that  "things are moving in the right direction."  </P> <P> But Foglia still wants some solid guarantees, among them that the ballot  argument favoring the constitutional amendment include language that the  schools would not lose gains won in Proposition 98.  </P></p>

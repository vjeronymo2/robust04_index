			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Lancer Boss decision due today The administrative receivers for Lancer Boss are due to announce the buyer of the Bedfordshire-based lift truck producer today amid signs that the battle for control of the company has been won by Hamburg-based Jungheinrich. Jungheinrich and Clark Material Handling, which is part of Terex, the US construction equipment group, are vying for control of the company. A third bid has been made by a South African-based entrepreneur, Mr Roman Simonovitch. Jungheinrich earlier this month bought Steinbock Boss, Lancer's German subsidiary, from the German lawyer handling its receivership, and has been considered the most likely buyer for most of the rest of Lancer Boss. Because of the trading links between Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss, managers and employees at Leighton Buzzard have been strongly in favour of a takeover by the German company. Jungheinrich said earlier this week that it was 'trailing' behind a bid from Clark, which is said to have offered Pounds 15m for Lancer Boss. Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich (GB), also threatened to starve Lancer Boss of vital supplies if its bid was not accepted. Last night, though, there was growing confidence at Lancer Boss that Jungheinrich had won the contest.</p>

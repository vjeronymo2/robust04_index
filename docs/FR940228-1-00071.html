			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) The institution would divide the number determined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> item (4) by the total obtained under item (3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed methodology instructs institutions to subtract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the denominator all students who were enrolled in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program at the end of the award year without regard to any time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frame established for the completion of the program. In view of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fact that the Secretary is addressing the effect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expectation that a student complete a program in a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time on the calculation of completion rates in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forthcoming NPRM concerning the Student Right-to-Know provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 485(a) of the HEA, the Secretary particularly invites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on whether that expectation should also be considered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the calculation under this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Calculation of Placement Rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) An institution would determine the number of students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who, during the award year, received the degree, certificate, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other recognized educational credential awarded for successfully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completing the program. The Secretary believes it would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair or accurate to include in the placement rate calculation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those students who have not yet completed the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The institution would subtract from the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students described in item (1) the number of those students who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were employed by the institution either before or after their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the degree, certificate, or other recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational credential. The Secretary believes that excluding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees of the institution will help curb abuse by those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schools who may hire their own students in order to increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement rates. The Secretary specifically requests comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether there are methods of distinguishing legitimate hiring by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution of its graduates or students from hiring simply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improve the results of a placement rate calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Of the total obtained under item (2), the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would determine the number of students who, within 180 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the day they received their degree, certificate, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized education credential, obtained gainful employment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recognized occupation for which they were trained or in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related comparable recognized occupation and, on the date of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation, are employed or have been employed for at least 13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that only students who have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed within 180 days should be counted in the calculation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes 180 days because it is consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum period of time that a payment on a student's loan under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FFEL loan program may be deferred. These FFEL deferments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include provisions for deferments for periods of unemployment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary considers this time frame to be adequate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable, and provides ample time for an institution to place a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation allows an institution to include in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its placement rate a student who is placed in a recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupation which is comparable and related to the occupation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the student has been trained. For instance, if a student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were trained as an auto mechanic, he could be included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement rate calculation if he were placed as a boat mechanic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if a student completed a retail sales management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, he could not be included in the calculation if he were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed as a counterman at a fast food establishment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be included in the placement rate, a student must have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been employed for at least 13 weeks following graduation from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. The Secretary believes that this requirement will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> help stem abuse by institutions that may arrange to have students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hired for short term jobs in order to boost placement rates. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed 13-week period is consistent with the period of time a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student must be employed to be counted in the calculation of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's placement rate under the procedures delineated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current &sect;668.15(g) for the appeal of an institution's loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation due to an unacceptable cohort default rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, for purposes of this calculation, a student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has up to 180 days after he or she receives his or her degree,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate, or other recognized education credential to obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gainful employment and then must be employed for at least 13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary understands that, because of the total length of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time allowed for obtaining and maintaining employment, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's calculations may not accurately reflect placement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results for programs that are offered in the latter half of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award year. The Secretary specifically requests comments on ways  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to address this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

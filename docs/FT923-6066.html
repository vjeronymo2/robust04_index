			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Yugoslavia - The Search for Peace: Official quits over US policy THE middle-level US State Department official in charge of managing day-to-day policy towards the former Yugoslavia has resigned in protest against what he considers Washington's ineffectual approach. Mr George Kenney also charged in an interview with the Washington Post that the London conference was 'a charade' whose outcome was doomed to fail because of an unwillingness to exert sufficient pressure on Serbia 'to stop its campaign of genocide in Bosnia'. He said many US public statements on Bosnia this year, some of which he had drafted, had consistently deleted accounts of suffering to reduce the risk of public pressure on the administration to intervene more forcefully in the region. US policy, he said, was 'made on the fly,' interspersed with occasional bursts of activity by Mr James Baker, secretary of state until last Sunday, the day Mr Kenney submitted his resignation. Mostly, he added, Mr Baker was 'an invisible ghost' to officials at his level, a common complaint in the State Department. He attributed such positive developments as there were to Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the influential former spokeswoman, who, he said, was gripped by the tragedy in the Balkans. She is 'in reality a bleeding heart liberal who hated scenes of people being blown up'. He said of Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, acting secretary of state and a former ambassador to Belgrade, 'his basic attitude is 'a pox on all their houses'. He feels we should wait until they exhaust themselves and then move in'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Kuvardin report; from the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>   [Text] Our listeners are sure to know that a joint  Russian-Japanese commission on problems of storage and  utilization of liquid radioactive waste -- ZHRO [zhidkiye  radioaktivnyye otkhody] for short -- worked in April in Tokyo,  Vladivostok, and Bolshoy Kamen. Two variants for the utilization  of liquid radioactive waste are being developed, and the final  variant will be chosen in mid-May. Japan undertakes its  financing.    I met this week with Stanislav Nikolayevich Pechugin, chief  engineer of the Murmansk repair and technological enterprise of  the nuclear fleet, who was on a business trip in our city. This  is the talk that we had: [begin recording]    Pechugin: A convention forbidding the dumping of  ZHRO into seas and oceans began to be implemented in 1986-87.  According to this convention, the ice breaking nuclear fleet  must stop its activity completely, or somehow find a solution  for purifying liquid radioactive waste. There are technical  service vessels in the fleet, among them tankers, where the ZHRO  is accumulated. But it cannot be accumulated indefinitely, and  the Murmansk Maritime Steamship Company decided -- our  enterprise was a part of the steamship company at that time --  to deal with this problem itself. In other words, the problem  was being solved at the state level. Money for planning and  building a special water purification system at our enterprise  was allocated. However, we were still at the planning stage at  the time, and the end of construction was still far away. Our  enterprise and the Murmansk Steamship Company invited three  Moscow scientific research institutes to solve the problem. The  problem cannot be called a new one because nuclear power  stations have been working for a long time, and they were  solving the problem of purifying their ZHRO. However, they have  their own specific problems. There was still no solution to the  question of processing the ZHRO of transportation nuclear  reactors. Our enterprise has created an experimental industrial  facility for purifying liquid radioactive waste. At present,  this is a facility of small capacity of about 1,500 cubic meters  a year. It needs further development. We have been purifying  liquid nuclear waste produced at ice breakers and at our  facility since 1988, and today neither the steamship company nor  our facility has any liquid waste, and that being produced is  immediately purified. Therefore, the accumulated waste in the  tankers of the nuclear technological fleet has all been  processed. Today, we need certain means to complete our  facility. However, all our efforts were directed at purifying  radionuclides, and problems of pure chemistry and the tail  process, that is, of solidifying of the still residue [kubovyy  ostatok] were not solved. Today, it is possible to complete it,  but lack of funds prevents us from doing so.    A conference initiated by heads of the Murmansk and  Arkhangelsk Oblast administrations was held in February in  Arkhangelsk. All specialists of transportation nuclear  facilities were invited, and Nuclear Energy Minister Mikhaylov  was present. Among other things, solutions for the ZHRO problem  was discussed. A decision has been adopted that after the  appropriate expertise and presentation of substantiations, the  problem of northern basin ZHRO would be solved at our facility.  In other words, we will become the main organization for  purifying ZHRO of both the civil nuclear fleet and the Navy, and  also of defense [word indistinct] enterprises.    Kuvardin: Stanislav Nikolayevich, do Zvezda plant  specialists know of your enterprise?    Pechugin: I will not speak for them, but the  general designer of the [word indistinct] knows it very well,  since they designed some of our facilities.    Kuvardin: Given time, they could adopt some of  your experience.    Pechugin: Yes, probably. I talked to the Zvezda  plant KIP [monitoring and testing center] on the telephone  before leaving for Vladivostok, and they asked me to accept  their specialists to study our facility. We did not refuse, but  these things are still not done free of charge today. I think  that we will reach an agreement.</p>

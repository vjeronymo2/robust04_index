			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone statement by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic in New </F> York; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Yesterday started with a meeting with Cardinal  O'Connor on sanctions and the humanitarian needs of Yugoslavia.  I would say that the cardinal had carried out a very impressive  analysis of the global character of the sanctions and their  counterproductiveness. We agreed that the sanctions were in fact  the inability of the international community to find a political  solution for certain conflicts, and that sanctions were hitting  the weakest and the most innocent and were, therefore, untenable.    The main event of yesterday was the meeting with UN  Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. These talks concerned the Yugoslav  crisis and its solution, particularly in view of the latest NATO  ultimatum concerning the air strikes against the positions of  the Bosnian Serbs. We agreed that the only just and justifiable  solution is a political one, a political agreement that could be  reached among the three warring sides without much interference  from outside, an agreement that would take into account their  legitimate interests. We also agreed that the agreement on the  deployment of a UN peacekeeping battalion between the warring  sides -- after the withdrawal of the Serb artillery -- is a  sufficient guarantee for a peaceful outcome to the crisis around  Sarajevo -- that is, the demilitarization of Sarajevo -- and  that this in effect removed all reasons for a possible air raid  by NATO against the Serb positions.    I would say that the secretary general had a positive  attitude toward out request for the lifting of the sanctions,  but he stressed that this depends not only on him and his views  but primarily on the Security Council members -- that is, some  of its members, who are still not ready to do so. We said he  preferred a gradual lifting of the sanctions, just as they were  imposed. At our request for the reintegration of Yugoslavia  into the United Nations, I think he reacted positively, but he  also stressed that this also depended on the General Assembly.  He suggested that we start preparing the ground for our return  to the United Nations.    I personally think that he was slightly surprised by the  hard  attitude, which I presented to him, that the Commission for  Sanctions was taking when it came to giving permission connected  to humanitarian aid, the humanitarian needs of the FRY [Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia]. Of course, this relates primarily to  energy suppliers and raw materials for medicine. He promised  that he would intervene with the Commission for Sanctions so as  to make it have a more benevolent attitude, and he personally  asked to be informed about my talks with the chairman of the  Commission for Sanctions.</p>

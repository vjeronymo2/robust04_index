			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD CUTS 2 ADMINISTRATIVE JOBS  </P> <P> The Ventura Unified School District governing board decided Tuesday night to  eliminate two administrative positions.  </P> <P> At its last meeting, due to pressure by parents and students, the board voted  to cut 12 positions but to temporarily hold off cutting three others.  </P> <P> Those were an assistant vice principal at each of the district's two high  schools and the director of pupil personnel services.  </P> <P> In the intervening two weeks, parents recommended reducing the number of days  administrators work and cutting other positions that they consider to be less  crucial to students. Other suggestions included smaller travel, conference and  car allowances.  </P> <P> However, the board voted unanimously to stick to its original plan to eliminate  the vice principal positions, saying the parent suggestions didn't save them  enough money.  </P> <P> The resignation of an unidentified administrator, however, allowed the board to  save the third position Tuesday. The board added new responsibilities to the  job, redefining the position as director of pupil personnel and health  services.  </P> <P> The cuts are being made by the district to balance the $58-million 1990-91  budget. Until the governor signs the final state budget this summer, it is not  known how large a cost-of-living adjustment will be granted to employees.  </P> <P> The district has been estimating an increase of 4.2%, which would amount to a  budget deficit of $1.2 million. If the state allocates less, which, according  to preliminary remarks by the governor's office, seems likely, the district  will have to make deeper cuts. AMELIA CHAFFEE  </P></p>

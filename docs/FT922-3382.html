			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Emu - time to go back to evolutionary approach Obviously Bruges Group supporters cheered the result of the Danish referendum, because they dislike 'Europe', or fixed exchange rates, or supranational bodies, or any combination of these. But it might be worth explaining why I should have given at least two cheers, as someone who favours an eventual European currency, and has no hang-up over a European political authority, so long as its functions are confined to currency, external and internal law and order, and the other classical functions of a limited federal government. Central European countries would have no difficulty in participating in a minimalist federation of this kind. The best account I can give of my attitude is by recalling an occasion when a Euro enthusiast was asked about a remark of Ludwig Erhard, then German chancellor. Having made sure that the Chatham House rules of non-attribution were being observed, the Eurocrat said: 'I was talking about serious politicians.' The Danish referendum is a victory for those of us who are not serious politicians in the bureaucratic, institution-building sense. It would nevertheless be difficult for me to vote 'no' in a UK referendum on Maastricht, partly because of my support for an eventual common currency, and partly because most of the objectionable features in Community practice  -such as interference in working hours and conditions of employment or Commission 'environmental' directives on road and rail projects - are justified by their promoters with reference to the original Treaty of Rome or the small print of the Single European Act. Maastricht, by comparison, is harmless. The prime minister himself defends it in terms of what it omits. It is not worth the career of a single cabinet minister. Having said this, the Danish result is a still a tonic for those of us who are much keener on the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) than economic and monetary union (Emu). For the latter, as put forward from Brussels and Paris, was always accompanied by proposals for vast regional and structural funds to build cathedrals in the desert and a 'social dimension', which was anti-social and job-destroying. These plans have received a setback this week as a direct result of the Danish referendum. With the automatic Maastricht timetable now in trouble, it is clear that the best way to a single European currency is through a strengthening of the ERM. There was, indeed, once a British Treasury which warned that 'administratively imposed changes would inevitably fail to foresee future developments'. On the other hand, the paper argued, the strengthening of the internal market and 'convergence on price and exchange rate stability' would lead to rarer realignments, and smaller fluctuations within the ERM bands. With minimal exchange rate uncertainty, and reduced costs of switching between currencies, all Community currencies would become effectively interchangeable; and the system 'could evolve into one of fixed exchange rates'. I am citing a British government paper entitled An Evolutionary Approach to Economic and Monetary Union, published in November 1989. The paper was conceived in Nigel Lawson's Treasury, but published when John Major had taken over as chancellor. It was thus an orphan. The earlier chancellor had been attracted by Friedrich Hayek's notion of competing currencies, but competing within their ERM bands. John Odling-Smee, who headed the team of officials then in charge, came however to the conclusion that, except during Latin-American type hyperinflation, most people would stick for most transactions to the currency with which they were familiar. His idea was competing monetary policies in which the country with the greatest non-inflationary credibility would have the lowest interest rates. But there was room for the two ideas jostling side by side. What sticks in my memory, however, is the contemptuous way with which the idea in any guise was shrugged off by the continental establishment. Jacques Delors and Karl Otto Pohl, then head of the Bundesbank, joined together in scoffing at choice among currencies. (A short train ride to Geneva or Salzburg would have shown them how this choice was exercised in their own backyards.) A European monetary union, they both averred, had to have a single currency, and that was that. In so doing they both exaggerated the importance of legal tender laws and overlooked the extent to which a new European unit would have to earn its place rather than be imposed by fiat or treaty. The scoffing was also to be heard in the UK. Sir Michael Butler, former British representative in Brussels, dismissed the Treasury paper because it did not involve a new institution and did not require an amendment to the Rome Treaty. His enthusiasm for the hard Ecu (invented not by him but by Paul Richards, an economist and a director of Samuel Montagu) derived mainly from the fact that it did require an institution which Britain could propose at an international conference and thus remain at the top table. I always found, however, that the hard Ecu, treated as a serious economic proposal, involved excessively long claims of hypothetical reasoning to form an easy judgment upon; and it would only be confusing to revive it now. The evolutionary route to monetary union was always the one most likely to work. It may now become the only one. So far the Danish referendum has given only a tiny jolt to the credibility of the ERM. Sterling has lost only a small proportion of the gains which it received after John Major's surprise election victory. The French franc has also fallen by a couple of centimes against the D-Mark. Sterling and franc bonds have similarly suffered a minuscule blow. The big jump has been in Italian bond yields, deservedly so given that Italian participation in Emu would have flown in the face of financial reality. ('In contrast to the British, we wanted the Germans to sort out our financial affairs,' said an Italian friend.) But there is a problem. The French willingness to bear the apparent sacrifices of sticking to an unchanging D-Mark parity was linked to the goal of a political Europe in which France would have a much greater say. Even in the UK early advocates of ERM membership saw it as a way of imposing monetarism by the external backdoor on the Tory 'wets'. A Big Idea is still needed, in default of the Maastricht ambitions, to hold European currencies together. There is such a big idea, but it would require a Gladstone to give it demagogic appeal. It is that of limited government based on the rule of law and sound money, and with as much power as possible being exercised by the people at the grass roots. So long as the idea is called 'subsidiarity' and remains in Eurospeak, it will not be powerful enough to withstand the demagogues and interventionists who still hanker after devaluations.</p>

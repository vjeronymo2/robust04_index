I/M Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the 1977 amendments to the Act, vehicle I/M programs were mandated for certain areas with long standing air quality problems. The 1990 amendments to the Act expanded the role of I/M programs as an attainment strategy and required USEPA to develop different performance standards for ``basic'' and ``enhanced'' I/M programs. The performance standard is the minimum amount of emission reductions a program must achieve, based on a model or benchmark program design. In addition, the amended Act directed USEPA to address requirements for specific design elements and program implementation issues for both basic and enhanced I/M programs. The amended Act requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states containing nonattainment areas to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B) of the Act directed USEPA to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The Act further requires each area required by the Act to have an I/M program to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. Based on these requirements, USEPA promulgated an I/M regulation on November 5, 1992. (57 FR 52950)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 182(c)(3) of the Act, areas designated as serious or worse ozone nonattainment areas with populations of 200,000 or more, in addition to metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more in the northeast ozone transport region, are required to meet USEPA requirements for ``enhanced'' I/M programs. These areas were required to submit a SIP revision to incorporate an enhanced I/M program by November 15, 1992. In Indiana, the State must implement a basic I/M program in the urbanized areas of Clark and Floyd counties; it must implement an enhanced I/M program in the urbanized areas of Lake and Porter counties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The I/M regulation establishes minimum performance standards for basic and enhanced I/M programs as well as requirements for the following: Network type and program evaluation; adequate tools and resources; test frequency and convenience; vehicle coverage; test procedures and standards; test equipment; quality control; waivers and compliance via diagnostic inspection; motorist compliance enforcement; motorist compliance enforcement program oversight; quality assurance; enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors; data collection; data analysis and reporting; inspector training and licensing or certification; public information and consumer protection; improving repair effectiveness; compliance with recall notices; on-road testing; SIP revisions; and implementation deadlines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For enhanced I/M programs, all requirements must be implemented by January 1, 1995 except that areas switching from an existing test-and-repair network to a test-only network may phase in that change between January 1995 and January 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each state required to implement an I/M program was required to submit by November 15, 1992, a SIP revision (here and after referred to as ``I/M committal SIP'') including two elements: (1) A commitment from the Governor or his/her designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all the requirements of the I/M regulation; and, (2) a schedule for adoption of the program, with interim milestones including passage of enabling statutory or other legal authority and adoption of final regulations. Acceptance of I/M committal SIPs in lieu of full SIPs was justified by the fact that states could not have been expected to begin development of an I/M program meeting the requirements of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation was adopted as a final rule, which did not occur until November 5, 1992. A complete SIP revision which contained all of the elements identified in the adoption schedule, including the authorizing legislation and implementing regulations, was to be submitted no later than November 15, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 2, 1992, the State of Indiana submitted a committal SIP to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA. A public hearing on this submittal was held by the State on October 22, 1992, in Gary, Indiana. The submittal included a schedule of implementation and a commitment to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program in the Lake, Porter, Clark, and Floyd County ozone nonattainment areas meeting all the requirements of the I/M regulation and the amended Act by November 15, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

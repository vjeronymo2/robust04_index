			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Review and make appropriate recommendations on the adequacy of the documentation and control procedures currently being used by the NRC for the Agreement State program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Commission regulations do not specifically impose data reporting requirements on Agreement States, the NRC criteria for the approval of new programs and the periodic review of existing State programs, necessitate that a State provide sufficient documentation to the NRC for the evaluation of the program. In addition to the documentation needed for the NRC to evaluate a State program against the NRC approval or review criteria, existing State programs routinely submit a wide variety of information and documentation, including copies of licenses and orders issued by the State, statistical data on licensing and inspection activities, draft and proposed regulations, copies of sealed source and device registrations, licensing guides, and similar documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PAG explored the handling of documents generated and received by NRC in relation to Agreement State and State Liaison program business, e.g., program reviews, followup letters, and other incoming documents and correspondence, as well as the management of information contained in these documents. OSP has informed the PAG that initiatives have begun that will improve the document control procedures used by the Office of State Programs. OSP has also initiated efforts to integrate its document tracking, control, and filing systems with those used throughout NRC. OSP will establish procedures to assure that appropriate documents are placed in the Public Document Room, use NRC Central Files as the official agency file for OSP correspondence, and use NUDOCS and RIDS for document distribution and retrieval. Other program improvements, such as procedures to implement the Integrated Materials Performance Evaluation Program, will result in satisfactory documentation of the important elements of OSP programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, OSP, with support from IRM, will establish an INTERNET-based E-mail and file transfer system for use by NRC and the Agreement States. This system should permit electronic communication between NRC and the Agreement States. The system will also permit the electronic transfer of large documents between regulators. This system began operation in May 1994. As a longer term project, OSP and IRM will establish an Agreement State program electronic information base that will permit faster retrieval and analysis of programmatic information in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSP indicates that these documentation and document control improvements should result in assurance that appropriate OSP documents are available to the public through use of the PDR; provide an administrative resource savings to OSP by using Central Files, RIDS and NUDOCS; and provide a resource savings to OSP and the Agreement States generally through (1) greater use of electronic communication, (2) more easily retrievable correspondence through the use of Central Files and NUDOCS, and (3) electronic retrieval and analysis of electronic data base information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Until performance indicators are in place and provide beneficial regulatory insight, staff should (keeping in mind the importance of a short turnaround time) provide the Commission with the results of each Agreement State program evaluation for which a finding is withheld concerning adequacy or compatibility prior to issuing a letter to the state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is now staff practice to provide the Commission with the results of each Agreement State program evaluation for which a finding of either adequacy or compatibility is withheld.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Propose a method to accelerate the process of issuing letters to States which notify State management of the status of the State program following NRC's formal review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed IMPEP review process is designed to achieve and institutionalize an accelerated procedure for issuing review letters. The goal is to have letters, which contain factual program review findings, issued in one month. The PAG agrees with this approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Determine criteria for placing (or removing) a State program in a status category which would serve to put State officials and the public on notice that their program is failing to fully meet an acceptable norm for public health and safety protection or compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PAG's recommendations in this area have been incorporated into the draft Policy Statement, and can be found at section VIII.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Evaluate and propose internal procedures/guidance on the NRC process to take over when a state agreement is suspended or terminated, in whole or in part, or is temporarily suspended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> You will find the PAG's proposed internal procedures in the following pages. Note that the concept of a Management Review Board (MRB) as described in these procedures, is a pilot initiative to evaluate the effectiveness of indicator information in adequacy and compatibility determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

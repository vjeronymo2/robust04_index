			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / People: Empire building Jean-Baptiste Tefra is replacing Martin Mays-Smith as chairman of Empire Stores, the UK's fifth-largest mail order company. Tefra, 47, became chief executive of the catalogue operations of Empire's French parent La Redoute last year. He was previously managing director of Empire, until Michael Hawker, managing director of Sears' mail order subsidiary Freemans, was recruited earlier this year. Hawker had been filling the role as a part-time consultant, but took over as full-time chief executive last week, at the same time as Tefra took over the chairmanship. Mays-Smith is stepping down to pursue his other business interests, which include chairmanships of the Norwich and Peterborough Building Society and First National Bank. He says that with Michael Hawker's appointment, it was 'clearly more appropriate' for Empire to have a chairman from Redoute. Tefra graduated from the Ecole Centrale de Paris. He joined La Redoute in 1969, moved to a computer leasing company, CFCE, in 1971, and then to French retailer FNAC, before returning to La Redoute in 1984. He became md of Empire in October 1991.</p>

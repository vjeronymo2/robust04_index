			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Chamber opposes Patten The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, which boasts 3,550 corporate members and which has been seen as adopting an increasingly pro-Beijing slant, has told the government it opposes a key plank of the constitutional reform bill of Governor Chris Patten. The bill, the second stage of which was submitted to the Legislative Council on March 9, aims to broaden the franchise by creating nine new 'jumbo' electorates and replacing corporate with individual voting in the functional constituencies, which represent business and professional groups. The chamber, which now holds a seat in LegCo and thus has a vested interest in preserving the status quo, claims the new functional constituencies should retain the essential features - to represent specific sectoral interests with a limited electorate - of the existing 21 functional constituencies.</p>

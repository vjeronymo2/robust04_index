			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VAN NUYS BOY HEADED FOR WHITE HOUSE  </P> <P> President George Bush may have his hands full when he meets Van Nuys resident  Jeffrey Baird on Monday.  </P> <P> Jeffrey wants to pin down the President about his plans now that Secretary of  Defense nominee John Tower has been rejected; he wants to know what Bush really  does all day in the White House, and he wants Bush to create another federal  holiday: a day off for kids.  </P> <P> Jeffrey is 12 years old, although his battle with cystic fibrosis has left him  smaller than his 8-year-old brother. Through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, an  organization that grants wishes to terminally ill children, he and his family  are scheduled to leave for Washington on Saturday and see the President on  Monday.  </P> <P> He also plans to tour the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing -- because "I  like money" -- climb to the top of the Washington Monument and observe Congress  in action.  </P> <P> While Jeffrey is excited about his trip, it is not quite what he wished for. He  wanted to be president.  </P> <P> "I had a few choices, and I couldn't really decide," Jeffrey said Thursday  morning during a send-off celebration at Van Nuys Hospital, where his father  works. "I said, 'Which would be harder to do? Whatever that is would be the  best one.' "  </P> <P> The Washington trip won out over spinning records at radio station KIIS or  meeting his favorite rockers, Guns N' Roses. Was he shooting a little high?  </P> <P> "Yeah, but I'm kind of known for that," Jeffrey said.  </P> <P> Jeffrey was diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis when he was 3 years old, after  suffering nearly constant colds, allergies and breathing problems. It is a  degenerative genetic disease that attacks the digestive system first, then  turns mucous in the lungs "almost to tar," said Mary Schraeger, director of  special events for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Greater Los Angeles chapter.  </P> <P> Jeffrey's only outward sign, besides his small stature, is a nagging cough. But  Schraeger said children suffering from cystic fibrosis lose weight, lose  stamina and eventually succumb to lung infections and diseases such as  emphysema and pneumonia.  </P> <P> "There is no cure, but we are getting very close," she said.  </P> <P> The Make-A-Wish Foundation heard about Jeffrey six months ago through  Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, where he has been a frequent patient. Judy  Lewis, executive director of the foundation's Los Angeles chapter, said the  turnover of administrations in Washington caused some delay in granting the  wish.  </P> <P> Lewis said they were surprised when Jeffrey asked to be president instead of  choosing one of the more common wishes, such as a Nintendo game or a meeting  with a movie star.  </P> <P> Jeffrey's sister, 9-year-old Kimberly, said she would wish for a trip to Disney  World in Florida and "a thousand bucks to spend." Kimberly also has cystic  fibrosis.  </P> <P> But Jeffrey's spunk did not surprise his mother, Doris, who said he became  mature beyond his years by facing things most adults could not handle.  </P> <P> Jeffrey cannot remember staying well long enough to spend a full week in  school. He is a seventh-grader in a special program for sick and handicapped  students at Porter Junior High School in Granada Hills.  </P> <P> He takes up to 52 pills a day, Doris Baird said. He used to end up in the  hospital every year or so, but recently he has been admitted nearly once a  month.  </P> <P> "It's not a terrible, awful place," Jeffrey said of the hospital. "But it's not  my favorite place either."  </P> <P> Jeffrey has seen two of his friends die of the disease and a third become too  sick to play. In fact, his mother said it was after his hospital roommate died  several years ago that he realized the seriousness of his illness.  </P> <P> "He sort of changed then," she said. "He got quieter, more introspective."  </P> <P> When he was younger, Jeffrey wanted to become a fighter pilot when he grew up.  Recently, he told his mother he didn't think he would ever realize that dream.  </P> <P> But neither parents nor child have given up. In fact, when the Make-A-Wish  Foundation contacted them, Doris Baird had misgivings about participating in  something that sounded so final.  </P> <P> "It tends to make a statement I wasn't ready to make," she said. "I'm going to  fight as long as I can, and he'll fight too . . . . I will not accept a  terminal diagnosis until this kid is dead."  </P></p>

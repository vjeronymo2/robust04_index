			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Tadiran returns to profit for first year since 1986 TADIRAN, a leading Israeli electronics company preparing for a Dollars 110m stock offering in New York later this year, yesterday announced a net profit of Dollars 30.2m in 1991, its first profit since 1986 when it lapsed into a prolonged financial crisis. The slump at Tadiran, which hit bottom with a Dollars 145m loss in 1989, was an important factor in the parallel debt crisis at its parent, Koor Industries, the big trade union-affiliated conglomerate which was rescued from collapse by a restructuring and write-off deal with its creditors last year. Tadiran is now reaping the benefit of its expensive restructuring programme, which accounted for most of its losses in the past three years. Although total sales were down from Dollars 800m in 1990 to Dollars 726m last year, the company said the underlying trend was ahead after the disposal of subsidiaries was taken into account. Half of sales were overseas, while products for civilian use accounted for 56 per cent, reflecting the shift away from Tadiran's traditional reliance on the military sector. The workforce was trimmed to 6,710 employees, down from more than 8,000 two years ago. Sales per employee rose to Dollars 106,000, compared with Dollars 96,000 in 1990. Bank debt was down by Dollars 74m to Dollars 171m. Koor intends to capitalise on Tadiran's recovery by floating about one third of its stock on one of the New York markets where a select band of Israeli high-tech stocks have performed strongly recently. Merrill Lynch has been appointed as lead underwriter.</p>

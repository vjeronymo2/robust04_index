			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Arts: All about getting lost - Video WHAT IS the most potent idea in all drama? Murder? Love? Jealousy? Ambition? Revenge? No: being lost. It is what happens to the protagonists in The Odyssey, King Lear and Gulliver's Travels. It is what happens to the villains in The Tempest and to the title hero in ET. It is what happens when surefooted men or women - or aliens - find solid ground pulled from under them and familiar backcloths swapped for terrae incognitae. We should point all this out to you in preparation for this month's videos. The great thing about being lost, as biologist Lorraine Bracco finds in Medicine Man and Anthony Andrews in Lost In Siberia, and the hero of Murnau's vampire classic Nosferatu and the heroines (more metaphysically 'lost') of The Hand Thats Rocks The Cradle and Les Diaboliques, is that you re-examine yourself and your values. 'Where am I?' is a natural prequel to 'Who am I?' Pre-Christmas video releases always do raise these great questions of life and death, just when we are expecting tinselly escapism. (For that see last paragraph). The marketing psychology is as follows. Fifty million Britons will be soon be zonked out beyond resuscitation, gorged on wine, turkey and pud, unless they the video marketeers provide something to think about, wrestle with and stay awake for. So here are Miss Bracco's adventures with Dr Sean Connery, her familiar urban world upheaved as she swings through the jungle with him seeking rare cancer-curing bromeliads. (Verdict: silly, but fun). Here is Anthony Andrews in an Anglo-Soviet cine-Siberia, teeth chattering over the gelid dialogue and matching direction. (Silly, but less fun). And here, more formidably, are the towering Gothic disorientations of that horror classic Nosferatu, released in shrewd synchronicity with the soon-to-engulf-us wave of Dracula films. Has there ever been a better film about being lost? The great German director FW Murnau took the Gothic conventions of his time (1922) and turned them inside-out, upside-down. Instead of the crazed studio sets of German Expressionism, he filmed outdoors and in a real castle. And instead of confronting his young hero adrift in Carpathia with the expected smoothly handsome vampire, he cast the hideously made-up Max Shreck as the neck-biter, a bald bat-eared human rat in funerary frock coat. No wonder the youngster has to readjust his world-view and grow into premature adulthood. Likewise the young ladies of two delectable horror films from different aeons. Annabella Sciorra's young housewife in the recent The Hand That Rocks The Cradle is given a grow-up-fast course by nanny Rebecca Mornay, a friendly blonde who kills and maims. (Horror films about home invasion prove you can be lost in your very own dream domicile). And in the 1954 French classic Les Diaboliques director Henri-Georges Clouzot pushes his actress wife Vera into the screaming lead role of a schoolmistress encouraged to murder by a colleague (Simone Signoret). Deadly stabbings, horrid shadows, corpses rearing from bathwater. But you are right. It is the festive season and before leaving we should earmark some videos for the children. Disney's 1950 animated feature Cinderella, though not quite vintage, has a scene-stealing Fairy Godmother and several show-stopping songs. Alan Parker's The Commitments is a funny, generous-spirited comedy about a Dublin soul band. And Laurel and Hardy are available in a collector's rarity, The March Of The Wooden Soldiers. As for Alastair Sim in Scrooge, he still presides over the best screen version of A Christmas Carol, made in 1951. Mr Sim, all teeth, chuckles and nervous sepulchral chuckles, even makes Scrooge a bit of a charmer. But that is what Christmas is about. Peace and good will to all men, even to those above-mentioned video distributors who have an odd idea of what we should watch at Christmas.</p>

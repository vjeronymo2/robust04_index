			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Two of a kind: Regretful note over unity's path - Former political leaders who advocate closer European integration / Helmut Schmidt Mr Helmut Schmidt, the Social Dem-ocrat chancellor of West Germany from 1974 to 1982, is wealthy, and worried. Wealthy because several best-selling books on German and international politics have brought a considerable income since he left office. His latest, on the travails of unified Germany, has sold about 100,000 copies since spring - but will earn him, he says, less than the originally expected DM1m because recession has damped demand. He is using the funds to help set up a foundation with other well-known Germans to help his country come to terms with reunification - a phenomenon most Germans (he included) thought they would never witness. Worried, because so much in Germany seems to be going awry. He concedes however, that he sometimes exaggerates his fears of German instability. In his book, he describes how earlier this year he dreamt that the Nazis had returned to power, closing the heavyweight newspaper, Die Zeit, of which he is co-publisher. 'Maybe I shouldn't have written this,' admits Mr Schmidt, framed against enyclopaedia-lined shelves in his Hamburg editorial office. 'I put it in to show how deep my concern is. I don't really think the Nazis will take over.' He says the break-up of the blocs of east and west has made not just Germany but all Europe more brittle. The new uncertainties have increased his support for European integration. 'I want Germany to be part of a greater Community. It is in Germany's self-interest to bind itself in.' But they also appear to have made this goal more difficult. The man who, along with French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, launched the European Monetary System in 1979 says last month's forced widening of the system's fluctuation bands has 'decreased the chances' of economic and monetary union by 2000. 'I am rather sceptical. None of the governments - neither London, nor Paris, nor Bonn - understands the importance of monetary union.' Unless the D-Mark is replaced by a single European currency, the German currency will one day be 'overwhelmingly strong'. This would eventually make the Germans the 'masters' of the European Community - a position which, he says, would rebound on Germany by making it vulnerable to 'coalitions' of European states formed to curb its strength. He expounds his well-known complaint that the Bundesbank is blocking progress on Emu. 'Under monetary union, it would become just another affiliate of the European central bank. I can understand why it dislikes this.' He says, however, 'not only the Bundesbank is damaging the process.' He terms a principal cause of last month's upset 'the unwillingness of the French and German governments' to adjust the D-Mark/French franc EMS parity earlier in the spring or summer. A second effect of the uncertainties has been to increase Mr Schmidt's popularity with the German electorate. Support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Social Democratic leadership - for which Mr Schmidt has no great regard - is at a low ebb, increasing his appeal as an elder statesman. Earlier this year, Mr Schmidt says he was 'besieged' with letters from Germans entreating him to stand for the chancellorship. His secretaries sent off replies, pointing out he is 74. The letters have now stopped. Mr Schmidt, in poor health, knows he will not make a come-back. He says a possible outcome of next year's general election will be a grand coalition between Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and the SPD. Despite his health problems, his capacity for work remains formidable. It took him five weeks to write his latest book, during a holiday last winter on the Canary Islands. For relaxation, he organises meetings of former international leaders, who exhibit collective anguish at their successors' failure to solve world problems. One of the biggest headaches is Germany. For all Mr Schmidt's fears of eventual German dominance, his preoccupation at the moment is the lengthy period Germany needs to cope with its challenges. 'In economic terms, unification will in the main be successful within 15 to 20 years. . . coming to terms with our national identity - trying to get the same answer to the question 'What does it mean to be a German?' from a man in Dresden and a man from Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) - will take longer, maybe 40 years.' Although his notorious irascibility seems to have softened, he still dispenses liberal doses of vitriol. Despite his support for monetary union, he calls the Maastricht treaty 'monstrous'. 'There are far too many things in one document. If you just wanted monetary union, you could have done it in 10 or 12 pages.' He says shortcomings in German politics are partly the result of television. 'On the news, politicians provide platitudes, not deep arguments. These are politicians who could also have chosen a career presenting talk-shows.' Relations between Mr Schmidt and his successor are icy: Mr Kohl, he says, 'has avoided asking for my counsel'. While Mr Kohl 'deluded himself' about the realities of unification, Mr Schmidt says he would have raised taxes immediately in 1990 to help finance the unification-induced rise in public spending. What verdict will history offer on Mr Kohl? Mr Schmidt's reply is balanced: 'He's been a successful politician so far. He grasped the chance (of unity) offered by (Mr Mikhail) Gorbachev's domestic situation. After that, he's not been convincing in the economic field. However, it is questionable whether any one else at the top level of political class in either party would have done better.' This seems to express both his low opinion of contemporary German politicians and a winsome disappointment that, when the bell of German unity rang out three years ago, a certain Helmut Schmidt was not 10 years younger. His disappointment seems unlikely to wither with age.</p>

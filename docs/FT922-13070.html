			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Rafsanjani widens margin of victory in Iran elections IRANIAN President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has widened his margin of victory in Friday's parliamentary elections and looks set to dominate Iran's incoming parliament. Half of the votes in Tehran have so far been counted, with Mr Rafsanjani's supporters taking 29 of the 30 leading positions. The extent of the landslide is a surprise, despite vetting before the poll which disqualified several hardline rivals of the president: not even Hojatoleslam Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, figurehead of the hardliners, could guarantee himself a seat. However, even outside parliament, the hardliners could still plague Mr Rafsanjani. 'They can make life more difficult for the government,' said an Iranian official. 'They have a lot of influence on the students.' Hardliners could also still gain more seats in the 270-seat Majlis (parliament). A second round of voting will be held for the more tightly contested seats. Supporters of Mr Rafsanjani are seen as moderates outside Iran. They have forged closer ties with the west and seek to end Iran's economic and political isolation. However they are far from sentimental reformers. A diplomat in Tehran said: 'They are pragmatic. They know they need the west. They need its money and they need its technology.' Inside the country, the rival organisations appeared so similar that many voters could not identify candidates from each side. With more than 2,000 candidates standing, voters seemed to rely on individual familiarity rather than political affiliation. Most of Tehran's voters plumped for a very familiar face: Mr Syed Ali Akbar Hosseini, host of a popular 'agony aunt' television show. The pragmatists had orchestrated their campaign tightly, depending on the frequent exposure of their candidates at religious services and political meetings. They contracted the Post Office to deliver political pamphlets with regular mail. 'They have been working at least for the past year,' said an Iranian official. By contrast, the hardliners mobilised late, holding public meetings only during the week before the elections. More important for the west, Mr Rafsanjani's Iran is emerging from its isolation; the revolution is coming of age. There is a cautious optimism in the air: ordinary Iranians express their opinion openly to strangers; foreign journalists are allowed independence. And while some Iranians still mouth anti-capitalist rhetoric against the west, they happily fork out for the latest Sony or Panasonic from Tehran's high-tech bazaar. Mr Rafsanjani will use his new parliamentary muscle to expand his economic reform, but his government will have little room for manoeuvre. It will be under pressure to increase state salaries in line with rampant inflation while keeping subsidies on basic foods. Petrol rationing, imposed during Iran's eight-year war with Iraq, was lifted in February 1991, but subsidies on chicken and eggs were only partially removed later last year. Mr Rafsanjani has placed great emphasis on cutting Iran's almost total economic dependence on oil exports. Since he came to power in 1989 the percentage of GDP earned from non-oil industries has increased to 8 per cent from 2 per cent. Non-oil exports doubled in two years, reaching a record Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.45bn) in the year to March 1992. But the price of reform has been high. Imports rose to Dollars 17bn last year, only just short of an all-time high, and prices have soared. Iranians are not happy with the government's record on the economy. In protest, many in Tehran refused to vote. At the moment, they are not seriously disaffected; they will give Mr Rafsanjani more time. However after a year, if the economy has not grown and prices have not dropped, the hardliners' fiery talk of independence and revolution may seem much more attractive.</p>

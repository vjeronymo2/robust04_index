			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "AP on LDPR Leader Vladimir </F> Zhirinovskiy's Family Tree"]    [Text] New York -- Civil records attest that until he was  18 years old Vladimir Zhirinovskiy used the name Eydelshteyn, AP  reports. The documents in question were discovered by a  journalist cooperating with AP and CNN TV in four archives in  Alma-Ata [Almaty], the city where the current LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] chairman was born.    The birth records register Zhirinovskiy under the surname  Eydelshteyn. It transpires that his father was called Volf  Isakovich Eydelshteyn. According to Zhirinovskiy, who is  renowned for his anti-Semitism, neither he himself nor his  father were Jews and his father's name was Volf Andreyevich  Zhirinovskiy.    The Alma-Ata archives illustrate that no one with that name  ever lived in Alma-Ata. AP says that the name of the LDPR  leader's father is in actual fact a combination of the names of  the first and second husbands of V. Zhirinovskiy's mother --  Aleksandra Pavlovna. Her first husband -- Andrey Vasilyevich  Zhirinovskiy -- died of tuberculosis in August 1944, 18 months  before the future LDPR leader was born. Her second husband was  Volf Isakovich Eydelshteyn, who married Aleksandr Pavlovna five  months before Vladimir was born.    The documents found in the archives also attest that the  18-year old Zhirinovskiy asked the Alma-Ata City Executive  Committee to change the name Eydelshteyn to his current name and  received permission to do so in June 1964. He signed the  application using his real name, Eydelshteyn.    LDPR Press Secretary Grigoriy Serebrennikov said in Moscow  that these documents "are forgeries." When asked by AP  journalists for a meeting with Zhirinovskiy himself, his press  secretary demanded $5,000 for a half-hour conversation with the  LDPR leader. The question of Zhirinovskiy's nationality, AP  points out, is of political significance and casts doubt on the  LDPR leader's sincerity owing to the latter's constant attacks  on Jews.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: THREATS PROVIDE BELATED ENDING TO EXPOSE ON TRUMP  </P> <P> AFTER THIS column broke the scoop last week that former Trump executive Jack  O'Donnell will bring out a hot and sizzling expose sometime next spring -- a  book to be titled "Trumped! The Decline &amp; Fall of Donald Trump" -- I  received a call from Jack.  </P> <P> He said: "You know, Liz, I had no ending for my book, no denouement. But after  your story appeared in print, Donald sent lawyers here to my office to threaten  me. They said he would accuse me of being a morally lax person and all kinds of  other stuff. They made intimidating threats that weren't even thinly veiled.  </P> <P> "You know, I had not used the book to include all the things I knew about  Donald's use of pressure to get whatever he wants. I had left most of that out  and did not bear down on it. But this was just the last straw. Thank you for  giving me the press that provided an ending to my book."  </P> <P> YOU CAN see Ivana Trump and Marla Maples in People magazine's "Most Intriguing  of 1990" year-end issue, under an amusing headline, "Marla vs. Ivana: How to  Tell Them Apart." Sample "Marla looks 35, is 27. . . . Ivana looks 35, is 41."  </P> <P> Ivana did not hold her annual all-girl Christmas lunch this year. Instead, her  pal Kathy Keaton gave a small private celebration for Ivana and her mother,  Maria, in the marble palace Kathy occupies with hubby Bob Guccione on  Manhattan's East Side. (Kathy is the tycoon publisher-editor of Omni and  Longevity magazines.)  </P> <P> Lunch began with heaps of caviar and went on to bigger and better things. Each  of the privileged few received a terrific flagon of designer Pauline Trigere's  hard-to-get perfume "Liquid Chic." (You have to buy this from Pauline direct.)  </P> <P> Ivana says she was going to Aspen with the children after Christmas because she  made reservations there months ago. At the time, she had no idea Marla also  planned to return. Ivana is not, as reported elsewhere, going to Palm Beach.  </P></p>

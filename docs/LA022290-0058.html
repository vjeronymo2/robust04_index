			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE GROUP SEEKING CHANGE IN CONDO STANDARDS  </P> <P> A group of Lawndale residents has begun to circulate a referendum petition in  an effort to revoke a set of condominium standards adopted by the City Council  last week.  </P> <P> The condominium standards, which were approved Feb. 15 on a 3-2 vote, are  designed to give builders the option of putting condominiums on lots where the  only alternatives are apartments or single-family homes. The standards  eliminate a requirement that condominiums be built only on lots of at least  10,000 square feet. Instead, condominiums must meet requirements for setbacks,  open space and parking.  </P> <P> Mayor Sarann Kruse and Councilwoman Carol Norman voted against the changes,  saying they would increase density and parking problems. They suggested that  voters be allowed to determine what the regulations should be.  </P> <P> Councilman Larry Rudolph, who proposed the new standards, has maintained that  the changes would not increase density because city codes require more open  space and off-street parking for condominiums than for apartments. He also said  the standards would encourage replacement of the city's older apartments with  new condominiums.  </P> <P> Nancy Marthens, one of 25 residents who began collecting signatures last week,  said the group believes the new regulations will greatly affect residents and  that voters should determine whether the standards will benefit or harm  development in the city.  </P> <P> City Clerk Neil Roth said that if the group collects 10% of the 9,751 voters in  Lawndale, the City Council must either revoke the standards or place them on  the ballot.  </P> <P> The group has until March 17 to collect the signatures, he said. Roth said if  he finds that at least 975 of the signatures are valid, the new standards will  be suspended until voters decide the matter.  </P> <P> Roth said the deadline for placing a measure on the April 10 ballot has passed.  The deadline for placing a measure on the ballot for the June 5 runoff  elections is March 9, according to officials at the Los Angeles County  registrar recorder's office. The deadline for getting a measure on the ballot  for the Nov. 6 General Election will be Aug. 10, officials said.  </P></p>

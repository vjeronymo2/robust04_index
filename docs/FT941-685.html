			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Cracks in the oil fields: Opec's split over proposals to cut quotas A fault-line running down the Gulf emerged at the weekend meeting in Geneva of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The divide, which has been created by weak oil prices since the autumn, was exposed when Saudi Arabia refused to go along with a suggestion by Iran and some other members that Opec should cut production to stimulate prices. The split will only encourage questions that have been asked increasingly in recent years about Opec's effectiveness in setting world oil prices. In late London trading yesterday, benchmark Brent crude was selling at Dollars 13.12, down 70 cents on Friday's close. Saudi Arabia, on one side of the divide, is owner of the world's largest oil reserves and Opec's dominant producer, accounting for a third of total output of 24.52m barrels a day. Weak oil prices have given the country cash flow problems and caused it to question how long it can maintain the comprehensive cradle-to-grave welfare system which cossets 12.3m Saudis. But with Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn in liquid reserves, an estimated Dollars 100bn in deposits held overseas by individual Saudis, and a triple-A credit rating, there is little doubt that Saudi Arabia can ride out even an extended period of low oil prices. Saudis may have to tighten their belts a little, the government may have to delay some spending, but there is no real hardship. Riyadh believes the longer-term costs would have been greater, had it agreed to a production cut: Iran, along with Nigeria and some smaller producers, might simply have taken advantage of any subsequent price rise and cheated on their quotas. Saudi Arabia's wealthy colleagues in the Gulf Co-operation Council - including big producers such as Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates - share its cash flow problems. On Saturday, they toed the Saudi line, some more reluctantly than others. The view from the other side of the divide could not be more different. Iran, Saudi Arabia's political adversary in the region, exemplifies the plight of the poor, heavily populated Opec states which have less oil. It is heavily indebted with virtually no access to long-term international credit. Every Dollars 1 fall in the oil price costs Iran about Dollars 1bn in oil revenues a year. In the six months to the beginning of March, during which Opec maintained its present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day, Tehran saw oil revenues fall by Dollars 3.5bn. Its revenue estimates for the year beginning March 21 have been slashed from Dollars 14bn to just over Dollars 10bn. Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, conceded that the decision to roll over the 24.52m ceiling to the end of the year will result in further oil price weakness, at least in the short term. In common with other Opec ministers, he expressed optimism that prices would strengthen in the second half of the year. Opec observers say he needs to be optimistic, given fears by diplomats in Tehran that a dip in annual oil revenues to the Dollars 8bn-Dollars 9bn range could force Tehran to cut back on essential imports, including food, at the risk of political unrest. Iran's predicament is compounded by persistent reports that technical problems in its oil fields are making it hard for it to meet its production quota of 3.6m barrels a day. Bargaining power in the cartel flows from oil production capacity. Any admission that quotas are going unfulfilled will be met by a chorus of demands that any unused portions be doled out to other, more deserving cases. Mr Aghazadeh went to considerable lengths to persuade fellow delegates that Iran's sustainable capacity was 4.2m barrels a day. His sensitivity was such that he invited the press to attend well-flow tests later this year to prove the point. Among the other members, Nigeria proposed cutting production by as much as 6 per cent. Like Iran, Nigeria has economic difficulties. It also has to worry about capacity: western oil companies foresee a decline in Nigeria's output of oil as early as next year, unless the government increases investment in production and exploration this year. Opec observers do not expect the strains which emerged at the weekend to break the cartel. After all, they say, it survived the Iran-Iraq and Gulf wars. An Iraqi representative still attends meetings, even though its oil exports are barred by UN sanctions. Moreover, many of the Opec meeting participants saw low oil prices as transitory. On Saturday officials from Gulf states described how, within nine months, oil prices might move from five-year lows and record steady rises. But the officials accepted that because output has not been cut at a time of year when world oil demand is usually at its lowest point, Opec is in for a rocky few months. They also cited the prospect of stronger, though perhaps still weak, economic recovery in Japan and western Europe as an additional factor pointing to higher prices. The Iranians, however, do not share such a rosy view, and will continue to clamour for a cut. But the officials conceded that only increased cash flows brought about by higher prices could paper over the chasm between Opec haves and have-nots. There is a danger that the disgruntled Iranians or Nigerians may exacerbate that division by cheating on their quotas - trying to increase revenues without an oil price rise. Mr Aghazadeh said he 'was not satisfied with Saudi explanations of why Saudi Arabia couldn't cut' output. Mr Don Etiebet, Nigeria's oil minister, would only say his country would 'do its best' to adhere to its quota. And even though Iran may indeed be having difficulty in meeting the quota, Saudi Arabia knows that oil field operators can achieve big short-term increases in output if they are willing to lose some of the long-term reserves of a field. Even if the Saudi vision is fulfilled and higher prices materialise by year-end, Opec is likely to experience further after-shocks from this weekend's events. They highlighted the fact that Opec's main weapon since quotas were introduced in the early 1980s - supply management - is proving ineffective in a world where technology and the end of the cold war are opening up new sources of oil supply at ever lower costs. Opec's divisions also show that Saudi Arabia's oil policy, thought to be set by King Fahd himself, looks at more than just short-term prices. He also appears anxious to ensure oil's longer-term future as a commodity. With reserves which will last for 100 years or more, Saudi Arabia still sees itself as the guardian of oil's pre-eminent place in the world's energy mix.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURPHY MOVIES  </P> <P> Peter Rainer criticizes Eddie Murphy for giving up those great moments on  "Saturday Night Live" for commercial films that -- according to Rainer -- don't  measure up to Murphy's talents ("Murphy &amp; Pryor's Star Trek," Nov. 24). How  come Rainer doesn't criticize other "Saturday Night" graduates such as Chevy  Chase, who continues to make those innocuous "on the road" movies; or Bill  Murray, who did "Ghostbusters II," a film that didn't make me laugh once; or  Dan Aykroyd, who is to the art of acting what apartheid is to compassion.  </P> <P> Of course it has nothing to do with the fact that all these are white and Eddie  Murphy is black. Of course not!  </P> <P> RICK EDELSTEIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

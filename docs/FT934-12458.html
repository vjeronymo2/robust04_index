			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Secret bid talks value Ferranti at token 1p a share THE CURTAIN began to fall yesterday on one of the most distinguished names in British industry. Ferranti, the deeply troubled UK electronics company, announced it was in talks with an unnamed bidder at a token 1p a share, a bid which would signal the end of independence for the company and value it at a mere Pounds 9.7m. This compares with a peak value of Pounds 845m in early 1989, just before a disastrous Dollars 1.1bn fraud was uncovered at its US subsidiary International Signal and Control (ISC). Founded at the end of the last century by Liverpool-born Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, the company became a flagship of UK technology. It was a pioneer in semiconductors, developing the first European microprocessor in the 1970s. Its computer division, now part of Fujitsu of Japan, developed a scientific computer which was competitive with the largest IBM machines. In the early 1960s it was one of the pioneers of numerical control for machine tools, a field now dominated by Japan, Germany and the US. Speculation on the unnamed bidder focused yesterday on rival defence companies, since two-thirds of Ferranti's business consists of defence work. GEC, which bought large parts of Ferranti's defence business after the ISC fraud, refused to comment. British Aerospace denied any involvement. Thomson of France, which has a joint venture with Ferranti in sonar equipment, was unavailable for comment. Ferranti emphasised that while it was in discussions, there was no certainty of an offer being made. Earlier this month it was obliged by law to call an extraordinary meeting of shareholders, since mounting losses meant its net worth had fallen to less than half its share capital. Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman, told shareholders he would seek to strengthen the balance sheet through equity injection or strategic partnership. The indicated price of 1p per share took the stock market by surprise yesterday. The shares had started the day at 9.25p, and closed at 2.5p in heavy trading. The company's likely loss of independence is chiefly attributable to the fraud at ISC, whose head, Mr James Guerin, received a 15-year jail sentence last year. However, it had also been criticised for poor management and loss of direction. Its chief financial assets now consist of a pension fund surplus of around Pounds 100m and large unrelieved tax losses, mainly attributable to ISC. Lex, Page 18 Declining fortunes, Page 20</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: Asahi Glass suffers sharp fall in profit Asahi Glass, Japan's largest glass maker, suffered a sharp fall in earnings as the economic downturn hit demand for glass, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. It reported a 34.4 per cent fall in parent company pre-tax profits for the year to December to Y26.2bn (Dollars 250m), on a 4.7 per cent decline in sales to Y964.5bn. After-tax profits fell 24.7 per cent to Y15.4bn. Sales of glass and construction materials decreased 8.3 per cent to Y479.4bn. due to sluggish demand for high-performance glass from the construction industry and fabricated glass from the automobile industry. On a consolidated basis, Asahi reported a 55 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y20.1bn on a 6.8 per cent decline in sales to Y1,227.3bn. For the current year Asahi expects the glass market to recover and sees parent pre-tax profits rising 6.6 per cent to Y28bn on a 0.6 per cent sales increase to Y970bn.</p>

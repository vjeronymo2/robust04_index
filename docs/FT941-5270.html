			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Khazakh election balance 'tilted' Parliamentary elections yesterday in Kazakhstan appear heavily weighted to strengthen the powers of Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president, western diplomats and local officials said. Analysts believe the pro-Nazarbayev tilt of the 754-name candidates' list was produced by national and regional government officials who intentionally blocked many prospective candidates and political parties including leaders of independent trade unions, Russian and Kazakh national groups and journalists, from registering for the elections. It was unclear, however, whether the strong-willed Mr Nazarbayev would emerge with the kind of majority he would need to enact his moderately reformist economic programme. The government said the turnout in most regions exceeded the 50 per cent mark needed to validate the elections. Vote counting will be completed on Thursday. The elections for a 177-member parliament, Kazakhstan's first since the Soviet collapse two years ago, seemed certain at least to weaken some of the regional and national bureaucratic forces that have so far resisted him. But they also appeared to inflame relations with the republic's ethnic Russian population and with Moscow because of a perceived government attempt to produce a parliament with more Kazakhs and fewer ethnic Russians. Critics in Kazakhstan say that while Kazakhs outnumber ethnic Russians 43 per cent to 36 per cent, on the list of candidates Kazakhs had a majority of 75 per cent to 18 per cent.</p>

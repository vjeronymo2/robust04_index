			<p>BFN     [Text] The Okinawa Prefectural Assembly's special  committee on issues related to the U.S. bases (with chairman  Moritada Kikumura) met on 28 March. Regarding a court decision  on a lawsuit against Kadena Air Base [KAB] noise pollution,  Prefectural Governor's Office Chief Choko Takayama said: "There  should be no difference in treatment between Okinawa and  mainland Japan when dealing with base issues." Then, he  indicated that after conducting a comparative study on noise  pollution at Yokota Air Base (in Tokyo) and KAB, "requests will  be made to the Japan-U.S. joint committee, the central  government, and the United States" to restrict night flights.    At this meeting, Yoshihide Isa (of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party]) pointed out that an agreement was reached by a  Japan-U.S. joint committee to restrict night flights at the  Yokota and the Atugi bases (in Kanagawa prefecture). He asked  how the prefectural government will deal with the issue, saying:  "It is not acceptable that only Okinawan people have to suffer  from discriminatory treatment." In response, Takayama mentioned  the fact that the court did not acknowledge certain damages  caused by noise pollution and said: "We plan to fully examine  the court's decision and compare results with the decision on  the Yokota suit."    Moreover, Hironori Teruya (of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan) said: "The problem is the fact that regarding the noise  pollution created by the U.S. military bases on Okinawa, we are  at the mercy of the U.S. military's self-imposed regulations.  The prefectural government should take a firm stance and demand  a ban on night flights." Takayama replied: "After the  comparative study, we will ask the Japan-U.S. joint committee,  the central government, and the United States [to impose a ban  on night flights]." In this way, he hinted at the possibility  of taking further steps to deal with the issue.    Regarding the emergency landing of a Cessna airplane which  belongs to the KAB aeroclub, at Blue Beach in Kin-cho on 26  March, Takayama expressed his regret and said: "It is a  violation of the Japan-U.S. Status-of-Forces Agreement (SOFA) to  allow civilians aboard their planes. We will deal with the  issue after thorough investigations."</p>

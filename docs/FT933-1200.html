			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (23): Down-to-earth  -and blunt - Profile, Eddie George / As the new governor of the Bank of England settles into his job, in a sense it is business as usual AS Eddie George settles into his new role as governor of the Bank of England, the winds of change are blowing through Threadneedle Street. A postman's son who grew up near a sewage works in south London, Mr George became governor on July 1, taking over from the patrician-mannered Robin Leigh-Pemberton (now Lord Kingsdown). While his predecessor lives on a country estate in Kent, Mr George inhabits a modest suburban house in Dulwich, south London, with a car showroom and toddlers' club at the end of his road. The new governor's down-to-earth lifestyle fits in with a blunt approach to organising the Bank's operations, particularly in the crucial area of monetary policy. Here the Bank advises the Treasury on day-to-day management of exchange rates and interest rates and has been given a new mandate to publish a quarterly report on how it views inflationary pressures. This idea - put forward by Mr George at the end of last year when he was deputy governor - is designed to improve public confidence in the UK's economic policies after the trauma of last September's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr George has been at the Bank for 31 years and has been the key influence on Threadneedle Street in the past five years. One close observer of the Bank says: 'No one pretended that Robin Leigh-Pemberton had anything very original to say on monetary policy. Eddie was always there at his elbow to help out. The move up to governor is the apotheosis that Eddie has been looking forward to for the past five years and so in this sense it is business as usual.' The view that life at the Bank was not going to change because of Mr George's appointment is backed up by his own remark just before the Thursday in July when he stepped up to the top position. His laconic comment was that it would be 'just like any other Thursday'. It is true, the world hardly fell out of bed when Mr George took over. However, one big fan is south London estate agent Mr Hendrik Bossman, who also runs the Dulwich traders' association. Mr Bossman, who wrote to the new governor when he heard of his promotion and received a 'courteous' reply, says of Mr George: 'I think he's going to be a success. He may be uncharismatic, but that doesn't bother me: he should get on with his job, not worry about appearing on TV shows.' Mr George's promotion cannot be seen in isolation. Senior Bank officials are increasingly willing to take arguments to the outside world, and - as with the inflation report - expose some of its economic thinking to the public. Even though the Bank remains less important than the Treasury in UK economic management, its position has become more powerful partly because of the errors made by the Treasury in misjudging the inflationary burst of the late 1980s, failing to recognise the seriousness of the recession which followed and the poor management of Britain's response to last September's ERM crisis. Helping this shift to greater openness is that, of the top six Bank officials, three are relative outsiders to the institution - the new deputy governor Rupert Pennant-Rea, economics director Mervyn King, international director Andrew Crockett - leaving the three 'insiders' as Mr George, banking director Brian Quinn and monetary guru Tony Coleby. Prior to the recruitment of Mr Pennant-Rea from his job as editor of the Economist and the retirement of the previous governor, the outsider/insider balance was two to four. One person with close knowledge of Bank activities says: 'It may not seem all that significant, but the change has definitely altered the personal chemistry at the Bank. There is a strong sense that the Bank is more willing to engage in a discussion with the outside world.' One of Mr George's preoccupations in the next few months will be to build up stronger links with the business community. There is a plan afoot at the Bank to involve Mr George more than his predecessor with informal discussions with business leaders, possibly through arrangements such as dinners. Since he took over in July, Mr George has already had one dinner with top executives who are members of the Confederation of British Industry's economic affairs committee. This committee is chaired by Sir David Lees who, as well as being chairman of the engineering group GKN, is on the Bank's court or board of non-executive directors. Mr George can also be expected to participate in an initiative under discussion at the Bank looking into the relationships between commercial banks and small businesses.</p>

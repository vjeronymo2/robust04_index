			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Confident Fowler stresses recovery THE END of the recession and the growing strength of the economy forms the background to next month's county council elections, Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, said yesterday. In a confident assessment of the UK's economic prospects, Sir Norman emphasised that the message over the remaining weeks of the campaign would be that Conservative policies were bearing fruit: 'The recession is over. We are recovering.' His words were echoed in Newbury, Berkshire, where the by-election in the once-safe Tory seat will be held on the same day as the local elections. Mr Julian Davidson, the Tory by-election candidate, said a Conservative victory would signal confidence in the government's economic policy. But Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader whose party offers the main challenge to the Tories, used a rally in Newbury last night to urge voters to 'speak for Britain', and force the government to change its approach. Liberal Democrats hope that Mr Ashdown's 'Newbury declaration' will show that they offer more than a protest vote. It lists demands for action by the government, such as investment in skills and education, fair taxation, and a well-resourced health service. 'We can in Newbury set out the positive vision of where Britain needs to go to make this country, again, a successful nation,' Mr Ashdown said. But the other main parties were dismissive of the impact a victory for Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat candidate, would have. Campaigning in support of Mr Steve Billcliffe, the Labour candidate, Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's deputy leader, said that voting Labour was 'a vote for a clear, competent alternative that the government could not shrug off'. The extent of the Liberal Democrat challenge to the Tories, in Newbury and in the county council elections, was underlined by the Tories' attack yesterday in both campaigns on the Liberal Democrat proposal of a local income tax to replace the council tax.</p>

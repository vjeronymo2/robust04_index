			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [EL PAIS] When will you leave  the Foreign Ministry?    [Abreu] I have not decided yet. I am working as if I were  staying until the end of this administration. There are a lot of  things I still want to do and promote. I am not contemplating  retiring from the service, unless there are political reasons.  For the time being we have not made any decision. There is no  job incompatibility.    We have to be careful about the negative influence of  partisan activities on the Foreign Ministry because this  portfolio is an instrument of the country's foreign policies.    [EL PAIS] Many people mention June....    [Abreu] We have no date. That is just speculation which  sometimes spreads in the very special climate of the Foreign  Ministry. We do not have any dates or definitions. They will  appear at the right time. We are working as if we were staying  until 1 March 1995. However, a political decision or internal  definitions by the president of the Republic might interrupt the  mandate any time. He said very clearly: Ministers are the fuses  in the fusebox of the executive branch.    [EL PAIS] Will the issue of the common external tariff  system  be defined in June?    [Abreu] Yes, 30 June is the deadline for a definition.  Technical studies have already defined 80 to 85 percent of the  issue. Some issues like petrochemistry, informatics, and capital  goods are still pending.    We have still to decide the degree of protection Argentina,  Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay will have with respect to third  countries, not based on a model of imports substitution or the  idea of creating a fortress, but to achieve a dynamic insertion  into other integration schemes.    [EL PAIS] This means that the level of common external  tariffs will be low.    [Abreu] Exactly. This is why Uruguay established 20 percent  as the maximum tariff. Who would have thought four, five, or six  years ago that we would be considering such a low tariff level,  particularly when our countries installed an important  protectionist system for their industries and other activities,  that sometimes went over 100 percent.    The process shows that the concepts of economic opening and  integration have become compatible and have replaced previous  integration concepts which promoted the model of import  substitution and contemplated very high tariffs to protect  internal industries.    [EL PAIS] But there has been a move to impose other  obstacles  to integration, even within Mercosur [Common Market of the  South]. For instance the consumer defense code approved in  Brazil or the quality controls or technical norms established by  Argentina. Has this problem been insufficiently resolved, that  is, if we want to prevent the lifting of new shields behind old  economic borders?    [Abreu] That is a good question because it shows that beyond  the political willingness there are interests and situations  oriented to hinder this process of trade liberalization.    Each country and each economy has interest groups defending  its own situation by pressuring to maintain privileges and  protect its interests. They want to maintain their markets and  avoid being exposed to competition where quality and price might  displace them from consumers' preference.    All obstacles are used. Obstacles can be administrative, on  quality, and now--for instance through GATT--on issues like the  environment. "Social dumping," which in some ways is justified,  can also hide protectionist intentions. That is what we  permanently do. We not only denounce these obstacles, we work on  them because the main enemy of integration and the forces used  to liberalize trade is the failure to fulfill deadlines. This  failure is sometimes caused by interests, or political or  circumstantial decisions which sometimes have more power than  obligations. The importation of subsidized products, or dumping,  will hurt those involved in these processes.    [EL PAIS] How did Uruguay take [Brazilian President]  "Itamar's [Franco] Initiative" to create a Latin American free  trade zone by 2010?    [Abreu] Uruguay's integration strategy is clearly defined.  We  understand that all integration mechanisms in Latin America,  including NAFTA, are modular and complementary.    We support the idea of discussing all these integration  processes to prevent them from becoming islands or broadened  import substitution models. We conceive them as complementary  efforts leading to a hemispheric free trade zone.    We do not see the Andean Pact, the Group of Three, NAFTA, or  even the Brazilian proposal as being against or incompatible  with our regional integration scheme, Mercosur.    [EL PAIS] But they are all different....    [Abreu] Yes, they are all different and have different  priorities. We believe--and we have said this more than  once--that Uruguay bets on two things: Political realism and  legal security. Realism tells us that Uruguay must recognize  that there are processes in the world that will not wait for us  to change before becoming effective.    Therefore, we must adapt to those changes, as in the case of  NAFTA, or the new forms of commercial relations currently  materializing in the developed world.    But that realism must be made compatible with legal  security,  which means credibility in the different integration processes  in which we participate.    We should not let ourselves be guided by anxiety or wonder.  We should not join new integration models, leaving aside what we  are creating--projects that are already at an advanced stage.    We will take note of all proposals as long as the other  Mercosur member countries recognize that the priority is to  consolidate this process.    We should finish building our Mercosur free trade zone, with  its known exceptions, and then, in due time, attack the  exceptions.    We must approve a common external tariff system in order to  fulfill our treaty requirements. We must also approve norms on  institutional structures, certificates of origin, and regulation  on the different exceptional regimes that are today listed in  the subregion, such as the free trade zones and the "draw back"  [preceding two words in English] temporary admission mechanisms.  All these should be put together in a package supposing strength  and clarity to fulfill the obligations among the four partners.    We are willing to take note of all other integration  processes, but not to deactivate one process to activate another.    [EL PAIS] But Uruguay--President Lacalle said this  recently--will present a proposal at the next Mercosur  presidential summit to broaden the "4+1" concept [George Bush's  proposal involving the four Mercosur member countries plus the  United States] to "4+3" [Mercosur plus the United States,  Mexico, and Canada]. Here is something new. Is this not a change  in the integrating strategy?    [Abreu] Nothing will change because Uruguay has clearly and  sharply supported NAFTA and has said that the agreement between  Canada, the United States, and Mexico is positive from the point  of view of international trade. It is a module to complement  existing integration schemes.    Within this framework, Uruguay is proposing the famous  reform  of Article 44 of the Latin American Integration Association  (ALADI) to grant legal security to these schemes, so that events  might not replace the law, and the norms regulating our trade  relations might be adapted to this reality. This is the reason  behind the expression realism with legal security.    When we encourage and take note of this integration process  we also say that we are encouraging other complementary  articulations with the United States within the framework of the  "4+1" Treaty, but also within the framework of a "4+3" Treaty so  that NAFTA and Mercosur can negotiate bilaterally within the  "4+1" scheme, which is a negotiating and consultation agenda.    [EL PAIS] Will Uruguay's proposal eliminate the permanent  problem created by Argentina "flirting" with NAFTA?    [Abreu] All that is part of the anticipation, I would say a  political anticipation which does not have an exact legal  foundation or anything concrete from the political viewpoint.  These expressions have a certain projection but no basis. The  important thing here is that the Asuncion Treaty establishes  that relations between Mercosur member countries and other  countries must be jointly undertaken. That is a legal obligation.    [EL PAIS] In other words, that is the only way in....    [Abreu] Of course, there are no other possibilities, except  for natural country to country talks. At the time of definition,  however, our idea is to respect the Asuncion Treaty so that the  four countries can relate to other integration systems through  Mercosur--that is, as a block, as it was done with the United  States through the "4+1."    The definition of a common external tariff system will  follow  this principle of negotiating as a block, which will be our  point of reference and will characterize our relations with  other states.    [EL PAIS] How will you resolve the problem of "social  dumping" within Mercosur? Uruguay is one of the hardest hit by  the problem.    [Abreu] First we must define how to handle the "social  dumping" problem. There is a proposal that will be discussed  within the framework of the GATT talks in Morocco. The proposal  was presented by developed countries which are only now  analyzing the fact that low salary levels will influence costs  and product prices, which will give underdeveloped countries an  advantage over countries with higher salary levels.    We cannot understand this as a protectionist measure. We  must  seek to level different salary levels so that salaries and  competitiveness increase at the same time.    We cannot increase our competitiveness by depressing  salaries, because that will affect workers' well-being.    [EL PAIS] The trend of every process of regional integration  has never been to bet on a reduction ....    [Abreu] Precisely. This situation stems from the fact that  there are heavily populated countries with abundant labor and  relatively low wages. Obviously, this has a bearing on prices.    We have to take extreme care, however, to defend our wage  levels so that once we enter into competition with others, wages  will go up rather than down.    Uruguay plays a very important role on account of its  location and social structure. We have partners like Brazil,  where labor is cheaper and less qualified. It is also true that  each country has to put its comparative advantages to good use  in order to achieve a dynamic insertion in foreign markets. As  we have better qualified labor, we must try to specialize in  things that will take advantage of market niches, in which  quality will be our main advantage.    These issues have to do with countries' strategies, but they  should be considered from the viewpoint of social awareness in  the true sense of the word, instead of using them for commercial  purposes disguised as protection mechanisms.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Japanese truck maker confirms Daf talks HINO MOTORS, Japan's leading truck maker, confirmed last night that it has held partnership talks with Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker, but said the negotiations were part of broad-ranging contacts with truck makers in Europe and the US. The Japanese company, bruised by the domestic economic slowdown, said it was negotiating 'sales and production' joint ventures with international truck makers, but insisted that 'nothing has been decided'. Hino, part of the Toyota Motor group, has been encouraged to broaden its international base by falling capital spending at home, which resulted in a 2.4 per cent decline in truck sales, by volume, for the first quarter beginning in April. Domestic difficulties led Hino, which exports about 15 per cent of production, to forecast a 57 per cent fall to Y3bn (Dollars 24m) in pre-tax profit for the first half to end-September. The company said another reason for the fall, and a reason for it to expand overseas production, was a stronger-than-expected yen this year. Japan's truck industry reported sharply increased sales during the late 1980s, when construction orders surged and companies were generally expanding capital investment.</p>

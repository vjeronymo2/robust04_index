In a statement distributed through the "Amal" group the  official spokesman for the movement urged "His Majesty to choose  the means that enable us to convey our view, its details, and  the (case) file to His Majesty in order to acquaint him with the  scale of our calamity, or -- alternatively -- this can be done  via an Arab state or through an open letter."    The movement reiterated its denial of any involvement in the  assassination of the Jordanian diplomat, Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, in  Beirut on 29 January. It pointed out that it was surprised that  "the al-Ma'ayitah case was thrown at our movement."</p>

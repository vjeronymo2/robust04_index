			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> PUBLISHER OF CONTROVERSIAL BOOKS GRANTS FULL REFUND  </P> <P> The furor over a controversial series of elementary school textbooks appears to  have ended for the East Whittier City School District. Holt, Rinehart and  Winston has paid $172,694.42 to the district as a refund for the company's  Impressions series.  </P> <P> The texts, designed for students in kindergarten through sixth grade, caused an  uproar among some parents because they believed the books were too graphic and  depicted anti-social or anti-religious values.  </P> <P> "When parents have input, you should listen to it," Supt. Dorothy Fagan said,  "but the basis for returning the books is that we didn't get what we ordered."  She said the texts were significantly different from those the district had  previewed and ordered last spring.  </P> <P> "Until they were used, nobody found out," she said. Fagan praised the  publishing company for agreeing to a full refund.  </P> <P> Schools in the district recently submitted their preferences for replacement  texts, although the results have not yet been tabulated. In the interim,  instructors have taught from a variety of readers and collections of literature  for children.  </P></p>

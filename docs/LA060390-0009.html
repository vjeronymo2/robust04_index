			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: PLACES;  </P> <P> ROSE BOWL GLIDING  </P> <P> WHEN THE WINDS get going, they blow some eagerly anticipated thermals into  Pasadena, which in turn lure glider pilots out of the hills and onto the grassy  area between the Rose Bowl and Brookside Park. Weather conditions in June make  it a big month for radio-controlled craft.  </P> <P> And glider flying can be as much fun for spectators as it is for participants;  there are often numerous planes in flight simultaneously, creating a colorful,  impromptu air show.  </P> <P> Keeping one of these radio-controlled gliders (many of which have 6-to-8-foot  wingspans) aloft and landing it safely is no small accomplishment. Generally  made of spruce, balsa or fiberglass, gliders range in weight from 12 ounces to  2 pounds. Their light weight makes them highly maneuverable, as well as  vulnerable to every air current. "You just have to wait for the lifts and pay  attention," says Bart Hibbs, a Rose Bowl flyer who began building his own  planes from scratch 20 years ago and now as an aerospace engineer designs  aircraft at AeroVironment, the company that developed the new back-pack plane  for the Marine Corps (the 9-pound motorized craft has a 9-foot wingspan and can  scout a 5-mile area via video camera).  </P> <P> For those who need some help getting started, glider kits are available  (selling from $35 to $200) at most hobby centers (radios are sold separately).  A.R.F. (Almost Ready to Fly) gliders, which require just a few finishing  touches, can be purchased for about $150 at the Hobby Place in West L.A.  (213-836-2000). Flying at the Rose Bowl location is limited to days when there  are no events scheduled at the stadium, so check timetables prior to takeoff.  JANEY MILSTEAD  </P></p>

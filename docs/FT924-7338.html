			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Former Mowlem men arrested in California TWO FRENCHMEN wanted in France for allegedly embezzling Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.2m) from a subsidiary of John Mowlem, the construction group, have been arrested in California by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mowlem said last night that it had made a provision of more than Pounds 4m in its 1991 accounts to cover any loss. 'We cannot say any more about the matter because the case is sub-judice,' the company added. Mr Jean-Michel Garoscio, 31, and Mr Erwan Anger, 28, were arrested in Monterey, where they were running a restaurant, according to the FBI. The two men are being held without bail to await extradition proceedings to France. They are sought by a court in Lyon on charges of misappropriating corporate assets and forgery. They were previously employed by HSS Location, a subsidiary of HSS Hire Service Corporation, which is owned by Mowlem and rents tools to the building trade. It is alleged that Mr Garoscio and Mr Anger used a variety of schemes to embezzle money from the company between 1988 and March 1992.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M.A. Deviah: "Driving Away the Multinational </F> `Devils'"]    [Text] Bangalore -- He describes himself as a Gandhian  terrorist; his adversaries call him a mad man. The Karnataka  Government does not know what to do about him and simply ignores  him. But, for thousands of anti-Dunkel Draft (now anti-GATT  activists, he is a hero. Instead of restricting himself to  merely holding seminars, carrying banners and shouting slogans,  Karnataka Farmers' Association President M.D. Nanjunda Swamy has  achieved the seemingly impossible: his supporters twice attacked  and destroyed facilities belonging to the multinational seed  company, Cargill Seeds India Limited. And even though his hand  has been clearly indicated in the attacks, the authorities have  neither the courage nor the inclination to take action against  him.    Now with the General Agreement on Trades and Tariffs  becoming  reality, Nanjunda Swamy intends taking his anti-GATT show on the  road. Starting this month, he will deliver lectures at various  universities urging the youth to stay away from products  manufactured by multinational corporations (MNCs). This lecture  tour will begin at Hyderabad and will continue with Banares,  Aligarh and Ahmedabad. On January 1, he will hold farmers'  meetings at Dharmapuri to spread the message about how GATT is  going to destroy them and their way of life. Tamil Nadu is a  sore point with Nanjunda Swamy because he claims the Jayalalitha  Government has used repressive measures to prevent anti-Dunkel  Draft meetings in the past.    "As an old student of socialism, I look at MNCs as the last  vestiges of capitalism. I call them last vestiges because they  will be wiped out by people's movements," he says. "People in  all countries are unhappy with GATT. That is why I believe there  will be a global people's movement. Before the treaty, the  people had a chance to elect their own governments which took  care of their interests. After GATT, the role of Governments  will be reduced in favour of the free trade regime, in other  words the MNCs."    What about any more gung-ho attacks like the ones on Cargill  Seeds facilities at Bangalore and Bellary, in North Karnataka?  "Definitely," he says, adding that his next target will be the  American W.R. Grace and Company, which has set up a neem  extraction plant at Tumkur, near Bangalore. According to him the  farmers have stayed away from W.R. Grace till now as the company  used hexane, an explosive, in its extraction process. However,  they are working on how to get around this. According to  Nanjunda Swamy, W.R. Grace is attempting to patent the  pesticidal properties of neem, an accusation which has been  denied several times by the company.    Unfazed: Denials have never fazed him; he simply  ignores them and prepares a new line of attack. Nanjunda Swamy  is a shrewd politician, using a combination of truths and  half-truths to whip up passions. For instance, his first attack  against Cargill Seeds centered around the accusation that seed  patenting, as laid out in the Dunkel Draft, would mean that  farmers would not have the right to re-plant the seeds they have  harvested. When this was proved false, he came up with another  accusation -- that Cargill seed producers had destroyed 500  acres of sunflower fields in Dharwad district of Karnataka. This  story too proved to be false. On another occasion he accused  Cargill of paying its seed producing farmers only Rs 3 per kilo  of sunflower seeds acquired by them and selling it at Rs 85 per  kilo. In reality, Cargill pays Rs 45 per kilo.    Cargill now conducts its operations under heavy police  protection. But this will not deter Nanjunda Swamy.    He says. "What are a few cozen policemen against us? I could  bring 6 lakh farmers to Bangalore, you think I can't take care  of Cargill?" Along with W.R. Grace, Nanjundaswamy, intends to  attack other multinational seed companies operating in Karnataka  -- Pioneer Seeds, Continental Seeds and Sandoz India Limited. "I  want to drive them out," he says. On a larger scale, the  Association will link up with other regional groups to fight  multinationals like Pepsi, Coke, MacDonald's, Burger King and  Kentucky Fried Chicken. The Association is also opposing  Madonna's tour of India next year.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / British Gas to shed 20,000 jobs by 1997 British Gas's restructuring plans will lead to the loss of 20,000 jobs - almost a third of its workforce - in the next three years, the company said yesterday. The company confirmed the figure after Unison, the public services union, warned that the restructuring plans could lead to the loss of 40,000 jobs. Mr Dave Stirzaker, the senior Unison official for the gas industry, said the other job losses might be expected in support industries - such as appliance-makers, contractors and distributors - if British Gas continued to cut its UK investment programme. He said most of the British Gas job cuts were expected to come from 12 regional offices which the union believes the company plans to close in its move to create a divisional structure for the business. British Gas said yesterday it was not yet in a position to announce how the restructuring would go ahead. The Society of British Gas Industries said yesterday that support industries had already seen a severe shake-out in jobs. Mr John Cull, last year's society president, said 40,000 jobs had been lost in the manufacturing and contracting sectors since July 1992 and more might be expected to go without new British Gas investment. Mr Cull said Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommendations on the splitting of British Gas were delaying investment in the industry. Unison, which is campaigning against the MMC proposals, claimed that British Gas investment abroad was taking funds out of the UK economy. It said: 'It would be insane for the government knowingly to put at risk 40,000 jobs by breaking up a company which is profitable, safe and efficient and which invests more than Pounds 750m a year in the economy.' The union is meeting British Gas on Monday and will consult its members in the new year to try to head off mass redundancies. UES Steels, the European Union's largest producer of engineering steels, is to cut a further 400 jobs. The division of Rotherham-based UES Holdings has already cut 500 jobs this year, reducing the workforce to about 4,200.</p>

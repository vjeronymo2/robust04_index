			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Cretan shipping line orders two ferries Minoan Lines, Greece's largest passenger shipping operator, has placed a Dr38bn (Dollars 152m) order for two ferries with Fosen MEK Verksteer, the Norwegian shipbuilders, Kerin Hope reports from Athens. Minoan, based on Crete, wants more capacity for larger vehicles on its main route between Greece and Italy and to cut the journey time to less than 24 hours. The Adriatic crossing has become the main link with western Europe for both Greek exporters and tourists travelling by road since the war in Bosnia blocked the overland route through the former Yugoslavia. Minoan Lines said the 31,000-ton ferries would carry 200 camper vans and 150 trucks each, together with 1,500 passengers. The first will be delivered in spring 1995. The company operates 10 ferries in the Adriatic and eastern Mediterranean and carries over 1m passengers a year. NEWS IN BRIEF</p>

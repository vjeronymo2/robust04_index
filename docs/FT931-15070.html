			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Czech price stance The Czech government says it does not intend to reintroduce price controls despite a public outcry against sharp increases on basic foods following the introduction of value-added tax on January 1, writes Patrick Blum in Prague. However, it plans a rise of 13.5 per cent in the minimum wage and an increase of 20 per cent in housing subsidies for the needy. Mr Ivan Kocarnik, the finance minister, said it was too early to assess the full impact of VAT on prices, and that there were signs prices were already coming down after the initial rises.</p>

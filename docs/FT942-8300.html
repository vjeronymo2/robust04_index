			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (16): Floated on the exchange / Profile of Strintzis Lines Strintzis Lines used to be a thoroughly traditional Greek ferry company. Controlled by the Strintzis family from Cephalonia, the company started its passenger operations using a converted US navy vessel. More recently, Strintzis acquired a reputation as an efficient, low-cost operator running ferries to popular resorts in the Aegean and on the main routes linking Greece and Italy. In line with established Greek practice, each of its half-dozen ferries belonged to a separate company controlled by the Strintzis family. The vessels, built in the 1960s and 1970s, were regularly renovated at Greek yards, enabling Strintzis to remain competitive as other passenger shipping companies started renewing their fleets. All this is changing as the company looks ahead to the lifting of cabotage restrictions at the end of the 1990s, which will open up Greek passenger shipping to outside competition. Strintzis is the first Greek ferry operator to join the Athens stock exchange, raising Dr5.1bn through a 25 per cent capital increase. The first step was to call in Arthur Andersen, the firm of accountants, to carry out an audit to international standards. The ferry operation was then restructured as a holding company. Barclays advised on a private placement, which raised Dr3bn. A share package, amounting to 20 per cent of the company's equity, was transferred to another holding group listed on the Athens bourse. In preparation for Strintzis' own flotation, the share package was re-purchased by the company. Faced with more stringent stock exchange regulations, the holding group had to be restructured as a ship-owning company, with increased liability for the eight-vessel fleet. To escape the constraints of fares set by the government on Greek routes, the Strintzis family looked for opportunities abroad, chartering vessels in Tunisia and acquiring an Irish ferry operator. Strintzis paid Dollars 2.1m to acquire Swansea Cork Ferries, undertaking to operate the line year-round for five years. One of its ferries underwent a Dollars 3m conversion, doubling passenger and vehicle capacity on the Swansea-Cork route. Earnings from the two foreign operations accounted for more than 80 per cent of Strintzis Lines' pre-tax profits of Dr2.2bn last year. This year, the company is operating a newly acquired ferry on the Adriatic crossing under an innovative hire-purchase agreement. Strintzis will pay Dollars 31.5m to Viamare, the Italian state shipping line, for a two-year-old ferry over the next two years, under an agreement based on a daily charter rate of Dollars 7,000. The Adriatic route, used by some 2m tourists last year, has become increasingly competitive since the conflict in the former Yugoslavia blocked the main overland route between Greece and northern Europe. 'It's not enough, any longer, to operate an efficient ferry service. You have to provide standards of service and entertainment that can match a cruise ship, even if it's only a 24-hour crossing,' Mr Strintzis says.</p>

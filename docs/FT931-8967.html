			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Manufacturers to prune product ranges to cut costs JAPANESE manufacturers are turning their backs on one of the key ingredients in their business philosophy of the last decade - that their international competitiveness depended upon producing ever wider ranges of products at an ever quickening pace. Surveys by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry show that, in the last year, Japanese makers of electrical goods and home appliances have begun to prune their product ranges and extend model life cycles in an effort to cut costs. The moves suggest that the pace of competition US and European companies will face from Japanese manufacturers is lessening. Most Japanese companies, hit by a combination of falling demand and rising labour and investment costs, are facing their third year of falling profits . Electrical retailers are offering huge discounts on electrical goods. The change in strategy in part reflects official guidance. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has been urging manufacturers to trim their often bewildering array of products to cut costs. The surveys found that the 10 leading manufacturers of televisions expect to produce 192 different types of television this March, about 10 per cent fewer than in March last year. There will be even sharper cuts in product ranges of video recorders, washing machines and vacuum cleaners. Nine companies which make video recorders told Miti the number of product types would be cut by 25 to 72 in the year to this March. The range of washing machines made by eight leading companies will be reduced by about a fifth to 101, while the number of different types of vacuum cleaners will be cut by almost a quarter to 79. Much more modest cuts are planned for the range of video cameras, down 3 to 20 and refrigerators, down 9 to 138. The only consumer electronics good to have its product range expanded is the microwave oven. The surveys found that although the turnover of products is still rapid, the product life cycle is slowly being extended to cut engineering and development costs. The average model life cycle for televisions has been extended by two months to 14 months, while the video recorder life cycle is now about 12 months, an increase of two to three months.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WIND NOISE FRAZZLES NEIGHBORS  </P> <P> As if life in the big city wasn't tough enough, neighbors living near a  Manhattan skyscraper say a high-pitched whistle coming from it is driving them  crazy.  </P> <P> "I've been all over the street trying to follow the noise," said Anthony  Mazzola, who lives about a block away from the 72-story Cityspire.  </P> <P> "You think you're in a loony bin. You can't get away from it."  </P> <P> Department of Environmental Protection inspectors blame wind blowing over  louvers on the mid-town building's green, eight-sided dome, which is about 800  feet above the ground, for the noise.  </P> <P> At its worst, the whistle can be heard 10 blocks away, although its intensity  depends on wind conditions, said Jerome Ross, an environmental protection  enforcement officer.  </P> <P> The building's developer, Ian Bruce Eichner, has been issued a summons for  allegedly violating noise regulations, Ross said. If found guilty, Eichner  would have to mute the whistling and pay a fine of up to $880, Ross said.  </P></p>

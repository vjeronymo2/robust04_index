			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister of education, Professor Sibusiso Bengu,  says black people will remain an underclass in the economy  unless his department intervenes decisively to improve their  educational qualifications. With this in mind, he said he had  initiated a series of processes to bring about the restructuring  of the education system. Prof. Bhengu said the directors  general and other managers in the old system would remain in  charge of their departments until the new system was in place.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PLAYHOUSE MOLDS COSTA MESA ALLIANCE;  </P> <P> THEATER: THE LA JOLLA TROUPE HAS JOINED WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY PERFORMING ARTS  CENTER TO PRODUCE A CLASSIC MUSICAL.  </P> <P> The financially troubled La Jolla Playhouse and the well-heeled Orange County  Performing Arts Center have decided to become co-producers.  </P> <P> Theater officials announced Tuesday that they will collaborate on a revival of  "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum."  </P> <P> The 1962 musical comedy, with score and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book  by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart, will play for six weeks at the Playhouse's  492-seat Mandell Weiss Theatre, July 3-Aug. 12, followed by two weeks at the  2,996-seat Costa Mesa Center, Aug. 17-26.  </P> <P> "This bond we're forging with the Center is the wave of future," Playhouse  artistic director Des McAnuff, who will stage the revival, said in a prepared  statement. "We need inventive partnerships to produce (musicals because)  they're beyond the scale of most theaters."  </P> <P> The nonprofit Playhouse had to raise $500,000 by last December to ensure that  it could mount its six-play 1990 season. It managed $560,000 in donations and  pledges, but must secure $500,000 more by June to achieve stability.  </P> <P> The Orange County center, though it too has nonprofit status and must raise  funds to offset operating expenses, has been so financially successful by  contrast that two years ago it was able to set aside $500,000 in a special  account reserved just for investment in musical and/or dance productions.  </P> <P> The center presents a five-play subscription offering called the Broadway  Series, and officials there long have complained of a scarcity of well-produced  touring shows. Previous investments with other organizations have included such  revivals as "Strike Up the Band," "Anything Goes" and "Babes in Toyland,"  although not necessarily for subscription. "Forum" will be presented outside  the Broadway Series.  </P> <P> Neither McAnuff nor center president Thomas R. Kendrick would disclose the  expected cost of the revival, but Kendrick said the Playhouse and the Center  will be  </P> <P> "50-50 partners in the capitalization of the production." The show is being  designed only for the stages at La Jolla and Costa Mesa, they added, noting  that a tour is "not under consideration."  </P> <P> McAnuff, who has yet to cast "Forum," is no stranger to musicals. He staged the  original "Big River" at the Playhouse in 1985 and won a Tony Award for  directing it on Broadway, where it garnered five other Tonys, including the one  for best musical.  </P> <P> The original "Forum" opened on Broadway on May 8, 1962, starring Zero Mostel,  and ran for 967 performances. It won six Tonys in 1963, including best musical  and best actor. Ironically, Sondheim wasn't even nominated for the score and  lyrics.  </P> <P> Shevelove's and Gelbart's farcical book, very loosely inspired by the comic  Roman writer Plautus, revolves around a slave trying to obtain his freedom by  procuring a courtesan for his master. The most famous song associated with the  show is the opening number, "Comedy Tonight." "Forum" was made into a movie in  1966, also starring Mostel, and was revived on Broadway in 1972 with Phil  Silvers.  </P> <P> Since then, productions frequently have been done in California and across the  country at all levels of expertise.  </P> <P> When San Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre took a version to Stratford,  Conn., last August, the troupe discovered three summer stock revivals being  done in Connecticut alone. A professional version was staged at the Pasadena  Civic Auditorium last June, and a touring revival starring Mickey Rooney played  both the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles and the Civic Theatre in San Diego in  1987.  </P> <P> The reviving interest in "Forum" has coincided with Sondheim's increased  acclaim, particularly in recent years. The show is not only one of his earliest  -- the first to have both his score and his lyrics -- but is also one of his  most accessible. Moreover, a production can be staged relatively economically  for a musical because it requires just one set.  </P> <P> McAnuff said he was unaware of the recent Southern California productions but  that he doesn't think they will hurt the appeal of the Playhouse's production  because "we'll do the physical comedy 1990-style."  </P> <P> Further, he said, he will be doing "serious dramaturgical work" on the play --  which he rated as "one of the top 10 musicals" of the American theater -- and  claimed that Sondheim, though not formally participating in the production, is  "already giving advice" by telephone.  </P></p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Training scheme claim denied THE Department of Employment yesterday denied claims that fewer than one in five unemployed adults get jobs after completing the government's employment training scheme. It said about a third of trainees failed to find work after completing the scheme. The Unemployment Unit, the independent research group, said unpublished government figures showed that only 19 per cent of trainees gained jobs after training compared with 27 per cent a year ago.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / SIB chairman says financial regulatory body should include banks and building societies THE Securities and Investments Board is determined that a new regulatory body for retail financial services should include all sectors of the industry including banks and building societies, Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said yesterday, Norma Cohen writes. The proposed Personal Investment Authority should 'act as the front line regulator for the sale of life insurance and life insurance related product,' regardless of which outlet is selling those products, Mr Large said. He also urged the life insurance industry to abandon its complaint that full disclosure of charges was too difficult. The new authority should be an appropriate vehicle for disclosure issues to be decisively resolved.</p>

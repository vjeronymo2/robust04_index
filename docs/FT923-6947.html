			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / De Klerk appeals for calm MR F W de Klerk, the South African president, yesterday appealed for calm and tolerance between black and white South Africans, saying that he feared that the controversy over tomorrow's rugby test match between Australia and South Africa could 'ignite a powder keg'. The issue of whether national symbols such as the South African flag and anthem should be banned from the match has pitted white against black in bitter verbal battles, highlighting a deterioration in race relations in recent months. Whites (who overwhelmingly support rugby) have been infuriated by the insistence of the African National Congress (ANC) that there be no official display of flags or singing of the national anthem, die Stem, both potent symbols of Afrikaner nationalism. Blacks (who primarily support soccer) argue that these are symbols of apartheid repression, and that such official displays should be banned from future sporting events - though the ANC has said it will not object to individual supporters carrying flags or singing. The ANC, which largely controls South Africa's access to international sport through its sanctions campaign, has said it would prevent future rugby tours unless these conditions are met on Saturday - especially the observance of a minute of silence for the dead of South Africa's black townships. At last week's New Zealand-South Africa match, white spectators broke into a spontaneous rendition of the national anthem during this period. Yesterday, Mr de Klerk said his government agreed that a minute's silence should be observed on Saturday, though he stopped short of urging his supporters to remain silent. On the subject of deadlocked constitutional negotiations, the president said government would convene a meeting early next month of like-minded parties - including the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party - to plan for the eventual resumption of talks with the main black group, the ANC. When talks do resume,they could include radicals from right and left - the ultra-radical Pan Africanist Congress and a splinter right-wing group - which had boycotted earlier talks.</p>

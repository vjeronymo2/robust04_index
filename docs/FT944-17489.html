			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Huaneng joins NYSE with Dollars 650m offering Huaneng Power International, a Chinese electricity generating group, yesterday made the biggest US offering by a Chinese company when it listed on the New York Stock Exchange following a Dollars 650m initial public offering of 31.25m American depositary shares at Dollars 20 each. The issue represents about 25 per cent of the outstanding share capital, with each ADS representing 40 ordinary shares. Trading was reported to be heavy at 2.63m ADSs, but the price held at Dollars 20. The issue was sold in three tranches, 50 per cent in the US and 25 per cent each in Asia and the rest of the world. Lehman Brothers was global co-ordinator of the issue and also lead manager for each tranche. This deal follows the first primary listing in New York by a Chinese company, when Shandong Huaneng Power Development made a Dollars 330m IPO in August.</p>

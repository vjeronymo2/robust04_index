			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHUNKS OF BRIDGE FALL ONTO CARS  </P> <P> Chunks of concrete plummeted from a bridge onto an interstate highway 75 feet  below Sunday, damaging at least 20 vehicles and injuring three motorists.  </P> <P> "A rock came out of the sky, bounced off our hood and smashed the windshield,"  said motorist Laura Nizankiewicz.  </P> <P> "There was glass all over the car. My sister got a piece in her eye, and our  arms were covered with little slivers."  </P> <P> State Trooper W. Hughes said 20 vehicles received damage to hoods, roofs,  windshields and bumpers as they passed on Interstate 376 under the city-owned  bridge about 3:30 p.m.  </P> <P> At least three people were injured, Hughes said. Two people were treated at the  scene, and one woman was in stable condition at Presbyterian-University  Hospital in Pittsburgh, he said.  </P> <P> Al Neri, a spokesman for Mayor Sophie Masloff, said late Sunday city engineers  weren't sure if the debris fell from the bridge or from collection nets placed  under the span during the weekend.  </P></p>

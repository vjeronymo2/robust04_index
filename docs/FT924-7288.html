			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Currency move gives bonus to British farmers EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers agreed yesterday to devalue the 'green pound' by 7 1/2 per cent. The move, which has full UK assent, will increase prices paid to British farmers and is intended to choke off speculation between varying prices paid for farm produce as a result of the departure of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism. Following sterling's flotation after September 16, a 'monetary gap' of 14.4 per cent has opened between the real and 'green' rates for the pound. The danger of speculation arose from the monetary compensatory amount system, which is due to be phased out from January 1 as a result of the inception of the border-free single market or 1992 programme. The MCA for the UK was 12.9 per cent; from November 19, when the green pound devaluation comes into effect, it will be 4.9 per cent. Without the change, food exporters could have shipped produce into the UK, claimed the nearly 13 per cent subsidy going in, and re-exported the food after January 1 once the MCA regime had been removed, thereby escaping the equivalent levy going out. The green pound devaluation could knock on into lower food prices for the consumer, according to a European Commission agriculture official. The abolition of the complex agrimonetary system of MCAs from January will still leave 'green' currencies in place. The current proposal of the commission, still to be approved by the council of ministers, is for a maximum 'monetary gap' of 4 per cent.</p>

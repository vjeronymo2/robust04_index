			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Trade unionists demonstrate outside Hong Kong's legislature HUNDREDS of trade unionists demonstrated outside Hong Kong's legislature yesterday, demanding that the government drop plans to import workers to ease the British colony's labour shortage, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Chan Yuen-Han, a member of the Federation of Trade Unions' standing committee, said many of the 500,000 workers represented by the demonstrators would strike if the government did not give in. He said unions would set up a strike fund and organise another rally after the Chinese New Year. The government, under pressure from employers to ease the labour shortage they say is feeding the colony's double-digit inflation, last month raised the ceiling on workers to 25,000. Many of the existing 13,000 come from across the Chinese border. About 600 unionists waved banners, shouted slogans and cheered speeches by unionists outside the Legislative Council (Legco) building. Legislators inside were due to debate a motion calling for a review of the two-year-old policy. Unions oppose the scheme saying it would lower wages and put many people out of work.</p>

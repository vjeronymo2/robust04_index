In its first day, the proceedings were  held this morning in an open session addressed by Higher State  Council Ali Kafi, after the conference was opened by Youcef  Khatib, chairman of the National Dialogue Commission. This  afternoon's proceedings are being held behind closed doors. We  will now try to get in touch with our correspondents at the  Palais des Nations with the latest developments:    [Correspondent] Yes, Rachid. Ladies and gentlemen, God's  peace and mercy be upon you. This afternoon's proceedings come  in in two different forms, namely what goes on inside the hall  behind closed doors and what goes on behind the scenes,  including the unofficial reports which have been circulating  about the identity of the next head of state. Things are also  happening inside the hall for news conferences where three  personalities have turned up so far, and they were the  rapporteur of the National Dialogue Commission, the leader of  the Party of Algerian Renewal, and the leader of HAMAS (Islamic  Society Movement).    The journalists, who have been kept away from the conference  hall, have tried to find out whether the report on the  appointment of the next head of state is true. According to  rumors, the incumbent will be [former foreign minister]  Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The report has not been confirmed or  denied by official quarters. However, what is certain is that  the text of the draft proposal on the platform for national  consensus has been amended on the issue of the head of state who  will now be appointed by the Higher Security Council. [passage  omitted]    The rapporteur of the National Dialogue Commission was very  reluctant to reply to some questions particularly those relating  to the reported appointment of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. He only  said that replying to such a question would be premature.    This afternoon's session was also marked by the news that  two  other parties, the Party of Algerian Renewal and HAMAS [Islamic  Society Movement], have also withdrawn from the conference. Our  colleague Mohsin Slimani will clarify the reasons of these  withdrawals in the following report:    [Slimani] Indeed. The Party of Algerian Renewal and HAMAS  movement, which took part in today's proceedings, have announced  their withdrawal from the national conference for different  reasons. Nourredine Boukrouh, the leader of the Party of  Algerian Renewal, indicated at a news conference that the  national conference has lost its credibility in that the  participants have found themselves in a position of mere  listeners. Boukrouh added that his withdrawal was also due to  the fact that the crucial decisions were taken in advance behind  the scenes, as he put it. He further said that the head of  state was also appointed behind the scenes.    Despite its opposition to the way the conference has been  organized, the Party of Algerian Renewal said that it considers  itself concerned by the real dialogue which he urged the new  head of state to open with representatives of the dissolved  Islamic Salvation Front. In the same context, but for different  reasons, HAMAS movement leader Mahfouz Nahnah announced the  withdrawal of his party from the conference. However, Mahfouz  Nahnah said that his movement is committed to a dialogue in  which all the active sides will take part. As regards the  political forces, the leader of the Islamic Society Movement  held the political parties also responsible for the failure of  the national conference, which everybody is talking about now.  Likewise, Nahnah held the authorities responsible for that too.  On the whole, Mahfouz Nahnah regarded the participation of  HAMAS as positive since it enabled him to reiterate the  principles of his party and it revealed to him the dimensions of  the conference or what he described as some actions [as heard].  The national conference, Nahnah said, is devoid of any  political aspect as a result of the decision of the major  parties to boycott the conference. He added that he has refused  to adopt such an attitude saying: We do not want to be the  attendants of any political movement. [passage omitted]    Here follows an excerpt from the statement made by Mahfouz  Nahnah, leader of HAMAS movement:    [Begin Nahnah recording] We hoped, from the beginning, that  the dialogue would be national, as I said, and political and not  based on groups and associations. The conference could well  benefit from these groups and these associations, but we believe  that these cannot be the core of the dialogue in the absence of  the partners to the dialogue. We also believe that this  operation is unlikely to achieve the minimum that would maintain  the value of this dialogue. However, we strongly believe that  this national conference -- supposedly national and supposedly  political -- has now whetted the appetite of those who wanted to  join a wider dialogue in the future so as to sow hope, spread  compassion, reassure the masses yearning for security and  stability, and put Algeria in its rightful place among the  peoples and the nations. For the aforementioned reasons, we  announce, on behalf of the HAMAS delegation and after taking  part for a whole day, our withdrawal from the proceeedings of  this conference, and not our withdrawal from an open, broad,  comprehensive and in-depth dialogue. [end recording]    [Slimani] In the same context, we will now listen to the  statement made by Noureddine Boukrouh, leader of the Party of  Algerian Renewal:    [Begin Boukrouh recording] We are not concerned by the  results of this conference, we will not get involved in the work  of the committees which have been set up, and we are withdrawing  from the conference this evening. We did not want to do it in a  sensational way and surprise people. We decided against that  and we gave our analysis not in a sensational way because  we are people keen on analysis and we are coherent  [italicized words in French]. We tried to do it in the best  possible way. [end recording]</p>

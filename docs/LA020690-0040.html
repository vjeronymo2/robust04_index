			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: AUDIOTRONICS CORP. SEEKS CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION  </P> <P> Audiotronics Corp., a North Hollywood maker of audiovisual products for  classrooms, said Monday it has filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the  federal bankruptcy laws.  </P> <P> Under Chapter 11, a company is shielded from creditors' lawsuits while it works  out a plan to pay its bills.  </P> <P> Audiotronics said it has hired Kenneth C. Cleveland &amp; Associates to help it  develop a reorganization plan.  </P> <P> Audiotronics said late product deliveries, parts shortages and new-product  delays left it with a severe cash-flow shortage that forced the company to miss  a debt payment and seek protection from the bankruptcy court.  </P> <P> The company also said its stock and debentures, a type of debt, will no longer  trade on the American Stock Exchange. The stock closed Monday at 31 cents a  share; it reached a record high $11.50 a share in November, 1980.  </P> <P> In its fiscal year that ended last June 30, Audiotronics lost $1.53 million on  sales of $6.15 million.  </P></p>

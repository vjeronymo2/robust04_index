			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News (Results Preview):  Results will shed light on broader trends - Profits are rising. But high share valuations imply companies can produce rapid earnings growth at a time of low inflation and slow economic growth. FT writers assess the prospects The table below shows some of the expected highlights of this year's results season. The figures and trading statements from these companies are awaited keenly, not only for their own significance, but partly for the light they should shed on broader trends. The classic bellwether stocks, such as ICI, BTR and Reckitt &amp; Colman, will provide useful pointers to the health of the world's main economies. The historic and forecast figures, which have been supplied by stockbrokers James Capel, need a little explanation. The forecasts for pre-tax profits and earnings per share are not necessarily the numbers Capel expects companies to report under FRS 3, the financial reporting standard for the profit and loss account which is now mandatory for British companies. Capel's analysts follow the Institute of Investment Management and Research's definition of 'headline' earnings, which often requires adjustment of figures prepared under FRS 3. For example, the headline numbers, designed to provide a better guide to underlying profitability, exclude gains or losses on the sale of a discontinued operation. These would be included in figures calculated under FRS 3. Capel has also adjusted the figures the companies reported last year on the same basis to make the comparison more meaningful. The price/earnings ratios the Financial Times calculates for the newspaper's London Share Service and the earnings in the FT-SE Actuaries indices are also based on the Institute's headline earnings definition.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           STOCKS TO WATCH  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Reporting             Comment date      Company  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 22    SmithKline  SmithKline showing good growth, despite pressure           Beecham     on health spending. Big worry is what happens to                       Tagamet when US patent expires this year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 22    Unilever    Unilever unlikely to report any respite in US                       detergents war with Procter &amp; Gamble or pick-up                       in recession-hit Europe. There may be further                       restructuring provisions.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 22    Guardian    Composite insurance reporting season should           Royal       be marked by fat investment gains and reasonable           Exchange    dividend rises. Market will be nervous if rate                       rises seem to be fading.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 23    British     Turboprop provisions will drag pre-tax figures           Aerospace   into red with Rover disposal profits yet to come.                       City will be hoping BAe has lost its capacity                       for nasty surprises.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 24    ICI         Focus mainly on the company's comments about                       current trading. Likely to report that European                       markets have bottomed but price and volume                       increases very difficult.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 2     Vickers     Should be back in the black after two years of                       losses.  Market hoping that, as promised,                       Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has broken even for the                       full year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 9     Standard    If there are no nasty shocks, focus will be           Chartered   dividend it has held for three years. It could                       jump by as much as 25 per cent, improving the                       shares' modest yield.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 24    British     Earlier than expected end to company's monopoly           Gas         of domestic gas market has raised questions about                       ability to maintain the pace of dividend growth.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 9     Cadbury     While most UK-based food manufacturers have seen           Schweppes   their margins squeezed by the supermarket price                       wars Cadbury will have had an excellent year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 9     RTZ         Apart from the figures themselves interest will                       focus on RTZ's comments about metal prices. Likely                       to argue recent rise due to speculation not                       fundamentals.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 10    Barclays    Positive noises expected on current year, although                       bank is unlikely to make any moves to restore 1992                       dividend cut. Forecasts vary wildly due to                       provision uncertainty.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 10    BTR         BTR's global and industrial spreads offer good                       view of world's major economies.  Given recent                       underperformance of shares, City braced for                       possibility of bad news.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 10    Rolls-Royce Rolls should be back in the black but markets                       still very tough. Group needs long-awaited pick-up                       in spares and comments here will shape 1994                       forecasts.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 10    TI Group    First full year from Dowty, which is struggling,                       but good US upturn elsewhere. Analysts hope for                       confirmation of landing gear merger with                       Messier-Bugatti  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 17    Arjo        City hopes that these figures represent bottom of           Wiggins     cycle Appleton for Arjo. Current year forecasts                       depend partly on comments on expected upturn in                       paper prices.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 17    Guinness    Figures were well flagged at the time of the LVMH                       deal. Interest will centre on the current trading                       statement, following LVMH's buoyant comments                       earlier this year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 22    Bowater     Shares have started to recover after sharp                       derating and analysts hoping the company will be                       rather more positive than in September.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 23    Kingfisher  Followers eager to learn whether slide in sales at                       Darty in France been stemmed and effect of pricing                       policy on sales at Woolworths and B&amp;Q.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 24    Reckitt &amp;   Provides good indicator of world consumer markets.           Colman      Expected to report making solid progress in the US                       but continent remains a struggle.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 13    RMC         Key question whether growth in demand from east                       Germany offsets slowdown in west.                       Analysts hoping                       contributions will be split out.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 14    Blue Circle Share price assuming that margins in the UK                       continue to improve and that price rises stick.

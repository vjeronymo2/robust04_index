			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Radio News"] </F>   [Text] As of 1 July, the Ministry of Prices and Finance,  through the 23 June Resolution No. 8, will establish new prices  for fuels that are sold for personal use through fuel ration  cards. The prices, agreed upon by the executive committee of the  Council of Ministers are: 1.20 pesos per liter for special  gasoline; 1 peso per liter for regular gasoline; 75 cents per  liter of gas oil or diesel.    The resolution establishes that the money will be collected  when the private-use fuel ration cards are issued to consumers  in the places designated by the enterprises that are authorized  to operate the service centers. The fuel ration cards will be  given out, in the same manner as before, according to Cuba's  fuel supply.    The enterprises that will supply and charge for the fuel  ration cards for private use will guarantee that they have no  expiration date and that those not used by year end, for any  reason, can be renewed during the period that the said  enterprises establish. A private vehicle owner who has a 1994  fuel ration card when the new prices become effective can renew  them before 31 July 1994 in the same place where he got them. He  will have to pay the difference between the old and new prices.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Jordan and Israel start talks again Jordan and Israel renewed talks in Washington yesterday which are expected to make progress on the peace 'agenda' signed by the two countries in September 1993. It is the first time the two sides have officially met since peace talks were suspended after the Hebron massacre in February. Government officials in Amman spoke confidently of a settlement on border disputes which could be implemented before a overall peace agreement is signed. Jordan has claimed two strips of land along its border with Israel. Other subjects to be discussed include water rights and economic ties. The thorny issue of Palestinian refugees residing in Jordan has been postponed to a later date to speed progress on the other issues. While Jordan has given assurances to Syria and Lebanon that it will not sign a separate agreement with Israel before a comprehensive solution is found, it has not ruled out implement-ing items on its agenda mean-while. This latest drive for progress comes at a time when the kingdom feels increasingly marginalised by developments in the Middle East peace process.</p>

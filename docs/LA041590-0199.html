			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I am avid fan of the Academy Awards festivities and watch faithfully every  year.  </P> <P> The excitement and the glamour is always very intriguing. I thought the show  run this year by Billy Crystal was very well done, except at the end, and that  did it for me. When Diana Ross came out and sang the wonderful "Over the  Rainbow," she ruined an otherwise terrific show. Why couldn't Judy Garland sing  the song in the clip they were showing? Ross did nothing to enhance the song  and had no business being there.  </P> <P> Toni Jacobson, Monterey Park  </P></p>

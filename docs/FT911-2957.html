			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Most pupils opt to stay on in education A MAJORITY of 16-year-olds is, for the first time, staying on at school or college rather than opting for a job or government training scheme. Last year those staying in education rose to 53 per cent from 48 per cent in 1989, according to figures on 500,000 pupils collected by local careers officers throughout the UK. More than three quarters of 16-year-olds now continue either in education or on Youth Training schemes, according to the survey, issued by the Associations of County Councils and Metropolitan Authorities. Local education authorities said yesterday that Britain was now beginning to compare well with other countries in the education and training of young people. Mr Roy Slade, who compiled and edited the report, said the figures also contradicted the picture painted by the Prince of Wales earlier this week when he said that only a third of 16-year-olds remained in further education. The trend towards staying on in the classroom in preference to getting a job or taking up Youth Training was reported in each of 11 regions and could not be linked solely to the recession or the rise in unemployment, the education authorities said. Overall, the national figures have to be seen in the context of falling school rolls and an overall reduction of 7.5 per cent in the year group last year. The reduction is part of longer-term demographic shifts and the reduction in the number of school leavers which is causing many organisations to revise their employment policies. Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, said the figures confirmed that more young people were recognising the importance of continuing their education beyond the age of 16. 'The reality which these figures, and indeed our own, show is very different from the gloomy pictures we keep hearing about,' he said. Schools that have opted out of local-authority control will no longer have to wait five years before changing their status, Mr Clarke announced yesterday. He said he would consider each application on its merits. School Leavers' Destinations 1991. ACC Publications, Eaton House, 66a Eaton Square, London SW1W 9BH. Pounds 5.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party [of  Japan] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Thursday [20 January] he  might resign if a possible rebellion by several SDP [SDPJ]  legislators led to the breakdown of a political reform package  in Friday's vote at a full House of Councillors session.    "If the political reform package failed to clear the upper  chamber as the result of SDP legislators' opposition, I will  take the responsibility as the SDP chairman, as our party would  not be able to disclaim resultant political responsibility," he  said.    Murayama made the remark at a meeting of 73 legislators of  the upper chamber, called one day before Friday's crucial vote  that is regarded as make or break for the five-month-old  administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The upper house will hold a plenary session at 3 p.m. Friday  to vote on the government-proposed package, upon which Hosokawa  has repeatedly pledged to stake his political future.    The wording "take the responsibility" was immediately taken  as expressing Murayama's readiness to give up his chairmanship  of the largest party in the ruling coalition in such an  eventuality.    Murayama pleaded with the legislators not to defect to the  opposition side in voting on the package.    On Wednesday, three SDP legislators vowed to vote against  the  package, saying its loopholes undermines the package's ability  to scare legislators away from taking bribes, while asserting  the proposed 274 single-seat constituencies would deal a heavy  blow to the SDP in a next election.    Five more SDP legislators have publicly voiced their  opposition to the package, citing similar concerns about its  possible adverse fallouts.    At least three other SDP legislators have abstained from  vowing to comply with the SDP leadership's instructions to vote  with the coalition in Friday's vote.    The coalition has only a slim majority in the 252 upper  chamber. The majority is 126 votes, as its chairman Bunbei Hara  is not qualified to vote. The opposition camp brandishes 117  seats.    This means that defections of only nine SDP rebels to the  opposition side could scuttle the package, unless similar  defections on the LDP side broke up the LDP's unity.    Murayama said, "I want you to hand down your final judgments  on the package with an eye to the issue of what would happen to  the relationship between the cabinet and our party and how our  party would be pressed to account for the failure of the  package" if the package got bogged down.    The SDP, which has in the opposition for 38 years until the  Liberal Democratic Party was ousted from power last August,  finally could obtain six cabinet posts, including the office of  minister in charge of political reform, in Hosokawa's 21-member  cabinet.    The SDP, with its 76 upper house legislators, secured its  intra- cabinet presence after a July 18 general election by  throwing its political weight behind Hosokawa's bid to form a  coalition government.    Murayama said Sadao Yamahana, a state minister charged with  political reform, and other ministers may be expelled from the  cabinet if the package were voted down.</p>

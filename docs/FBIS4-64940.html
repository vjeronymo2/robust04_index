			<p>BFN     [Text] Balta Hasan, a 38-year-old Turkish man, who had  escaped from a Greek prison where he was serving a 15-year  sentence, has been named as the head of a three-member ring of  drug dealers broken up by the police yesterday.    The drugs were smuggled to Greece through the river Evros by  a 39-year-old Turkish casino owner, Deniz Ozkan, and were handed  over to his compatriot, escaped from a Patras prison last  February. "He was on a five-day leave, as the law provides, but  he never returned to the jail," Khristos Keramidas, Attiki's  security police chief, told reporters.    A few days ago, officers of the drug squad spotted the  escaped prisoner in Passalimani, Piraeus. They followed him and  found out that he was being hidden by a Greek convicted drug  dealer Khristos Peroutseas, aged 36. The police stormed his  apartment yesterday and arrested the two men, discovering one  and a half kilos of heroin.</p>

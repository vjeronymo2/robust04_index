			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lev Volkov with introduction by Pavel </F> Felgengauer: "START II and the Topol Mobile Intercontinental  Missiles"]    [Text] Lev Volkov is a lieutenant general and former  chief of the Ministry of Defense Central Research Institute (the  main institute in the system of the Strategic Missile Forces).  He is a full member of the International and Russian engineering  academies and a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of  Sciences.    In the first days of January 1993 and, accordingly, in  the final days of the presidency of George Bush, the  Russian-American START II treaty on a reduction in strategic  offensive arms was signed in Moscow. Many observers were  astonished at that time at the incomprehensible haste in the  signing and, most importantly, at the necessity for inviting to  Moscow a president who had just two weeks of his term to go.  Boris Yeltsin was probably in urgent need of international  confirmation of his status following the first major (and  extremely unsuccessful for the president) clash with parliament  (Congress of People's Deputies) in December 1992.    There arose, naturally, quite widespread suspicions  that START II was an insufficiently weighed, opportunist  document that by the year 2003 would have placed Russia in a  position of strategic inequality.    But if START II was signed in a hurry, it had been  prepared quite thoroughly, and not only by specialists of  Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs but also of the General  Staff, what is more. "START II is a result of the joint efforts  of two ministries--Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the  Ministry of Defense. Never before have the two departments  worked so closely and in such a friendly working atmosphere,"  Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Army  General Staff, maintains. The group of experts from the Ministry  of Defense was headed by General Nikolayev, incidentally, who is  now commander in chief of border forces and who was at that time  first deputy chief of the General Staff.    The former Supreme Soviet greeted the treaty warily and  after several hearings postponed ratification to the fall of  1993 in order never to return to it. Altogether, the treaty  could not have been considered in earnest, for that matter,  until the fate of the former Soviet strategic arms in Belarus,  Kazakhstan, and Ukraine had been decided and until these  countries had ratified the START I treaty and subscribed to the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    Now all the preliminary conditions have been more or  less fulfilled, and the time has come for the ratification of  START II by the new Federal Assembly. The ratification or  nonratification will determine for many years to come Russia's  defense policy and the structure of its strategic nuclear force.  But, in any event, the old strategic weapons systems added to  our armory in the 1970's and 1980's will have to be eliminated  since their service life is coming to an end. As a result, in  the current Strategic Missile Forces system armory there is only  one system of ground-based intercontinental ballistic  missiles--the Topol--that simultaneously corresponds to the  terms of START II and is sufficiently modern to be able to  survive (with a certain modernization) until the year 2015. In  the next year or two the Russian military and political  leadership will have to choose: either stick with the Topol  system, as the basis of the future ground-based Strategic  Missile Forces, or immediately begin the development of another  prospective intercontinental missile....    "According to open press data, six catastrophes  accompanied by the sinking of the boats, explosions, and fires,  the result of which were the loss of nuclear munitions and  missiles and also the loss of life of personnel, have occurred  in the course of the operation of several dozen nuclear  submarines. But no one today is raising the question of  abandoning the use of strategic nuclear weapons on nuclear  submarines."  <H8>  START II </H8>   Compared with the START I treaty, the START II treaty alters  the structure of the strategic nuclear force thanks to the  elimination in the Strategic Missile Forces of missiles with  multiple reentry vehicles. It is necessary in fulfilling START  II conditions to have dismantled 675-780 launchers (3,775-3,880  warheads) by the years 2000-2003 and during this time to have  created in exchange a grouping of 800-900 single-warhead  missiles. With regard to the country's actual economic  situation, it will have been possible, most likely, to deploy  only 600-700 ground-based ICBM's, that is, in practice we will  not have assimilated the quota of 3,500 warheads for the  strategic nuclear force.    It would be desirable, therefore, to adjust a number of the  provisions of START II prior to its ratification: the  "automatic" termination of the treaty in the event of a  violation of the provisions of the 1972 ABM Treaty and stricter  control of the possibility of the return to the grouping of the  warheads removed in accordance with the treaty from the missiles  and bombers.    In addition, it would be desirable to extend the timeframe  of  the reduction in the Strategic Missile Forces to the year 2005,  which would make it possible to make fuller use of the service  life of the ICBM's to be destroyed, compensating for the  insufficient funding of strategic nuclear force development  programs. This adjustment ensues directly from Russia's economic  difficulties, but it does not alter the cardinal provisions of  the program for the development of the Strategic Missile Forces,  merely shifts the time scale for its realization.  <H8>  Prospect--Single-Warhead Missiles </H8>   The treaty between the USSR and the United States limiting  strategic offensive arms (SALT II), which Leonid Brezhnev and  Jimmy Carter signed in 1979, determined an overall permissible  number of delivery systems and also the number of ICBM's with  multiple reentry vehicles (820). As a result, it was  advantageous to have in the grouping the maximum permissible  number of ICBM's with multiple reentry vehicles.    START I limited to a considerably greater extent the number  of weapons compared with the number of delivery systems, which  determined the prospective nature of an increase in the  single-warhead part of the grouping. Although according to the  terms of START I it was possible to preserve some part of the  ICBM's with multiple reentry vehicles, including 154 heavy  missiles, the overall limitation on the number of warheads  compelled increased survivability and an aspiration to the  single-warhead grouping. After all, the destruction by one  weapon of an ICBM with 10 warheads pays, and the destruction of  a single-warhead missile with one weapon is only equivalent  exchange.    Thus the switch to single-warhead ICBM's was the arterial  direction for the development of the Strategic Missile Forces  grouping adopted in 1991 together with START I, and the terms of  START II merely accelerated the timeframe of this switch.  <H8>  Liquid Fuel </H8>   The Strategic Missile Forces grouping had as of 1 January  1993 six classes of ICBM's, including four classes using a  liquid fuel that is highly toxic and dangerous in  operation--"heptyl" (asymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine--P.F.)--and  two classes using compound [smesevoy] solid fuel that is  nontoxic and considerably safer in operation, including the  Topol single-warhead mobile missiles. The solid fuel is charged  under plant conditions, repositories, fuel tanks, and fuel  supply lines in the line units are not needed, and fuel vapor  discharges are excluded. Solid fuel may be used for the ICBM's  in both the fixed- and mobile-basing versions, which affords  opportunities for standardization, whereas it is dangerous to  use liquid fuel in mobile missiles.    We would mention also that our solid fuel is in a number of  its specifications superior to the fuel used in the United  States' ICBM's, and in terms of the energetics of the missiles  as a whole, the solid-fuel systems are only very negligibly  inferior to their liquid-fuel counterparts.    Thus all program developers have unanimously concluded that  the prospective Strategic Missile Forces grouping should have  solid-fuel ICBM's.  <H8>  ICBM Basing Modes </H8>   The "Fundamental Provisions of the Russian Federation  Military Doctrine" define as the purpose of policy in the sphere  of nuclear weapons: removal of the danger of nuclear war by way  of deterring the unleashing of aggression against the Russian  Federation and its allies. They also define the mission of the  strategic nuclear force: maintaining the composition and status  of the strategic nuclear force at a level providing for the  assured infliction of the desired damage on an aggressor under  any conditions.    These doctrinal provisions compel the consideration as the  main scenario of the use of the strategic nuclear force and the  Strategic Missile Forces the infliction on an aggressor of  unacceptable damage in a retaliatory strike, that is, after the  enemy's ICBM and SLBM warheads have delivered a strike against  the territory of Russia.    In the struggle between launcher protection facilities and  the accuracy of warhead delivery to target that has gone on for  several decades, victory for the coming decade goes to the  accuracy of the missile guidance systems. A MX missile warhead  delivered to a launch silo with the current degree of protection  (of the order of 100 kg per square centimeter) would destroy it  with 0.998 probability, and warheads of the Minuteman-3M ICBM  and the Trident-2 SLBM, with 0.921 probability. Two warheads of  the Trident-2 SLBM would destroy a launch silo with 0.994  probability. A further increase in launch silo protection  requiring big outlays for construction would easily be countered  by the use of guided warheads capable with a probability of  close to 1 of destroying launch silos with a protection an order  of magnitude greater than is customary at the present time.    The data presented in respect to launch silo survivability  raise no doubts since the well-known algebraic dependence  incorporating three parameters: protection of the launch silo  and the power and accuracy of the warhead to be delivered to it,  are used for the calculation.    The development of offensive arms has in the past 20 years  forced the missile engineers of the USSR (Russia) and the United  States to earnestly seek basing versions with an indeterminate  location of the ICBM and its launcher. Mobile ground and  railroad launchers have been developed, whose survival, even  with the prospective means of space reconnaissance (radar,  infrared, optical), in a retaliatory strike is six to seven  times higher than the survivability of a modern launch silo with  a strike against it of one warhead from a Trident-2 missile.    The United States completed the development of ground and  railroad ICBM sites, but abandoned their deployment under the  conditions strategic arms reduction since it has a potential for  a retaliatory strike, thanks to the modernization of submarines  and their fitting with Trident-2 missiles, two to three times  greater than Russia. In the USSR mobile sites were deployed at  the end of the 1980's, which considerably enhanced the  efficiency of the strategic nuclear force in the delivery of a  retaliatory strike.    In the course of preparation of START I the main efforts of  the American side were geared to various prohibitions and  limitations of the Strategic Missile Forces' mobile grouping: a  ban on the use of several shelters (launchers) for one ICBM, a  ban on the Strategic Missile Forces' whole mobile grouping, a  ban on the use of railroad sites, limitation of the strength of  the mobile grouping, limitation of the mobile ICBM patrolling  areas, notification of changes of position, and so forth. It  should be noted that, for the most part, our delegation  succeeded in preserving an acceptable strength of the mobile  grouping and conditions whereby it remains sufficiently  effective.    Today approximately one-third of the ICBM's in the Russian  Strategic Missile Forces are mobile, including 72 launchers with  Topol missiles that are currently being withdrawn from Belarus.  It is contemplated that in the future the Strategic Missile  Forces will have 60-70 percent mobile ICBM's and 30-40 percent  fixed launch silos. The contribution of the mobile sites to the  efficiency of a retaliatory strike of the Strategic Missile  Forces here will constitute 80-85 percent, and to the efficiency  of the strategic nuclear force, 60-70 percent.  <H8>  Vulnerability of Mobile Sites in a Conventional War </H8>   During operations in position areas of sabotage groups or in  the event of a breach of the front of our forces in the course  of a conventional war where combat operations are conducted in  the disposition of Strategic Missile Forces' units and combined  units, mobile sites are more vulnerable than fixed sites. The  efficiency of the operations of aviation against mobile and silo  launchers with guided aerial bombs or cruise missiles with  conventional shells is approximately identical. One single unit  of ammunition would with a high degree of probability destroy a  protected launch silo thanks to greater hitting accuracy, and it  would be easier to destroy a less protected mobile launcher, but  harder to find it among several combat launch positions or on  traffic routes.    It should be noted, however, that the views of the  military-political leadership on the possibility of an  aggressor's premeditated destruction with impunity of strategic  nuclear weapons in the course of a conventional war are now  changing. The "Fundamental Provisions of the Military Doctrine"  note that massive strikes against the strategic nuclear force by  conventional weapons could bring about a retaliatory nuclear  strike. I would like to see this provision strengthened: A  premeditated attack with the use of conventional weapons on the  strategic nuclear force means the guaranteed start of a nuclear  war. It is essential to enshrine this provision politically  since only the United States and NATO have the possibility of  inflicting a "nonnuclear" strike against the Russian strategic  nuclear force, whereas the destruction of the nuclear weapons of  the United States by conventional arms is highly problematical.    Thus possible losses of mobile and fixed ICBM's in a  conventional war are not a characteristic of the arms but,  rather, the degree of tolerance of the leadership of the country  observing the annihilation of strategic weapons reduced to a  reasonable minimum. The danger of the destruction in a  conventional war of mobile ICBM's and the possible consequences  are not in the least bit different from the danger of the  destruction of nuclear power stations, chemical plants, nuclear  submarine bases, airfields with strategic bombers, and other  similar facilities.  <H8>  Safety of Operation of Mobile Sites in Peacetime </H8>   It is obvious that the operation of mobile sites connected  with a change of position on prepared routes is potentially more  complex and dangerous than ICBM's in launch silos. It is  important that these potential threats not become reality.    A particular feature of the mode of the operational use of  mobile launchers that is frequently not understood by the  critics of this basing version is the fact that the missiles in  a permanent state of readiness 96 percent of the time are in  battle position, that is, in protected installations where they  are dependably guarded by personnel using special facilities for  detecting and destroying intruders. The routes for changing the  launcher position have engineering support realized in advance,  the march is usually undertaken at night, when traffic intensity  is low, the launcher is provided with cover in the front and at  the rear by special vehicles, the drivers of the launchers are  highly skilled specialists who constantly undergo training in  simulators and at automotive test grounds, and the driver's work  is monitored by the launcher commander and a set of technical  facilities.    The enumerated measures have made it possible to markedly  increase safety on the march compared with the practical  operation of the first SS-20 intermediate-range mobile sites.  There were in the process of operation of several hundred SS-20  launchers an average of eight to 10 accidents, breakages, and  instances of damage a year, but none of them signified even the  preconditions of an incidence of radioactive contamination.    As a result of the great deal of organizing work that was  performed in the Strategic Missile Forces, the introduction of  new designs, and an improvement in the selection and assignment  of launcher driver personnel, the accident rate has declined  sharply and the probability of an incident is not more than  0.00001 a year. This means that with the operation of 500  launchers there is a 5 percent probability of an accident at one  of them over the course of 10 years. In terms of industrial  grading, conditions of occupational activity with such an  accident probability are considered safe.    I would like to compare the safety of nuclear weapons in  different components of the strategic nuclear force. According  to open press data, six catastrophes accompanied by the sinking  of the boats, explosions, and fires, the result of which were  the loss of nuclear munitions and missiles and also the loss of  life of personnel, occurred in the course of the operation of  several dozen nuclear submarines in the USSR. But today no one  is raising the question of the abandonment of the use of  strategic nuclear weapons on nuclear submarines. On the  contrary, this component of the strategic nuclear force is in  terms of the proportion of nuclear weapons being augmented. The  public is also well aware of the accident rate of our aircraft.    Thus the potential danger of the operation of mobile sites  in  peacetime is compensated in practice by technical and  organizational measures and represents less of a threat to the  public and the territories than other components of the  strategic nuclear force.  <H8>  Economy of the Strategic Missile Forces' Grouping With </H8> Mobile Sites    Outlays on the creation, introduction to the grouping, and  operation over the warranty period of sites with fixed or mobile  basing modes per missile, on the whole, are close for  prospective fixed and mobile launchers. It should be noted,  however, that the bulk of the outlays, for which funding per the  "capital construction" item is the most complicated, is composed  for the launch silo of expenditure on the reequipping or the  construction of a new silo, and for the mobile launcher, on the  development of a road network used by more than just the  military. For example, the introduction of SS-24 railroad sites  made it possible to replace the track, reinforce the bed,  install automated equipment and means of communication, and  build sidings, which improved the traffic capacity of a  pronounced portion of our railroads. The development of a  network of roads in the areas where the mobile ground-based  sites are located is, naturally, also supported by the local  administration. Whereas the public money "dug" into the earth in  the construction of a launch silo is not returned even following  the dismantling of the launcher and its hand-over to the local  authorities.  <H8>  What Happens if the Program To Create Mobile Sites Is Halted </H8>   The fixed and mobile sites in operation will have exhausted  their service life by the years 2000-2003. The abandonment of  one program without the fulfillment of any other would signify,  therefore, the slow extinction of the most efficient and least  costly component of the strategic nuclear force. Without the  Strategic Missile Forces sea and aviation components could not  perform their set assignments of deterring an aggressor. Critics  of the program for developing the Strategic Missile Forces  grouping based on single-warhead solid-fuel ICBM's with two  basing modes should in saying "a" also be saying "b," that is,  proposing some reasonable alternative.  <H8>  Possible Alternative Versions </H8>   If we do not ratify START II and develop the strategic  nuclear force and the Strategic Missile Forces under the  conditions of START I, preserving the current mobile grouping  strength, it will be necessary to develop a new missile with  multiple reentry vehicles to replace the SS-18 heavy missile and  also an SS-24-class light missile for the railroad site. Nor  will it be possible to abandon the modernization of the  single-warhead missile here since this part of the grouping will  by the years 2000-2003 also need to replace the missiles and  launchers. For the Strategic Missile Forces such a program would  be at least 30-50 percent more costly, and the grouping's  efficiency in a retaliatory strike also would still be  determined mainly by the mobile sites.    If START II is ratified (preferably with the proposed  adjustments), it will be possible to speak only of the ratio of  silo- and mobile-basing single-warhead missiles. But even today  more than one-third of the launchers in the grouping are mobile.  Since the mobile ground sites are several times more efficient  than the silo sites, with an approximately identical cost, it  would be expedient to have in the grouping the maximum quantity  of them determined by the terms of the START I and START II  treaties, with regard, of course, to the actual possibilities of  industry, given its limited funding.    Thus the ratification or nonratification of START II will  not  alter the arterial direction of the development of the Strategic  Missile Forces--the transition from missiles with multiple  reentry vehicles to single-warhead missiles--since this is  determined by the START I treaty that is already in effect (an  appreciable limitation on the number of warheads compared with  the number of missiles). The START II treaty merely shortens the  timeframe of the transition to a single-warhead grouping and,  the author believes, is in need of adjustment in this respect  prior to ratification with regard to the country's economic  situation. It is also obvious that it would be expedient to  create the single-warhead grouping on the basis of one  standardized Topol-class (SS-25) missile with two types of  basing if only because approximately one-third of the ICBM's are  of mobile ground basing and have the corresponding  infrastructure of the position areas and an evolved system of  operation.</p>

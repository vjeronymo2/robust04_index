			<p>930615 FT  15 JUN 93 / Letter: Social provisions must be preserved Sir, Your article 'Japan car workers top of earnings league in world motor industry' (June 10), paints a rosy picture of the Japanese car worker's condition. It ignores, though, the now oft-documented stress and ill health their long working hours produce. Without actually saying so, the article hints that Europe's social provisions (particularly good wages and moderate working hours), should be sacrificed in the name of increased competitiveness. This attitude is increasingly souring relations with Britain's European neighbours, who rightly feel social justice and economic prosperity go hand in hand and resent the attempt of the UK government to create a competitive labour market on the basis of low wages and poor working conditions. There should be no suggestion that Europeans should go back on their social achievements. We should be calling for our main competitors to adopt similar policies to improve the living and working conditions of their working people, particularly shorter worker hours to achieve an enhanced quality of life and increased employment opportunities. Carole Tongue, Rapporteur for European Parliament on the European Car Industry, 97a Ilford Lane, Ilford, Essex IJ1 2RJ</p>

			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Print group to talk with union THE ST IVES printing group has agreed to formal talks with the GPMU print union about the use of casual or temporary labour in its magazine division. The move follows a GPMU ballot in favour of industrial action after the company refused to stop hiring casual staff in the unskilled finishing area at Pounds 3 an hour, compared with the usual Pounds 5.85. The union wants an agreement on the limited use of casual labour.</p>

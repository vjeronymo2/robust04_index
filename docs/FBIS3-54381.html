			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on the economy by Economy Minister Mourad Benachnou </F> at the conference on national consensus at the Club des Pins in  Algiers -- live]    [Excerpts] Mr. Chairman of the Higher State Council; Mr.  Chairman of the National Dialogue Commission; Mr. Head of the  Government; ladies and gentlemen: The government has carried  out, since its formation, an analysis of the financial and  economic situation in the country in order to detect the  underline factors which would help in slowing, if not stopping,  the deterioration. As such, the situation is characterized by  the following features:    A spiral inflation which has grown by about 2 percent per  month for the widely consumed goods;    A quasi-end to job creation and the loss of job  opportunities  in all sectors of production as a result of lack of investment  and the bad management of the economy. Thus, unemployment,  which is rife among youth, was on the increase;    A financial situation was characterized by a deficit in the  public sector of the economy, a matter which compelled the  treasury to pay off part of this sector's debts;    A sharp deficit in the budget: It was much more than what  was  estimated at the beginning of the year. It was the result of a  drop in the oil revenues, in particular, as a result of a drop  in the oil prices in world markets, in addition to a decrease in  ordinary tax revenues, given the decline in the production and  service sectors of the economy;    A sharp imbalance in the balance of payment which led to  restricting imports and controlling through the use of rules and  laws scares foreign currency resources. This led to a grave  scarcity of the intermediate goods which are destined to the  productive apparatus. [passage omitted]    Two-pronged activity was undertaken to re-organize the  economy: A corrective activity directed towards the achievement  of a balance between the available resources and domestic and  foreign expenditures. [passage omitted]    An economic revival activity which was aiming at creating  productive working posts and consequently reducing unemployment  through investment, the revival of the economic apparatus,  regaining the confidence of the private economic operators and  the reorganization of the distribution net work.    The success of this revival activity requires a progress in  economic reforms and its implementation has to begin,  particularly in the fields that include special initiatives and  the sectors which have significant repercussion on the economy  such as the building sector. Around these two axes, the most  important activities of the government in the economic,  financial, and monetary spheres were presented in this brief  round-up. [passage omitted]    Generally speaking, the in-depth analysis of the  government's  activities and its intervention should show that the scope of  its activities have focussed on reforming and stimulating the  economy. Concerning economic reforms, under this title comes  the current relations with the IMF aimed at achieving a plan of  economic stability, dealing with foreign debts and introducing  measures to reduce the budget deficit.    Regarding relations with the IMF, the government decided  since its appointment to resume negotiations with the IMF in  order to draw a plan for stability. This decision was based on  the following estimated factors: The main features of the state  of the internal and external finance are an increasing deficit  in the budget as a result of the decline in the petroleum  revenue and increasing difficulties in securing financial cover  for imports through external financing at reasonable cost.    The restoration of internal and external financial  equilibriums, I mean a return to an economic policy financed by  the existing resources, is the only way to control inflation,  boost the economic apparatus, promote private investment, reduce  speculative economic activities, and launch actions for the  creation of productive and permanent jobs for young people.    Thus, the government is determined to face up to the  country's economic and financial situation. There was no  suitable remedy [as heard] to improve growth and create jobs.  These facts have led to the resumption of talks with the  International Monetary Fund. It is worth mentioning in this  respect that these talks were never interrupted. The government  has given these talks a clear objective and it has drawn up a  strategy of negotiations with the IMF taking into account the  particular circumstances which the country is going through.    This objective was announced from the very start and the  idea  is to achieve a program for economic stability. As a result of  this strategy these negotiations have moved in a direction which  allows our country to benefit from the support and understanding  of our international partners with a view to persuading the IMF  to take into account our country's special situation and also to  pool its own financial resources to help us in our efforts to  revive the economy. It is worth noting that the government was  anxious not to start negotiations with the IMF before informing  its social partners, workers and trade unions. The government  thus presented the analysis which led it to choose this path and  also the strategies of the negotiations [as heard] which will  follow.    The talks with the IMF consisted of three stages. In the  first stage, there was a joint analysis of the country's  economic and financial situation. This analysis led to in-depth  discussions last September in Washington between government  representatives and senior officials in the IMF. In the second  stage, the two sides agreed to define the economic, financial,  and monetary measures which the government would adopt to  stabilize the economy. The talks relating to this stage were  held in Algeria in the first two weeks of December 1993 between  a team of Algerian experts and a team of IMF experts. The  objective sought by the two sides was mainly to reach an  understanding on elements of the economic policy which should  include a structured program in order to improve the country's  economic and financial situation.    In the third stage, the two sides agreed to lay down  criteria  on which these various elements should be based with a view to  achieving the desired economic and financial results. They also  agreed to discuss these criteria on the strength of technical  reports prepared by the two sides.    The elements of the plan of stability which received  financial support from the IMF must be tackled during this  stage. Intensive work had been undertaken to prepare for these  negotiations both at the level of the government and the  technical bodies. The technical aspects of relations with the  IMF are considered to be under control. They attracted the  attention of the directors of the economy concerning the correct  Algerian viewpoint with regard to the soundness of its program  which will be put before the IMF. These directors have  expressed their approval and support after Algeria reached  agreement with the IMF. [passage omitted]    The government in its negotiations with the IMF provided for  itself a negotiating margin to enable it to stringently and  clearly undertake this plan which would have positive effects on  social strata. In this framework, one can explain the measures  that had been taken recently with the General Union of Algerian  Workers [UGTA] within the framework of social protection.  [passage omitted]    With regard to the problem of foreign debts, foreign debts  at  the end 1993 stood at $25.9 billion. It is expected that  servicing these debts in 1994 would cost $9.3 billion out of  which 7.1 billion dollars are earmarked for the loans and $2.2  billion as interest.    The revenues from exports during the same year could be less  than the cost of servicing the debts. As well as being heavy in  terms of the economy's ability to sustain servicing them, the  main feature of Algeria's foreign debts is that they are of very  short terms and they must be settled within a period of three  years. The heavy weight of the debts had increased as a result  of the drop in the revenues from the exports of carbohydrates  coupled with the continuing fall in the price of a barrel of oil  and this doubles the efforts to tackle it. The search for a  negotiated solution with the creditors to reduce foreign debts  must take place through a deal with the IMF. However, this  entails results which are known beforehand and effects that can  be undertaken. As far as the budget deficit is concerned,  the government has paid great importance to reduce the budget  deficit which has resulted from a number of economic  complications; it is matter which should be taken seriously.    The financial year 1993 was ahead of the forecast; a matter  which has enabled the government to take measures to reduce this  year's deficit, which is estimated at 12 percent of the GDP.  However, as far as 1994 is concerned a number of measures,  which would allow a reduction of the deficit to an acceptable  level, around 3.6 percent of the GDP, have been taken. Although  this should still be considered a high level given the  inflationary trends in the economy this figure can, however, be  achieved through the following measures:    Cuts in a number of secondary expenditure which would be  coupled with further rationalization of other expenditures.    An increase in ordinary tax revenues; which will be achieved  only through a program to combat tax evasion. [passage omitted].  The use of some of the money, which has been set aside for the  past few years. [passage omitted]    Encouraging investments in the framework of the small and  medium-sized companies thanks, in particular, to the law on  investments directed mainly at the private sector.    Enforcing the finance law of 1994.    Facilitating the objection of foreign financing.    As far as the law on investments and encouraging small- and  medium-sized companies are concerned, and regarding the  financial situation of the country, it is difficult to lay down  a strict program of economic research. The economy, however,  has the potential to have vitality instilled into it, and this  potential has not been fully exploited. For this, it needs  individual initiative as this is based on restoring confidence  in the private sector in particular.    Since it was appointed, the government has adopted a number  of measures aimed at not marginalizing the private sector.  [passage omitted]    Protecting national production was the subject of measures  aimed at raising duties on some products. All import  restrictions would be lifted on those products which might  compete with national products.    Measures had also been taken to encourage products destined  for export by reducing customs duties imposed on raw and  semi-manufactured materials used in the manufacturing of  products suitable for export.    In the same context, and in order to encourage economic  activities by companies whose capital allows for the sharing of  risks between numerous investors in a single project, the tax  index on the companies' profits had been reduced from 42 percent  to 38 percent in the present financial law.    Concerning facilities for acquiring hard currency, in  addition to these measures, which are of a legislative nature  and which reflect the government's desire to encourage the  revival of economic activities, the sum of 60 million American  dollars in cash was made to the banks to cover the needs of the  private sector for imported materials and spare parts.    Within the same context, the special committee received  instructions to grant permits for obtaining foreign financing  for the import requests submitted by the private sector to  obtain products for the sectors considered of priority, such as  the construction sector.    To these measures was added the settlement of the problem of  the loss in exchange rate incurred by some private investors as  a result of the devaluation of the dinar in 1991.    All these emergency measures would pave the way for the  solid  revival of the productive activities of the sector of small and  medium enterprises.    The adopted economic policy forms a sovereign national  choice  which is responsible and which was taken after a lot of thinking  and adapted to the serious challenges of the current situation.  This policy, the essential points of which have already been  presented, has been completed and consolidated, particularly  with tight and realistic plans, to correct the course of  national or local public enterprises whose problems have been  identified. These enterprises will have to adapt their methods  of management to the new situation which is characterized by  special requirements.    In order to allow it to bear fruit, this policy was adopted  as a method of work in reorganizing the national financial  resources. This policy constitutes a rational choice for a  successful move to a market economy since numerous elements of  such an economy have already been put in place. This policy  requires a continuous effort, discipline and a firmness which  does not tolerate shortcomings. In addition to the basic  choices which meet the requirements of the present time, the  reform and the revival of the economy depend on an collective  effort since they will guarantee a return of growth and restore  hopes for a regained prosperity to be shared out among everyone.  God's peace and mercy be upon you. [applause]</p>

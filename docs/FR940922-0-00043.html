			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Refinancing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NCSHA recommended that HUD permit HFAs to restructure high-interest rate loans through Section 223(a)(7) refinancing. HUD-held mortgages are not eligible for Section 223(a)(7) refinancing, and subsidized mortgages generally are not eligible for prepayment. However, as part of the restructuring of the mortgage, HUD will consider modifying mortgages to lower above-market interest rates (and to reduce subsidy payments, as appropriate) prior to mortgage sale. Such reduction would be considered in any pricing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Due Diligence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NCSHA recommended that HUD work with HFAs to disseminate information on mortgages and permit HFAs to perform adequate and timely due diligence. HUD intends to cooperate fully with HFAs in their conduct of needed due diligence on the mortgages in which they are interested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Warranties and Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NCSHA recommended that, among other representations, HUD warrant and represent that purchased loans are secured by projects that are in full compliance with their regulatory agreements and subsidy contracts and that the loans are current in their debt service and escrow and reserve payments. HUD's view is that not all of these representations and warranties may be appropriate for the subperforming mortgages that are the focus of this negotiated sale program. HUD proposes to discuss these representations in conjunction with necessary due diligence and a specific portfolio of mortgages identified for sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Interstate Mortgage Pools <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NCSHA recommended consideration of the formation of interstate mortgage pools, to lower administrative burdens and transaction costs. HUD will consider such pools as long as the results are consistent with the overall objectives of the negotiated sale program, including hands-on servicing by the purchasing agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, NCSHA and IHDA recommended that HUD negotiate the sale of both unsubsidized mortgages with Section 8 contracts and nonperforming unsubsidized mortgages. As noted above, HUD intends to sell partially assisted, unsubsidized mortgages in specialized auctions to investors that will be selected in part on the basis of their commitment to preserving the economically integrated nature of this rental housing. In addition, HUD intends to sell nonperforming unsubsidized mortgages to the highest bidder in competitive auctions that are designed to put local and national bidders on equal footing. Given the high degree of investor interest in HUD's unsubsidized mortgage portfolio and the Department's aim of reducing losses to the FHA insurance fund, the Department cannot justify reserving unsubsidized mortgages for purchase only by State and local agencies. Depending upon the terms of a sale, however, these agencies may participate with other investors in the purchase of these mortgages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> HUD Mortgage Sale Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments focused upon the mechanics of HUD's auction program. Both JBS &amp; Associates, Inc., a national real estate and loan marketing firm, and Ross-Dove Company, Inc., an auctioneering firm, recommended that HUD use open outcry auctions as one method of disposition to sell multifamily mortgages. HUD will consider the use of open outcry auctions for some of its mortgage sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Real Estate Capital Recovery Association (RECRA), a trade association representing both real estate workout specialists and real estate purchasers, recommended that HUD develop a strategy and schedule for disposing of the HUD-held inventory; determine the best disposition strategy for mortgages on a case-by-case basis; and make greater use of the private sector in managing, foreclosing, and selling assets. In addition, RECRA recommended against giving mortgagors two purchase opportunities_i.e., the opportunity to payoff their mortgages and to bid in an auction. RECRA believed both: (1) that HUD's ability to negotiate a payoff would be improved if the mortgagor could not participate in the auction; and (2) that other bidders would not want to bid against the mortgagor who is most knowledgeable about the property. The terms and conditions under which a mortgagor may be permitted to bid on its mortgage are best decided in the light of the particular facts of a mortgage sale, such as whether the mortgages are being sold separately or in pools or are current or delinquent. Accordingly, HUD will announce any such terms and conditions in the mortgage sales announcement and by notice to affected mortgagors. HUD will consider these comments and other factors in setting these terms and conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

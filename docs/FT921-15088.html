			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (11): Mergers transform financial sector - The Netherlands - Trend towards concentration gathers pace among insurers and banks THE two biggest Dutch companies in this year's FT500 (excluding the Anglo-Dutch giants Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever) are newcomers to the annual rankings, yet they are also very much part of the Netherlands corporate establishment. This seeming paradox is easily explained: both entries ' Internationale-Nederlanden Groep (ING), the financial services company, and ABN Amro, the country's biggest bank ' are the product of two recent, huge corporate mergers between four of the Netherlands's best-known institutions, underscoring the rapid and radical transformation of the Dutch financial sector. The birth of ING is a compelling illustration of just how quickly the trend towards concentration has gathered pace among Dutch insurers and banks over the past two years. NMB Postbank, the country's third-largest bank which merged with the Netherlands's biggest insurer Nationale-Nederlanden to produce the new combine in early 1991, was itself the product of a merger just a year earlier. The emergence of ING also testifies to another new trend in the Dutch world of finance ' the development of the 'All-Finanz' concept, in which insurers and banks combine to create a financial services 'supermarket' in the hope of attracting the consumer to a wide range of financial products. Of the Netherlands's three leading insurers, only Aegon has yet to forge a link with a bank. Amev, the third-largest Dutch insurer, earlier took over VSB, the Netherlands's biggest savings bank group, before merging with the Belgian insurer AG to form Fortis, which enters the FT500 for the first time this year in 167th place. Apart from the creation of Fortis, the recent series of big mergers has not involved cross-border link-ups, belying earlier expectations in the Netherlands that there would be a wave of European corporate marriages in the run-up to 1992 and the EC single market. A clear preference for local partners has emerged, at least in the short term, though the long-term rationale behind most of the financial-sector mergers has been a desire to create a springboard for European acquisitions. This tendency to seek out local rather than foreign merger partners is best illustrated by the merger between ABN Bank and Amro Bank, now called ABN Amro. Before entering negotiations with ABN, Amro had been involved in an ill-fated attempt to arrive at a full link-up with its Belgian counterpart Generale de Banque. This proposed bi-national merger foundered on cultural differences and the lack of common European corporate legislation. Still, the Netherlands may yet see a big European link-up, one which would bring substantial changes to future FT500s. In late 1991, KLM, the Netherlands's flag carrier, confirmed that it was engaged in talks on a far-reaching partnership with British Airways. These talks, if successful, could result in the creation of a formidable European mega-carrier. An outright merger is less likely than a construction which would enable both KLM and BA to retain their separate legal identities and stock market listings. If this indeed proves to be the case, KLM and BA will be following in the successful Anglo-Dutch traditions of Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever, ranked first and fifth respectively in the FT500. The Dutch companies in this year's rankings provide a good mini-portrait of the Netherlands's corporate sector. The Netherlands, which was late to industrialise in the 19th century, is strongest in trade, services and agriculture-related activities. Of the 16 purely Dutch companies included this year, the only industrial concerns are Philips, the electronics company; Akzo and DSM, the chemicals companies; KNP, the paper group; and Buhrmann-Tetterode, the packaging and graphic equipment company. In addition to these companies, the financial sector groups and KLM, other entries include two Dutch publishing houses with strong international connections, Elsevier and Wolters Kluwer, as well as Heineken, the brewery group, and Ahold, a food retailer which generates half of its sales along the US east coast. A new entry at number 494, the food company Nutricia, is due in part to the good performance of the food sector on the Amsterdam stock exchange in 1991. The inclusion of two property investment groups, Rodamco and Wereldhave, testifies to the Netherlands's long-standing involvement in overseas investment, an area forced upon it by the severely limited size of its home market. Rodamco, part of the Rotterdam-based Robeco investment group, saw its ranking plummet to 132nd place from 77th in 1990. The sharp drop is a consequence of Rodamco's sudden decision in September 1990 to suspend its previous policy of making daily purchases and disposals of its own shares on the Amsterdam bourse to ensure that its share price was always equivalent to the prevailing net asset value of its property portfolio. By retracting this guarantee, Rodamco effectively transformed itself from an open-end into a close-end fund. Since then, its shares have traded at a discount of 20 per cent or more to net asset value, accounting for the steep decline in Rodamco's market capitalisation between mid-1990 and mid-1991. Although the FT500 offers a capsule view of the corporate sector, its measurement of companies by market capitalisation means it does not include family-owned concerns or those organised along co-operative lines, such as Rabobank, the Netherlands's second-largest bank. Like its bourse-listed rivals, Rabobank was also converted to the concept of 'All-Finanz' when it took full control over Interpolis, a co-operatively-owned insurer, in 1990. Because of the strength of Dutch agriculture in particular, co-operatives ' ranging from dairy organisations to flower and plant auctions ' play a large role in the economy. Their structure, however, makes it difficult for co-operatives to issue shares that can be traded on the stock market. Later this year, OPG, a pharmaceuticals purchasing co-operative owned by more than 2,000 Dutch chemists, hopes to become the first Dutch co-operative to get around this problem and launch a share flotation in Amsterdam. OPG's solution is to establish a trust company and make it an extraordinary member of the co-operative. The trust company, in turn, acquires participation certificates in the co-operative (including a right to future dividends) and uses these as a basis for issuing shares to the public. In the absence of any substantial state holdings in industry left to privatise, this formula, if successful, could potentially become one of the Amsterdam bourse's most important vehicles for attracting new listings in the 1990s.</p>

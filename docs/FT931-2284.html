			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gain and loss for Names - Insurance Market / The Budget and You ALTHOUGH Lloyd's of London has responded enthusiastically to the tax measures for the insurance market's hard-hit Names, the benefits are far from unalloyed. The measures do nothing to help Names already hit by heavy losses. And while Names' advisers said the new reserving arrangements were more generous than they had anticipated, others were less enthusiastic, suggesting that a second measure - affecting the tax treatment of capital appreciation - will affect many Names adversely. The most important measure is a new, more generous tax deductible reserve to meet future losses. This replaces the current special reserve fund, which allows Names to set aside up to Pounds 7,000 each year against higher rate tax. The level of the reserve has been unchanged since 1955. According to the new arrangements for the 1992 underwriting year, a Name will be able to transfer up to 50 per cent of profits to the new reserve each year, provided the value of the funds in the reserve does not exceed 50 per cent of the Name's overall premium income limit. Amounts withdrawn will be made to fund losses or cash calls; withdrawals that are not used to meet losses will attract tax. The change 'should allow Names to plan their business. The current system does not really allow them to 'set aside an extra bit just in case'', said John Reed, insurance tax specialist with Ernst &amp; Young. Robert Saunders, of Smith &amp; Williamson, the private bank, said another feature of the new arrangements - that income and gains arising on assets in the reserve will be free of income tax and capital gains tax - was especially attractive to Names. 'This is generous. It makes a lot of difference to prospects at Lloyd's' But Charles Sturge, co-editor of the Chatset guides which analyse syndicate performance at Lloyd's, said the change did nothing to help Names hit by losses between 1988 and 1991. 'It is no big deal because most Names are likely to have underwriting losses carried forward from previous years, as well as the constant drip of losses from the 1992 year onwards.' Names would have to pay profit commission to their agents on money invested into the new reserves. Sturge is particularly critical of a second change. From 1994, the Inland Revenue will treat capital gains earned from appreciation of Names' premium trust funds (the funds into which premium income is paid) as income rather than capital. Present arrangements are beneficial to Names because capital gains are usually converted into tax losses by indexation allowances. These 'tax losses' can be offset against capital gains a Name might make outside Lloyd's. Sturge says the indexation allowance in an average year is worth about 3 per cent of a Name's premium income limit, or Pounds 30,000 for a Name underwriting Pounds 1m. 'The average Name will be worse off as a result of this Budget.'</p>

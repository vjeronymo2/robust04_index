			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> APARTMENT PROJECT REJECTED  </P> <P> Residents of the Hollywood Hills area were neither fooled nor amused when a  developer took a unique "time machine" approach to building a new apartment  complex overlooking the Hollywood Freeway. Members of the Los Angeles City  Planning Commission were likewise not taken in by Lincoln Properties' bid to  use a 24-year-old permit to build a 200-unit apartment project just off  Mulholland Drive, but the panel appeared to take the unusual approach with more  humor than the angry residents.  </P> <P> "I take my hat off to you. It certainly was creative," Commissioner Theodore  Stein Jr. told Doug Ring, attorney for the developer at last week's Planning  Commission hearing. The "creative" approach that drew outrage from citizens and  snickers from commission members has a long and complicated history. The  developer argued that a loophole in a use permit granted in 1965 for the  28-acre property would allow him to go forth with the expansive construction,  even though the permit was to have expired after six months.  </P> <P> The property is currently zoned to allow the building of no more than three or  four single-family homes, according to Planning Commission staff. Although it  had given varying interpretations of the validity of the old permit in the last  decade, the Los Angeles city attorney's office ruled in May that the permit was  no longer valid.  </P> <P> Unfazed, Lincoln representatives took their chances with a roomful of hostile  residents before the commission.  </P> <P> After the unusual bid was denied, spokesmen for the developer said an appeal  before the City Council is possible.  </P></p>

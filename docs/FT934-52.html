			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / BAe sells Ballast Nedam for Pounds 175m British Aerospace has sold Ballast Nedam, its Dutch construction subsidiary for Fl 500m (Pounds 175m) to a consortium including Internationale Nederlanden Group (ING), the Dutch financial services group, and Hochtief, one of Germany's largest construction companies. The sale ends a six-year relationship between Ballast Nedam and BAe, which acquired the Dutch company for Pounds 47m in 1987 to support its bid to win up to Pounds 30bn of Saudi Arabian defence contracts. The Al Yamamah contracts, which originally envisaged the construction of a new airbase 480km south of Riyadh, have since been scaled down and proposals for the base have been shelved. Saudi Arabia accounts for about a third of Ballast Nedam's annual turnover. Nonetheless the subsidiary was regarded as no longer central to BAe's business. Plans to sell the company for about Fl 500m to Boskalis, the Dutch dredging company, collapsed before Christmas. Hoare Govett, which advised BAe on the sale to ING and Hochtief, said the sale price matched the Pounds 175m book value of Ballast Nedam. The former BAe subsidiary earned net profits of Fl 83.7m in 1992. The company, which also has an aggregates dredging business, generates most of its sales in continental Europe, mostly in the Netherlands, and in Saudi Arabia. Under the terms of the deal, ING will initially hold a 49.99 per cent stake in Ballast Nedam with Hochtief acquiring 48 per cent. The remaining 2.01 per cent stake goes to the Ballast Nedam pension fund. Ballast Nedam said yesterday that it planned to float its shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange early in the new year. ING intends to sell part of its stake to Internationale Nederlanden Verzekeringen, its insurance division before the flotation. In addition it will sell a 3 per cent stake to a new trust company owned by Ballast Nedam's management and staff. Ballast Nedam said yesterday that it had agreed with Hochtief that the German group would not acquire a majority of the shares. An irony is that Ballast Nedam's chairman resigned earlier this year when BAe turned down his plan for a flotation on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. The company said yesterday that it expected 1993 turnover to rise 6 per cent to Fl 2.6bn and repeated its forecast that net profits would total about Fl 80m. It added that its order book had grown this year to Fl 3.3bn, up from Fl 2.3bn in 1992.</p>

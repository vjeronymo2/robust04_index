			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / 'Gift' from Babangida leaves Nigerians guessing: A farewell increase in fuel prices NOT FOR the first time, but possibly for the last, General Ibrahim Babangida yesterday demonstrated his capacity both to surprise Nigerians and keep them guessing. Three days before he is scheduled to step down from power, Nigeria's military leader authorised the introduction of a two-tier price system for petrol that will have the effect of raising the price ten-fold. Is the move designed to trigger protests which might turn to violence and provide a pretext for an extension of the general's strong-arm rule? Or is it his farewell gift to the new government, due to be sworn in tomorrow, tackling an issue a civilian government might prefer to avoid? Whatever his motive, the general has belatedly fulfilled an acid test of any attempt to put Nigeria's lapsed economic reform programme back on track. Few issues are so central to recovery as the need to end the massive subsidy of fuel that saw smuggling to neighbouring states thrive and left many parts of Nigeria short of petrol - at the official rate, that is. Under the new system, fuel at the old price of N0.70 a litre (1.8p) will still be available, but in the coming weeks the number of outlets will be cut and queues will get longer. More and more drivers will choose to pay a higher price - N7.50 - for a premium grade petrol rather than queue, so the theory goes. And in centres where smuggling has created a shortage, motorists are already paying a black market price equivalent to the new rate. Petrol in a country which produces 1.8m barrels of oil a day is not the only commodity in short supply. Banks have been unable to meet a sudden run on deposits because of a shortage of bank notes. Cheques are not being honoured. The Central Bank of Nigeria has rejected calls to print more notes. In the absence of reliable data, Nigerian businessmen believe inflation is running at an annual rate of 70 to 100 per cent, compared with 46 per cent at the end of 1992. 'In the past three weeks this country has ground to a halt because there is just no government,' says the managing director of a big industrial group. 'No one wants to hold stock, manufacturing output has dwindled and people want their money in cash kept under the mattress. Everyone is just waiting to see what will happen on August 27.' Managers have put investment decisions on hold. They say planning meetings are about how to survive through the week. Any business forecasting is impossible. Fears for safety have stopped truck drivers making journeys between north and south Nigeria, adding supply problems to the other woes of Nigerian industry. More disruption is expected as pro-democracy groups have called three days of protest from today. The Nigeria Labour Congress, which groups 41 industrial trade unions, has called its members out on strike if Gen Babangida does not bow out on Friday. More serious is the threat of Nupeng, the oil workers' union, to do the same. 'The soldiers have taken arms and ammunition into refineries in contravention of all international safety regulations,' says Mr Elijah Okougbo, the deputy general secretary of Nupeng. 'They fear we will sabotage the oil industry. But we have no guns. Our only weapon is a civil disobedience campaign to force Babangida to quit the stage.' Gen Babangida yesterday convened a meeting of the ruling military council to discuss the composition of the 'interim government' which he says will succeed him next Friday. But with 48 hours to go before the handover, the general, who annulled the June presidential elections, is understood to be having difficulty convincing a Nigerian of sufficient stature to head the new administration. Several eminent people are believed to have declined the offer. 'No self-respecting Nigerian wants to lead a puppet government,' says a banker in Lagos. 'It will be a government of nonentities, and the economy will continue to fall to pieces.' The pro-democracy movement has been fragmented and leaderless since Chief Moshood Abiola, the presidential candidate robbed of his victory, fled the country three weeks ago. Labour protests are unlikely to have much impact outside Lagos, although the disruption in the oil industry could be serious if Nupeng carries out its threatened strikes. Businessmen fear that the new interim government will lack the legitimacy and authority to solve Nigeria's economic problems. The departing transitional civilian administration, named by Gen Babangida six months ago to put Nigeria's faltering economic reform programme back on track, has wound up in dismal failure. The country's budget deficit is thought to have reached N22bn (Pounds 582m) in the first quarter of 1993 - nearing in four months its deficit target for the year. Chief Ernest Shonekan's administration also failed to reach a debt-rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club of creditor nations, who are owed Dollars 16.5bn of Nigeria's Dollars 30bn foreign debt. Whatever government takes over will inherit an economic crisis; but if the price rise yesterday is accepted by Nigerians, it will have one less headache to bear.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yevgeniy Tkachenko] </F>   [Text] Chelyabinsk, 24 Jun -- The energy crisis in the  South Urals is assuming a catastrophic scale. Chelyabinsk  Oblast's second largest power station, the Yuzhnouralskaya GRES  [South Urals Rayon power station], has been shut down owing to  the suspension of gas supplies. Accordingly, the Uraltrak  joint-stock company, the Chelyabinsk automatic engineering  works, and a whole series of other large enterprises that have  failed to pay their debts to the power engineers have been  completely disconnected from the supply of electrical energy.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by Viktor Makhortov,  chief engineer at Chelyabenergo [Chelyabinsk energy  directorate], the debt is currently in excess of 400 billion  rubles [R] and has grown by R50 billion in the past six months  alone. At the same time, the power workers owe a total of R43  billion to Uraltrasgaz [Urals gas line]. The association's  chief engineer regards the situation as deadlocked and may cause  the South Urals economy to collapse. Indeed, if one imagines  the electric furnaces at the huge iron-and-steel plants here  being de-energized or -- God forbid -- the power supply to the  nuclear complex being suspended, all this threatens far greater  consequences than just the closure or shutdown of an engineering  plant.</p>

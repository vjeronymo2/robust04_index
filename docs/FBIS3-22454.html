			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Roger Highfield, science editor: "Sellafield: </F> Who Is Hit If the Worst Happens?"]    [Text] It hasn't happened yet. But should an accident occur  at Sellafield, the nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria, the  path of a radioactive cloud across Britain can be plotted  instantly.    The hypothetical "footprint" of pollution caused by a leak  and borne on prevailing winds can now be predicted using a  computer model. And a couple of days can make all the difference  between radioactive fall-out spreading over Scandinavia, or  falling in Britain's back yard.    A small-scale version can also reveal how the location and  height of a smokestack at a chemical plant affects local  pollution. "We could predict five days ahead when there will be  a problem with a factory," said Robert Chadwick, environmental  product manager at the Meteorological Office, which has  developed the model.    The Met Office hopes to use the model, which can incorporate  weather forecasts, as a tool to predict air quality, such as the  risk of ozone or nitrogen dioxide pollution under certain  weather conditions.    When the Met Office unveils its new generation of computer  models next month, Whitehall, local councils, pressure groups  and environmentalists are expected to show interest in the  predictions, which can be produced for as little as &pound;250.    The Government will rely on the computer model to highlight  areas at risk from acid rain across the globe, and to predict  the fall-out in the event of a catastrophic nuclear accident.    The Met Office's Nuclear Accident Response Model has shown,  for instance, that the radioactive plume released by a nuclear  accident is diluted more during a hot day in summer than a cold  night in winter. The distance the plume of radioactivity travels  can depend on the presence of a faster, mobile, non-turbulent  layer of air above the explosion. At night, the cool still air  can make this layer a few metres thick, while it could be as  much as a mile on a summer afternoon, enabling the plume to  travel a long way.    The model was developed in the wake of the world's worst  nuclear accident at Chernobyl, in 1986, when it became clear  that there was a need for a way to assess the risks to the  public created by an airborne plume of radioactivity. A  smattering of dots moving across a computer screen can aid  crisis management by showing how radioactivity spreads, or the  effect of smoke sent up by a major fire or volcano.    "Just select your accident and we can forecast the effects,"  said Roy Maryon, one of its developers.    In the case of Chernobyl, it took a few days before the  world  was aware of the accident. Now "hindcasts" based on weather  patterns can track the pollution over five days from the moment  of release.    The computer was put through its paces by Noel Nelson and  Karl Kitchen, who helped to develop the model. They simulated a  nuclear accident at Sellafield -- site of the western world's  worst leak, in 1957, when it was known as Windscale.    They chose two different days last month to stage a  hypothetical nuclear accident, and after the computer had  processed the relevant weather data it plotted the gradual  spread of radioactive particles across a map. Had the accident  occurred on January 15, within three days north-easterly winds  would have wafted the pollution by turns across southern  Ireland, Wales, the West Midlands, the south coast as far east  as Brighton, then Devon, Cornwall and the coasts of northern  France.    By January 18, the winds had turned towards the east. "We  see  a plume passing across the country to the North Sea," Mr. Nelson  said. Had this been the date when a leak began, only the  north-east coast of Britain would have received fall-out, while  Scandinavia would have felt the effects 48 hours later.    Other computer plots show how radioactivity would have been  washed out of the atmosphere by rain, creating distinct areas  where fall-out would concentrate. Within 36 hours of the January  15 emission, the worst hotspots would have been in northern  France, with most of Wales and the West Midlands almost as badly  hit.    Mr. Chadwick said he could have done with such a warning in  1986, when he was rained on as Chernobyl's plume passed overhead.    The Met Office's computer model contains details of nuclear  plants across the planet. It is also linked to a national  radiation monitoring network, called Rimnet, so that its  predictions can be checked and refined. A major European  experiment, Etex, will be conducted this year to see how well 20  such computer models predict the movement of an inert tracer gas  released from Brittany.    The model is already part of the Department of the  Environment's emergency plan for nuclear accidents.</p>

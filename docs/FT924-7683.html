			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Alternative to bank deposits - A look at a savings bond THE CUT in base rates hits those with savings, as banks and building societies reduce the rates they pay on deposits. Bristol &amp; West building society, for example, yesterday cut rates on its Balmoral postal account by 0.55 of a percentage point. But higher-rate taxpayers who want to keep their money on deposit can consider an alternative which offers the same security as the building societies but often at higher rates than those offered directly to savers. Providence Capitol's building society bond, launched in July, is an insurance bond, linked to units in its building society fund, which invests in the deposits of the top ten building societies chosen by asset size. Alan Parsonson, broker operations director at Providence said: 'The objective of the fund is to offer investors a return which is comparable with rates on 90-day accounts on more than Pounds 10,000.' There is no initial charge or penalty on surrender. Brokers are paid 1 per cent commission but the rates quoted are net of charges for customers. Access is the same as with a postal account. Rates are fixed at the end of the month for the following month. However, new investors are given a lower rate for their first month. Withdrawals are penalty free and operate on the same time schedule as a postal account. However, rates for November will not seem too exciting given the recent falls in base rates. The bond was launched in July with a rate of 8.3 per cent net. Interest on a minimum of Pounds 10,000 for November is now an annualised 6.75 per cent net with interest paid annually (there is a monthly income option at a lower rate of 6.55 per cent net). Those investing for the first time will get 6 per cent net. There are still a few fixed rates which are higher. Chelsea building society, for example, is paying 8.06 per cent net on Pounds 10,000 - a rate which is held to February 1 next year. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is paying 7.2 per cent net on a similar amount, fixed until January 1 1993. The rate on Pounds 10,000 with Bristol &amp; West's Balmoral postal account is now 6.83 per cent net. The bond is unsuitable for non-taxpayers because the rates are paid net and the tax deducted at source cannot be reclaimed. Its real value is to higher rate taxpayers who can use it to defer payment of tax. This is useful for those who expect to fall into the 25 per cent income tax bracket, perhaps as a result of impending retirement. James Higgins, of advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says the bond has particular merit for those people who are tilted into the higher rate tax bracket by virtue of their building society savings. Tax flexibility derives from the bond being treated as a single premium investment bond for tax purposes. It benefits from a system of taxation known as top-slicing. Top slicing allows the investor to divide the gain made on the bond by the number of years for which he has held it. This average gain is then added to his taxable income in the year of encashment, and only if that takes him into the higher rate tax band is the top rate payable. In addition, the investor can take 5 per cent of the initial investment every year as income without paying tax on this amount immediately. When the investor comes to cash the bond, these withdrawals are added to any additional gains and are used to calculate the tax liability, with top slicing relief available. Clearly, care has to be taken about the timing of encashment. Those approaching retirement, who are eligible for age allowances, must make sure that these are not adversely affected when the bond is cashed in. Savers are protected by the Policyholder Protection Act which pays up to 90 per cent of the amount guaranteed under the policy. Those interested in the bond can get further details from an independent financial adviser.</p>

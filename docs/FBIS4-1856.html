			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station reporter Liao Xuefeng: "Based on </F> Sincerity and Keeping the Words"; from the "News and Current  Events" program]    [Text] The fourth round of working-level talks between the  Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and  the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF], which ended in Beijing  recently, did not produce the expected results. In this  connection, our station reporter Liao Xuefeng has written the  following commentary: "Based on Sincerity and Keeping the Words."    The latest round of talks between the two organizations  failed to make progress largely because prior to the talks, the  Taiwan side had partially reneged on the common understanding  reached between officials of the two organizations in Beijing  last February. During the talks, SEF further raised questions  which expanded or narrowed (?the scope of understanding). This  is indeed regrettable.    As is known, the three topics, including repatriation of  those who have entered the areas of the other side in violation  of relevant regulations and other relevant issues, discussed at  the latest round of working-level talks between the two  organization are issues of deep concern to the masses on the two  sides of the strait. Both the mainland's ARATS and Taiwan's SEF  agree that these issues, which have inconvenienced the two sides  for a long time, should be settled as soon as possible. For  this reason, the two sides should respect and trust each other  and hold talks on an equal footing so as to reach an early  settlement, eliminate the inconvenience, and enhance  cross-strait friendship. If these issues remain unsolved for a  long time, they will affect the vital interests of the people on  both sides of the strait, as well as cross-strait relations.  This is absolutely not a wise man's action. To achieve positive  results from talks, the two sides should first agree on two  major points: first, it is necessary to separate political from  routine issues so as to foster (?consensus); and second, it is  necessary to value the common understanding and strictly carry  out the promises reached during the previous rounds of talks.    It is a fact that currently the two sides of the strait  practice different social systems and follow different political  ideologies. However, this should not become an obstacle to the  settlement of routine issues. If one side insists on mixing  political ideologies with routine issues, even a simple matter  can become complicated and can encounter mounting difficulties  in the process of settlement. (?Therefore), the willingness to  separate political ideologies from routine matters has become  the yardstick for measuring one's sincerity of settling issues.    Moreover, it was a very remarkable feat that the two sides  of  the strait, which had been separated, got together to discuss  common problems and reached rare understanding on some aspects.  We should cherish the fruitful results of talks by respecting  each other. As the saying goes, a gentleman attaches great  importance to promises and keeps his word. ARATS-SEF talks are  high-level contacts and negotiations between the two sides'  nongovernmental organizations. They have conducted the  negotiations in a serious manner and have reached an earnest  common understanding. In a sense, the common understanding is a  kind of promise that must be kept by both sides. For this  reason, one should not make accusation as one pleases and should  not renege on the understanding rashly.    (?In fact), during the final-day discussion between the two  organizations, Mr. Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu], SEF deputy secretary  general, suggested that the next round of working-level talks be  arranged in Taibei [Taipei] as soon as possible, thereby showing  in a certain way the Taiwan side's sincerity and determination  to settle problems. We express our appreciation toward his  suggestion. Meanwhile, we hope that the next round of  working-level talks will be based on the common understanding  reached between officials of the two organizations in Beijing  last February; will be conducted in the spirit of avoiding  political issues, discussing matters as they stand, solving  first easy and then difficult issues, and seeking common ground  while reserving differences; and will see that promises are kept  with sincerity to achieve fruitful results and that no side  issues crop up to complicate matters.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DEATH ENDS MILLIONAIRE'S SEARCH FOR KIDNAPED WIFE  </P> <P> Robert Hearin paid almost $1 million trying to pay ransom for his wife of 50  years, but her kidnapers were unyielding and the 73-year-old multimillionaire  died without seeing her again.  </P> <P> Hearin's heart gave out in November, two years after Annie Laurie Hearin was  taken from their Mississippi home.  </P> <P> Hearin, one of the most powerful and wealthiest men in Mississippi, paid  $931,000 in ransom, but his wife was never freed and authorities believe she is  dead.  </P> <P> "My one regret is I couldn't give him back his wife," FBI agent Wayne R. Taylor  said. "We continue to do everything we can that might lead to her."  </P> <P> The Hearins met as students at the University of Alabama and were married in  1940. They had two children, Robert Hearin Jr., a lawyer in New Orleans, and  Laurie McRee of Jackson.  </P> <P> "We've had a terrible loss. I think, all along, there has been a real mix of  sadness and anger," said the son.  </P> <P> Hearin's worth was estimated at $200 million. He controlled Mississippi's  largest gas distribution company, Mississippi Valley Gas Co., its  second-largest bank, Trustmark National Bank, and its second-largest insurance  company, Lamar Life Corp.  </P> <P> Hearin avoided the news media after his wife was kidnaped, but did appear on  the TV show "Unsolved Mysteries." He never gave up hope of finding his wife,  although authorities believe she died long ago. Last year, he moved out of the  brick house they had shared.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty sure she was dead within the first month. I am absolutely sure she  is dead," said Dr. Rodrigo Galvez, a Jackson psychiatrist and pathologist who  analyzed the ransom note.  </P> <P> Mrs. Hearin, who was 72 when she was kidnaped, suffered from ileitis, a chronic  intestinal disease that can cause death in days without daily medication.  </P> <P> About three weeks after she was kidnaped, her husband received a letter in her  handwriting. It urged him to pay off 12 disgruntled investors who were named in  a rambling letter left in the house the day she disappeared.  </P> <P> FBI officials said that Hearin paid a total of $931,000 to investors in a  school picture company of which he was the largest shareholder. Among them was  Newton Alfred Winn, a St. Petersburg, Fla., lawyer.  </P> <P> Winn was sentenced in February to 19 years in prison for conspiracy to kidnap,  mailing a threatening communication and lying to a federal grand jury. No one  was ever charged with the actual kidnaping.  </P> <P> The younger Hearin said that he and his sister still hope their mother will  return, but "the passage of time leads one not to be optimistic."  </P></p>

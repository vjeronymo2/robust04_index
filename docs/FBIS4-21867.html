			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Unidentified men diverted a  Sudanese airliner coming from Khartoum and forced its captain to  proceed to the Luxor airport, where the airliner has landed.    The Boeing 737 airliner with 93 passengers and six crew  members on board took off from Khartoum en route for  al-Danaqilah in south Sudan. The hijacker forced the captain to  fly to Egypt. Defense Minister Field Marshal Husayn Tantawi  gave permission to the airliner to land at the Luxor airport.  The hijacker is a Sudanese national and is asking for political  asylum in Egypt.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Italians cool on bourse incentives ITALY'S stock brokers yesterday reacted with disappointment to the cabinet's plan, announced on Thursday, to amend the country's complex capital gains tax and introduce new measures to encourage share buying and boost the bourse. The steps, which fall short of suspending the tax as first thought, offer a variety of incentives for individuals to buy shares, particularly of new issues. The draft law, expected to be passed next month after comment from stock brokers, should help to buoy the flagging stock market and pave the way for privatisation. However, Italian equities fell to a new low for the year yesterday on the back of thin trading and adverse reaction to the decision by Moody's, the US rating agency, to downgrade Italy's foreign debt. The Comit equity index fell by 1.15 per cent to 393.70, its lowest since the mid-1980s. On the foreign exchanges, the lira slipped further against the D-Mark, closing at 760.02, down from 759.175 on Thursday. The Bank of Italy did not intervene in spite of the fall, partly because trading was very quiet before today's Assumption Day holiday in Italy. Mr Giovanni Goria, the finance minister, reacted angrily to the Moody's decision, which he described as 'unfounded'. 'This is a wrong judgment,' he said. Meanwhile, officials at the Bank of Italy were reported as dismissing the downgrading as being 'out of date' in view of the new government's efforts to cut the huge budget deficit. In a television interview, Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said the step was 'nothing tragic. It will increase the Italian government's determination to continue on the road it has chosen.' Ministers also stressed the stock market's ills could not be attributed wholly to the government. According to Mr Goria, 'the problems of the stock market have 1,000 motives', taxation being only one element. Nevertheless, ministers are hoping the incentives and tax breaks they have unveiled will stimulate the market once brokers digest their implications.</p>

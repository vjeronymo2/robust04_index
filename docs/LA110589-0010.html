			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEVE GARVEY  </P> <P> Steve Garvey was my favorite Dodger, and I tried to keep an open mind in  regards to his "problems" -- until I read his "side of the story." I can only  tell you, if he was my husband or my friend or my associate, I would become  hysterical and need counseling just being around this "pillar of perfection."  All I can say to Cyndy Garvey is, I wish you and your daughters all the best.  </P> <P> TERESA BIRD, Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / People: Swapping chemicals for food David Fyfe, managing director of a division of specialty chemicals group Hickson International, is resigning to join the board, as chief executive designate, of a food company. An announcement is expected this week. Fyfe had been managing director at MTM but left at the end of 1990 after disagreements with the then chairman Richard Lines. MTM, most of which has just been sold to BTP, has been under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office concerning a shortfall in the 1991 profits. Dennis Kerrison, chief executive of Hickson where management turnover has been considerable in recent years, says there has been 'no falling out', adding that 'for someone with his temperament, (the opportunity to be at the top of a company again) was an offer he could not refuse. There was really no chance of him coming on the main board here and he did have a bit of a problem adapting.' The only executive directors on Hickson's main board are Kerrison and the finance director Michael Rowley. 'We have a number of strong non-executive directors, including from the chemical sector. Also our chairman (Sir Gordon Jones) is of the very firm opinion that people have to earn a place on the board.' Kerrison said he was looking internally and externally for a replacement but that he himself would take charge of the division in the meantime. 'We are in no rush' he added explaining that it was important to get the right person, given fine chemicals, the division Fyfe ran, contributed about half of group profits. Fyfe, who has just turned 50, was on a trade delegation to Japan last Friday and hence unavailable for comment, but Kerrison said he expected him to depart form Hickson 'within a week or so.'</p>

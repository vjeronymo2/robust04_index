			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OGILVY GROUP AGREES TO DEAL WITH WPP FOR $864 MILLION  </P> <P> Less than two years after it rocked the ad world with a hostile takeover of the  J. Walter Thompson ad agency, the British marketing firm WPP Group on Monday  did it again by agreeing to acquire the Ogilvy Group for $864 million.  </P> <P> "This combination will create the finest advertising and marketing services  group in the world," said Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, in a  statement released just before midnight.  </P> <P> Top Ogilvy executives will remain with the merged agency, including Kenneth  Roman, who retains the title of chairman at Ogilvy and gains the title of vice  chairman of WPP.  </P> <P> "While we would have preferred to remain independent," Roman said in a  statement, "we have become convinced a combination with WPP represented the  most attractive course for the future."  </P> <P> David Ogilvy, the 77-year-old founder of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, will become  chairman of WPP.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Run Autonomously  </P> <P> The acquisition places under one corporate umbrella two of the best-known and  most established names in advertising -- Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J. Walter  Thompson. Executives say, however, the two agencies will be run autonomously.  </P> <P> The deal creates the world's largest advertising and communications company --  topping that of rival British advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. An  expanded WPP would post annual revenue exceeding $2 billion, while Saatchi  &amp; Saatchi would rank second with revenue of about $1.6 billion, analysts  say. WPP's annual billings will now exceed $13.5 billion. Well over half of the  Fortune 500 companies will become WPP clients.  </P> <P> The deal is subject to approval of WPP shareholders and the tender of at least  two-thirds of Ogilvy's outstanding shares. Ogilvy Group's annual meeting is  scheduled today in New York. WPP has scheduled a special shareholder meeting  for June 14.  </P> <P> WPP and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi now find themselves locked in a fierce rivalry  for global pre-eminence not only in advertising, but also in media-buying  wallop. The holding company whose advertising agencies have the most  media-buying power often commands the best prices in purchasing advertising  time on television and space in newspapers and magazines.  </P> <P> Although news of the anticipated agreement led to heavy over-the-counter  trading of Ogilvy stock on Monday, Ogilvy Group closed unchanged from Friday's  close at $53.25 a share.  </P> <P> Although there has been speculation for nearly six months that Sorrell planned  to acquire Ogilvy, his first bid of $45 per share was not made public until May  1. Ogilvy executives responded by saying they intended to keep the agency  independent. One week later, however, Sorrell raised his bid to $50 per share.  The agency will be sold for $54 a share.  </P> <P> For the 44-year-old advertising executive, the purchase of Ogilvy not only  makes for a sweet victory, but perhaps even sweeter revenge, Sorrell-watchers  say.  </P> <P> Sorrell was formerly the chief financial officer at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi who  masterminded many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. He left Saatchi in 1986 for  reasons never made public. Since then, some analysts say almost all of  Sorrell's efforts have been directed toward creating an empire that can  out-muscle -- if not out-hustle -- Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.  </P> <P> "What you've got here are guys who are really portfolio managers," said Greg M.  Ostroff, vice president of research at the New York investment firm Goldman  Sachs &amp; Co. "From that aspect, Sorrell would have some of the finest assets  in the business."  </P> <P> Executives from WPP and Ogilvy had essentially agreed on the price tag last  week, but spent the weekend and most of Monday ironing out the responsibilities  of key Ogilvy executives.  </P> <P> David Ogilvy, who has not attended an Ogilvy annual meeting for several years,  reportedly flew to New York late last week to attend this one. He was  unavailable for comment on Monday.  </P> <P> Beyond the prestigious Ogilvy name, WPP will inherit most of Ogilvy's client  roster. When WPP purchased J. Walter Thompson, it picked up such key clients as  Ford Motor Co. and Eastman-Kodak. Now, with the Ogilvy purchase, it also adds  such select names as American Express and AT&amp;T.  </P> <P> Ogilvy's Los Angeles office -- regarded as one of Ogilvy's most profitable --  is expected to at least initially escape unscathed from the acquisition.  </P> <P> "About the only thing that's different is we'll have a different owner," said  Gerald D. McGee, executive vice president and managing director of Ogilvy's Los  Angeles office, which employs 220. "This is a financial transaction only. It  will not change our culture."  </P> <P> But Mattel Toys, which accounts for about one-quarter of the business in  Ogilvy's West Coast office, has reacted coolly to the WPP bid. Mattel remained  undecided Monday whether it will review its business with Ogilvy. Glenn  Bozarth, director of public relations at Hawthorne-based Mattel, said: "It's  still up in the air."  </P> <P> Investment analysts and top industry executives look with mixed reviews on the  prospect of WPP buying Ogilvy.  </P> <P> "I think it's a shame," said John S. Bowen, chairman and chief executive of the  privately held New York ad firm, D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles. "This  business of buying and selling ad agencies has gone too far. Any agency that is  publicly held is subject to being taken over by anyone who wants to take it  over."  </P> <P> Not that Sorrell doesn't have his supporters on Wall Street. "He's talented,  charming and an extremely good businessman," said Andrew Wallach, a vice  president at the New York investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert. "He's been  badly portrayed by the press as an ogre."  </P> <P> Under Sorrell, Wallach said, "you'll see an aggressive attempt to improve the  management of the company and cut costs without hurting the creative product."  He said Sorrell will probably cut costs by closing some of Ogilvy's less  profitable foreign offices. WPP will also save Ogilvy money by purchasing media  time at larger discounts -- now that WPP is nearly twice the size.  </P> <P> "Sorrell does not intend to destroy the Ogilvy culture," said Wallach. "That is  the last thing he wants to do."  </P></p>

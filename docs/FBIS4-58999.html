			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, PETRA--Jordan yesterday welcomed the French  Government's decision to suspend its participation in the naval  inspection operations in al-'Aqabah Port.    This came in a statement by the Talal Sat'an al-Hasan,  minister of state for foreign affairs, in answer to a question  by the Jordanian News Agency. He said this decision was  announced in a statement by the French Foreign Ministry's  spokesman on Wednesday [4 May] on France's decision to halt its  participation in naval inspection operations in al-'Aqabah Port.    Al-Hasan said the decision reflects France's understanding  of  Jordan's positive and constructive role in the region and the  fairness of its request to reconsider the mechanism for  implementing the embargo, which inflicted major losses on the  Jordanian economy. The decision, he said, also reflect France's  compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy and  its conviction that Jordan is fulfilling all of its commitments  and responsibilities toward the implementation of these  resolutions.    Al-Hasan also praised the distinguished relations that are  based on understanding and mutual respect between Jordan and  France and the ties of close friendship between His Majesty King  Husayn and His Excellency President Francois Mitterrand.</p>

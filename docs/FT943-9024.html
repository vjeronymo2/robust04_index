			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK brewing Pubs without televisions were a bit quiet in July as drinkers stayed in to watch the World Cup. But most of Britain's brewers are now feeling better about life. Summer trading generally seems to have been reasonable, helped by the steamy weather. There are also signs that the wholesale price war is abating, at least when it comes to supplying smaller pub operators. However, the big independent pub chains, such as Greenalls and Boddingtons, are thought still to be getting very attractive terms and given the overcapacity in the industry it is likely that the national brewers will remain under pressure. Against that background it is somewhat surprising that regional brewers and pub operators have tended to underperform their national counterparts over the last couple of months. In part that may merely reflect the fact that large stocks have led the stock market rally. The shares of several of the second division companies may also have suffered from the sale of Whitbread's stakes in March. Either way the smaller fry look relatively cheap. Yet the pub operators appear well-placed as consumer spending recovers while brewers like Marston are showing there is good growth to be had for those with strong brands. Share prices also make little allowance for industry restructuring. Other regionals must be considering pulling out of brewing while Greenalls' ambitions have not been satisfied by last year's acquisition of Devenish.</p>

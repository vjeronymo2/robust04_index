			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Other Safety Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA requests comments on the following additional issues related to the safe performance of CNG containers. What are the safety implications of fast-filling CNG containers during refueling, which can result in pressure levels of 125 percent of service pressure due to the heat of pressurization? Do the initial permeation rates of CNG containers constructed of nonmetallic liners remain constant over the life of the container? What are the consequences of gas permeation from vehicles fueled by multiple CNG containers? What are the degradation characteristics of vinyl esters and thermoplastic resins for composite material? Should containers and container liners have longitudinal or circumferential welds? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Leadtime <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is proposing to make the requirements in this notice effective one year after publication of the final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The agency believes this would be a reasonable time period for container manufacturers to test their containers and certify compliance to the additional tests being proposed in this notice. The agency anticipates that container manufacturers would readily be able to certify compliance to the proposed requirements. This is because container manufacturers already certify compliance with NGV2, which is essentially consistent with the proposed requirements. The one exception is the proposed salt spray test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency requests comments about the leadtime. Does one year provide sufficient time for manufacturers to certify compliance to the proposed requirements? Would the addition of the proposed salt spray test require a longer leadtime than one year? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the meantime, prior to the standard's effective date, the industry is free to advertise containers as meeting the CNG equipment standard that will take effect in one year. Manufacturers have sought to achieve early compliance with other agency requirements <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  such as those relating to dynamic side impact protection and air bags. The agency encourages manufacturers to seek, to the extent feasible, to manufacture their CNG containers to meet these new requirements before the date the standard takes effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> However, the agency emphasizes that a manufacturer may not certify a container as meeting the equipment standard until the standard goes into effect. Under the statte, a certification is a statement that a vehicle or item of equipment meets all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Standards that are then in effect. Therefore, until a standard is effective, manufacturers may not certify compliance with it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained earlier, NHTSA anticipates that the number of CNG fuel vehicles will increase greatly in the near future, in light of directives by the Clinton Administration and legislation by Congress to develop vehicles powered by cleaner burning fuels. This notice will enhance the safety of this growing population of vehicles, since CNG containers will be required to comply with the tests in Standard No. 304. The necessity for certifying compliance with the Federal requirements will provide added assurance that the containers are safe. The benefits of the proposal to issue additional requirements applicable to CNG containers are to provide assurances of the structural integrity of the CNG containers. The agency is adding one test not currently part of NGV2 (the salt spray test) to simulate environmental roadway conditions. In addition, by helping to minimize any safety concerns associated with CNG vehicles, this rule should result in positive environmental impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  L. Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For six of the seven tests proposed, there would be no additional costs of upgrading current containers to comply with the proposed requirements, since CNG container manufacturers already comply with NGV2. Similarly, there would be no additional compliance test costs for these six tests, since the manufacturers already meet the NGV2 tests. Testing and container costs for these six tests are estimated to range from $13,800 to $30,650 per container size and type. The agency does not know whether existing containers can meet the proposed salt spray test, and what costs might be incurred if the containers do not meet the proposed test. The agency estimates that the testing and container cost for the salt spray test to range from $1,220 to $4,130. Total testing and container cost for the proposal are $15,020 to $34,780. The agency has made the criteria in some of the tests more objective than NGV2 by changing unacceptably subjective and broad terms to more measurable and therefore more objective criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

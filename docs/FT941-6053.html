			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Court clears Europa merger The proposed three-way merger involving Europa Minerals, a small UK-quoted finance house, and two Australian companies with which it already has close links - Burmine and Austmin Gold - looked virtually certain to go ahead last night. The Western Australian Supreme Court yesterday ruled in Burmine's favour and against Mount Edon, another Australian company which has made a hostile bid for Burmine and is attempting to block the three-way merger. Burmine hopes to implement this by making a recommended Pounds 15m offer for Europa and a separate agreed bid for Austmin. Mount Edon already owns 22.6 per cent of Burmine and previously had a 19.9 per cent shareholding in Europa. Mount Edon sold the Europa stake last week in the hope that it would therefore be able to vote at the Burmine meeting called to approve the mergers. However, the court yesterday upheld the decision of the independent scrutineers to disregard the Mount Edon votes.</p>

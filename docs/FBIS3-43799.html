			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There is a new political deal in Zaire: The head of  the Zairean state, President Mobutu, announced yesterday the  resignation of the government of Faustin Birindwa, who will be  responsible for current matters until the appointment of a new  prime minister. The latter will have to be appointed within the  next two weeks by the High Council of the Republic, which will  also include President Mobutu's political allies.    Two candidates will stand, Etienne Tshisekedi and Mulumba  Lukoji. Lukoji has already held this post; he inaugurated the  national conference two years ago. He is the candidate of the  parties close to the Presidency, whereas Etienne Tshisekedi  remains the candidate of the opposition. On the opposition's  side, the president's speech has provoked anger and outrage.  For the Christian Democrat PDCS [Democratic and Social  Christian Party], this is merely a constitutional coup. There  has been another reaction, that of the UDPS [Union for Democracy  and Social Progress], Etienne Tshisekedi's party, which is the  hard core of the Radical Sacred Union of the opposition. Herve  de Guelinck spoke to Justine Kasavubu:    [Begin recording] [Kasavubu] It is an extra obstacle. You  may remember that Mobutu said a few days ago that he agreed to a  prime minister from the opposition. That has now been shown to  be a lie. He has given Mulumba Lokoji a leg-up, which means  that after Mulumba Lokoji, we will still have Mungul Diaka  [presidium chairman of Alliance of Independent Forces for  Integral Change] and Nguza Karl-I-Bond. This is the Mobutist  carousel.    [Guelinck] Yet it will be up to the transitional parliament  to appoint the candidate, won't it?    [Kasavubu] But the transitional parliament never said that  Mr. Tshisekedi was out of bounds, so I think that the  counsellors of the Republic will be keen to set Mr. Tshisekedi  back to work [as heard] and to tell Mobutu once and for all that  the comedy is over.</p>

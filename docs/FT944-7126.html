			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Founders reject Pounds 650m sale of National Car Parks group The Pounds 650m sale of the company that owns National Car Parks collapsed yesterday after its largest shareholders would not accept the final deal. The sale, to Prudential Venture Managers and a consortium of venture capital backers, would have been the largest leveraged buy-out in the UK this year. Negotiations had dragged on for more than eight months. It is understood that Sir Donald Gosling and Mr Ronald Hobson - the founders and 72 per cent shareholders of National Parking Corporation (NPC) - valued the company at almost Pounds 50m more than PruVen was ready to pay. PruVen, part of the Prudential insurance group, is believed to have offered about Pounds 550m cash, with a further Pounds 100m if NPC met performance targets. Both sides emphasised that the parting was amicable. PruVen remains NPC's second-largest institutional shareholder. 'Nothing in the due diligence (the report into the company's finances) suggested that the company was anything other than what we had thought it was,' said Mr Martin Clarke, a director at PruVen. 'We were paying a full price, they wanted a slightly fuller price, and we couldn't make the two meet.' PruVen's consortium included Charterhouse Development Capital, Cinven, Electra, Montagu Private Equity, NatWest Ventures and Royal Bank Development Capital. NPC's shares , which are traded on a matched bargain basis, fell 100p yesterday to 450p. They reached 630p earlier this year following expectations that a deal could be worth up to Pounds 1bn. NPC's two key operating companies are National Car Parks and Green Flag, which owns National Breakdown Recovery and Home Emergency Service. The group published net assets of Pounds 242m as at March 1994, but the car parks are valued at cost and analysts put the asset value closer to Pounds 400m. NPC made a Pounds 50.5m pre-tax profit last year. Sir Donald and Mr Hobson, the joint chairmen, founded the company in 1949, buying bomb sites and using them as temporary car parks. It now runs 600. PruVen planned to bring in Mr Bob McKenzie, former BET finance director, as a new chief executive, but would have left the remaining management structure intact. The deal was to have been only 50 per cent funded by debt, an unusually low level for a venture capital buy-out. Sir Donald and Mr Hobson will continue to manage the group, but it is expected that they will search for an alternative buyer at a later stage.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report]    As the traditional divide between right and left becomes  less  important, a new rift based on different attitudes toward trade  and protectionism has split France into two camps, commentator  Alain Duhamel contends in the 11 December LE POINT. One camp  has reacted to the economic crisis by demanding protection from  foreign competition. The other believes in opening up new  markets for France and in placing the country in a "forced  march" to modernization. This split first emerged during the  campaign to ratify the Maastricht Treaty and was deepened during  the GATT negotiations, Duhamel continues. Politically, the  first group is made up of communists, FN [Front National]  sympathizers, ecologists, and followers of National Assembly  President Philippe Seguin. According to Duhamel, members of  this group feel nostalgic for a France of "disparate but always  protective traditions" and support protectionist devices such as  "safeguard clauses, Community preference, and national  exceptions." This group also tends to "curse American  hegemonism...mistrust German ambition...and be suspicious of the  selfishness of the powerful and of treason by the elites,"  Duhamel writes. The second group is characterized by Duhamel as  "determined, dynamic, and resolutely positive." Its members  come primarily from the white-collar class, see themselves as  reformists, and nurse fewer suspicions about the Maastricht  Treaty and the GATT.</p>

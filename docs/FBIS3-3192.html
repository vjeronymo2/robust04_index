Personnel from the State Security  Ministry, the National People's Congress Security Department,  and the Family Dependents Commission keep a 24-hour watch in  front of their house, and all who come to see them will be  questioned and warned. This serious interference in her normal  life has caused Ding Zilin to have a heart attack. Even when  she went to the hospital for treatment, she was "accompanied" by  some persons.    Several of her students who are studying in the United  States  have called this newspaper or faxed messages to us saying they  were concerned about Ding Zilin's condition. At the same time,  the Humanitarian Rescue Work Committee of the Autonomous  Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in America has urged  the mainland authorities to lift the unlawful house arrest of  Ding Zilin and her spouse immediately, on the grounds of  humanitarianism, and to provide a good medical environment and  treatment conditions for Ding Zilin.</p>

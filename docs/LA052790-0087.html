			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE AMERICAN CIRCUS AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY BY JOHN CULHANE  (HENRY HOLT: $39.95; 504 PP.)  </P> <P> Before television, amusement parks, country fairs, public zoos and  entertainment zones, there was the circus. In the United States, ever since  1785 when in Philadelphia a Thomas Pool presented "Feats of Horsemanship . . .  and a Clown to Amuse the Spectators," the circus has enthralled ladies and  gentlemen and children of all ages with increasingly spectacular acts and  abiding dedication, under makeshift tents, in sports arenas and in open fields.  </P> <P> Author and sometime performing clown John Culhane notes in his three-ring  effort of a book that the history of the circus has been rich and rocky, marked  by storybook characters and magical moments, personal tragedies and public  disasters. It has been, in effect, a theatrical high-wire act, teetering  between failure and acclaim, and Culhane in his obvious enthusiasm tries to  tell it all.  </P> <P> Culhane's narrative begins with pioneer Pool's performances and moves through  the turbulent era of P. T. Barnum, his competition with Bailey, their merger,  the rise of the Ringling brothers, their merger with Barnum and Bailey in 1919  to create the halcyon days of the super circus, to the present diverse efforts.  The institutional history is interspersed with the legends of Buffalo Bill and  Annie Oakley, animal trainer Clyde Beatty, the acrobatic Great Wallendas, clown  Emmett Kelly, Gunther Gebel Williams and his cage of mixed cats, and dozens of  other lesser characters who have performed under the Big Top.  </P> <P> The total is an evocative, somewhat overflowing, starry-eyed history of a  grand, if wavering, tradition. Culhane's effort reads not unlike the feat of  immortal clown and contortionist Lou Jacobs, who orchestrated the packing of a  midget car with a gaggle of clowns. And while the illustrations could have been  of better quality and the design more imaginative (as would befit the book's  subject and price), "The American Circus" as a history of an endearing  theatrical tradition deserves the center ring.Sam Hall Kaplan  </P></p>

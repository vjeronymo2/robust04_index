			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza Rosales] </F>   [Excerpt] Guatemalan Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de  Vielman said yesterday that the Guatemalan Government is trying  to persuade the U.S. Government to eliminate the travel warning  that has decreased the flow of tourists to Guatemala.    She denied that the Guatemalan Government is not doing  anything about the situation and said that efforts have been  made both in Washington and at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala.    The minister said the interested parties should be aware  that  this warning is not aimed at Guatemala alone, but that such  directives generally include several countries. That is why the  Guatemalan Government has presented the necessary social and  economic arguments for a favorable resolution, although this  warning is a unilateral U.S. decision.    She said the hunger strike declared by a U.S. citizen in  front of the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City is something that  Washington should take into consideration when a new decision is  made.

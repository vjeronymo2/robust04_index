This was  announced by the Pakistan foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad  Ali, at Islamabad a short while ago. He told a press conference  that consequently Pakistan has authorized China and Iran to  decide the best course they feel is available for it.    Earlier, Beijing and Tehran approached Islamabad to postpone  for three hours the voting on the resolution this evening so  that further consultation could be held on certain proposals  made by them. These options included either withdrawal of the  resolution or its indefinite deferment. PTI, quoting observers  in Islamabad, says Pakistan can agree to withdraw the resolution.</p>

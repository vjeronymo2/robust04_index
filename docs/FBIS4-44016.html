			<p>BFN     [Text] In the opinion of Valery Giscard d'Estaing  [president of the French Democratic Union], the intervention  operation in Rwanda poses problems, because it is the  responsibility of Africa, not Europe, much less France.    The French forces of Operation Turquoise in Rwanda have thus  entered the town of Cyangugu. They have established themselves  in the Nyarushishi camp. This is where thousands of Tutsi  civilians fleeing the massacres have taken refuge. No shots  have been fired, and we have been well received by the people,  Colonel Andre Chilles said this morning.    Two wide-bodied planes carrying more than 100 tonnes of  medical supplies and equipment left Satolas [Lyon airport] for  Rwanda this morning. Nicole Guillard reports from Lyon:    [Begin Guillard recording] At least 150 tonnes of supplies  and equipment are going to be transported to Rwanda from  Satolas. Half of the crates were loaded aboard a wide-bodied  plane yesterday, and the second will leave late this afternoon.  They are taking modular operating theater units, medical  equipment, medicines, and vehicles supplied by Bron military  college, within the framework of the rapid humanitarian  intervention air force. This emergency force, incorporated into  Operation Turquoise, should make possible the rapid  establishment of two medical units in Zaire, behind the Rwandan  border. A rapid intervention unit in southeast Rwanda will also  make it possible to give first aid to the victims of the war,  thanks to two medical units, a surgical unit, and a dental unit.

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIEW FINDER: ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY  </P> <P> Electing to Serve  </P> <P> Theresa Wessig of Canoga Park has been serving as a precinct election clerk  since 1950. She became an election inspector, supervising voting in her  precinct, in 1952. For more than two decades, she has opened her home as an  election polling place. And, come Tuesday, she'll be at it again.  </P> <P> Lorraine Patterson, a county Registrar of Voters supervisor, wishes that there  were a lot more like Wessig. With 276 precincts in the San Fernando Valley,  Patterson is always on the lookout for a few good living rooms, or garages, or  businesses that will allow her to set up her voting booths for the Election Day  siege.  </P> <P> Patterson also needs 1,205 people to man the polling places, and it's still not  too late to serve for Tuesday's election, she said. "We are fairly well-staffed  in most precincts, but there still some vacancies. And we always have people  who say they will work and can't make it, so we need others to fill in."  </P> <P> Anyone interested in serving as an election official should be prepared to be  at the assigned polling place by 6:30 a.m. and stay until 8:30 p.m. It's also a  good idea to bring a sack lunch and wear comfortable clothing, she said.  </P> <P> People who serve as clerks earn $45 for the day and are instructed in their  duties when they report to the polling place, which is usually as near to their  residences as possible. Inspectors receive 1 1/2 hours of instruction, usually  in a classroom situation, and earn $60 for the day.  </P> <P> The number to call to volunteer either services for this election or voting  space in the future is (213) 725-5919.  </P> <P> And if you do decide to serve, be thankful for voting machines. "When I started  on the boards," Wessig said, "we used to have to stay up all night and count  the ballots."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hit the Road  </P> <P> Terry Hottman, who is in the marriage repair business in Encino, says the  marital state is sometimes a tough place to be in today's complex world.  </P> <P> "Marriage has never been uncomplicated, but roles used to be more clear-cut,"  said Hottman, who holds a master's degree in marriage and family counseling and  is often asked by divorce lawyers to help clients whose marriages are on the  brink of collapse.  </P> <P> Some matters of marital contention are as old as time, Hottman said, like the  loss of communication between partners. But other issues are relatively new,  like what's expected of you if your partner goes into Alcoholics Anonymous or  some other 12-step program.  </P> <P> "About a third of my practice involves people who are starting to work a  program and are trying to cope with the changes this makes in the way the  entire family relates to one another. Sometimes the partner not in the program  needs to begin working on his or her co-dependency. Sometimes the children need  to be in a program designed for them," Hottman said.  </P> <P> Another third of his practice has to do with cross-cultural marriages or  blended families, as in his, hers and ours. "There are many areas of confusion  when couples marry someone from a different background and the same is true of  people who are marrying for the second time. It takes a lot of patience and  understanding to sort out all the nuances of these kinds of unfamiliar or new  relationships."  </P> <P> Another part of Hottman's practice, he said, deals with people who have had or  are having affairs. "Affairs put stress on a marriage and can cause one or both  partners to consider divorce," Hottman said, but he added that often the affair  is symptomatic of something else.  </P> <P> Hottman said that being a counselor doesn't mean that relationships are any  easier for him. "Therapists are at greater risk, in a way, because they are  used to taking other people's inventories, and they can be manipulative," he  said. "You really have to be aware and listen to yourself."  </P> <P> His advice for helping couples get over rocky times, when they are rubbing each  other every way but right, is take a hike.  </P> <P> Together.  </P> <P> "A brisk walk will do wonders for your outlook on life, as well as your  health."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Artistry in Marketing  </P> <P> If you are moving in the near future, expect to receive a ton of mail offering  goods and services, including a note from the Wing Gallery in Sherman Oaks  promising a free gift.  </P> <P> Robin Wing, the entrepreneurial force behind the gallery, is not giving away  Rembrandts, but she is making a present of a small print by American primitive  artist Charles Wysocki in an effort to make new friends for her establishment.  </P> <P> Even when the economy doesn't seem to be in a snit, selling art is a challenge  because there are so many other things to do with discretionary income, so Wing  has made an art form of soft-sell inducements to bring in new customers.  </P> <P> One of the ways she does this is to offer children's programs occasionally  because "we think that exposing people to art and an artistic environment at an  early age will bring them back when they are adults," she said.  </P> <P> The gallery also invites artists to come and share an afternoon with patrons,  as Wysocki, who lives in the Lake Arrowhead area, will do between 1 and 5 p.m.  Sunday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mall Karma  </P> <P> Before we all start picking out a burial shroud for the economy, take a look at  the local shopping centers.  </P> <P> It's not the Christmas rush yet, but some of the malls look as if they're about  to reach critical mass. If everyone is so worried about federal, state and  personal finances, who are all these people shoving cash and plastic at  salespeople?  </P> <P> Patrick McGowan, who works in ladies shoes in the Glendale Galleria's  Nordstrom, said he couldn't explain what's going on, nor could Yolanda Denike  in women's wear. Topanga Plaza and Northridge Fashion Center are jammed, as is  the Sherman Oaks Galleria. Is there some kind of shopping center karma that  draws those presumably in financially distress and makes them surrender the  contents of their wallets at the cash registers?  </P> <P> The most amazing manifestation of the phenomena is the newly opened Antelope  Valley Mall.  </P> <P> Brenda Marshall, who sometimes sits at a desk at the entrance to Harris' taking  credit card applications, said: "It really is strange. The day before the mall  opened, no one was here. The next day, it looked like people had been shopping  here all their lives."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overheard  </P> <P> "My son is so taken with his new role as an acolyte that we call him the altar  ego." -- One mother to another at Balboa Park soccer practice  </P></p>

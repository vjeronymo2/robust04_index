			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (5): The pressure is mounting The unions and the need to cut jobs Trade unionists fear that India's chronic problems of unemployment and underemployment will be exacerbated by the structural reform programme. Openings for India's workers, who increase at the rate of 2 per cent a year, may be curtailed by technological change and a tougher line on redundancies. Apprehensive of labour militancy and its political fallout, the government has been dragging its feet over redundancy policy. Officials in the labour ministry are reviewing the whole gamut of industrial labour laws, to ensure they are in line with the other reforms, but the changes will be slow in coming. The retrenchment of labour will eventually be given a legal framework, and the law relating to the regulation of trade unions may be revised, say officials in the labour ministry. The government believes that the reforms will benefit labour, at least in the long term. 'Trade unionists may be worried about the effect of reform on labour in the short term, but in the long term, the government hopes that the reforms and the encouragement of foreign investment will lead to a substantial expansion of employment in more labour-intensive industries,' says a senior labour ministry official. Recognising that the reform process would increase structural unemployment, the government established the National Renewal Fund (NRF)in 1992, a social safety net instrument to provide compensation and transitional support to workers who lost their jobs. The NRF has two constituent windows: the National Renewal Grant Fund (NRGF) compensates workers affected by the closure of both private (those under liquidation orders from the state governments) and public sectors, and provides payment for voluntary retirement schemes by public sector units. the Employment Generation Fund (EGF) provides grants for retraining, redeployment and approved employment generation schemes. But labour leaders complain that the Fund's safety net has been inadequate for the loss of 1m jobs in 1992-93, swelling the country's unemployed to 18m. 'It should be termed the National Retrenchment Fund, because the total compensation package far exceeds the entire corpus of the fund,' says a senior labour leader. Despite the World Bank suggestion two years ago that a suitable policy be framed to facilitate industrial restructuring, including a framework for reducing barriers to reducing industrial manpower levels, government efforts to introduce labour reforms and an exit policy have been minimal. 'The government has done nothing to protect the workers from retrenchment, even though the law does not allow retrenchment of workers,' admits a Congress (I) MP. 'The government is shying away from an exit policy because it is afraid to antagonise labour, but workers continue to lose jobs because businesses that are unviable simply shut down.' Mr CP Rangarajan Kumaramangalam, a Congress (I) MP and former union labour minister, says that changing labour laws alone will not solve the problem of surplus labour. He has suggested that the government should try to persuade management and labour to regard each other as partners in progress, instead of adversaries. He criticises the negative overtones of the term 'exit policy' (the official euphemism for labour reductions), arguing that labour, like capital, can be redeployed rather than simply rejected. 'Good labour relations make for good business,' agrees Mr Krishan Lal Chugh, chairman of ITC, the Calcutta-based company, which last year reached a landmark settlement hinging on improved productivity. Industrial relations have remained mainly peaceful in the last two years, despite the loss of jobs as a result of structural reforms. The loss of man/days in 1992-93 declined to 21.15m from 34.57m in 1991-92. The main bone of contention between trade unions and government is the closure of the economically sick public sector units. 'The government wants to close down the sick mills, while we are fighting for their revival,' says Mr Chittabrata Majumdar, secretary of the 1.1m strong Centre of Indian Trade Unions, affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). 'We have put forward a number of suggestions how sick mills can be run viably, but they do not care to listen, and have only taken steps which have favoured more sickness.' Union leaders point out that employers can already exploit the workers, using voluntary retirement schemes, increasing contract and casual labour that can be easily retrenched, and subcontracting production. 'The government has to evolve a practical policy to tackle the loss of jobs or face a worker upheaval', a union leader says. Last year, the unions won an important victory when they stalled the introduction of the Industrial Relations Bill in parliament. The Bill sought to delete a section of the Industrial Disputes Act, requiring government clearance for the closure of a company employing more than 100 workers. Says a labour ministry official: 'The government may seem ostrich-like about labour reform because it is caught between political considerations at home and pressure from foreign agencies to initiate it. But it's not as if we are neglecting this crucial area of reform.'</p>

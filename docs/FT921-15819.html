			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Sears may eliminate 7,000 jobs SEARS, Roebuck one of the largest retailers in the US, yesterday announced plans to eliminate about 7,000 jobs through a Dollars 60m investment programme in automated customer service facilities. The Chicago-based company, whose management has faced criticism from shareholders recently and where retailing profits fell in the third quarter, said that it hoped to achieve annual cost savings of about Dollars 50m, beginning in 1992. The investment will purchase 28,000 new point-of-sale terminals, and 6,000 automated customer service 'mini-kiosks'. Installation of the equipment should be completed by the end of the first quarter. Sears said the cash register side of the investment programme should add about 5,000 terminals to the sales floor. About 1,000 full-time non-sales jobs would be eliminated, together with some 5,900 part-time clerical positions, the company said. About 676,000 sq ft of back office space would be converted to sales usage. Sears said that employees affected by the moves would be offered the opportunity to switch to other store positions. The company said that it planned to test different delivery options for its catalogue merchandise. The aim was to increase the number of direct home deliveries, reducing the amount of catalogue merchandise which was held at store pick-up areas. The US retailer has been under considerable pressure recently; the merchandise group, which covers the stores, catalogue business and the Sears credit card, reported a 60 per cent fall in after-tax profits in 1990, to Dollars 257.4m.</p>

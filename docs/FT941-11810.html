			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat talks continue Talks between Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, and its bankers over the extension of its standstill agreement were continuing yesterday. The standstill on Queens' Pounds 1.3bn of debt expired at midnight on Monday. Talks were continuing to be 'constructive', it was said yesterday. Queens said talks were continuing with the steering committee, headed by Barclays Bank, and it could not comment further. Although it is unusual for a standstill agreement not to be rolled over, bankers said that no party was taking precipitate action.</p>

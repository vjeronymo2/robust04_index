			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Han Shaojun (7281 4801 0689): "Persistently </F> Popularize the Public Bidding System"]    [Text] The numerous unhealthy trends arising in the public  bidding system of Hebei's construction and decoration trades due  to imperfect market system have drawn the great attention of the  provincial party committee. On the afternoon of 7 June, Cheng  Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, and other  provincial leaders, including Liu Shanxiang and Guo Shichang,  heard reports on popularization of the public bidding system and  the unhealthy trends in the construction market given by the  provincial and Shijiazhuang city construction committees,  construction industry bureaus, and bidding offices. Chen Weigao  pointed out: Construction and decoration trades have made  important contributions to Hebei's urban construction and  construction of key projects, but some architectural and  construction units have conducted trade between power and money  when contracting construction projects because the construction  market has yet to be fully cultivated, the mechanism of market  competition has yet to be standardized, the laws and regulations  for the trades are imperfect, and management of the trades is  still weak. This has not only brought about tremendous economic  losses to the state and turned a number of important projects  into high-priced and low-quality projects with hidden danger.  But it has also led some cadres to the road of crimes, such as  bribery and embezzlement. This has become a conspicuous problem  in the anticorruption struggle. For this reason, in our effort  to oppose corruption, advocate honesty, and correct the  unhealthy trends of some trades, we should pay attention to this  problem.    Cheng Weigao emphasized: To make the work successful, we  should coordinate the endeavors to build the market, strengthen  management of public bidding work, establish the market  competition mechanism, and strengthen the supervision and  management of the market with those to oppose corruption and  advocate honesty, check unhealthy trends, and investigate and  handle major and serious cases. He called for efforts to start  with five aspects of work. First, we should strengthen the  fundamental managerial work for construction projects. We  should clarify who are to hold the responsibilities, implement  the project report system, screen and approve the projects  strictly based on their planning, designing, and construction  procedures, make all construction units implement the public  bidding system, and strengthen the supervision and management of  the quality after the projects are started. Second, the public  bidding system should be persistently applied to all  construction and decoration projects. The extremely small  number of projects to which the system cannot be applied due to  special reasons should be screened and approved by authorized  departments. Projects for which bids are to be negotiated  should be screened and approved by authorized departments before  bids are determined. In the process of inviting and entering  bids, government administrative departments are prohibited from  giving intervention, and leading cadres are prohibited from  giving hints on or forcing the designation of the construction  units by giving approvals or admonitions. Construction units  which give pressure on architectural units in the name leading  cadres and intervene in the bidding procedures, once discovered,  should be disqualified from the construction and dispelled from  the province if they come from other provinces. Construction  licenses will not be issued to the architectural units which do  not invite bids or negotiate bids without approval. Third,  focusing on promoting the public bidding system, we should  establish and improve the compatible construction market  mechanism as well as laws and regulations. We should also  establish and improve bidding organizations, appraisal  organizations, and intermediary organizations. Fourth, in the  process of inviting and entering bids, it is strictly forbidden  to give parties and gifts or to offer sight-seeing tours in the  name of observation. Fifth, we should investigate and handle  major and serious cases. When construction investment is found  to be greatly disparate from the construction results, we should  strengthen auditing and inspection of them and sternly deal with  the people who have abused power to extort money and take and  ask for bribes.</p>

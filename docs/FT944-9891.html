			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Cardoso candidates confident of power: Strong election showing will strengthen hand of Brazil's next president When Brazil holds state governor elections tomorrow , but the biggest winner has already been elected. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who takes office as president on January 1, is likely to see his supporters cruise to victory in the most important states. His own centre-left Social Democracy party (PSDB) is also expected to perform strongly and seal its emergence as a new force in Brazilian politics. Elections are being held in 18 of the country's 27 states where there was no clear winner in last month's first round. Mr Cardoso, who as finance minister launched a currency which tamed inflation, won the presidential race easily. Victories for his supporters in the gubernatorial elections will considerably add to his political clout next year. His advisers are increasingly jubilant that PSDB candidates will win in the three key states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. These states alone account for 43 per cent of the country's voters, and more than 60 per cent of GDP. They are also the most influential politically and, because state governors hold influence over congressmen, Mr Cardoso will be guaranteed a strong voice in Congress. Sao Paulo, the country's most important state, looks set to be won by Mr Cardoso's long-term ally and PSDB leader Mr Mario Covas. He has a big advantage over his challenger, a populist local politician who, among other colourful claims, once said he would solve the capital's traffic problems with the help of God. The state, home to more than half the country's biggest companies, is also home to a big potential time bomb, the state bank Banespa. The bank has been abused by politicians for so long that it has a bad loan ratio five times higher than private sector banks. Mr Cardoso needs to sort out the state bank sector to avert a banking crisis and expensive federal support. Mr Covas may not agree to all Mr Cardoso's recommendations, but is thought to be looking at ways to negotiate changes. The expected victory in Rio de Janeiro for the PSDB's Mr Marcello Alencar will also give Mr Cardoso a strong mandate to attack the city's problems, especially drugs and economic decline. The army is preparing an offensive against Rio's drug traffickers and was also to appear today on the streets of Rio to ensure an orderly vote. In other important states, PSDB candidates are clear favourites in Minas Gerais and the big northern state of Para. . The Liberal Front (PFL), part of Mr Cardoso's election alliance, is almost certain to win the main north-east state of Bahia and consolidate the powerbase of Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, , the state's most powerful politician. The only possible setback for Mr Cardoso is in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. Mr Cardoso's choice, Mr Antonio Britto, faces a late challenge from a Workers' party (PT) candidate. Opinion polls suggest the two are neck and neck. The strong showing of candidates linked to Mr Cardoso partly reflects optimism about his prospects as president. Candidates have been rushing to seek his blessing and stress that states which elect his allies have a better chance to benefit from the economic growth which many expect a Cardoso government to bring. The new currency, the Real, won Mr Cardoso his election and is now winning votes for his allies by keeping prices under control. Mr Cardoso's popularity should also ensure the emergence of the PSDB as one of the most powerful political parties. As well as holding the presidency, it looks set to increase its number of state governors from one to five - second only to the Democratic Movement (PMDB). The PSDB, which Mr Cardoso helped found in 1988, also elected enough congressmen in last month's elections to make it the third largest in Congress. This is important because it gives the PSDB a strong negotiating position to build a coalition in Congress. Before the elections, there were fears that Mr Cardoso would need to compromise to guarantee the support of its larger alliance partner, the right wing PFL. Instead, Mr Cardoso should have considerable autonomy from PFL leaders like Mr Magalhaes, so long as his popularity remains high. Mr Cardoso's main presidential challenger, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left wing PT, did poorly in the elections. But his party may be close to a breakthrough. The PT, which has never won a race for governor, has candidates with good chances of winning in the federal district of Brasilia and the small state of Espirito Santo. A third candidate is neck and neck in Rio Grande do Sul. The PT is growing quickly, helped by its reputation for propriety and by disillusionment with old-style politicians who relied on corruption and patronage. Its congressional strength increased by 50 per cent to 54 members following last month's elections and it is expected to form the nucleus of opposition to Mr Cardoso.</p>

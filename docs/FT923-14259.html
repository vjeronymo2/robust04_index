			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Pentland to buy Adidas from BTF PENTLAND Holdings, the UK consumer products company, yesterday ended weeks of negotiations by agreeing to buy Adidas, the German sporting goods group, from Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF), in a deal worth worth DM621m (Pounds 215m). The transaction, which values Adidas at FFr3.1bn (Pounds 300m), ends speculation about the future direction of cash-rich Pentland. The UK company first set its sights on Adidas last summer, when it negotiated the purchase of 20 per cent stake and an option on a further 5 per cent in BTF for Pounds 46m. Pentland became a stock market favourite in the 1980s on the windfall Dollars 777m profit from its investment in Reebok, the US sports shoe company. Mr Frank Farrant, Pentland finance director, insisted the company had not been 'bounced into a deal' by press speculation about management bids. 'Pentland had always made it clear we would be very interested in taking control of this company at the right price,' Mr Farrant said. 'If you look at the price we paid relative to the DM1bn that was mooted last week, it is a very good price.' The deal is a watershed for Mr Tapie, who has been struggling to repay debts he took on to buy Adidas two years ago. Pentland has agreed to pay DM621m in cash for BTF's 58 per cent stake in BTF GmbH and also to buy out the other minority investors. Pentland's shares rose 14p to 144p in London. BTF's shares remained suspended in Paris at FFr130.  -------------------------------------------         SPORTS SHOE MARKET SHARE  -------------------------------------------                   ADIDAS    NIKE   REEBOK  ------------------------------------------- WORLD (excl.

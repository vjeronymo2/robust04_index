			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Lyell resists 'scapegoat' role in arms affair Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, last night launched a dramatic effort to defend his role in the political furore over arms-related sales to Iraq by insisting he would not be a 'scapegoat' in the affair. In a series of television interviews before his appearance today at the inquiry headed by Lord Justice Scott, Sir Nicholas vigorously defended his role in seeking to prevent critical Whitehall documents being released to a trial of three businessmen. Sir Nicholas admitted in an interview with ITN that he had at one stage considered resigning, but said he had rejected the idea. 'If I thought I had done something wrong at the outset, that would have been the time to have resigned - when the case collapsed. I thought about that carefully at the time,' he said. But his appearance on television just ahead of evidence to the Scott inquiry underlined the serious threat the affair poses to the attorney-general's political future. 'I hope not to be the fall guy because I believe in justice and I believe I advised carefully,' Sir Nicholas said. He added: 'I certainly don't believe I am beleaguered by colleagues.' In his interview with the BBC, he said: 'I don't believe in scapegoats, and I am confident that what I did was right and fair and carefully done.' Sir Nicholas has been under intense pressure since Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the inquiry earlier this month that he had strongly resisted an instruction from the attorney-general to withhold documents from the Matrix Chirchill trial. Mr Heseltine and three other ministers eventually signed the so-called public interest immunity certificates. But Sir Nicholas's judgment in issuing the instruction has been strongly criticised by leading legal authorities. The attorney-general said last night that he had 'nothing against Mr Heseltine at all'. He said: 'I quite understand that from different perspectives, people see things differently.' But he added: 'I gave him careful written advice.' Sir Nicholas defended himself against the idea that, as attorney-general, he had taken a party political view in the whole affair. 'When it comes to prosecutions, party politics has nothing to do with it whatsoever. That is the job of attorneys-general down the centuries,' he said. 'They have been criticised down the centuries. We have been like lighthouses in a storm for a very, very long time. I am proud to be there and I intend to stand like a lighthouse.' Sir Nicholas said there were 'real lessons' to be learned from the affair. 'I look forward to getting across to the world this complete and utter myth about me and about all the perfectly responsible ministers who signed these certificates,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FOR TOURING SOVIET HOCKEY TEAMS, THE TIMES ARE DEFINITELY CHANGING  </P> <P> Glasnost and familiarity have created considerable change for touring Soviet  hockey teams and North Americans with whom they come into contact.  </P> <P> During previous visits, players were closely watched by grim-faced "tour  guides" and media interviews were rigidly conducted with interpreters who  obviously altered any controversial words.  </P> <P> Now it is possible for a player such as Viacheslav Fetisov to express in a  40-minute news conference his dissatisfaction with both Coach Viktor Tikhonov  and the Soviet Defense Ministry, a phenomenon that Fetisov admitted, "If it  weren't for (Mikhail) Gorbachev, this would be impossible."  </P> <P> The police still are out in force to assure that Soviet players will be  protected from dissidents who object to their coming here. For Thursday's game  here, there was a mobile command post, at least two dozen vehicles and half a  dozen police on horseback. But there were no dissidents.  </P> <P> There were precious few spectators, either, a mere 9,504 in a building that  seats 16,297. The turnout prompted Islander General Manager Bill Torrey to  wonder what will happen next year, when the Soviets are scheduled to play all  three New York-area teams.  </P> <P> "There's a large segment of my customers who don't want this game played,"  Torrey said. "People are telling me, 'We don't want the Russians here.' If we  don't sell out and the Devils don't sell out, how can we sell three games next  year?"  </P> <P> Some of the Islanders' veterans, notably Bryan Trottier, who didn't play, and  Bill Smith, who played under protest, felt the game was unnecessary, Smith  complaining, "I've got nothing to gain, except maybe getting hurt."  </P> <P> But some of the younger players tried very hard and Patrick Flatley said, "When  nationalism is at stake, you develop a distaste for other countries. When you  play against them, you can't help but dislike them. It goes back to the (1984)  Olympics."  </P> <P> There was a feeling that the Soviets themselves were more interested in a  shopping visit to Crazy Eddie's than in the game itself.  </P> <P> Asked how well the Central Red Army had played after it edged the Islanders,  3-2, winger Vladimir Krutov replied through an interpreter, "A victory is a  victory."  </P> <P> Asked if his team was excited about the game, Tikhonov sidestepped, "Our better  game is ahead. We need time to adapt ourselves to North American playing. The  time difference is eight hours between Moscow and North America."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, center Igor Larionov, who speaks fluent English, sat and feigned  laughter as the questions were presented to Tikhonov, winking at a reporter and  obviously enjoying himself.  </P> <P> After Tikhonov's segment ended, he left the interview room and Krutov and  Larionov were put on the North American media hot seat.  </P> <P> Larionov, who has been drafted by Vancouver and has made known his desire to  play in the NHL, said, "It's always important for me to play in North America.  I like the ambiance, the atmosphere here. I feel the spectators very much like  hockey in these countries and it's important for both parties to come  together."  </P> <P> A reporter then asked Larionov about a letter he wrote to the magazine Ogonyok,  protesting Tikhonov's oppressive training methods as well as his coaching  tactics.  </P> <P> Larionov covered his face and said, "Oh, no," but the interpreter obviously was  unaware of the letter and translated the question for Krutov, who shrugged his  shoulders. The interpreter then said, "What letter?" and the reporter began a  recital, while Larionov struggled to keep a straight face.  </P> <P> After discussing the players' enforced absence from their wives, the reporter  went on to mention a statement that the players often ignored Tikhonov and made  up their own plays, at which point Larionov shouted in English, "Too much, too  much."  </P> <P> The mere thought of players criticizing the coach would have been unthinkable  in the past, when players were reluctant to say more than "Hello" to the  natives. But Gorbachev obviously has lightened the atmosphere.  </P> <P> Fetisov, in two earlier interviews, accused Tikhonov of placing obstacles in  his attempt to join the New Jersey Devils. Tikhonov, who recently passed the  captain's "K" from Fetisov to Sergei Makarov, insisted he had approved  Fetisov's release in May, "but there are other top-level officials," an  apparent reference to Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov.  </P> <P> However, Fetisov, a major in the Red Army, said, "If Tikhonov wanted it, I  think this thing would be resolved quickly. He's all talk and no action."  </P> <P> That statement was made through a translator. In English, Fetisov said of  Tikhonov, "He's an actor, a very good actor."  </P> <P> Besides the atmosphere, the Soviets' game appears to have changed, too. Instead  of passing the puck patiently until they set up a good shot, as they once did  with such grace, they are following the typical NHL practice of shooting from  all angles. Against the Islanders, the Soviets put 37 shots on goal and fired  countless others wide. But they were low-quality shots; all three goals came on  breakaways.  </P> <P> For each of the 14 games being played here by the Army and Dynamo Riga, the  Soviets are guaranteed a fixed amount, believed to be $25,000. They also  receive a percentage of the gate, expenses and a full set of equipment.  </P> <P> Accordingly, the Army appeared in its opening match at Quebec in spiffy red  helmets and sweaters. However, the players wore blue pants borrowed from the  Nordiques, because their new red ones had been shipped inadvertently to Moscow.  Also, the sweaters lacked names on the back, because the manufacturer  mistakenly put the Army players' names on the Dynamo sweaters. The mistakes  were rectified for the game here.  </P> <P> If some fans are indifferent, it would appear nonetheless that matches against  the Soviets will increase and a lot of people on both sides think it is a good  thing.  </P> <P> Coach Al Arbour of the Islanders said, "It's a good experience for a great  number of our players. We can learn from them and they can learn from us. Their  skating and headmanning the puck are things we've got to do."  </P> <P> Krutov said, "Any games with North American teams are prestigious. It's very  good for our hockey future to play them."  </P> <P> Now if Fetisov and Larionov could only figure out their hockey future.  </P></p>

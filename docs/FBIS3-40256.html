			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, leader of the Parliamentary </F> Group of the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Noemi Sumegi; place  and date not given: "We Maintain Our Cooperation With the  FIDESZ -- Gabor Kuncze on Revanchism, the Prime Minister's  Style, and What Could Be a Real Stir"]    [Text] The program-forming meeting of deputies of the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] begins today, 28 January, and  will last until 30 January. This is where it will finally be  decided what political message the party will have for the  Hungarian people at the 1994 elections. We interviewed Gabor  Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of the SZDSZ, before the  meeting.    [Sumegi] After so many exciting general meetings, this one  promises to be a calm working conference.    [Kuncze] Indeed, we are not expecting any excitement. The  SZDSZ is preparing for the elections and it is presenting a  program to the citizens that is an alternative to the past four  years and to the preceding 40 years. I will have to talk to the  representatives of a united party at the general meeting: We  will have to set out the direction of the program.    [Sumegi] What is your message for the voters?    [Kuncze] We can launch the country on the way toward  security and prosperity! The SZDSZ has the necessary program  for this. We cannot acquiesce in Hungary's current lack of  success, which is not the fault of the people who have been  working hard in the past four years and before; rather, it is  the fault of the governments that have been unable to use these  efforts in the interest of a successful Hungary.  <H5>  Light Dreams </H5>   [Sumegi] The SZDSZ is preparing for a governmental role full  steam ahead. However, public opinion polls show that the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Federation of Young  Democrats [FIDESZ] are leading neck and neck.    [Kuncze] The elections will be in May, and the SZDSZ will  have to increase its support by then. However, the trends  indicate that the SZDSZ has started "to go upwards." According  to the latest opinion poll, the party's popularity already  reaches 15 percent among those who will choose a party, and we  reached this in three months. Almost 40 percent of the  electorate would like to see us in government. There is a  sympathy toward the SZDSZ, and we will have to change this into  more votes.    [Sumegi] I will not ask you for coalition speculations, but  I would like to outline two versions. What will happen if the  MSZP wins? Many people think that the SZDSZ would be willing to  form a government with the MSZP and this is also confirmed by  the fact that the MSZP does not have a prime ministerial  candidate.    [Kuncze] The SZDSZ is open to all democratic parties. It  will decide on coalition when the election results, and whether  the programs can be reconciled, are known. This is not  influenced by the fact that the MSZP has not named a prime  ministerial candidate.    [Sumegi] According to the FIDESZ, the socialists should be  kept away from power for at least another four years if we want  a real democratic "rotation" system.    [Kuncze] Things like this can be said but the electors will  make the final decision.    [Sumegi] [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto once said that a kind of  revanchist spirit has arisen among the supporters of the old  regime, especially in the provinces.    [Kuncze] In my experience, people who lost their positions  in 1989 and 1990 appear to be getting organized and they are  becoming increasingly self-confident. There is a danger that,  if they get back into power, people will feel that nothing has  happened. This is regardless of the MSZP's national politics.  At the same time, all political forces have a responsibility in  preventing the domination of revanchism in Hungary. Taking  revenge on people every four years would be an impossible  situation. A country cannot operate like this. This has to be  ended for once and forever.    [Sumegi] According to the other -- let us call it -- extreme  idea, an agreement between [Prime Minister Peter] Boross and  [FIDESZ Chairman] Orban would like to prevent the socialists  from coming to power.    [Kuncze] When ideas like these surface, it would be best for  the affected sides to comment on them. According to our  agreement with the FIDESZ, its leaders should inform the SZDSZ  about all such talks. We have not received any such  information. The fact that certain parties talk about having to  prevent another party from coming to power might indicate the  lack of programs. However, if it is to indicate that, in this  case, they will have to present a good program to the electors;  then I can approve this.    [Sumegi] It is conceivable that it will not be possible to  form a stable government and Boross will in the end be right  because he said that, if something other than the current  coalition comes to government, new elections will have to be  called within a year.    [Kuncze] Boross is probably aware of the situation the  country was brought into by the government led by the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF]. On this basis, he might even be right.  However, I believe that if, in 1994, a coalition is formed that  is able to present a united program to the people, and which can  agree with the employers and the employees, then the government  will be supported by the interest protection organizations.  This way, a stable coalition can be established, and we bear  this in mind.    [Sumegi] What are your views on the MDF's chances? In  "crisis situations" -- voting for the budget or election of the  prime minister -- the MDF has always been able to pull itself  together. What can be Boross's role from this point of view?    [Kuncze] The MDF will lose the elections. It is  undoubtedly true that, to the outside, Boross represents a  different style compared to the previous period. The emphasis on  the need for dialogue also indicates this. It is also apparent  that he wishes to move the government toward pragmatic politics.    [Sumegi] As far as I can see -- and the SZDSZ has not  indicated otherwise --he has not yet made any big mistakes since  he became prime minister.    [Kuncze] This is true and when he does make one, we will  certainly mention it. The prime minister has not done much good  yet, either, and he could not have in this short time. He  presents the activities of the MDF government in the past month  as a series of successes. The electors will later express their  views on the "series of successes." The question is how the  forces in the MDF will influence Boross's scope for maneuver.  It is certainly true that he simply does not deal with  ideological issues.    [Sumegi] There is a significant uncertain strata in society  which lost its faith in the MDF but cannot find a better party  to suit its taste.    [Kuncze] In my view, a significant part of the MDF's voters  have gone over to the MSZP, just as, at the time, people who  otherwise were left-wing sympathizers had voted for the MDF  because it had promised "light dreams" and painless transition,  as opposed to the SZDSZ that had spoken honestly about the  burdens of the changes. People were wrong in 1990 when they  chose the MDF. The voters have now returned to the MSZP; many  have also changed over to the FIDESZ but those people who are  now leaving the FIDESZ increase the number of those who do not  choose any parties. I do not believe that the MDF will be able  to improve its position considerably. Today, in the view of the  public, the SZDSZ is a party that has good ideas and promises  safe changes.  <H5>  The FIDESZ in the Center-Right </H5>   [Sumegi] According to the FIDESZ's leaders, they pulled the  SZDSZ into the center through the SZDSZ-FIDESZ agreement. On  the other hand, you once said that the FIDESZ is around the  SZDSZ.    [Kuncze] We should leave it to the electors to decide this.  Public opinion polls have been placing the SZDSZ into the center  and the FIDESZ either to the left or to the right of the SZDSZ.  It was indeed I who said that, according to this, the SZDSZ is  in the center and the FIDESZ is around us. However, the  movement of the past one year indicates that the FIDESZ is  moving to a center-right position, Orban has been taking his  party in this direction. The question is what the electors will  think of this. However, this does not mean that it is not the  FIDESZ that is closest to the SZDSZ.    [Sumegi] According to the BESZELO, the SZDSZ and the FIDESZ  are as happy about each other's problems as divorcees usually  are. After the events of the past two months, people who have  been hoping for a liberal victory might even be worried about  the alliance of the two parties.    [Kuncze] In the Hungarian electoral system, the parties have  to have themselves measured to find out their support. It is  after this when it is worth talking about alliances. Therefore,  in addition to being allies, we are also rivals of each other.  We are not happy about the FIDESZ's quick loss of popularity  because this weakens the liberal center. However, it is still  worth maintaining our cooperation because this can be beneficial  for both parties at the elections.    [Sumegi] In the MAGYAR NEMZET, [former MDF deputy] Jozsef  Debreczeni said nothing less than that the SZDSZ and the  intelligentsia that supports it tried to influence the FIDESZ's  formidable politics against the successor party [MSZP] through  [former FIDESZ deputy] Gabor Fodor.    [Kuncze] This is a usual twist in Debreczeni's thinking and  it is not worth dealing with it. Naturally, the SZDSZ had  nothing to do with the problems within the FIDESZ at the time.    [Sumegi] One of the goals of the FIDESZ-SZDSZ agreement was  that the two parties would try not to set candidates against  each other in six to 12 electoral districts.    [Kuncze] This is still a possibility, for example, the  FIDESZ has not yet set a candidate in my district, and the SZDSZ  has not yet named anyone in some districts. Another section of  the agreement talks about automatic withdrawal [to the benefit  of the other] between the two rounds, and this also can still be  fulfilled. As for the period after the elections, we specified  that we would always first talk to each other. However, even  this does not mean any strict obligations, the two parties are  still free to act as they wish.    [Sumegi] The biggest conflict between the two parties is in  the local organizations, therefore, the withdrawals will not be  so automatic.    [Kuncze] The leaderships of the two parties asked the local  organizations in writing to take up contact with each other and  to try to keep the emerging conflicts in normal channels in  order to strengthen the liberal center.    [Sumegi] You are talking very cautiously....    [Kuncze] I am making a conscious effort to be a politician  who does not steer the political forces toward conflicts. I am  aware of the serious differences of views between the various  parties but these have to appear in a way that will give people  options to choose from, rather than which will divide society.  <H5>  Who Is on the Right Way? </H5>   [Sumegi] To what extent is the media making the FIDESZ-SZDSZ  conflict more acute?    [Kuncze] The press pays much attention to this issue because  it would cause a big stir if cooperation between the two parties  ceased to exist. When I give calm answers to these questions,  journalists think that I am avoiding the answer and they are  disappointed. However, my view on this issue is exactly what I  said.    [Sumegi] To what extent will calm politics be  characteristic of the campaign? According to Boross, it is  important to keep a calm atmosphere. However, you have already  been called a rascal by [MDF Executive Chairman] Sandor Lezsak,  and some of your fellow SZDSZ members have been called traitors  to the country.    [Kuncze] I would like the election campaign to be a  competition of programs. This is needed because we must regain  people's faith in politics. A vehement and negative campaign  would even more convey the message that it is not worth dealing  with "these" because all they try to do is discredit each other.  I believe that Boross has the same view and I can see that  Lezsak's views are different. When he called me a rascal, I  deliberately did not react because I thought that sooner or  later he would make a statement that comes up to the level where  it is worth conducting a dialogue. It is a different matter  that this has not yet happened. However, I am optimistic in this  respect, too.    [Sumegi] If Lezsak is elected chairman of the MDF, to what  extent will he be able to move the MDF in this direction?    [Kuncze] If he takes the party in this direction then the  MDF will definitely be lost. Lezsak is already the executive  chairman; in this position, he should be more careful about what  he says and how he offends politicians. It is he who has to  change in this respect; I am on the right road.</p>

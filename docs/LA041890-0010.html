			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT PLANS CUTBACKS  </P> <P> Faced with a potential $1.2-million budget shortfall, Ventura Unified School  District administrators announced proposed cutbacks Tuesday for the 25-school  district, including layoffs, a hiring freeze and reductions in district  programs.  </P> <P> Unveiled at Tuesday night's school board meeting, the proposed layoffs would  affect 15 district employees, including five administrators and two assistant  principals at the district's two high schools.  </P> <P> The proposed cutbacks, which also include trimming such programs as the visual  program, would pare the entire $1.2-million shortfall from the district budget.  </P> <P> The district is facing the potential deficit because of a proposal by Gov.  George Deukmejian to trim the state budget allocation for education. Deukmejian  has proposed cutting the annual 4.95% cost-of-living increase for California's  elementary and secondary schools to 3%.  </P> <P> The district's estimated $1.2-million deficit is based on a 4.2% cost-of-living  increase, a figure educators hope will be the compromise reached when the state  budget is finalized. If the 3% increase should be instituted, district  officials estimate, an additional $500,000 in cuts will be necessary.  </P> <P> Richard Averett, an assistant superintendent, said the proposed cutbacks, while  harsh, are not unusual. School districts statewide are scrambling to bring  their budgets in line with decreased revenues, Averett said.  </P> <P> The Ventura Unified Board of Education will decide whether to implement the  cutbacks at its May 8 meeting.

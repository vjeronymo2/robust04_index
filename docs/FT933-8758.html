			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Turnround at Royal Insurance ROYAL INSURANCE yesterday reported a sharp recovery in its interim results, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 52m for the first six months of 1993 compared with losses of Pounds 79m. Earnings per share rose to 9.3p against losses of 18.3p and the interim dividend is lifted by 25 per cent to 2.5p. The City, however, appeared disappointed with the result, which fell short of some more optimistic expectations. Following strong growth in recent weeks the shares fell 11p to close at 333p. Royal said that it would launch a new direct motor insurance subsidiary on a national basis in September following a successful trial period of operation in the north of England. Like The Insurance Service, based in Bristol, Royal Northern Direct will be a telesales operation, bypassing the insurance broker. TIS now insures about one third of the 1m motorists insured by Royal and is growing rapidly. Commenting on the results, Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, said 'we are definitely on our way back.' Mr Gamble's appointment was accompanied by a change in management style at Royal and the introduction of a more disciplined approach to underwriting, including sharp increases in premium rates. Pre-tax losses have gradually fallen from their peak of Pounds 373m in 1991, with a recovery in the UK underpinning the improvement. UK underwriting losses fell from Pounds 172m to Pounds 22m. The company reported underwriting profits in household, personal and commercial motor and commercial property, but they were offset by losses of Pounds 50m (Pounds 100m) on domestic mortgage indemnity business. UK premium income increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 836m (Pounds 769m). DMI losses for the year are expected to reach Pounds 90m. Underwriting losses at Royal Re, the reinsurance subsidiary, were also higher than expected, reaching Pounds 45m (Pounds 26m). Overall underwriting losses fell to Pounds 207m (Pounds 310m). Investment income - at the general insurance subsidiary - rose to Pounds 250m (Pounds 235m) before loan interest. Income from associated undertakings rose to Pounds 13m (Pounds 9m), while losses on estate agency business fell to Pounds 6m (Pounds 9m). Profits from life insurance fell to Pounds 25m (Pounds 27m). Loan interest payments at holding company level amounted to Pounds 21m. At the insurance subsidiary loan interest amounted to Pounds 3m (Pounds 19m), long-term insurance profit Pounds 1m (Pounds 12m losses) and minority interests losses of Pounds 2m (Pounds 2m profits). Capital and reserves increased to Pounds 2.07bn (Pounds 1.5bn) and include realised gains of Pounds 80m (Pounds 375m) and unrealised gains of Pounds 50m (loss of Pounds 184m). At June 30 the solvency ratio amounted to 56 per cent, compared with 42 per cent at end-December. See Lex</p>

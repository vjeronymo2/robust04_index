			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Cuba shakes up economic posts CUBA'S government replaced four ministers yesterday in a shake-up of key economic posts that signalled its determination to confront the island's economic crisis with reforms, Reuter reports from Havana. The ruling council of state, headed by President Fidel Castro, named Mr Alfredo Jordan Morales, Mr Nelson Torres Perez, General Silvano Colas Sanchez and Mr Jose Luis Rodriguez Garca as the new ministers for agriculture, sugar, communications and finance respectively. It was the most important shake-up of economic posts on the Caribbean island for several years. Foreign diplomats said the changes confirmed President Castro's intention to tackle the island's economic problems, aggravated this year by flagging food production and a disastrous sugar harvest. Mr Rodriguez, a leading economist, was previously deputy director of the Centre for Research in the World Economy in Havana. Last week he told foreign reporters he foresaw the introduction of monetary, tax and exchange rate policies and limited market mechanisms to overhaul the economy.</p>

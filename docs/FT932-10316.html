			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Assessing the case for higher government savings THE LATEST World Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund (1) forecasts a return to synchronised growth among the industrial countries by 1994. Like most mainstream forecasters, the IMF has been profoundly wrong about the slowdown of recent years. If it is right at last, however, what obstacles might emerge to a sustained recovery? Since inflation is now low by recent historical standards, the IMF focuses particular attention on 'unsustainably large fiscal imbalances' and 'structural impediments to saving and investment'. The aggregate general government financial deficit of the G7 has grown from 1.2 per cent of GDP in 1989 to an expected level of 4.2 per cent in 1993. A particularly startling deterioration has occurred in the UK, which saw a surplus of 0.9 per cent in 1989 turn into a forecast deficit of 8.8 per cent in 1993. The government deserved the Newbury by-election result for this performance alone. But the French fiscal position has deteriorated considerably too, as Edouard Balladur, the new French prime minister, will be explaining this week. Recession is only part of the explanation for the deterioration. 'In 1993,' argues the IMF, 'the structural deficits of Germany, France, Canada, the US and the UK are all estimated to be in the range of 2 to 5 per cent of GDP, and that of Italy considerably higher.' Only Italy and Canada managed noteworthy improvements in their structural fiscal deficits between 1991 and 1993, while the deterioration in the UK was over 4 per cent of GDP. 'The persistent failure to achieve an adequate degree of fiscal consolidation', complains the IMF, 'has had costly macroeconomic consequences: a lower level of potential output because of reduced capital formation; lower productivity growth; high debt-GDP ratios and debt-service payments; pressure on real long-term interest rates; and, most recently, low consumer and business confidence because of uncertainties about future economic policies.' Fiscal positions do matter, but in what it says about the effect of governments on national savings, the IMF goes too far. This is particularly true of its argument that 'the most important reason for the trend decline in national saving has been the general increase in budgetary imbalances'. As the chart shows, however, the most important reason for this decline has been the declining rate of private savings. The principal question would seem to be how far governments should offset the behaviour of the private sector, be it to raise the overall level of national savings, or to smooth cyclical fluctuations in savings, or to equalise savings rates across countries. Governments of the G7 do seem to be evening out cyclical swings by saving less whenever the private sector is saving more and vice versa. But they have not offset the declining trend in the private savings rate. Furthermore, public savings have not been relatively high where private savings rates have been relatively low and low where private savings rates have been high. The World Bank's latest analysis of global economic prospects shows, for example, that in 1991 the share of private savings in GDP was 17 per cent in the US, while it was 24.9 per cent in Japan, and while public savings were - 2.2 and 9.3 per cent of GDP, respectively (2). Government savings rates should take account of the rate of national savings if the social return to savings exceeds the private return. Tax systems alone ensure this. A still stronger case can be made for governments to keep their fiscal deficits in bounds, since there is a limit to the indebtedness that any government can hope to accumulate. But the IMF overstates the link between the two issues. If declining levels of national savings are a problem for the G7, the private sector, not the government, has been the principal culprit. It is incentives for private savings that should be examined more closely. (1) World Economic Outlook. Washington DC: International Monetary Fund, April 1993.

seasonally adjusted. Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial production: data from national government sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.</p>

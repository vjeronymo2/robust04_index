			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: Not a sterling response Sir, Why is it that every person I speak to overseas asks me why the British are not taking advantage of cheaper sterling to boost exports? My answer is that they are using cheaper sterling to widen their margins rather than increase sales. Meanwhile, the Japanese and the Germans are gaining market share. 'Not very clever', as someone said recently in Johannesburg. David Hughes, 5 Dunsay Road, London W14 0JJP</p>

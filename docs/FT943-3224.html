			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Walker admits 'something wrong' Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of the Brent Walker property and leisure group, yesterday admitted in evidence at his trial that there was 'something wrong' in the way cash was moved out of his company. Mr Walker was being asked about sums of Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 250,000 which allegedly moved from Brent Walker through two bank accounts before reaching a third, of which Mr Walker was the sole signatory. He and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, are accused of fraudulently inflating Brent Walker profits by devising bogus film rights transactions. They deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify accounts. The trial resumes tomorrow.</p>

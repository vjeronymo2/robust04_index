			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BREATHLESS SEARCH FOR THE MOST EVIL VILLAIN IN 'DICK TRACY'  </P> <P> Regarding the June 24 letters about "Dick Tracy": I saw it with my boys and  then took my husband.  </P> <P> We loved it!  </P> <P> Why can't people just go to a theater, sit back, eat popcorn and and enjoy the  movie? Why is it some people think "Oh my God, kids are going to see deformed  people and run screaming from them, thinking they are bad guys" because they  saw Pruneface in "Dick Tracy"?  </P> <P> Do these people have kids? Do they think kids are stupid?  </P> <P> And concerning the letter writer who points out there are no African-Americans  in movies that certain directors make: Come on, don't take it so seriously.  It's only movies.  </P> <P> JOY RACKEMANN  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

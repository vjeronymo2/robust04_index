			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Prospects brighten for Ulster talks PROSPECTS FOR new all-party negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland brightened yesterday, when the leaders of Ulster's four main constitutional parties agreed that talks could resume after next Friday's Anglo-Irish meeting in Dublin. Mr James Molyneaux of the Official Unionists, Mr Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionists, Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party, agreed a joint statement after a private meeting of just over an hour. The statement said the party leaders assumed that after next week's gathering there would be no further conference meeting before the election. Although the Northern Ireland Office last night welcomed the leaders' statement, it was not clear that all hurdles had been cleared to allow talks to start and the proximity of the general election would make the timescale extremely tight. A UK general election, if Mr John Major decides on April 9, could be called as early as the following week. Mr Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, have made it clear that the basis of talks would be the same no matter who won the election. The two party leaders are to be asked next week to confirm these assurances in writing. Fresh impetus to break the apparent deadlock in the talks came from a Downing Street meeting held by Mr Major with Ulster party leaders earlier this month. Unionist and nationalist leaders agreed then to discuss how obstacles to formal talks, which had been postponed until after the general election, could be overcome. Mr Major called the meeting - the first for 16 years between a prime minister and all Northern Ireland's political parties - because of the escalation in terrorist violence in the province. There have also been claims that, by putting political talks on the back burner, the government was creating a political vacuum which could be exploited by terrorists. Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, is due to meet the four Northern Ireland leaders on Monday, and there will be a Commons debate on Northern Ireland next Thursday.

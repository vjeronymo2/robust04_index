			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Shetlanders worry about keeping their prosperity afloat: James Buxton is warned that the thriving economy of a remote group of islands 'could fall on its face very quickly' MR Bill Fraser identifies a problem, most unusual in Britain today, that confronts the Shetland Islands. He describes it as 'our very low rate of unemployment'. Unemployment in Shetland has been static at roughly 4 per cent for several years. In effect, the islands have virtually full employment. For Mr Fraser, who runs Shetland Enterprise, the local development agency, that means 'it can be difficult to convince people that in a few years' time their jobs could be gone'. If the 22,000 Shetlanders, who inhabit the northernmost point of the UK, do not sound particularly worried, that is understandable. Each day almost 1m barrels of oil pass through the Sullom Voe oil terminal from the Brent and Ninian fields in the North Sea. Shetland benefits from the 520 jobs at the British Petroleum terminal and from hundreds of other oil-related jobs as well as through disturbance payments and harbour dues from tankers. Islanders also benefit from rent and rates paid to Shetland Islands Council, which enable it to spend heavily on welfare projects and on helping local businesses through grants. Shetland exudes quiet prosperity, but its population has not sunk into the idleness of a rentier oil state in spite of the modest cushion of accumulated funds in the council's Charitable Trust, which amounts to about Pounds 135m, and the reserve fund for commercial projects of more than Pounds 30m. Shetland still makes much of its living from fish. Almost a third of the region's 10,000-strong labour force works in the fish industry, including fishermen, fish processors and salmon farmers. 'We are more dependent on fish than any other part of the EC,' says Mr John Goodlad, secretary of the Shetland Fishermen's Association. 'Without fishing, the future of this community is doubtful.' That Shetland is a hive of activity unrelated to oil is obvious to any visitor: the splendid harbour at Lerwick, the capital, is alive with powerful-looking fishing boats, ferries and the odd Russian cruise ship. Elsewhere crofts, making a living from the unpromising grazing, dot the landscape. Some of the islands' historic speciality of making knitwear continues and at least one company, Judane, exports garments to Japan that are produced on computer-controlled knitting machines. Yet, according to Mr Fraser, 'Shetland is a vigorous economy that could fall on its face very quickly.' The Sullom Voe terminal is in decline. Opened in 1981 and laid out to enable expansion to deal with throughput of 3m b/d, it reached its all-time one-day peak of 1.5m b/d in 1985. Parts of it have already been dismantled, while one of the four tanker loading berths has been mothballed. Mr Rod Walker, British Petroleum's terminal manager, says that Shell and Chevron, operators of the fields feeding the terminal, are committed to using it until 2000, but warns that throughput may by then have fallen to 300,000 b/d - the level at which it becomes uneconomic. If throughput of gas declined seriously, Sullom Voe would not be able to run its power station from gas and would have to import electricity. It might have to stop separating the gas from oil, which is part of its raison d'etre. 'We've got to find more oil out there, and compete for the oil that is found with other methods of transporting it,' says Mr Walker. The Clair field, about 50 miles west of Shetland, is now being explored and might use Sullom Voe, but it may not be until 2000 that development begins, and that may be too late for Sullom Voe. At the council, Mr Malcolm Green, the chief executive, says the local authority expects the 'final days of the terminal' - and thus of the council's oil income - will come between 2005 and 2010. Aware that money will become tighter, the council is reorganising itself and replacing grants for businesses with a system of loans. The fishing industry also presents an uncertain picture. In the white-fish industry, fishermen are frustrated at regulations requiring 135 days of tie-up a year to conserve stocks. The near-surface fishery - fishing for herring and mackerel - once depended largely on selling its catch to 50 or more factory ships from the former eastern bloc, the so-called Klondykers which came every summer to process herring in Lerwick harbour. Fewer Klondykers are expected this year, and Mr Goodlad believes that in two or three years this type of factory ship will have become uneconomic in the market economies of eastern Europe. Meanwhile, the remaining Klondykers depress the market for the Shetland fish-processing plants, as they now sell their output on the open market instead of disposing of it behind the Iron Curtain. The salmon farmers are cutting production because the market has been depressed by Norwegian overproduction, although Mr James Moncrieff of the Shetland Salmon Farmers Association believes prices will improve in the next few months as excess supply ends. Mr Goodlad is optimistic. 'The Shetland fish industry is at the leading edge of technology,' he says, and points to the gleaming new North Atlantic Fisheries College at Scalloway. It is a striking example of how Shetland invests its oil money: it cost Pounds 6m, most of it from the council, and has the latest equipment to teach nautical studies, marine engineering, aquaculture and fish processing. It is part of Shetland's preparations for the future. 'Our businesses have to be very efficient to compete with anyone given the high cost of transport to the mainland,' says Mr Jack Burgess, the council's development director. 'The council does help them, but there's no rush of companies coming to take advantage of what we offer here.' 'The Shetlanders are very adaptable people,' says Mr Fraser of Shetland Enterprise. 'But we're saying to them: You should start thinking about what you're going to do when the oil runs out.'</p>

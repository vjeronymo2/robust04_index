			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (1): Val d'Isere voted the king of the FT mountain - Arnold Wilson analyses FT readers' views of the top skiing resorts and finds that the old favourites come out best WE HAVE been deluged by a blizzard of Pink Snow questionnaires returned by the Weekend FT's skiing readers. Almost 2,000 readers, aged on average between 35 and 44 and with an average income of Pounds 35,000, filled in the form in the hope of winning either the main prize of a skiing holiday in Klosters, or at least some pink champagne. FT readers have skied an average of 2.6 countries each and skied in 25 countries altogether. In spite of Austria's famous gemutlichkeit and the charm and glitter of Switzerland, the French resorts dominate the FT readers' choice of favourite skiing areas, with Val d'Isere and Tignes - the celebrated Espace Killy - nosing ahead of the gigantic Trois Vallees: Courchevel, Meribel, Les Menuires and Val Thorens. There are five French resorts in the readers' top ten. But one has emerged unquestionably as king: Val d'Isere. The choice is no surprise, and it is thoroughly deserved. Readers found both the vast network of pistes and lift systems in Val d'Isere unbeatable. Tignes, Val d'Isere's partner, also attracted praise for lifts and runs. Both resorts had excellent feedback about ski schools. Of the rival Trois Vallees system, Courchevel and Meribel emerged - again unsurprisingly - as outstanding ski resorts. Indeed, on an individual resort basis, both finished higher in the FT readers' top 20 than Tignes. Val Thorens, also in the Trois Vallees, emerges as a creditable tenth. The huge snow desert of La Plagne is 11th, and Flaine and Les Arcs fill 13th and 14th slot. Chamonix/Argentiere is 16th. Alpe d'Huez, (18th), the less well-known resort in the Dauphine region of France, achieves a strong rating with its modern lift system. In Switzerland, Verbier (fourth) wins the skiing Oscar, with Zermatt (sixth) and Davos/Klosters (seventh) picking up most of the other votes. Wengen is 17th and St Moritz 19th. Zermatt, which has been criticised in the past for its standard of ski instruction, seems to have overcome its problems and is highly rated. Verbier also does well in this department. The ski schools at Gstaad and Saas Fee are praised by many. In Austria, St Anton, with its highly regarded ski school, is the highest-placed Austrian resort at No. 8. Kitzbuhel/Kirchberg is 11th and Lech/Zurs scrapes in at No. 20. Kitzbuhel's famous Red Devils ski school has many admirers, and those at Alpbach, Obergurgl, Soll and Solden are much praised. Italy does not get much of a look in - not, apparently, a big ski destination for FT readers - but the ski school at Souze d'Oulx receives several bouquets. The US is predictable: Vail, whose ski school is praised to the skies, wins by a mile and manages to get into the top ten table. However, Aspen, at No. 21, does not quite make it. The French domination is reflected handsomely in the choice of the most popular tour operators: Club Med averages a score of 6.8 out of 8 for every mention. Among operators used by fewer readers, Touralp heads the field with the best average of any in the entire table - 8 out of 8. Powder Byrne and Over The Hill also did well among those with fewer mentions. Many readers, we learn, make their own arrangements and do not use tour operators. Mr MP Cunliffe, an intermediate skier from Evesham, Worcestershire, marked himself 'A' for 'own arrangements', but a much earlier school trip only earned a 'C'. Ski Thomson, the market leader, achieved a healthy 5.5 out of 8. Others mentioned frequently include Supertravel (Lotus) (5.9); Mark Warner (5.9); Horizon (5.7); Inghams (5.7); Neilson 5.5); Bladon Lines (5.1). We asked FT readers to rate operators from A (excellent) to D (poor). To compile our score we counted A=8, B=6, C=2, D= - 2. We felt that there should be a penalty for readers showing positive dissatisfaction. However, this system enables smaller operators with satisfied customers to score relatively highly compared with larger operators, which are bound to have at least some dissatisfied users. Lower scores may represent patches of dissatisfaction in a generally contented clientele. Crystal (3.3) and Ski West (3.6) both received a poor rating from the survey. Both operators believe they have improved substantially in the last year or so and claim that because our survey goes back five years, poor results do not represent present performance. Andy Perrin, Crystal's marketing director says: 'Between 1989 and 1991 we were involved in a period of enormous growth and experienced certain volume-related problems. These occasionally left a sour taste in clients' mouths even before they reached the resort, so that in the event of a problem later - no matter how small - it could all be blown out of proportion rather than just being settled by popping round to see the rep. We have now installed a new computer system which we believe will prevent further problems.' John Parker, of Ski West, says: 'We were surprised and concerned at these results. They contradict our own returns which last season reflected a very high level of satisfaction and a negligible level of complaints - less than 1 per cent of our clients. We have invested heavily over the last 12 months in resort staff training and quality control. We are convinced that our choice of chalet accommodation is among the best on the market.' And what of Powder Byrne, which provided our first prize of a week's chalet holiday in Klosters? The company scored an excellent 7.8 out of 8. Ski Scott Dunn, its rival in the world of up-market ski holidays, emerged with a creditable 6.9. Some tour operators mentioned by readers are no longer with us and these have been omitted from the list. Mr H. Gray of Ashford, Kent, an intermediate who also wants a better deal for 'mature' skiers, mentions four operators but omits 'others no longer in business or too poor to qualify.' Some, like Supertravel, are under new management. As for apres-ski, several readers, including Mr DY Adams from Twickenham, west London, a hard-skiing intermediate, wrote that they were 'too tired' to visit nightclubs or discos. One reader even said he was 'too drunk' to remember the names of the establishments he had found the energy to visit. Mr John Dyet, a beginner, from Paignton, reports from Puy St Vincent: 'No night life but none the worse for it.' There were, however, more serious, though thankfully few, tales of woe. One has to feel for Mr Keith Otto (intermediate), from Brighton who says of a chalet holiday in Italy: 'Very disappointing. No snow. Poor food.' That just about sums up the worst possible scenario for a skier. At least Mr Otto survived unscathed, which is more than can be said for Mr WP Kember (intermediate) a recently retired reader from Highgate, London, who chose St Moritz as his favourite resort. 'But it might have been Vail had the pistes been safer', he writes. 'Wife hit twice by out-of-control snowboarders and needed hospital treatment. I was hit once.' Mr Edgar Phillips, an expert skier from Kendal, showed some sympathy for tour operators trying to deal with poor snow conditions - but there was a sting in his tale. 'It wasn't their fault that there was no skiable snow, but I booked a skiing holiday, not a walking or shopping trip. It was the year during which, when checking snow guarantees and insurance small print, I felt an air of fraud emanating from the pages of tour operators' brochures.' A number of readers used the form to campaign about what they perceive to be problems and injustices in the industry. 'Help stamp out iniquitous single room supplements]' says angry Mr P. Snook of Abingdon, Oxon. 'It is very random whether one acquires an instructor who suits,' writes Mrs Margaret McAlpine, an intermediate from Enfield, Middlesex. 'Alpe d'Huez was a happy combination of excellent snow and very conscientious instructor. St Anton was a disaster of poor snow, a laid-back pensioner of a teacher and a very mixed ability class. We were outstretched and experienced increasing drop-outs after one fright too many.' Sadly, Mr EA Coles, (intermediate) from Stevenage, Herts does not share Mrs McAlpine's enthusiasm for French resorts. 'No problems anywhere except French purpose-built resorts', he trumpets, noting that in his view these had the worst restaurants, ski school and apartments. He chose Vail and Breckenridge as his favourite resorts, but in spite of admitting that he is comfortably off, thought America was expensive. He did rather grudgingly say that one French ski village - Belle Plagne, in La Plagne - was pretty in spite of being purpose-built and was among his favourites. Mr Quintin Gardner, intermediate, of Croydon, thinks Mr Coles has got it all wrong about France. He skis there four times a year (always with Touralp) and likes it so much he has never bothered to try Austria, Switzerland or the US. His favourites: Les Arcs and Flaine. Mr JM Bray of Handcross, intermediate, of West Sussex chose Zermatt: 'Good skiing, scenery - and no cars.' For Mr James Bardner, an expert skier from London it was 'Aspen - but it's expensive.' The merits of Europe versus the US was a popular theme. Dr JA Heyworth, a 'good intermediate' from Wilmslow, Cheshire, thought the US best for 'discipline of queues' but rated Courchevel's 'bubbles out of resort' highly. Mr E. Brett, from London, admitted that he 'occasionally takes a guide, to jump queues in France.' The hotels, restaurants and apres-ski in Jackson Hole, Wyoming (my own personal favourite) swept the board with Mr J. Hoseason, an expert skier from Norwich, who has also skied in Gstaad, Kitzbuhel, Courmayeur, Val Thorens and Meribel. But for European skiing his favourite was Val Thorens. Jenny Fowle, from Jersey (intermediate) also rates Val Thorens highly. 'It is impossible to beat the Trois Vallees in Europe, but I'll try the US soon,' she says. A beginner, Mrs Moya Drummond, says that all the facilities are good at big Canadian resorts such as Whistler and Mont Tremblant. But then she would say that - she lives in Canada. Swiss hotels come in for adulation, but also a little criticism. The Monte Rosa and Zermatterhof - both in Zermatt - win most acclaim. In Wengen, another popular haunt with FT skiers, the Regina, Silberhorn, Alpenrose and Sunstar were extremely popular, and the Palace at Gstaad and St Moritz attracted praise. The Rosalp in Verbier, the Park at Flims and the Margna at Sils Maria were also popular. The Kulm at Arosa and the Schweitzerhof at Gstaad, St Moritz, Davos and Nendaz (Verbier) received a lot of votes from satisfied customers. But Mr RM Dymond of Lymm, Cheshire (intermediate) was 'very disappointed by the Schweizerhof in Zermatt. Cold and unfriendly.' There might be something in this, because not a single reader has praised this well-known hotel. Other Zermatt hotels which do receive bouquets include the Alex, Alpenhof, Mont Cervin and Zermatterhof. Mr David Hall, an expert skier from County Meath, Ireland, is unequivocal about the Fluela in Davos. 'It's the best ski hotel in the world' he says. Mr PD Carosone, an Edgware, Middlesex, intermediate writes: 'Please note that the Llao-Llao Hotel will be opening in Bariloche (Argentina) very soon. It will be the best hotel in South America - right in the best ski area in the southern hemisphere.' In France, Le Totem and Les Lindars in Flaine have many admirers among our readers, and the Golf Hotel scored well in Les Arcs. Readers also enjoyed the Christiania and Savoyard in Val d'Isere. Skiers in Austria liked the Arlberg at St Anton, the Tannbergerhof in Lech and the Post at Soll. Mr CD Cranmer, intermediate, of Wimbledon, chose the Wildbad in Bad Gastein, adding: 'Please keep it quiet. I don't want to find I can't get in in future.' However, by and large readers skiing in Austria seem to have such eclectic taste that few individual hotels appear more than once or twice. Perhaps this reflects the wide choice of accommodation, from guesthouse and bed-and-breakfast farmhouse to hotel, available in Austria. Skiers who cross the Atlantic rate the Breckenridge Hilton and the splendidly scenic Chateau Lake Louise in Canada highly, however, the Chateau Whistler and the celebrated Lodge at Vail get the lion's share of the laurels. Vail's Marriott Hotel also does well. Restaurants singled out by more than one reader include Banff's Grizzly Bear, and Siding 29 (Banff's original name when the railway but not the town had been built in 1883.) The Blue Moose at Breckenridge, the Chalet de Pierres, the Diva at Isola 2000, the Rustico and the Walliserhof (Klosters), Chez Kiki (Meribel), Barking Frog and the River Horse (Park City, Utah), Tim's Stray Dog Cantina (Taos, New Mexico), Sonnenalp (Vail), Crech'Ouna and Perdrix Blanche (Val d'Isere), Rosalp and Vieux Verbier (Verbier) and the Wengernalp (Wengen) all seem to have something special. And in Zermatt, where there are more mountain restaurants than perhaps in any ski resort in the world, Enzo's, Le Mazot, Simis and Stockhorn seem to be the favourites among FT readers. I fancy the entry for the 'Forget' establishment in Meribel Mottaret is probably a reader saying he forgets the name of his favourite restaurant. On the apres ski front, Dick's T-Bar in Val d'Isere seems to be preserving its loyal following with 27 mentions. Verbier's Farm Club is praised by nine readers and the boisterous Londoner in Kitzbuhel finds favour with five. The Krazy Kangaruh at St Anton also has five admirers. And finally, Mr W. Hall of Fordingbridge, Hampshire, who describes himself as an expert, writes: 'Please do not ring unless I have won the major prize.' Sorry, Mr Hall, you forgot to send us your telephone number.

were asked to rate the operators from A (excellent) to D (poor). We have converted these ratings to a score as follows: A=8, B=6, C=2, D= -2 Total number of mentions for all operators still in business: 1088.  Average score: 5.6. The survey relates to the experiences of FT readers over the last five years. The management of some companies changed in that period. Operators no longer in business have been excluded from the survey.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

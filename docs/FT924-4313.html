			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Venezuela calls off national curfew THE Venezuelan government has lifted the national curfew imposed after Friday's failed coup, and restored the rights to free speech, free transit and public assembly, Joseph Mann writes from Caracas. Mr Luis Pinerua Ordaz, minister of the interior, said the government hoped to restore the rights to freedom from arbitrary arrest and the inviolability of the home before state and local elections on December 6. President Carlos Andres Perez, the target of two coup attempts this year, has in recent days stressed that he does not plan to change his free-market economic policies.</p>

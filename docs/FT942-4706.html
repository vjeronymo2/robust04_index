			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Huhtamaki hit by lower growth in first term Shares in Huhtamaki, the Finnish confectionery, food packaging and pharmaceuticals group, fell 10 per cent yesterday after it produced lower-than-expected profits in the first four months. Taxable profits increased by 4 per cent to FM112m (Dollars 20.4m), sharply lower than the FM150m profit anticipated by the market. The shares fell to FM189 from FM210. 'People have got used to a big increase in Huhtamaki's profits and this slowdown was not expected,' an analyst said. The performance reflected a slight improvement in operating profit, which rose to FM163m from FM161m, and a small reduction in financial costs to FM51m from FM53m. Sales were up 13 per cent at FM2.7bn. Much of the growth derived from acquisitions which lifted the European sales of the Leaf confectionery business and Polarcup packaging. This helped to compensate for a downturn in Leaf's North American operations and a stronger markka. Mr Timo Peltola, chief executive, said the group had a sluggish winter but market prospects for the rest of the year were slowly improving. Leaf, the world's 10th largest confectionery group, is expected to win market share in North America while Polarcup's business is forecast to pick up during the summer.</p>

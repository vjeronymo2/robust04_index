			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Search for value to continue - London A stock market constantly searching for new peaks presents investors with a heady environment, especially when it insists that all news must be good news. The UK market is still riding strongly on base rate cut prospects and the reality must be that the cut is not going to be delivered until the chancellor of the exchequer wills it; he did not sound too willing on BBC radio last week, so hopes must be projected forward yet again. This week will leave the stock market relatively light on UK economic data compared with last week. There are also fewer trading statements from the big corporate names, except in the retail sector. This could be dangerous because it leaves investors to continue the search for value in a market where the word 'overbought' is becoming audible. Plummeting yields on equities as prices race ahead have already brought the dividend yield on the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index down to levels seen only rarely over the past 20 years. With bond yields also declining fast, investors have been driven to seek out 'value' in the higher yield areas in equities, including, most notably, the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks. This index, having outperformed the FT-SE 100 Share Index by almost 8 per cent since January 1993, went into overdrive in the middle of last week, outpacing and even leading the FT-SE 100 Share Index. But any market index which can rise by 136 points on one day, and fall by 43 the day after, as the Mid 250 did in the middle of last week, is a hazard for the unwary. Fund managers are very cautious towards the non-Footsie stocks, remembering how many relatively illiquid shares proved unsaleable for a long time after the market crash of 1987. Higher than average yields can highlight dividend risk as well as underlying value, warns Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. Technical market specialists warn that market makers have been effectively short of stock since the FT-SE Index stood at 3,050, just ahead of the November budget. Allowing for several catch-up opportunities since then, the genuine 'average shorting level' is believed to be around 3,265 which leaves a lot of room for market makers to welcome and encourage any correction in share prices. Technical pressures of this nature can push prices downwards as well as upwards if the market changes direction. Derivative Securities, the UK-based specialist on equity market technical factors, believes that, while a correction is still likely, only a few stocks are in serious danger. It identifies Ladbroke, the leisure and hotels group, as displaying clear signs of being overbought following the response of the share prices to the boardroom developments. It rates as marginally overbought stocks ranging from British Airways, where the shares are looking for higher traffic levels as global economies improve, to Tesco, which last week commented on the trading outlook.</p>

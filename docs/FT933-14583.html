			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Canada senate cancels its rise LAWMAKERS around the world who contemplate voting themselves large pay rises in tough times may wish to take note of the recent humbling experience of the Canadian senate. The upper chamber of parliament has bowed to a public outcry by rescinding a CDollars 6,000-a-year (Pounds 3,180) rise in expense allowances, which it approved less than three weeks ago. 'The senate made a mistake on June 23, and public opinion on a matter of this kind must be respected,' said Senator Lowell Murray, government leader, at a special session convened on Monday night to overturn the increase. The 104 senators owe their seats to patronage appointments by former Conservative and Liberal prime ministers, but they are at present a little more sensitive to public opinion than usual. With a general election coming up within the next four months, both the Conservatives and Liberals want to avoid anything that might risk driving voters into the arms of smaller parties, several of which favour either abolition or drastic reform of the Canadian federal parliament's upper chamber. The senators could not have chosen a worse time to award themselves an increase. The province of Ontario has just passed a law requiring 950,000 civil servants to accept a three-year pay freeze and 12 days of unpaid leave a year. With the national unemployment rate at 11.3 per cent and inflation at 1.8 per cent, most private-sector workers can look forward to, at best, a token pay rise this year. Faced with the combined opprobrium of their party leaders, the media and the public, the senators meekly accepted that an increase was not such a good idea after all. The vote to rescind the extra allowance was 80-1, with two abstentions. The about-turn is 'not a humiliating thing,' Senator Murray declared, but 'the right thing.' Not all his colleagues agree. The lone senator from New Brunswick who stuck by his original vote noted that the arguments made last month, in support of more generous travel and accommodation allowances, still applied. 'I've seen nothing to change my mind,' he said.</p>

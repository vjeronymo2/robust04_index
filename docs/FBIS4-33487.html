			<p>CSO     [Text] Tehran, 10 Ordibehesht [30 April] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I  News Service -- Following the dissolution of the apartheid  regime and the participation of all races in the national  elections in South Africa, Iran's political and economic  relations with this country, which were cut off in 1980 after  the triumph of the Islamic revolution of Iran, were resumed.    The Iranian Government, which sent four delegates to  supervise the national elections in South Africa, is waiting for  the announcement of the results of the South African elections,  in order on that basis to organize relations with the next  government in Pretoria.    Iran's political relations began with South Africa in 1349  [21 March 1970-20 March 1971]. In that year the governments at  that time in Iran and South Africa opened consulates in  Johannesburg and Tehran. Following that, economic relations  between the two countries also developed to the extent that 90  percent of the Pretoria regime's oil needs were met by Iran.  Several years later, with the participation of the Iran National  Oil Company, construction began on the [?Natruf] refinery in  South Africa. In addition to its participation in the  construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned  17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's  shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30  percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil  and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent.    In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels  per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus  Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5  percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery.    Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran  National  Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was  required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf.  Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million  tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the  time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons  of crude oil had been delivered to this country.    In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign  affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South  Africa. He said: Since the Natruf Oil Refinery was designed  based on the characteristics of Iran's oil and Iran cut off its  oil exports to South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, the Natruf Refinery suffered losses that were such  that several years later the Government of Iran sold its shares  to the South African SASOL company to recover its losses and  prevent further losses. Nevertheless, if the South African  elections produce a democratic government, the Iranian  Government can resume its relations with this country.    These experts added: In addition, the former Iranian  regime's  oil cooperation with the apartheid government and South Africa  made Iran the Pretoria regime's second-largest trading partner  after Israel.    The governments of the time in Iran and South Africa  cooperated on mining matters and in the extraction of uranium.  Likewise, companies affiliated with the private sector in the  two countries were active importing and exporting and selling  Iran's dried fruits and South Africa's industrial materials.</p>

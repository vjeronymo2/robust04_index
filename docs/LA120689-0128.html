			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUSTAFSON SEEKING FUN OUT OF POOL  </P> <P> Gunnar Gustafson has decided to have a little fun in his senior year at Corona  del Mar High School. And what could be more fun than a fourth Southern Section  championship.  </P> <P> Gustafson has been a member of three Sea King water polo teams that have won  4-A titles, and now he wants to try his hand at volleyball. To do this, he has  to forgo the swim season, but, for a little fun and possibly another title,  it's worth it.  </P> <P> "It is my last year in high school, so I want to have a good time," said  Gustafson, The Times' player of the year in water polo. "The idea has been in  the back of my mind since I was a freshman."  </P> <P> This isn't completely a whim on Gustafson's part. He does have some background  in the sport.  </P> <P> As an eight-grader, Gustafson played for the Balboa Bay club team. He was a  middle blocker on the team, which won the national championship in the  14-and-under division.  </P> <P> Although he had enjoyed his one year of volleyball, there was no question which  sport he would play in high school.  </P> <P> "As a kid, I really looked up to the water polo players," Gustafson said. "I  would see them hanging out at the pool wearing their team sweats. I really  wanted to be like them."  </P> <P> Gustafson has competed for club swim teams since he was in kindergarten and has  been a good age-group swimmer. He made the natural transition from swimming to  water polo when he entered high school.  </P> <P> As a sophomore, Gustafson was a key reserve for the Sea Kings. He has been a  starter the past two seasons and was named first team All-Southern Section both  years.  </P> <P> Although water polo is a fall sport and volleyball a spring sport, there was no  way to play both. Corona del Mar water polo coach John Vargas requires all his  players to compete on the swim team.  </P> <P> "The reason Vargas has been so successful is because he makes his players swim  in the spring," said Corona del Mar volleyball coach Charlie Brande, whose team  won the 4-A championship last season.  </P> <P> But Brande didn't give up on Gustafson completely.  </P> <P> "He always talked to me about possibly playing my senior year," Gustafson said.  "I already have all the swimming background I needed, so I talked to Charlie  before water polo season began and he said he would work with me."  </P> <P> Brande has a little background in converting water polo players to volleyball  players. In 1977 when he was the coach at Newport Harbor he did the same thing  with Ted McGinley, a three-year starter on the Sailor water polo team.  </P> <P> McGinley played his senior season for the volleyball team, which also featured  Olympian Steve Timmons.  </P> <P> "The sports are similar in some ways," Brande said. "What Gunnar will have to  improve on is his jumping ability. That's the one thing that swimming a lot  takes away from an athlete."  </P> <P> Gustafson began training shortly after the Sea Kings defeated Villa Park to win  the water polo title. He rides a bicycle every day and has been lifting weights  periodically.  </P> <P> Gustafson also will have to learn a new position. At 6 feet, he is too short to  play middle blocker and will likely play outside hitter.  </P> <P> It hasn't been a problem for Gustafson, though. He's just having fun.  </P> <P> "It's been great to see all the guys I played volleyball with in the eighth  grade," he said. "It's been fun. Of course another title would be awesome,  too."  </P> <P> ALL-COUNTY: WATER POLO  </P> <P> FIRST TEAM  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:1.45IN:2.99IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW>

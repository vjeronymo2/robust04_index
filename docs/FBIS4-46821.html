			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Larisa Zelkova: "TV as One of the Local </F> Attractions in Nizhniy Novgorod"]    [Text] It would be difficult to call this Russian  city provincial, and not just because it is the birthplace of  many famous people, it has a population of over a million, and  its fair was famous even in the last century. Everything here is  acquiring the dimensions of a capital. This applies to the motor  vehicle plant and to the submarine engineering facilities. As  for television broadcasting, Nizhniy Novgorod has more  broadcasting companies than most cities. There are several  reasons for this unique situation, and it is significant that  the broadcasting industry in Nizhniy Novgorod is a paradigm of  the one in Moscow.  <H5>  Reason One: How One State TV Broadcasting Company Turned </H5> into Two    The story of this division began, as most stories do, with a  confrontation. The creative team in the oblast studio split into  two camps. One group called themselves patriots and refused to  "sell out," while the members of the other group were more  likely to act on purely materialistic interests. When Mikhail  Poltoranin from Moscow decided a year and a half ago to open  local branches of the Federal Television Broadcasting Company,  this provided a way of resolving the conflict. Today it is clear  that it may not have been the best way. Imitating a single-cell  amoeba, the labor collective split into two halves: an oblast  team and a federal team. Each received its own chunk of air  time. They divided the days up evenly, so that no one would be  slighted. This created an unusual, overlapping program schedule:  The new oblast studio took Monday, Thursday, and Friday, leaving  the other four days at the disposal of the new federal company.    Many believed that this paradoxical division was possible  only because there was always enough "watchable" TV here. The  film editing division alone, which made excellent documentaries,  was good enough for several oblast studios. Director Olga  Noskova of the Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Studio is certain that  the uniqueness of the situation was due to one unusual feature:  The television broadcasting center in Nizhniy Novgorod is a  leased enterprise and was not dependent on any existing company.    "The director of our television center could be called a  legend in his own time.... He was the one who displayed  impressive persistence and consistency in solving the problem.  If he had not done this, we would have had the same situation as  in other regions. We would have been the poor relatives of  non-government companies. The television broadcasting center is  a monopolist, but it does not concern itself with industry  politics. It serves everyone--as long as they all pay their  bills," Noskova explained.    Now the two competing companies have been joined by a third  force, a quite independent and strong force. The leased TV  broadcasting center dared to treat all of its clients equally,  and some of them categorically objected to this.    The management of the federal company is convinced that the  issue of property has to be settled. "Look how they managed to  get the technical equipment away from us!" This is what makes  the chairman of the federal "Nizhniy Novgorod Broadcasting  Company" furious. Of course, the people in his studio want the  issue to be resolved in only one way: They want title to the  broadcasting center and are implying that no one else is  entitled to use the equipment and the premises.    Incidentally, there is more than enough unequivocal  animosity  in the relations between the two broadcasting companies. Olga  Noskova, director of the oblast TV studio, has another opinion:  "The problem of the federal company has to be solved by  eliminating it. I could talk to them about unification, but only  in one sense: Guys, give us your air time and we will find  something to fill it with."    The resulting situation is fascinating in several respects.  The groundlessness of the federal company's insistent refusal to  "sell out" was confirmed by subsequent events: They are now  hunting for advertisers just as eagerly as the oblast studio and  are starting to show the same "disgraceful box-office hits and  other bourgeois trash" as the other studio. Their competitors in  the oblast studio, however, have already had time to learn the  ways of commerce, and advertisers are more likely to do business  with them.    In general, it is a peculiar situation. A single channel  shows the programs of one company for three days a week and the  programs of another company the rest of the time. Both want to  destroy the competition and are basing their long-range plans on  precisely this outcome, which would be beneficial for only one  side. Everyone realizes that it is ridiculous to divide up the  program schedule in this way. The viewers do not want to have to  remember the specific days of the week that belong to each  company, and they do not remember: They call the oblast company  to complain about the mistakes of the federal company, and vice  versa. This is not surprising: The programs of the competing  former colleagues are so similar.... And this is also  understandable: After all, they all worked together for such a  long time to establish the television industry in Nizhniy  Novgorod.    This overlapping schedule is not particularly agreeable to  the administrators or the journalists. The journalists know that  something momentous might happen in Nizhniy Novgorod that day,  but their company will not have any air time until the next day.  The news services of the competing companies are naturally  independent of one another--and, it seems, independent of the  viewers, who might have to watch virtually identical reports two  days in a row, because all of the reporters cover the same beat.    In any country with a technical rating system, the question  of viewer preference is never left unanswered. We, on the other  hand, have only the pathetic results of sociological surveys,  and they can only be used to inform a competitor as loudly as  possible: "Nobody watches your programs anyway!"    Their relative merits will become apparent with the passage  of time.  <H5>  Reason Two: It Takes a Pioneer </H5>   The first non-governmental broadcasting company in Nizhniy  Novgorod, the "N-N Network," does not have to wonder if anyone  watches its programs. The company does not have a channel of its  own yet. It leases air time on Sundays from the federal studio  and for two hours in the morning on weekdays from the "Rossiya"  Network. The network's colleagues have different opinions of it.  They all acknowledge its boldness. It dares to do all kinds of  things with no regard whatsoever for politics. Company President  Mikhail Lerman had this to say about the absence of political  programming on his schedule: "As soon as political programs get  popular, we will make political programs." This lack of concern  about politics might be the reason that all of the sociological  polls indicate that a high percentage of the people in Nizhniy  Novgorod are watching the "N-N Network" on Sundays.    It would be odd if they were not watching it. There is no  commentary at all, and there are many Western movies,  mini-series, and entertainment programs, half of which the  company produces itself. In general, the "N-N" team has several  interesting principles of operation, and they always act on  them. At some point the people at the "N-N Network" realized  that they had to have something of their own. They have their  own editing room and their own equipment. When company President  Mikhail Lerman was asked what kind of equipment they had, his  answer was quite simple: "Anything that is not essential is not  necessary. That is another of our principles of operation. We do  not buy ultra-modern equipment, because neither today's  businessman nor the present viewing audience is demanding  ultra-high quality." The company's policies are distinguished by  pragmatism and expediency. These qualities are in short supply  today.    The "N-N Network" was the first in Nizhniy Novgorod to begin  buying licensed products. It has accumulated an impressive  library of films, and as soon as the other companies in the city  begin showing licensed programs, it will broadcast only the  films it acquired legally. The company administrators feel that  the "N-N Network" should not have to pay for something that the  others get virtually for free. This situation requires an  explanation.    Local TV studios in virtually every part of Russia are  broadcasting nothing but stolen films. No one is paying  royalties to anyone. There are two reasons for this. Most of the  firms in our country that are claiming the rights to bourgeois  films do not really own the rights. Since there are no  legitimate representatives, it appears that there is no one to  pay. Furthermore, our companies still cannot afford to pay the  fees that are accepted in the rest of the world. They are too  poor.    It would be difficult, however, to call the "N-N Network"  poor. Everything there looks wonderful to an outsider. This  company acquired the regional rights to CNN and MTV telecasts by  paying for them. They feel it is always better to pay their way,  and this is another of the company's principles of operation.    It has accomplished a great deal on the local TV scene since  1985: It was the first to interrupt programs to show  commercials, the first to hold advertising fairs, the first to  organize "Night Flight"--special programming for night owls, and  the first to film commercials for local advertisers. The "N-N  Network" staffers were the only ones smart enough to get  on-the-job training at CNN, which even showed the story of an  "N-N Network" trainee on its international news channel.  <H5>  Reason Three: Where the "Volga" Flows </H5>   The "Volga" channel is not even a year old. It had the  simplest beginnings imaginable. A few people decided to start a  book-publishing business a few years ago. It was a success. Then  they started publishing their own newspapers. They ended up with  "Kuryer," a whole publishing house. A little later they got a  broadcasting license and "Rendezvous Radio" came into being.  With this experience in taking on so many projects successfully,  some of them decided to go into television. They used the same  method as before: They got a broadcasting license, their own  transmitter, and their own equipment--not the best, but good  enough for a start. Six private individuals and one firm acted  as the co-founders. It was a success.    The story of this company's quick rise is surprisingly  simple  and essentially ordinary. The principle of "doing something  different from everything else on TV in Nizhniy Novgorod" worked  perfectly. That is why the image of the "Volga" channel is more  youthful and audacious than mature and wise. Young people were  hired to make all of the programs--kids from 16 to 22. They did  some incredible things on the air in the beginning, but we have  a tolerant viewing audience. Everyone knew that these young  people had to learn their job and that they could only learn by  trial and error. It goes without saying that each day they tried  more and erred less.    The boys and girls who were literally taken off the street  immediately started making their own programs about the most  diverse and extremely serious topics. Now anyone who has been  working there for more than half a year is already an  "old-timer." During the first six months the company moved away  from the usual kind of programming and began to produce its own  shows. Two children's series could be regarded as a genuine  accomplishment. Once some young staffers filmed a whole  children's play with just one home video camera. There were many  things about the program that could have offended the eye of a  professional, but this was a show for children, and it was a  very good one.    Another of "Volga's" indisputable achievements is its own  sports programming. I do not know of any oblast studios that  show the soccer matches of local teams.... The "Volga" staffers  have even made their own tourist magazine show, with the same  young staffers making films in Gorkiy Oblast. There is also some  political commentary, but the company administrators learned  long ago that political programs do not bring in enough  advertising revenue. Advertisers are more eager to show their  commercials during horror movies and erotic films....    The number of members of the "Volga" creative team can be  counted on one's fingers. Each one is a jack-of-all-trades. Each  can film a show, edit it, and broadcast it. Maybe everything has  gone so well because these young "TV experts" (what else can we  call them?) have never experienced abject failure. They  fearlessly take on anything new. They have nothing to fear but  their own commercial failure. Remember the old adage about the  destructive power of the predictable? The youngest people in the  television industry in Nizhniy Novgorod know better than their  senior colleagues how this principle works. They have all of the  necessary knowledge and ability. These children have a great  future ahead of them. These boys and girls have already learned  to do their job and to take responsibility for what they do.  This is valued in any social structure and in any profession.    ...Everyone knows that the Volga flows into the Caspian Sea.  No one knows where this "Volga" will be in a few years.  <H5>  Reason Four: The Zverev Brand of TV </H5>   There are many women on television. There are few successful  women on television. Nina Zvereva, the Rossiya Network's  personal correspondent in the Nizhniy Novgorod region, is unique  in this respect and in many others. Her reports from Nizhniy  Novgorod are always distinguishable from the work of other  journalists. Nina Zvereva has perfected her own special brand of  TV coverage.    They like her in Nizhniy Novgorod. She is well-known in  Moscow. Nina Zvereva manages to combine the best features of  provincialism with the sophistication of the capital. Zvereva  herself feels that she was just lucky in guessing what the  viewer in Nizhniy Novgorod wanted from her. "People do not care  what I am talking about. All they want is for me to assure them  that everything is fine, that life goes on. I even feel  something like a minister...," Nina explained.    Her news bureau was the Rossiya Network's first independent  agency. She managed to put together a set of good professional  equipment. When company Chairman Oleg Poptsov, who had to  approve her requisitions, asked Broadcasting Director Anatoliy  Lysenko with amazement why all of the equipment was going to  Nizhniy Novgorod, Anatoliy Grigoryevich had a simple response:  "Because Nina Zvereva lives in Nizhniy Novgorod...."    At the start of her TV career, Zvereva had to wear two hats:  In Moscow she was a provincial, and in Nizhniy Novgorod she was  a representative of the capital's values. "Then I realized that  my image, my appeal, my individuality stemmed from my provincial  nature. I knew that a Muscovite could not succeed here anyway.  After all, they do not know anything." Nina, now confident of  her own strengths, recalled her early days in the business. At  one time she worked for the children's programming department of  the Central Television Network, taking her best Nizhniy Novgorod  programs to Moscow, but she found that they were not appreciated  in the capital.    There have been many changes since then. Now Zvereva is a  chief executive. She always knows what to send to Moscow and  what to show on her only program on oblast TV--"Video Library."  Relying on her own judgments, Nina Zvereva is almost never  mistaken--about people or about situations. First-rate cameraman  Mikhail Sladkov works with her. She has been able to find the  most committed people for her news bureau, perhaps because she  is also wholly committed to her job. She has trouble taking it  easy on the weekend and has to conceal her eagerness to get back  to work from her husband.    It was the same sense of commitment that made Zvereva open  her school of television arts. At first Nina thought this was a  good way of starting a business of her own and making money. As  soon as the students arrived, however, she was hesitant: It  would have been like taking money from her own children.    The school already has several graduates. Each puts an  additional workload on Zvereva's news bureau, because all of her  students later come back to the bureau for advice on their own  reports. At this time Zvereva and Sladkov are teaching beginners  in television: Rayon TV studios are being opened in Nizhniy  Novgorod Oblast and they need personnel.    What Nina Zvereva would like to do is to teach  correspondents  for the Rossiya Television Network in Nizhniy Novgorod. After  all, it would be impossible to teach people in Moscow to work in  the provinces. She wants the school to have its own good  professional equipment and a nice building in the middle of the  city. I am quite certain that she will have all of this someday.  Nina Zvereva knows how to get what she needs.  <H5>  Reason Five: How the Governor Governs </H5>   There is another possible explanation for the uniqueness of  the television industry in Nizhniy Novgorod: Officials here are  distinguished by a particularly democratic style of  administration and do not exasperate broadcasters with stupid  regulations or try to keep journalists on a leash. Boris  Nemtsov, the Nizhniy Novgorod governor who is well-known all  over Russia, has his own ideas about the development of  television broadcasting in the region and, consequently, his own  preferences. After all, the governor is also a member of the  viewing audience.    "No one has to give me any reports on TV broadcasting--no  oral or written reports. I have always supported independent  television. Furthermore, I have no wish to issue orders to the  TV stations.    "My colleagues frequently reproach me for giving interviews  to journalists who always criticize me, but there are no  journalists with exclusive status in my office. A reporter from  any station can come to me and ask me any questions at all, even  the most unpleasant ones."    "How do you envision TV broadcasting in Nizhniy Novgorod in  the future?"    "In general, our case is unprecedented in provincial Russia.  They say that no other place has so many different broadcasting  companies. Now they are starting to compete with one another.  Obviously, someone is bound to defeat someone else. My job is to  prevent monopolization without interfering. If someone on the  highest level decides to herd everyone back into a common stable  again and to appoint a general administrator, I will object, but  if one company defeats another in competition, I will tell the  loser that he must not have been doing his job well....    "It seems to me that the companies with the greatest  prospects are not the ones in Nizhniy Novgorod, but the ones in  the cities and rural communities of the oblast that we are just  opening now. I am certain that the emergence of these  broadcasting companies is a step toward the civic society. It  means that people are acknowledging their common features to  some extent and are realizing that they have common problems. I  hope we will have our own broadcasting companies in all of the  rayons before I have to leave office."  <H5>  In Lieu of a Sixth Reason: You Have To Know What Life Is </H5> Like in Nizhniy Novgorod    The situation in Nizhniy Novgorod is unique in other  respects  as well. For some reason, people of different specialties regard  this Russian city as the test site for their social and economic  experiments. This was the site of the first organized  privatization program and the first auction in Russia for the  sale of land to the peasants. Imagine that!... Now trainees in  the TV industry can come here for experience, and I will not be  surprised if some of them decide to stay at one of these four  extremely promising TV broadcasting companies.</p>

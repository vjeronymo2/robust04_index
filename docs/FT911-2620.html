			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Monday Interview: Navigating in turbulent waters - Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank High in the slab-like Bundesbank headquarters in Frankfurt, an anguished-looking post-impressionist portrait hangs above the desk of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the president of Germany's central bank. The lugubrious painting, by the pre-war artist Karl Hofer, could hardly be in greater contrast to the bonhomie characteristically radiated by the man who enjoys his reputation as Europe's most powerful central banker. Yet, as the Bundesbank faces political and economic turbulence unmatched since 1945, the painting gives a clue to the challenges on all sides. The Bundesbank enjoys statutory independence from government. It has become the model for the European central bank which would eventually be set as the centrepiece of European monetary union (Emu). But perhaps the chief complexity facing Mr Pohl is that his own autonomy - both vis-a-vis the politicians in Bonn, and in the decision-making apparatus of the bank itself  -is clearly circumscribed. During the past year, the task of navigating between these limits has occasionally defeated even Mr Pohl's tactical skills, honed during two decades operating the levers of German monetary power, the past eleven and a half as Bundesbank chief. He heads the institution responsible for extending the D-Mark to east Germany last year. But the unsentimental Mr Pohl never regarded German unification as a great priority - and, in far more realistic tones than the government, consistently warned last year of the severe economic and social problems facing the east. In an interview last week, the Bundesbank chief, bronzed after his Easter skiing holiday in St Moritz, showed every sign of standing up to the strains. Perhaps partly because he has two children aged 10 and 12, he looks younger than his 61 years. Interestingly enough for a person whose Cassandra-like forecasts over east Germany have been largely vindicated, Mr Pohl believes that once the difficult transition is over, Germany will quickly extend its position as Europe's most powerful economy. With characteristic jauntiness, Mr Pohl displays one piece of evidence for his settled frame of mind. He brings out a photograph of himself and Mr Nicholas Brady guffawing at a joke during the US treasury secretary's visit to the Bundesbank earlier this month. Mr Brady, whom Mr Pohl knows well from the former banker's time at Dillon Read, came to Frankfurt partly to complain about Germany's tight money policy. On the back of the photograph, ready for presentation to Mr Brady as a memento, Mr Pohl has scrawled sardonically: 'Serious men, serious times.' Mr Pohl does not think much of the US administration's arguments, tailored above all to easing the US recession rather than meeting inflationary pressures in the still-buoyant west German economy. He believes that the D-Mark is somewhat undervalued - and that, especially if other countries in the European Monetary System continue to cut their interest rates, the German currency will soon move up again. 'The trend at the moment on the foreign exchange market is going in the wrong direction. The US, which is trying to come out of recession, does not need a dollar revaluation. And Germany, which is still experiencing over-heating demand in some quarters, requires a stronger D-Mark, not a weaker one,' he says. The German central bank chief made clear again at yesterday's gathering of the Group of Seven industrial countries in Washington that there will be no cut in D-Mark interest rates for the moment. The calls from the US represent just one of the conundrums taxing Mr Pohl. Pressure from European partners, with France in the vanguard, to accelerate the move to Emu has forced the Bundesbank to campaign against a premature dismantling of its monetary powers. Meanwhile, the continuing slide of the east German economy has badly unhinged German fiscal policy, requiring DM140bn in public sector transfers this year, and has also been an important factor behind the D-Mark's recent weakness. East German restructuring is 'an enormous problem', Mr Pohl says. But especially now that the government has at last decided, somewhat late, to raise taxes to fund transfers to the east, he leaves no doubt that the task is manageable. 'The former East Germany was only a small country - less than 10 per cent of West Germany's Gross National Product. The problem is that these transfers should have been financed to a greater extent through cuts in public spending in west Germany.' Mr Pohl's headaches at home have been aggravated by a battle with the German federal states (Lander) over streamlining the structure of the Bundesbank. Mr Pohl wants to push this through in a reorganisation made necessary by German unification. But he is at odds with a sizeable minority of the central bank's 18-man policy-making council, on which Lander appointees have most votes. Mr Pohl's relationship with the rest of the board, a mix of 11 regionally-appointed state central bank presidents and seven Frankfurt-based directorate members, makes for a fascinating case study in behavioural psychology. With just one vote out of 18, Mr Pohl cheerfully concedes his dependence on his colleagues. Strictly speaking, he says he cannot buy a postage stamp without consulting them. But he regards many council members with affectionate disdain. When in the limelight at international monetary meetings, Mr Pohl plainly enjoys not having to think about them at all. Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a professor and former state economics minister, now president of the regional central bank of North Rhine-Westphalia, is the newest of the 11 state bank chiefs on the council. He is also one of the most independent-minded, leading what some Bundesbank officials call 'a rebellion'. Mr Jochimsen has irritated Mr Pohl by writing to Chancellor Helmut Kohl to oppose his plan to cut the number of state central banks to eight. Mr Jochimsen admits of the increasingly acerbic dispute - which Mr Kohl will now have to mediate - 'For the image of the Bundesbank and the central bank council, this is not very helpful.' None the less, Mr Jochimsen is a enough of a heavyweight to lecture Mr Pohl on constitutional niceties: 'Assessing the direction of the structure of the federal government and the Lander is not for a top Bundesbank functionary to decide.' Mr Pohl's own relationship with Mr Kohl, always cool, took a turn for the worse last month when the Bundesbank chief termed 'a disaster' the consequences of last year's introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany. Mr Pohl was not told about the chancellor's sudden decision in February 1990 to propose speedy currency union with east Germany. The Bundesbank's advice to the government at least to consider the need for tax increases last year went unheeded - differences which have left their mark, despite efforts from both sides to smooth over the traces. Two days after his unguarded comments on March 19 in Brussels, which sparked anger in Bonn and depressed the D-Mark on the currency markets, Mr Pohl sent a letter to Mr Kohl saying he regretted the uproar. Trying to assure the hyper-sensitive chancellor that the Bundesbank was not attacking him, Mr Pohl stuck to the contention that east Germany was indeed experiencing a 'disaster' - but said he should not perhaps have admitted it. Mr Pohl says that his stewardship at the Bundesbank has taught him above all that independence can bring unpopularity. However, recent pressure has, if anything, probably strengthened his public image. 'Pohl is doing the right thing,' says Mr Karl Schiller, the 80-year-old former Social Democrat economics minister. Somewhat ominously for France, Mr Schiller warns that 'the greatest restructuring crisis of all times' in east Germany will inevitably delay the day when the D-Mark is abandoned as part of the establishment of a single European currency. Mr Pohl himself said with some satisfaction last week that a compromise Luxembourg plan to delay until 1996 the target date for setting up a European central bank - two years later than the French government desires - was 'a step in the right direction'. Significantly, by 1996 Mr Pohl's second eight-year term at the Bundesbank (it expires at the end of 1995), will have come to an end. A Bundesbank president may one day have to transfer control over German money to a European central bank. But his name is highly unlikely to be Karl Otto Pohl.

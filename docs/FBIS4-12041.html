			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A delegation from the Hebron Governorate visited  the Royal Hashemite Court today. The delegation represented  various popular organizations and the families of the martyrs  and wounded of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. It came to  express thanks, appreciation, and gratitude for His Majesty King  Husayn's noble and honorable pan-Arab and human stands on the  kinsfolk in the occupied homeland and for his majesty's  eagerness to stand on their side in all cases and under all  circumstances.    Speaking at this meeting, His Majesty King Husayn said:    [Begin recording] Brothers, I am thankful to have this  opportunity to meet with you today. This home is your home and  this place is your place. No matter how I try, I cannot find  the words to express my feelings toward the criminal massacre  and toward the suffering of the kinsfolk and brothers in Hebron  and everywhere in the occupied territories. You need not thank  me. We and you are one. We support you to the best of our  ability. With the help of God, we will continue to be as such  as long as we are alive, and until rights are restored to their  rightful owners--our kinsfolk, beloved ones, and brothers--in  the Palestinian territories. Please convey to the kinsfolk all  love and appreciation. I take pride in our kinsfolk and  appreciate their patience and endurance in the face of ordeals,  challenges, and sacrifices. Their sacrifices are made for the  sake of the Arab nation and for a future of justice, wellbeing,  and prosperity for the coming generations on their national soil.    May God bless you. Please convey to everyone that we here  are constantly for them and with them. We are confident that  justice will eventually prevail. If there is any way that we  can do anything, anytime, we beseech God to help us. I hope  that my kinsfolk and brothers here will bring to my attention  anything we can do to ease the suffering of the kinsfolk who  were injured and suffered. As for the martyrs, they have  preceded us down the path of martyrdom. They have fallen in the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque, near the forefather of the prophets  [Abraham], in Ramadan, and at the dawn of a Friday. Thus, they  have gone to heaven. I beseech God to make us among the  righteous martyrs in defense of the Arab nation and its rights.  I pray that God will inspire and help the revival of an  imminent Arab awakening to restore to this nation its status  among other nations, so that our nation, which is part of the  Islamic nation, will become the best nation on earth, as God  Almighty has wanted it to be.    If we fail to do anything, significant or trivial, forgive  us  and alert us, because nobody matches us in our eagerness to be  with you and on your side, as we have always been in all cases  and under all circumstances. National unity is not just  necessary, it is imperative; we are one small family within a  larger family, which is the Arab family. It is our destiny to  face challenges and dangers, to suffer, and to offer martyrs.  All this is an honor to us. I pray that the time will come  when everyone will appreciate the extent of what the kinsfolk in  the occupied territories have offered by clinging to their land  and rights, and by their steadfastness and endurance throughout  the long march. I beseech God to help us to be always at their  side. May God guide our steps and grant us success. Once again,  I address every thanks, appreciation, and gratitude for you as  you visit this home and place of yours, now and anytime. As  long as we live, we will take pride in our being one family.  Peace and blessings be upon you. [applause] [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

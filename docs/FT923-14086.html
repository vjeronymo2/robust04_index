			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Technology: Digital's package aims to revive declining - Hopes of commercial recovery lie in Alpha technology Digital Equipment, the loss-making US computer manufacturer, this week took its biggest step so far towards securing its future, announcing products that bridge the gap between the technology of yesterday and that of tomorrow. It announced: a series of 13 new computer systems, ranging from a desktop workstation to a small mainframe, that are compatible with its earlier Vax technology, but can make the jump to its new Alpha systems. modifications to its proprietary VMS operating system which will enable it to be classified as an 'open' system - that is, conforming to the broadest industry standards. a programme to make it simple for DEC's existing customers to move to the new Alpha systems as they become available. DEC, with annual revenues of over Dollars 13bn, is the world's third largest information technology company after International Business Machines and Fujitsu, but it lost more than Dollars 500m last year. Its success in the past decade has been based on its Vax computer family, a range of machines all of which use the same VMS operating system and which can therefore run the same applications software. It failed, however, to move quickly enough into workstations powered by Risc (reduced instruction set computing) chips, or into open systems, the fastest growing parts of the business. Its principal hope of commercial recovery lies in Alpha technology, which it has been working on for over two years. Alpha technology involves a 64-bit architecture or machine design and a 64-bit Risc microprocessor chip. Tests indicate that the Alpha Risc architecture is faster than the IBM or Hewlett Packard equivalent in transaction processing benchmarks, according to Geoffrey Shingles, DEC's UK managing director. The first Alpha machines will be available by the end of the year. There are now some 10m users of Vax technology worldwide which DEC hopes will switch to Alpha technology. The systems announced this week are intended to facilitate an easy move. The new machines, while running VMS, are designed so that they can be upgraded to Alpha by inserting a printed circuit board incorporating the new processor chip. At the same time, X/Open, the open systems standards body, has agreed that DEC's latest VMS operating systems conform with open systems specifications (in technical terms, its conforms with X/Open's XPG3 standard). DEC is calling the system Open/VMS. Michael Lambert of X/Open said: 'Digital's success in obtaining XPG3 conformance for Open/VMS represents a clear response to user needs and the strongest possible commitment to open systems.'</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Call to limit state pensions THE BASIC state pension should be paid only to those who really need it, Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, said yesterday. He told the autumn conference of the pensions industry trade association that the government should give benefits to those most in need. At present those whose only income is the state pension are considered to be eligible for supplemental social security benefits. Mr Amy said that when the state pension was introduced the link between old age and poverty had been much clearer. Now, roughly a third of pensioners were well off relative to the working population, making the case for a universal pension provision less convincing. Mr Amy also said that any increase on taxes on pension schemes in the Budget will reduce benefits for 7m scheme members and run counter to the government's policy of encouraging private pension provision. Professor Roy Goode, chairman of the government's advisory pension law review committee, told the conference that undue alarm had been created about proposals to require pension schemes to meet minimum solvency standards. The committee had recommended that schemes be required to have assets sufficient to meet 100 per cent of their liabilities if they were wound up immediately, a measure which some actuaries have warned could force schemes to sell up to Pounds 150bn in equities and buy gilts instead.</p>

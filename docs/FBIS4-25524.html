			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporters Ai Feng (5337 0023) and Bao </F> Hongjun (7637 3163 0193): "Reduce the Number of Overseers,  Increase the Number of Sanitary Inspectors--Ruan Chongwu Talks  About the General Idea for Reforming Hainan Province"]    [Text] "It is necessary to reduce the number of overseers  but increase the number of sanitary inspectors." This is a  remark very easy to understand which was made by Hainan Governor  Ruan Chongwu when talking about how government functions should  be transformed in the course of establishing a socialist market  economy. Some explorations have been made in theory and  practice according to the above idea.    These reporters interviewed him in Haikou a few days ago in  order to know what actually happened.    [Reporter] What do you think of the above simple and  figurative expression concerning the transformation of  government functions?    [Ruan Chongwu] Before answering this question, I should like  to explain the following view first: The readjustment of  interests is an issue that cannot be evaded in carrying out  reform. Generally speaking, our reform is in the interests of  the state, nation, and people. Meanwhile, reform is also a  process in which the interest pattern is repeatedly readjusted.  In the course of specific readjustments during a certain  period, four circumstances--gaining a lot, gaining a little,  gaining nothing, and gaining less--may occur. Interest  relationships will, to a certain extent, affect people's  attitude toward reform.    A great majority of the people in our country have benefited  from reform, which is also very obvious in Hainan. Since the  founding of the province six years ago, more than 200  enterprises directly under the provincial authority have  increased their vitality, as most of them have transformed  operational mechanisms and adapted themselves to the market. A  great majority of the masses have also enhanced their living  standards. However, in a certain stage of the reform process,  some enterprises may suffer losses and the income of their staff  and workers may be affected. This situation calls for our  government to exercise the role of leader and guide and take  care to exert influence on the main bodies of social behavior so  that the masses will, in light of the overall and long-term  interests, adopt a correct attitude toward the current  difficulty, continue to participate in reform enthusiastically,  and unite as one to strive for a magnificent future.    [Reporter] What has the view that you just talked about to  do with the transformation of government functions?    [Ruan] They are quite closely related. In the course of  moving from a planned economy to a market economy, fundamental  changes have taken place in the mode of allocating social  resources. Human, financial, material, and other resources which  were previously distributed by government planning are gradually  changed to be primarily allocated by the market. With regard to  government departments, their previous authority in target  assignment, examination, and approval have now been withdrawn,  or the procedures have been changed. If the minds of government  personnel are still confined in outmoded conventions, they will  feel "frustrated." Moreover, they will even feel that their  interests have been damaged because they have lost certain real  power which they possessed in the past. Though the great  majority of our government personnel are good, if this issue is  not properly resolved, some of them will consciously or  unconsciously take a passive attitude toward reform measures.  In the meantime, the masses will find it difficult to approach  government personnel for handling affairs as they are afraid of  seeing the unpleasant countenance of the personnel. If things  go on like this, the administrative efficiency and reputation of  the government, being the leader and booster of reform, will be  adversely affected, and the smooth progress of reform as a whole  will certainly be affected too.    [Reporter] Is it for the purpose of enhancing government  personnel's reform consciousness that you have clearly put forth  this issue?    [Ruan] Yes. Such consciousness is chiefly manifested in the  following two aspects: On one hand, every government worker  must more consciously treat and handle the issue in light of the  overall interests of reform. Our people's government has the  obligation to serve the people wholeheartedly, so it and its  personnel have no longer any interests of their own to consider  except for those of the state and the people. Hence, every  worker should seek his own development in serving the people.  On the other hand, government workers should perform their work  more consciously, vigorously, and in a clear-cut manner in their  specific actions of transforming government functions.    "Small government, big society" is an important experience  we  have gained. If government organs are excessively big, not only  do we have to increase administrative expenditure, but many  personnel have to "look for something to do." In this way, they  will take up this and check up that, only disturbing people and  making trouble for enterprises. We have carried out reform in  this area. In the future, we will divert some of our personnel  to work in enterprises or in the service sector.    "Reducing the number of overseers but increasing the number  of sanitary inspectors" is our general idea. Previously,  government departments were in charge of a good many links in  examination and approval, so they were regarded as "overseers."  What the market economy needs most, however, are not overseers,  but those exercising standardized management and supervision.  Hence, they are vividly likened to "sanitary inspectors." More  overseers mean more expenses, which not only increase the cost  of handling affairs, but reduce work efficiency. In addition,  the practice also provides opportunities of "seeking personal  gain by abuse of power" to a few personnel who lack strict  self-discipline. Since last year, our work to transform  government functions has started from this. For example,  according to the principle of "relaxing the procedures of  examination and approval while tightening management work" under  the new enterprise registration system which we have practiced  for a year, more than 100 units in charge of examination and  approval have been abolished, and only 24 are licensed to carry  on the work. This action has been well received, and, in a  certain sense, it has removed the cause of corruption in the  area of structure. Hainan's reform of tax collection and  control system and labor power employment system have been  carried out in line with this idea.    [Reporter] "Reducing the number of overseers" mainly refers  to changing the economic management method of the planned  economy, then does "increasing the number of sanitary  inspectors" mainly refer to how government work can be better  suited to the development of a market economy?    [Ruan] Yes, you may take it this way. Under a market  economy, both the buyer and seller determine their own actions  in light of gaining benefit to the maximum. The most  fundamental requirement of the market economy is: Any  enterprise and individual can freely enter or exit the market,  and commodities can circulate without restriction. Therefore,  the creation of a fine environment for free circulation in the  commodity, service, and factor markets is a matter that the  government should consider as top priority. In the past, there  were quite a few regulations restricting free entry, exit, and  circulation of commodities, and production factors which should  be considerably simplified now. For example, there were many  check-points on the roads that had fostered the malpractice of  levying charges arbitrarily. In Hainan this year, the practice  of collecting charges such as highway maintenance fees and  others by various departments has been changed to a unified levy  of "fuel sub- charge" by the petroleum retail sales department,  and various check-points on the roads have been totally  abolished, thereby creating the condition for free commodity  circulation. Of course, some concrete measures have yet to be  improved. Another example is that if property rights are unable  to circulate, it is very difficult to achieve the objective of  optimum allocation of resources. For this reason, we have  started to standardize transaction behavior in this field to  create conditions for property rights transactions. As regards  the labor force market, a job search agency has been set up so  that labor force markets in the province have been initially  centralized, which has played a remarkable role in the rational  flow of labor force in the province. While resolving this  issue, we should energetically carry out housing reform and  social insurance system reform to remove anxieties arising from  the flow of laborers. In short, we should create a fine market  environment with the authority of the government and its fair  service in a bid to fully mobilize the initiative of various  social sectors and give impetus to the development in Hainan.    [Reporter] Now we roughly understand the meaning of your  remark regarding "overseers" and "sanitary inspectors." It is  associated with the idea of strolling around a park, which  people are quite familiar with. The manager of a park is  capable not because he sets up many gates to collect tickets,  but because he puts in a lot of efforts to make the park very  clean and beautiful so that people can enjoy their stroll there  with pleasure. However, a market is not a park after all, and  it is not omnipotent either. In the meantime, market mechanisms  do not take effect spontaneously by solely depending on the  market itself, because the macroeconomic regulation and control  of the government should also be an essential component of a  market economy. What do you think the government should do in  this area?    [Ruan] Under a market economy, government's macroeconomic  regulation and control really play an important part. In my  opinion, the government should be adept at concretely exercising  the functions of macroeconomic regulation and control through  the following eight means--laws, regulations, policies,  planning, coordination, balancing, intervention, and imposition  of sanctions. With regard to the major projects which have  social benefit but lack good direct economic results, the  government must see to it that they are properly organized and  brought into execution. What is more, the government must  seriously manage rare resources and resources that cannot be  regenerated, guard against monopoly, maintain fair competition  and market order, stress efficiency while giving consideration  to fairness; ensure rational distribution, maintain good social  order, intensify ideological education, step up the building of  spiritual civilization, and encourage honesty while combating  corruption.    [Reporter] Judging from your above remark, it seems to me  that the government's duties have increased rather than  decreased, and its responsibility has become heavier rather than  lighter.    [Ruan] Yes, we will continue to perform our work in line  with this idea.    [Reporter] We hope that you will make even greater progress  in your work. Thank you for the interview.</p>

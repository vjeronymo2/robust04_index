			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Fashion: Big girls really can have more fun - A new focus on the fuller figure A NEW fashion shop will open on the high streets of towns and cities in the UK this month. Each store will be called Ann Harvey, with a smart cream and gold fascia and stylish window displays. Only closer inspection of the clothes and the swing tickets will reveal that the shop specialises in outsizes - specifically sizes 16 to 26. Ann Harvey has been born out of the Alexon Group and, over the next 12 months, aims to grow to be a 60-strong chain. It is a deliberate decision not to herald the fact that Ann Harvey is for larger women. 'We want to create a stigma-free shopping environment from day one,' says Mike Spencer, marketing director. 'We are a new fashion brand first and foremost, and, by the way, we cater for large sizes. With the fashion trend for fluid garments, there is no reason why size 12 and 14 women shouldn't shop with us as well.' Ann Harvey clothes are middle market and are aimed at the 25- to 50-year-olds, with a core target of 30- to 45-year-olds. The range is similar in styling and price to the fashion collections in stores such as Next, Principles or Wallis. The fabrics are good quality - silk jersey separates, silk and linen knitwear, Japanese polyester/viscose suitings, moss and satin-backed crepe fit-and-flare dresses featuring abalone buttons. Evening wear is strong, ranging from a sexy short velvet number to a sophisticated tuxedo dress and a variety of chiffon separates. 'Quality of fabric and detailing is very important in this collection,' says fashion director Lesley Thomson, 'as so often quality is sacrificed for price, almost as if there were a stigma attached to being large.' That there is a stigma at all is because society purveys the message that thin is good. Audrey Winkler, editor of Pretty Big magazine, says she is impressed with the quality of the Ann Harvey range. There is a great need for something like a Next for larger women, she says: clothes that are smart, fashionable and middle priced. 'Large women are women first and large second, they are no different to anyone else and they want more choice in fashion.' And there are a lot of them. For any fashion retailer addressing the larger woman, the most difficult problem to overcome is her frequent lack of confidence. Even now, when many are having the courage to take a symbolic axe to the bathroom scales (98 per cent of diets fail anyway), a great many continue to put their lives on hold, waiting for the day when they too will be thin. Tessa Bosworth, buyer for the Plus Collections in Harrods, who is herself a large size, says the larger woman needs to be reassured and encouraged to try on the clothes, because often even expensive designs have little hanger appeal. With that in mind the Plus department in Harrods in London has been extended and refurbished and this autumn will carry the new American Theo Miles Plus collection. Laura Pomerantz, executive vice-president, says that the Plus range is virtually identical to the Theo Miles standard size range (which will be stocked in department stores around the UK). But it is specially cut for the size 18 to 26 woman 'who I find is more fashion driven than other customers, and has only been limited by selection. Just because she is fully figured doesn't mean that she doesn't want tailored jackets and trousers: they will look good on her in the right proportions and colours.' As far as confidence is concerned, a lot has to do with the name. Evans, up to now the only national retail chain catering for large sizes, jettisoned the 'Outsize' part of its name more than ten years ago, replacing it with 'Collection'. Yet Evans is still dogged by the ghost. The Evans range has much improved; there are ongoing shop refurbishments and image-enchancing advertorials have appeared in quality magazines. Yet some customers still insist on turning the carrier bags inside out rather than venturing on to the high street carrying the Evans name. Janice Bhend, editor of Yes], a new consumer magazine for large women, believes that Evans will never lose the old image unless the name is changed. She suggests that Profiles - a sub-brand within the store - would be a good substitute. Hennes takes a subtle approach with its larger sized range - Big Is Beautiful (BiB) - which was launched in the UK in spring last year. The department is not even listed on the store directory board at the entrance to the shops. The BiB range is wonderful for casualwear, from jeans and leggings to chunky knitwear, separates and some soft suits. It is also very well made - which is just as well, as the prices are considerably higher than Hennes' main line: Pounds 69.95 for a jacket compared with an average of Pounds 39.95. Psychology also comes into it: size 16 is a small, 18 is medium, 20/22 large and 24/26 extra large. For women who prefer to shop at home - or who cannot face the high street - there have, until recently, only been the traditional mail order catalogues offering a limited and hardly high-fashion selection. Now there is Elegance, an up-market mail-order catalogue from Germany which also has a shop in Grafton Street, London W1. The collection includes fabulous tailoring and quality casualwear; sizes start at 8 and go up to 22. The company is planning a fashion show in September with models of size 10 and size 20 to prove the clothes look equally good on both. The visual presentation of large-sized clothes is a sensitive issue. Jacques Vert was criticised last year when it launched its Plus collection photographed on Rachel Hunter (Mrs Rod Stewart). Susie Orbach, author of Fat is a Feminist Issue, was quoted at the time as saying: 'They are perpetrating the very aesthetic they are ostensibly fighting against - that there is only one form of beauty.' Yet mail-order company GUS says it tried photographing its Fashion Extra catalogue on large models some years back, and sales plummeted: now the models are back to being size 12 and sales have risen. Catch 22? Slowly, there is beginning to be more choice in fashion for large women, and for this one can probably thank the recession, as retailers look to tap every market in order to boost sales. River Island is launching an XL collection, Wallis is introducing a size 18 (which will probably fit a size 20), and the Sears women's wear division - which encompasses Wallis, Warehouse, Richards and Miss Selfridge - is rumoured to be planning an outsize retail chain.

These are: Birmingham, Bolton, Brighton, Bristol, Bromley, Canterbury, Cardiff, Chester, Crawley, Hemel Hempstead, Ilford, Leeds, Manchester, Meadowhall, Milton Keynes, Nottingham, Staines, Thurrock, Tunbridge Wells, Watford and York.

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo climbs 2.2 per cent to a new high for the year EQUITIES climbed 2.2 per cent to a new 1993 high amid foreign exchange rate stability following the G7 accord in Washington, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The market was closed on Thursday for a national holiday. The Nikkei average gained 464.61 to 20,919.18, up 6.7 per cent on the week, after opening at a low of 20,502.06. The Topix Index of all first section issues rose 28.03 at 1,620,79 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.14 to 1,282.87. Volume was estimated at 650m shares. Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by 967 to 132, with 78 unchanged. Brokers said that the Nikkei had been expected to decline yesterday on profit-taking before next week's Golden Week holiday. The market will re-open next Thursday. However, heavy buy orders from foreign investors offset the day's selling pressure and generated a broader rally. But one broker at a Japanese securities house said hopes that the Nikkei average would trade higher after the holiday , based on historical chart movements, fuelled most of the session's gains. Nippon Oil, the day's most active issue, moved Y53 higher to Y854 in reaction to the G7 news to limit the yen's advance against the dollar. Telecommunications equipment manufacturers also gained ground, with Fujitsu up Y39 at Y800 and Mitsubishi Electric rising Y26 to Y629. Computer software companies advanced on reports that Sumitomo Bank intends to upgrade its on-line system and speculation that other national banks may follow. CSK, the largest software developing company, gained Y250 at Y3,320 and Ines, a major data service company, rose Y150 to Y1,520. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 343.85 higher at 22,628.08, in volume of 39.3m shares. Roundup THERE were mixed performances yesterday. MANILA closed at a record high, although investors took some of the profits made during the week. The composite index rose 9.74 to 1,604.33, 5.7 per cent higher on the week. Analysts say that excess cash in the system has been driving the market, boosting not only blue chips but also second liners. TAIWAN finished off its highs as profit-taking emerged in late trading. The weighted index, which gained more than 90 points at one stage, ended 36.05 higher at 4,563.52, little changed on the week, in turnover that rose to TDollars 38.7bn. Reports that Washington would place Taiwan on a 'priority watch' list of unfair traders, instead of the more serious 'priority country' list helped the market's mood. BANGKOK edged up from the day's worst levels in the last few minutes of trade but still closed at the year's low. Sales of shares in finance and securities firms left the SET index almost 12 points lower at one stage. However, the index pulled up to finish a net 4.28 easier at 845.29 or 6.2 per cent lower on the week in turnover of Bt3.3bn. It was the fifth day straight day of losses. KUALA LUMPUR saw further strength on demand for issues linked to the Morgan Stanley Capital International index. The composite index rose 14.61 to a new high of 719.61, up 4 per cent from the previous week. Volume rose to 548.1m shares. AUSTRALIA edged up on cautious trading, but turnover surged on options related trading. The All Ordinaries index advanced 1.2 to 1,681.5, but lost 1.2 per cent on the week. Turnover totaled ADollars 914.8m as investors exercised options on Westpac Banking and Broken Hill Property shares. Gold stocks regained strength, with Plutonic Resources, which announced a gold discovery this week, rising 78 cents to ADollars 4.50. HONG KONG eased on profit taking with the Hang Seng index closing down 53.54 at 6,830.51, 1.1 per cent higher on the week. Turnover was HKDollars 4.3bn. Issues which had shown strong performance recently met heavy selling: Hang Seng Bank lost HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 57. SEOUL retreated as profit-taking overwhelmed late buying by institutional investors. The composite index fell 3.19 to 721.57, losing 1.9 per cent from the previous week. NEW ZEALAND turned back after Thursday's peak in volume that fell to around half that of the last few days. The NZSE-40 index fell 16.13 to 1,611.74, little changed on the week. Analysts suggested that some investors may have taken fright at news that Chile's Copec, which is 30 per cent owned by Carter Holt Harvey, may report a first quarter net profit fall of some 50 per cent. CHH ended 7 cents down at NZDollars 3.07. BOMBAY fell on the release of some disappointing company reports. The BSE index lost 21.97 to 2,122.30. JAKARTA was higher on domestic buying concentrated on companies which have reported a sharp rise in net profit and have sound fundamentals. The official index rose 0.88 to 314.10, barely changed on the week. Jakarta International Hotel, which reported a 115 per cent rise in net profit, moved up Rp550 to Rp8,050.

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Long-term future of Rosyth in doubt as Trident bid fails THE LONG-TERM future of Rosyth dockyard, Scotland's biggest industrial site, is in doubt after yesterday's government decision to refit Trident submarines at the Devonport yard in Plymouth. However, the bitter blow to Rosyth was offset by promises of guaranteed work on surface warships until 2005. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, announcing the long-awaited decision in the Commons, said he expected the government's plan would cost 450 of the 3,700 jobs at the Rosyth yard, far fewer than predicted. Another 350 would be lost at Devonport, which employs 4,950, because of the declining refit programme. The redundancies could be absorbed 'without significant difficulties', Mr Rifkind said. The defence secretary later told MPs during an emergency debate that over the next 12 years Rosyth would be allocated 49 further vessels for refit work in addition to the 18 major warships referred to in his original statement. The decision concludes a two-year battle by Devonport to stop Rosyth setting up facilities for the Trident boats. Nuclear-powered submarines will in future all be refitted at the same yard as the Trident vessels. The work is estimated at between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 5bn over the next 20 years. Rosyth has up to now handled the UK's Polaris submarines, being replaced by Trident. Other nuclear submarines have been refitted at both yards. Devonport's Pounds 120m plan was Pounds 12m cheaper than Rosyth's, Mr Rifkind said. Total cost includes a further Pounds 116m worth of equipment common to both proposals, mainly from Rolls-Royce and Associates, which makes the submarine reactors. The overall difference, including savings on running costs, was Pounds 64m. The cabinet disqualified a last-minute bid by Rosyth, more than halving its investment cost to Pounds 60m. Mr Rifkind said it was 'quite unreasonable' to submit a completely new idea so close to the decision. The plan also contained 'unacceptable risks' by using an emergency dock. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, who had argued strongly in favour of Rosyth, insisted losing the Trident work was 'not the end of the world' for the dockyard. He said it would continue to provide thousands of jobs. But the strength of anger among opposition MPs was seen as the Commons held an emergency debate on the decision. Some Scottish Tory MPs joined opposition politicians in expressing bitterness at the government's 'betrayal' of its commitment to give the work to Rosyth. The cross-party Commons defence committee is to scrutinise the decision. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, its Tory chairman, said the MPs wanted to be sure that work given to Rosyth would be enough to ensure its survival. The work allocated to Rosyth would 'taper down' after 2000, he said. Rosyth would be the only yard receiving allocated surface ship work, and shipbuilders could join the competition for other refits. Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Rosyth, said the decision was 'a major setback'. MPs sceptical about work pledges, Page 8</p>

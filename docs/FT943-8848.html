			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Swiss banks The Swiss bank reporting season, which continues this week with first half results from Swiss Bank Corporation and CS Holding, remains under the shadow of the near 70 per cent fall in dealing profits announced earlier this month by UBS. The other two banks should also report lower dealing income. Indeed Credit Suisse, which is the main bank within the CS group has already announced a 35 per cent drop. To some extent such a development is inevitable since the big Swiss banks are actively involved in the bond market and carry large holdings on their balance sheets. But the Credit Suisse figures suggest UBS will stand out for the size of its decline. While the reason for this is obscure, the SFr1bn fall in UBS's first half trading income reveals a volatility in its earnings stream which gives pause for thought about its traditional premium rating to the sector. Through the recession UBS was helped by a relatively sound loan book and diversified sources of income. But this is a doubled-edged sword as there is now less room for bad debt provisions to fall. Lower spreads on international credits may also make it harder to boost its net interest income with the high quality lending which provided such a bulwark in the past. In the second half, CS Holding and Swiss Bank Corporation could reap further advantage from falling provisions. At both banks last year's provisions were more heavily weighted to the second half than those at UBS. Their greater leeway to compensate for shrinking dealing income may give their shares a relative edge.</p>

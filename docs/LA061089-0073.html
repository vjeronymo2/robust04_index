			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEW WORRY AS WHOLESALE PRICES SPURT 0.9%  </P> <P> Wholesale prices jumped 0.9% in May, considerably more than expected, as the  cost of gasoline, food and autos increased, the Labor Department reported  Friday.  </P> <P> The increase brought wholesale price inflation for the first five months of  1989 up to an annual rate of 9.4%. However, the financial markets and analysts  took the news calmly; economists attributed most of the rise to factors whose  main impact has already passed.  </P> <P> "This is not at all what it appears to be," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief  economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York. "It's an aberration. What you  have here is a continued effect of last year's drought and the oil price run-up  earlier this year."  </P> <P> Analysts said they expect wholesale price increases to subside for the rest of  the year.  </P> <P> "We should see annual rates of producer price inflation running more slowly, at  an annual rate of about 3.5% to 5%," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the  Boston Co. Economic Advisers.  </P> <P> May's price jump featured increases of 1.8% for passenger cars; 3.3% jump for  energy goods and 0.8% for food, with fresh vegetables accounting for most of  that.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Energy Inflation Peak  </P> <P> Faced with signs of a slowing economy, the Federal Reserve this week let  markets push interest rates down about half a percentage point. After Friday's  report, little further easing seems likely for fear it would fuel inflation.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, analysts said energy inflation seems to have peaked for the year  and that new consumer rebates by car makers should blunt further auto price  increases. Some speculated that many other price increases at the wholesale  level may not be passed along to the consumer.  </P> <P> "Consumers continue to be price-conscious, and businesses continue to be  cost-conscious in a very competitive environment," said Dirk Van Dongen,  president of the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors.  </P> <P> "So long as we have that kind of behavior in the economy," he said, "we don't  have any sign of inflationary psychology driving behavior. Consumers don't rush  to buy for fear prices will be higher tomorrow. And our people are buying  sharply, negotiating aggressively, because they realize they can't pass these  things on, willy-nilly."  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported that inflation for intermediate goods excluding  food and energy was only 0.2%, while prices for crude goods other than food and  energy actually dropped 0.4%. Thus, prices for finished goods of many types are  not expected to accelerate much.  </P> <P> "Vegetable prices were unexpectedly high, but we expect agricultural prices to  level and possibly even decline later in the year," said Stacy Kottman, an  analyst at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "There was a rebound in the  measured prices of autos from April rebates and incentives, but we don't expect  a lot of that to get into (consumer prices) because the auto market is quite  soft and the industry is in no position to make those prices stick on the  consumer level."  </P> <P> Kottman noted that the 3.3% jump in energy prices actually marked a slowdown  from a 7.2% increase recorded in April. "We think producer prices for energy  have finally ratcheted up to where they are compatible with the $20-a-barrel  crude oil we have had all winter, so we don't look for much higher prices  there," he said. "All that suggests that the producer prices ought to be fairly  well behaved by the end of the year."  </P> <P> Sinai said the high wholesale inflation for the beginning of 1989 will "lock us  into producer price inflation of about 6.5% for this year."  </P> <P> "So the message is that price inflation is still entrenched and will respond  only very slowly to a slackening economy. From the point of view of the Fed,  this is too high for them to ease any more."  </P> <P> Before seasonal adjustment, the Labor Department's producer price index rose  1.2 points to 114.2 in May, from a base of 100 in 1982, meaning that a selected  cross-section of wholesale finished goods costing $100 in 1982 would now cost  $114.20.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama" newscast] </F>   [Text] Members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN] have released a five-point proposal to begin a dialogue  with the government. They are demanding the recognition of the  EZLN as a belligerent force, a cease-fire by both parties, the  Army's withdrawal from all the communities--with a full respect  for human rights--and the suspension of the indiscriminate  bombardment of rural towns.    In the communique, in which it discloses this proposal, the  EZLN says that it does not have in its ranks or its leadership  any foreigner nor has it ever received any support or advice  from revolutionary movements of other countries or foreign  governments.    We have a report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal  de  las Casas:    [Santoyo] The EZLN has issued its first official communique  describing as unacceptable the federal government's conditions  for a dialogue. It added that it will put down its weapons when  its demands are fully met.    In the five-page document delivered to the newspaper EL  TIEMPO of San Cristobal de las Casas, the EZLN establishes five  points that must be followed to begin a dialogue:    1. The recognition of the EZLN as a belligerent force.    2. A cease-fire by both parties throughout the territory  involved in the conflict.    3. The withdrawal of federal troops from all the  communities, with a full respect for the human rights of the  rural population and the return of federal troops to their  respective garrisons in the different places of the country.    4. The suspension of the bombardment of rural towns.    5. Based on the compliance with the previous conditions, the  EZLN is proposing the creation of a national commission for  intermediation [intermediacion].    The EZLN adds that its troops vow to respect these  conditions  if the federal government does likewise; otherwise, it warns,  the EZLN will continue its military actions in the various  regions.    It says that it will abide by the laws of war as approved by  the Geneva Convention, respecting the civilian population, the  Red Cross, the media, the wounded, and the enemy troops that  surrender without a fight.    Furthermore, in six points, it explains the reason for its  struggle and the reason to clarify various matters regarding the  EZLN movement. First, it says that it has no foreigners in its  ranks or among its leadership. Second, it also denies that it  has any ties or links with Catholic religious authorities or of  any other denomination.    A third point stresses that its ranks consist of Chiapas  Indians who are the most humiliated and unprotected people in  Mexico.    In the fourth point, the EZLN admits that it has  sophisticated modern weapons and communications equipment which,  it explains, were acquired by contributions from civilians.    A fifth point notes that this struggle was started because  throughout 10 years they resorted to every peaceful and legal  means to solve their problems. The sixth point lists the  conditions for dialogue.    The subversive group also assesses the situation. It states  that nine EZLN members were killed and another 20 were seriously  wounded. It adds that the enemy casualties, including policemen  and federal soldiers, amount to 27 dead, 40 wounded, and 180  prisoners who were already released. It also says that during  the attacks against four jails, they released 200 inmates.    This first EZLN official communique was signed with an  explanation handwritten by subcommander Marcos and states that  it was issued somewhere in Mexico's southwestern mountains.    For its part, the special commission for the dialogue of  Chiapas' social sectors, which consists of Senator Eduardo  Robledo Rincon, Heraclio Cepeda, and (Andres Falgas Quic),  stated that if they are asked to form a negotiating commission  with the rebel forces, they will be glad to participate.    Meanwhile, Senator Robledo Rincon has made the following  announcement:    [Begin Robledo Rincon recording] We have been talking with  different organizations and parties, and they have expressed  their concern for their rank and file. We were allowed to  permit several leaders of these organizations and  representatives of relatives, as well as government officials,  to tour parts of the region, especially the Ocosingo area, so  that they can establish contacts in the different regions of the  state. [end recording]    [Santoyo] At the same time, the National Human Rights  Commission has reported that members of its delegation, which  consists of lawyers and doctors, has visited Altamirano and  Chanal, where there had been heavy fighting. They have said  they went to San Carlos Hospital and Santo Domingo Convent,  where they have received complaints of alleged violations of  human rights. Different townspeople have filed the complaints,  complaints, they said, which are being investigated.</p>

At the start of the  session, Assembly members rose to observe one minute of silence  in mourning for the martryrs who fell at the holy Ibrahimi  mosque, victims of armed Israeli elements.    Afterwards, Qaddurah and several members spoke. They  denounced this ugly massacre and stressed that the entire world  will realize Israel is a leader of terrorism that is protecting  extremism, organizing all kinds of crimes, obstructing the peace  process, and placing obstacles in order to foil the peace talks  and turn talk about peace and stability in the region into  illusions.

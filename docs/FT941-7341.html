			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Shareholders 'must see option scheme benefit' Executive share option schemes must be perceived to offer something to shareholders as well as to managers, National Association of Pension Funds delegates were told yesterday, Barry Riley writes. Last month the association controversially expressed 'strong disapproval' of the share option scheme since implemented by the investment group M&amp;G. Mr Angus Matheson, the association's investment committee chairman, yesterday praised the 'efforts and ingenuity' of several big companies such as Reuters and Grand Metropolitan in framing their more complex proposals. Instead of schemes linked simply to the share price - such as the M&amp;G arrangement - institutional shareholders are now expecting companies to relate the options to some more sophisticated measure of corporate performance, such as beating an index. The association, along with the Association of British Insurers, has for some time been pressing for executive share options to be subject to shareholder-oriented guidelines. But Mr Matheson said that, judging by the responses by companies to the association's consultative document on the subject, corporate respondees' level of understanding of share schemes was 'disappointing to say the least'. Mr Geoff Lindey, who is about to become investment committee chairman, said the decision on an appropriate performance yardstick was up to the company.</p>

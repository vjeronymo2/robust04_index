			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official  disclosed on 28 May that the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic  of Korea] plans to carry out missile test launches over the Sea  of Japan in a few days.    This information is the result of the analysis of data  provided by the United States. He said, "Preparations for the  experiment are under way. We have concluded that it will be  carried out in the immediate future."    The Japanese Government was able to confirm the test  launches  of the DPRK's "Nodong-1" ballistic missile in May 1993. It  believes that the missile to be tested this time will be  slightly bigger and that it will have a greater range.</p>

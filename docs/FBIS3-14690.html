			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman, March 29 (GNA)-- The Jordanian authorities  have started the application of new restrictions on traveller  crossing into Jordan through bridges with the occupied  Palestinian territories.    Without any announcement, the Jordanian authorities ordered  Palestinians to obtain an entry authorization ahead of crossing  its territories from the occupied Arab lands.    The new decision, the first such measure since 1967, is only  effective on residents of the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip who  are 45 years old and more and those living in the occupied West  Bank who are 36 years old and more.    Palestinian and Jordanian joint committees have discussed  here lately the movement of Palestinians through bridges linking  Jordan with the occupied territories.    The measures were apparently taken in light of the agreement  reached between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel  in regard with the Gaza-Jericho first accord.</p>

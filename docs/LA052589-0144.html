			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DETACHED HOME SALES IN O.C. DROP 26% IN APRIL AS SPENDING SPREE ENDS  </P> <P> Sales of existing single-family homes in Orange County plunged 26% in April, a  sign interpreted by some market analysts as the official end of a yearlong  spending spree that pushed the price of housing beyond the reach of many  would-be buyers.  </P> <P> Still, the California Assn. of Realtors reported Wednesday that the median  price of a detached house rose 2% to $243,485 last month, indicating that  softening sales have not yet caused prices to plateau.  </P> <P> Orange County's month-to-month sales decline was the biggest in the state but  the same pattern of falling sales and increasing prices was evident in almost  all of the residential housing markets surveyed by the Realtors group.  </P> <P> "This is the firmest evidence we have seen that things have slowed down," said  David Hensley, director of California forecasting at the UCLA Business  Forecasting Project in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Sales of existing homes fell 14.1% across the state, the Realtors association  said. It was the largest such decrease since January, 1987, when sales fell  22.4% following implementation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  </P> <P> The statewide median house price topped the $200,000 mark for the first time,  rising 2.5% to $200,784 in April from $195,815 in March. The statewide median  has increased 25.8% since April, 1988, when it stood at $159,542.  </P> <P> Real estate agents in Orange County substantiated the trade group's sales  statistics. "Houses last year sold in less than 30 days. Now you're looking at  90 to 180 days at least," said Sherry Powers, senior vice president of Grubb  &amp; Ellis in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Economists explained the seeming contradiction of declining sales and rising  prices by saying house prices do not respond as quickly to market forces as  sales.  </P> <P> "What we expect to see as homes stay on the market a little longer, the prices  will start to level off," said Roger Cruzen, spokesman for the Realtors trade  group. "We don't expect them to decline, certainly. But the level of price  appreciation should moderate."  </P> <P> San Francisco was the state's most expensive housing market in April, with a  median price of $261,520, the trade group reported. Ventura County was second  with $249,847. Orange County's $243,485 median price ranked third.  </P> <P> Sales in the Los Angeles area fell 2.6%, while the median price gained 3.9% to  $215,871. In the San Diego area, sales fell 20.3%, and the median price  increased 5.4% to $176,057.  </P> <P> The Riverside-San Bernardino area was the only surveyed region that experienced  a decline in price. The median price in the Inland Empire fell 0.6% to  $119,124, while sales were down 11.1%.  </P> <P> Rising house prices and sluggish sales have caused a problem for homeowners  trying to trade up to more expensive homes, because many are facing delays in  selling their old homes.  </P> <P> "Buyers are having to get swing loans and home equity lines of credit because  the funds to buy a new home aren't available yet because they haven't sold  their old house," said Bonnie Kalen, an Irvine loan representative. "There are  buyers out there, just not as many as there were last year."  </P> <P> Real estate agents said price increases have already started to taper off since  April. "Sellers are not getting top dollars for their properties," Powers said.  "They have to be realistic in their pricing or they just sit on the market."  </P> <P> Joel Singer, economist for the real estate group, agreed. "There is more price  undercutting in the marketplace now than there was 6 or 9 months ago," he said.  </P> <P> Real estate experts said the drop in sales was not unexpected because  first-time home buyers have been sidelined by soaring house prices and rising  mortgage interest rates, which have jumped nearly 2 percentage points during  the last 6 months.  </P> <P> While many buyers have turned to condos as prices of detached homes escalated,  statewide sales of attached housing also slumped in April, falling 10.8% for  the month. The median price of a condominium in California rose 2.8% to  $136,575 from $132,847 in March.  </P> <P> Based on April sales activity, it would take 5.6 months to deplete the current  inventory of single-family houses listed for sale, the trade group estimated.  April's inventory, up from 4.7 months in March, is the highest total since May,  1986.  </P> <P> "There is no question that the inventory situation has improved dramatically,"  Singer said. "It's a pretty good sign that the sellers' market of the last year  or so is moving toward a more balanced market."  </P> <P> The real estate group surveys sales of existing residences listed with brokers  in selected areas of the state. Its figures exclude new houses.  </P> <P> But an earlier report covering all real estate transactions in Orange County  detected the same trends as the real estate association. Earlier this month,  TRW Real Estate Market Information said residential sales fell 19% in April,  while the average home price rose 6% to $238,353. The TRW survey included both  detached housing and condominiums.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOME PRICES AND SALES ACTIVITY  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.76IN:2.22IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE>

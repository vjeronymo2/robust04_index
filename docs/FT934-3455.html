			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Assembly lifts Tapie's immunity Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman-turned-politician, is expected to face prosecution for alleged financial irregularities after the French National Assembly voted yesterday to lift his parliamentary immunity. The 432 to 72 vote followed a judge's request to investigate alleged misuse of corporate funds from Testut, a small near-bankrupt manufacturer of weighing scales which is controlled by Bernard Tapie Finance. The company was used to extend loans to Olympique-Marseille, the football club which Mr Tapie also controls, to buy football stars. Appealing to fellow deputies yesterday, Mr Tapie said: 'This assembly is asked to cast the first stone at me. And this will allow others to cast bigger, heavier stones perhaps at me, but perhaps they will also hit some of you'. Several deputies, mostly Socialists, have been implicated in alleged illegal funding of political parties by businessmen seeking public contracts. Mr Tapie built up his group largely by taking over failing businesses, often with credit from state-controlled banks, selling some of their assets and juggling the rest between various holding companies. According to Mr Antoine Gaudino, a former member of Marseilles' financial police, Mr Tapie has piled up personal guarantees to banks of nearly FFr1bn (Dollars 173m). Societe de Banque Occidentale, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, yesterday acknowledged loans to Mr Tapie, but would not reveal their amount. SDBO and other institutions are said to have a FFr79m mortgage on Mr Tapie's Paris mansion, which he admitted this summer was now worth only FFr30m.</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (16): Decisions must be made - Rail links / The case for a high-speed train from Barcelona to Madrid is clear SOONER rather than later, serious talk is going to have to start on Barcelona's high-speed train links with Madrid and with the French frontier, if the project is to be up and running by its 2004 target date. So far, plenty of discussions have taken place but no firm decisions have been made. The absence of clear rulings is distressing, because Barcelona, which is almost equidistant from Madrid and Lyons, in France, will be superbly served by a railway service that puts it within, at most, three hours of both cities. The case for a high-speed train link between Madrid and Barcelona is unarguable in terms of travel time. The air shuttle service between the two cities takes 50 minutes flying time - that is to say, longer than a high-speed train link, once check-in times and city-centre to airport transport is accounted for. With 2m people a year travelling on the air shuttle - at an inflated return ticket price of Pta 29,000 - the arguments for a distinctly lower-cost travel alternative are just as powerful. Barcelona points out that the high-speed train link between Madrid and Seville, a city which is economically negligible compared with Barcelona and less than half its size, has been a runaway success since it came into service in April 1992. The national railways estimated that 41 per cent of the 1m passengers that travelled between Madrid and Seville on the high-speed train in its first year of service had formerly travelled by aeroplane. Barcelona overcame one hurdle in its battle for a high-speed train when the principle was accepted that the bullet train into France's TGV network would pass through the city and cross the frontier at Port Bou, on the Mediterranean edge of the Pyrenees. There had been a counter plan that gave priority to the route into France via Bilbao, which would cross the frontier on the Atlantic side of the mountain range at Hendaye. It is not, however, clear whether the line will take the direct Madrid-Barcelona route, via Zaragoza, or whether it make a detour to embrace Valencia, Spain's third largest city. There is a strong lobby, centred on Valencia's fruit growers, that wants a fast train link for the area's produce to the frontier and to Madrid. Nor is it certain that the Barcelona connection, whether through Zaragoza or through Valencia, will be a genuinely high-speed train using the TGV's GEC-Alsthom system that is already in service between Madrid and Seville, or whether it will be downgraded to use Spain's Talgo system, allowing for maximum speeds of around 200kph. Whichever the final route, and whichever the type of train that will travel on it, new European gauge tracks, which are narrower than the Spanish ones, will have to be constructed to carry the trains into France. If the tracks are built to TGV specifications, the outlay for a route via Zaragoza to the French frontier is initially estimated to be Pta1bn. Draft plans at Madrid's transport ministry call for a consortium, in which public money would provide some 70 per cent of the cost of the Barcelona's high-speed rail infrastructure, with the private sector making up the balance as well as footing the bills for the rolling stock. Exploratory presentations of the draft cost breakdown by ministry officials to the capital markets, have proved encouraging. All that is required is a final decision on what type of train will travel on which of the two routes. Barcelona cannot afford to wait much longer.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Iveco gambles high stakes on future - Kevin Done examines the investment plans of Fiat's truck division THE stakes that Europe's hard-pressed truckmakers must gamble in order to survive have become daunting. The weaker players are being swept aside by recession. As the European truck industry slides into a fourth year of retrenchment, Iveco, the commercial vehicle division of Fiat of Italy, is reaching the climax of a L5,000bn (Dollars 3.35bn), five-year investment programme aimed at transforming its products and manufacturing operations. With capital commitments on such a huge scale, the truck industry is not for the faint-hearted. Iveco has been in loss for the past two years, as demand for trucks across Europe has fallen sharply, but it must maintain this level of investment to become one of the industry's elite. Daf, the Dutch vehicle maker which collapsed into receivership in February, is only the latest and most notable victim of the war of attrition that has cut the number of European truckmakers from 25 in 1975 to 10. The number shows every sign of falling further. Iveco has managed to establish itself among the 'big three' of the European truck industry, along with Mercedes-Benz of Germany and the Franco-Swedish alliance of Renault and Volvo. But it has had a tougher road to travel than any of its rivals. From a limited base in Italy in the 1970s it has been forced to undertake an ambitious series of acquisitions of some of Europe's weaker players. It has shouldered an important part of the rationalisation and restructuring of Europe's truck industry. Iveco fell behind its rivals in the 1980s in developing new products. It was distracted by the task of moulding disparate operations and corporate cultures from France, Germany, Spain and the UK into a single, integrated group, as well as creating a pan-European sales and marketing network. It has mounted a formidable effort in the past five years to close the gap. Each year, from 1988 to 1992, it has spent between 4 and 4.5 per cent of its turnover, or about L350bn a year, on research and development for new products. R&amp;D spending has totalled L1,706bn in the past five years. In the same period, capital expenditure has been running at between 6.3 and 8.8 per cent of turnover, or about L598bn a year, totalling L2,989bn. The goal has been to transform Iveco from a national company with scattered plants into a single, transnational company, firmly established in six countries, and with production, design and engineering linked by common systems and computer networks. The launch this week in Turin of two new truck series, EuroStar, for long-distance haulage, and EuroTrakker, for heavy off-road construction work, marks the climax of the product renewal process. But the series are hitting the market when the industry is 'struggling under the grip of the most hostile economic environment for over 20 years', according to DRI Europe, the London-based automotive analyst. Iveco has suffered two years of losses, while rivals, such as Volvo and Renault, are awash with red ink. Daf has crashed; Renault has given up truck assembly in the UK; AWD, the British independent truckmaker that took over the Bedford truck operations, collapsed into receivership; Mercedes-Benz has abandoned its plan to build a truck plant in eastern Germany. 'Truck manufacturers and dealers in Europe are scrambling to survive the most drawn-out recession in truck sales for more than two decades, which has settled like a blanket of gloom over the entire truck market in western Europe,' says Automotive Industry Data, the UK analyst. When Iveco embarked on its transformation project in the mid-1980s, truck producers were enjoying a four-year period of growth and profits, which peaked with record volumes in 1989. It must now make investments pay in an era when volumes and margins are under the severest pressure, and competition is intense. Iveco claims it has increased its competitiveness and expanded its global presence through the integration of design, manufacturing, logistics and marketing functions. It now has centrally co-ordinated R&amp;D, manufacturing and distribution facilities and is present in all the European markets. It has completed the reorganisation of the manufacturing assignments of all its plants in Italy, Spain, France, Germany and the UK. So-called modular construction, a strategy pioneered by Scania, the Swedish heavy truckmaker, to overcome its relative lack of size, became a guiding principle for Iveco. In 1987, its engineers working in three countries were given the task of standardising all the essential sub-systems of a truck - cabs, axles, engines, chassis frames and gearboxes - into basic modules. It has invested 8.2m hours of engineering into redesigning these five main sub-systems. Manufacture of the 'modules' is concentrated in specialised centres in Brescia, Bourbon-Lancy, Foggia and Turin. Assembly has been focused in Brescia, Langley in the UK, Madrid and Valladolid in Spain and in Ulm, Germany. Iveco claims to have cut costs significantly. It has reduced its suppliers from 2,000 to 700 as they switch from individual components to producing sub-systems. According to Mr Giancarlo Boschetti, Iveco chief executive, manufacturing rationalisation has allowed the company to reduce the number of components by 20 per cent. Standardised modules have made it possible to utilise in truck manufacture the sort of automated techniques associated with volume car production, he says. The sweeping renewal of products and manufacturing processes has spread to sales and marketing, says Mr Boschetti. Iveco salesmen will now have lap-top computers to give them access to the catalogue of modules that make up the product range. 'The salesman effectively develops the vehicle to fit the customer's needs,' he adds. Mr Boschetti admits that one priority is to invest in training for salesmen to 'ensure the benefits reach the customer'. He says this is where the battle-lines will be drawn between surviving truckmakers, as they all achieve similar levels of efficiency. But the revolution in sales and marketing is to be the next phase of Iveco's corporate revolution. For the moment, rocked back like all its rivals by the ferocity of the recession in the European truck market, Iveco is having to take more tactical measures to stem the losses. After only breaking even in 1990, and with losses of Fl 199m in 1991 and Fl 187m (Dollars 103.8m) in 1992 (Iveco is incorporated in the Netherlands), it was forced to cut its workforce by 4,000, or nearly 10 per cent, in 1992. This rationalisation has been led in the UK and in Spain, where its most recent acquisitions, Iveco Ford Truck and Iveco Pegaso, have continued to run up losses. It is pouncing eagerly on the opportunity offered by the collapse of Daf to try to recruit about one-fifth of the former Anglo-Dutch truck producer's main dealers in the UK. While markets shrink in Europe, Iveco is pushing to develop its presence in Asia. Exports outside west Europe accounted for 19 per cent of its sales volumes last year, compared with 13 per cent in 1989. It is establishing a significant presence in India and China. The key to Iveco's future, however, lies in delivering the promise of a corporate transformation in Europe. Mr Boschetti claims Iveco has gone through a 'corporate metamorphosis - a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis after being a caterpillar'. The question is, how well the butterfly can fly?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      BIG INVESTMENT, LITTLE REWARD  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Western Europe Truck sales over 3.50t gross vehicle weight  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1992     share      1991      share      Change                             per cent             per cent   per cent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mercedes           90,200     32.8     103,115     33.6     -12.5 Iveco              49,300     17.9      55,123     18.0     -10.6 Man/VW             37,200     13.5      37,664     12.3      -1.2 Renault RVI        23,700      8.6      30,463      9.9     -22.2 Daf                21,500      7.8      22,265      7.3      -3.4 Volvo              21,200      7.7      25,007      8.1     -15.2 Scania             16,100      5.9      18,674      6.1     -13.8 Others             15,800      5.7      14,766      4.8         - Total             275,000      100     307,077      100     -10.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Automotive Industry Data  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

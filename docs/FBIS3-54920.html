The Bishop has consecrated the building where the  Russian government will work from now on.    The Premier will work in the study formerly occupied by the  former Russian prime minister, Ivan Silayev, and then Boris  Yeltsin. The recent occupant of the study was the former speaker  of the Russian Parliament, Ruslan Khasbulatov.    The Bishop of Istra blessed the activities of the premier  and  the government. Chernomyrdin has handed over to him two icons  and added that over one thousand icons would be handed over to  the Russian Orthodox Church later.    Taking part in the ceremony was the first Vice-Premier Oleg  Soskovets who, together with other government members, moved to  the new study in the building at Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment.    A spokesman for the Council of Ministers has told Interfax  that the new government residence has an office for President  Yeltsin.    The building on the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment will have  previous telephone numbers for the government hot line. The  telephone numbers for the cabinet members will change due to the  building's being switched to a new automatic telephone network.  At Staraya Square, the telephone numbers began with 206. Now  the first three figures will be 205.</p>

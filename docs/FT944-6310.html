			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Breweries The chancellor's decision to leave duty on beer and spirits unchanged was not the best the drinks industry could have hoped for. A cut in duty to help breweries fend off the impact of cross-border shopping would have been ideal  -but the government was never likely to yield to their special pleading. The outcome was at least better than the feared indexation in line with inflation, which would have added appreciably to breweries' woes. The sector perked up yesterday, with shares in Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Whitbread rising by 2 per cent each and Bass by 1.5 per cent. This follows a burst of outperformance in the past few months which has left Whitbread and S&amp;N standing on a premium to the market, despite expectations of lower than market-average earnings growth. The re-rating reflects the higher valuation investors are prepared to give the breweries' retailing activities, as well as a general shift towards consumer stocks at the expense of cyclicals. But it may prove short-lived: results from Bass and S&amp;N next week are likely to highlight volume declines and intense competition. Moreover, low inflation makes it hard, if not impossible,to force through price increases.</p>

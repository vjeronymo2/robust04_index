			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Letter: Why there are no 'followers' Sir, Your columnist Joe Rogaly ('Business: ex cathedra', May 3) states that the Pope 'is regarded by his followers as infallible on matters of doctrine and Christian principle'. I make no comment on the subject matter of the article but I would like to say, as a Catholic, that the Pope has no 'followers'. There are certain religions or sects within religions in which the members could be described as the followers of a leader but that is not the case in the Catholic Church or, for that matter, in the whole Christian Church. We Catholics and all those who hold the Christian faith are the followers of Jesus Christ only. And besides not being the Pope's followers many of us do not accept this modern doctrine of infallibility. It is not an article of faith. I should add that encyclicals are not Scripture. They are the views of the 'CEO' and those who share his views, but there is a great variety of opinions in the universal church. The arguments and opinions expressed in encyclicals change with the times and contradict themselves over time. P J Pace O'Shea, 45 Fellows Road, NW3</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: IRA volunteers face tough choice The IRA is facing unprec-edented political pressure to lay down its arms, but the nature of its own military organisation means it is far from guaranteed that it will agree to a permanent cessation of violence. It is made up of 'volunteers', many of whom have remained on the sidelines of political developments. They have been hardened and encouraged by their 'war' against the British. Moreover, of all the statements made by the House of Commons yesterday, Mr Major's rejection of an amnesty for IRA prisoners would have touched a particularly raw nerve. The IRA believes it retains the capacity to continue to conduct a successful campaign of attrition against the British by attacking members of the security forces and perhaps targeting the mainland. Indeed, the latest peace process is viewed in the short-term as stemming from the IRA's attacks on the mainland over the past two years and the way they have focused government attention on the Irish question. The terms of yesterday's declaration fall short of the IRA's historic idea of victory, however - Irish unity and a withdrawal of British troops. In the next few days the IRA will be reminding itself that previous experiences of ceasefire led to a weakening of its morale. The IRA leaders face pressure from their political allies in Sinn Fein to weigh their options. But the men of arms see the question they face as what kind of initiative can they take if they are not to be frozen out by the climate of acceptance for the Reynolds-Major plan. The IRA is likely to seek concessions from the British government to mitigate any suggestion that a ceasefire amounts to a surrender. These may include a withdrawal to barracks of the security forces to match any ceasefire. As far as the IRA is concerned the acid test of whether peace is really on the cards will come nearer to Christmas Day, when the organisation will have to decide on what terms, if at all, it declares its traditional seasonal ceasefire. The peaceful three-month period before talks with Sinn Fein is being viewed in the republican movement as an attempt to put pressure on the IRA to extend its ceasefire well beyond the new year. It is not inconceivable that the IRA may be persuaded by Sinn Fein to declare an extended - though not open-ended - ceasefire in order to put the ball back in the government's court.</p>

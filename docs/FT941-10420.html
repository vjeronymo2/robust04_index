			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Polypropylene venture probed A chemicals joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Montedison, the industrial arm of the collapsed Ferruzzi empire, could dominate the technology for producing polypropylene in Europe, the European Commission said yesterday. The Commission opened an in-depth inquiry into the Dollars 6.6bn joint venture to find out whether such dominance could hamper competition in the polypropylene sector. Brussels officials said the companies' technology - Spheripol developed by Montedison and Unipol developed by Shell and Union Carbide of the US - was used by 70 per cent of the world's polypropylene manufacturers. However, Shell said it was querying the Commission's official statement on the investigation because Unipol was not covered by the deal, which brings together most of the two companies' polyolefin activities. The inquiry could last up to four months, further delaying a deal which was first discussed in September 1992. Talks were first held up last May by the collapse of the Ferruzzi family's business empire, and only went ahead when the second phase of a restructuring plan was agreed before Christmas. Both Shell and Montedison said yesterday they had expected the Commission to open an in-depth inquiry into the deal, because of its size - the joint venture would become the world's largest polypropylene manufacturer - and complexity. If the Commission decides the venture is anti-competitive it can block it or, more likely, ask for the deal to be amended.</p>

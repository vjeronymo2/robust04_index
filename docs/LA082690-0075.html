			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE WORLD ECONOMY;  </P> <P> HELP THE SOVIETS PUMP THE OIL WE NEED  </P> <P> The new status of American-Soviet relations offers the United States a way out  of our over-dependence on Middle East oil as well as a means of helping the  Soviet Union out of its economic chaos.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil exporter. Production from existing  fields could be substantially increased if Western drilling and refining  techniques were made available. In addition, while "proven" Soviet oil reserves  are not as great as those in the Middle East, some geological experts believe  that far greater reserves will yet be discovered.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has shown a reluctance to join Germany and other  Western European countries in helping the Soviet Union out of its grave  economic crisis. But if aid to Moscow were presented as a way of making us less  dependent on Middle East oil, it would likely be accepted both in Congress and  the nation. Actually, the aid would be minimal -- primarily loans for purchase  of drilling and refining equipment as a part of arrangements guaranteeing sales  of oil to the United States. Some Western oil companies are interested, though  they are understandably cautious about involving themselves in a country whose  future appears so uncertain.  </P> <P> A deal would be eagerly welcomed in Moscow. Soviet oil production actually  decreased by 8% in the last two years, due largely to inadequate drilling  machinery and absence of Western oil technology. At the same time, the Soviet  Union has more oil available for export than previously because the Soviets  insist on being paid in hard currency, and their traditional customers in  Eastern European don't have it.  </P> <P> The Soviets must find hard-currency customers like the United States. For lack  of hard currency, the Soviet government has warned it may not be able to import  enough grain to feed its people.  </P> <P> Eliminating our oil dependence on the Middle East would put us in an enormously  better position economically, and, given the current crisis, would ease  pressure to take military action that could have disastrous consequences. In  short, a deal for Soviet oil is a natural.  </P></p>

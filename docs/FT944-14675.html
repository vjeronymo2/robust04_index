			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust tumbles 45% in third term to Dollars 169m Bankers Trust reported a 45 per cent drop in third-quarter profits to Dollars 169m yesterday, but management of the New York banking group expressed satisfaction at the performance in what it described as a difficult business environment. The bank said its client financial risk management and propriety trading businesses had performed especially well. This is indicates that the problems Bankers Trust encountered earlier in the year in selling derivatives products and in trading its own money have partially eased. The profits are equivalent to Dollars 1.98 a share, compared with Dollars 3.60 in the same quarter of 1993. Net revenues were Dollars 542m, down from Dollars 773m a year ago, when results were boosted by record revenues from trading activities. Return on equity in the latest quarter was 15 per cent, a respectable figure among banks of its type. However, investors had hoped Bankers Trust would match analysts' earnings per share estimates of about Dollars 2.15, and the shares closed down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 65 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Although trading revenues of Dollars 278m were down from last year's record Dollars 431m, they were stronger than analysts had expected. Net interest revenues, however, came in well below forecasts at Dollars 264m. An increase in assets under management helped lift fiduciary and fund management revenues slightly, to Dollars 188m, but fees and commissions slipped 18 per cent to Dollars 163m due to the slowdown in corporate finance activity.</p>

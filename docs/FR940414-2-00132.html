Including Texas, there are 21 States, the Alabama Liquefied Petroleum Gas Board, the District of Columbia, 9 Canadian Provinces, and one Canadian Territory which have PI programs which the FHWA has determined to be comparable to, or as effective as, the Federal PI requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This docket will remain open until further notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit written, signed comments to FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;89&hyph;10, room 4232, HCC&hyph;10, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.

On December 7, 1988, the FHWA published a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (53 FR 49402) [Docket No. MC&hyph;113] which implemented the statutory requirements by amending part 396, Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance, of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). That final rule requires that CMVs operating in interstate commerce be inspected at least once a year. The inspection is to be based on Federal inspection standards, or a State inspection program determined by the FHWA to be comparable to, or as effective as, the Federal standards. Accordingly, if the FHWA determines that a State's PI program is comparable to, or as effective as, the requirements of part 396, then a motor carrier must ensure that any of its CMVs which are required by that State to be inspected through the State's inspection program are so inspected. If a State does not have such a program, the motor carrier is responsible for ensuring that its CMVs are inspected using one of the alternatives included in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 16, 1989, the FHWA published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (54 FR 11020) [Docket No. MC&hyph;89&hyph;10] which requested States and other interested parties to identify and provide information on the CMV inspection programs in their States. Upon review of the information submitted, the FHWA published a list of State inspection programs which were determined to be comparable to the Federal PI requirements on (December 8, 1989, 54 FR 50726). This initial list included 15 States and the District of Columbia. The list was revised on September 23, 1991 (56 FR 47983), to include the inspection programs of the Alabama Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Board, California, Hawaii, Louisiana, Minnesota, all of the Canadian Provinces, and the Yukon Territory. On November 27, 1992 (57 FR 56400), the list was revised to include the Wisconsin bus inspection program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Determination: State of Texas CMV Inspection Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 8, 1993, the State of Texas (the State) amended its inspection requirements for CMVs under &sect;23.101 of the Texas Administrative Code. The State requires CMVs which are registered in Texas to be inspected annually. The State defines a CMV as any self-propelled or towed vehicle (except certain farm vehicles with a gross weight, registered weight, or gross weight rating of less than 48,000 pounds) used on a public highway to transport passengers or property when: (1) The vehicle or combination of vehicles has a gross weight, registered weight, or gross weight rating in excess of 26,000 pounds, (2) the vehicle is designed to transport more than 15 passengers, including the driver, or (3) the vehicle is used in the transportation of hazardous materials in a quantity requiring placarding. Upon review of the material submitted by the State, the FHWA has determined that the Texas CMV inspection program in effect as of January 1, 1994, is comparable to or as effective as the Federal PI requirements. Therefore, motor carriers operating CMVs (as defined in 49 CFR 390.5) subject to the Texas PI program must use the State's program to satisfy the Federal PI requirements. Not all CMVs are subject to the Texas program, however. Motor carriers operating vehicles that fall below the threshold weight for the Texas program, but which meet the FHWA's definition of a CMV may continue to use alternative means to satisfy the Federal PI requirements (e.g., self-inspection, the use of a commercial garage or similar facility, or passing a roadside inspection that meets the requirements of 49 CFR 396.17).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

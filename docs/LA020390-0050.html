			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DIGGERS AND PLANTERS: GARDENING  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen:  </P> <P> * If your houseplants are dropping leaves, overwatering could be the cause.  </P> <P> During the winter, they need less water because there are fewer hours of  daylight.  </P> <P> * It's not too late to add more color to the winter garden. Check to see which  plants are in bloom at the nursery.  </P> <P> * While pruning roses, be sure to discard the old leaves and branches so they  won't become a home for insects and diseases.  </P> <P> * If you have a cool-season lawn (rye, blue, fine or tall fescue) and live in  one of the warmer local climate zones, you'll probably need to mow it once or  twice a week.  </P></p>

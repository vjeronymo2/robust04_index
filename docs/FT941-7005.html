			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets: Share crash on information superhighway - New York This is beginning to look a little worrying. First, US bond markets post heavy losses amid fresh concerns about the pace of economic growth and inflation. Then, one of the largest corporate deals in US history - the union between telecoms group Bell Atlantic and cable giant Tele-Communications - collapses, simultaneously knocking the stuffing out of merger-obsessed cable and communications stocks and creating a large pothole in the much-vaunted information superhighway. This nasty one-two punch left equity investors reeling, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average nursing a 52-point loss by Thursday's close. Since the Federal Reserve pushed up the bank overnight lending rate from 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent on February 4, the Dow has taken three steps back for every two steps forward. The net result is that the average has fallen 130 points, or 3.3 per cent, in three weeks of erratic trading. There are analysts on Wall Street who are unperturbed by these events, and who scoff at reports that the failure of the Dow to break through the 4,000 level marks the end of the great 1990s bull market. Their sanguine view of the recent selling is that it is part of a natural correction, a correction that was inevitable in the wake of the Fed's decision to tighten monetary policy. While this argument is compelling (share prices were looking overbought at the time of the Fed's move, so a rate increase provided an obvious opportunity for the market to let off some steam), the recent surge in long-term interest rates remains disturbing, not least because this was not how it was meant to happen - at least according to the Fed's plan. Remember, the logic behind the February 4 rate increase was that by pushing up short-term rates early, the Fed would assure financial markets of its commitment to tackle inflation, and create a climate in which long-term interest rates could stay low, comfortable in the knowledge that the central bank was ever-vigilant against the threat of an overheated economy and rising prices. Yet, since the Fed put up short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, as measured by the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, have risen from 6.30 per cent to 6.73 per cent. The yield on the 30-year bond has not been that high since June last year. This rapid rise in bond yields concerns stock market investors primarily because higher interest rates could undermine the robustness of the economy, and slow the pace of corporate capital-raising. Also, if interest rates keep rising, investors might eventually be lured away from stocks and into higher-yielding fixed-income securities. If this were not enough to worry about, the demise of the Bell Atlantic-TCI deal has further dented the stock market's confidence. The collapse of the merger, calculated to have been worth somewhere between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 30bn, is worrying on several counts. From a strategic point of view, the removal from the board of what would have been the largest and most powerful player in the cable-telecommunications game reduces the incentive for other cable, telecoms and technology companies to forge similar alliances. Those companies considering joining forces to compete with the Bell-TCI giant may now be content to enter the new age of interactive information technology, communications and entertainment on their own. From a financial point of view, the fact that the main reason the merger failed was because Bell and TCI could not agree on terms - Bell kept wanting to pay less for TCI (mostly because regulators have ordered cable companies to lower their cable television rates was likely to damage TCI's future cash-flow) and TCI was increasingly troubled by the drop in Bell's share price - means other companies seeking to conclude takeovers or mergers in the industry will be more reluctant to pay the top dollar. Moreover, unless the sharp drop in in the price of cable and telecommunications stocks is reversed, it will be harder to pay for deals with equity. One of the great features of today's mergers and acquisitions boom is that so many companies have been funding their acquisitions with stock. Last year, more than a third of all transactions in the US involved companies swapping stock for stock. Yet, if the value of stock starts declining (not just in the cable and telecommunications sectors, but in the market as a whole, if the current 'correction' continues), then companies will be less willing to use equity to pay for mergers or acquisitions. And, they are not going to be keen to start funding deals with borrowed money if interest rates keep rising, either.  ------------------------------- Monday         Closed Tuesday       3911.66  +  24.20 Wednesday     3891.68  -  19.98 Thursday      3839.90  -  51.78 Friday        3838.78  -   1.12  -------------------------------</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Sega surges 83% on strong sales SEGA Enterprises, the Japanese electronic games maker, continued its remarkable rate of growth during the first half, when sales surged 91 per cent and pre-tax profits advanced 83 per cent. The company said sales of home-use video games doubled during the half, in which it made greater inroads into the Japanese market share of the main competitor, Nintendo, which has traditionally dominated the domestic market. While many other leading Japanese companies' assets are shrinking and their profits falling, Sega has doubled in size over the past year, even though it was forced to pay Dollars 43m in a US patent dispute. Pre-tax profits for the half were Y27.4bn (Dollars 221m), compared with Y14.9bn for the same period last year, while sales were Y167.3bn against Y87.49bn. Net profits rose 72 per cent to Y13.77bn from Y8.01bn, and the company is to pay an interim dividend of Y12 a share, up from Y7 last year. Sega also runs amusement arcades in Japan, and reported that sales in this sector rose from Y18.7bn last year to Y28.3bn. The company has profited from a shift towards cheaper amusements as the domestic economy has slowed. The company maintained momentum in international markets after having scored unexpected victories against Nintendo last Christmas in the US. Domestic sales, which account for about 45 per cent of revenue, have also risen on the success of new games. For the full year, Sega is forecasting a 50 per cent increase in sales to Y320bn, and a pre-tax profits of Y50.3bn, also 50 per cent higher.</p>

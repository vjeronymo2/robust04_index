"As the world has changed dramatically after the collapse of  the Cold War structure, our country's handling of defense and  security must change as well," Hosokawa said in welcoming the  nine panel members.    He called on the group to discuss new defense policies "from  a stance that takes into account the changed international  situation, technological progress and economic and human  resources."    The panel is expected to put forward recommendations until  July for a revision of the national defense program outline,  which has served as Japan's basic defense policy since 1976.    The program calls for the government to maintain security  arrangements against large-scale attacks and also to build up  Japan's own defense capabilities to repel limited-scale invasion.    Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies,  including Japan's future role in United Nations-led peacekeeping  operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the  defense agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995.    The panel groups Kuniko Inoguchi, a Sophia University  professor, Yoshio Okawara, former ambassador to the United  States, Bank of Tokyo Chairman Toyoo Gyohten, and Makoto Sakuma,  former chairman of the Joint Staff Council.    The other members are Seiki Nishihiro, former vice minister  for the Defense Agency, Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of ASAHI  Breweries Ltd., Shinji Fukukawa, vice president of Kobe Steel  Ltd., Ken Moroi, chairman of Chichibu Cement Co., and Akio  Watanabe, an Aoyama Gakuin University professor.</p>

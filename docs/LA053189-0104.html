			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The chief judge of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Milwaukee said he  would begin a review of two cases in which District Judge Thomas J. Curran  ruled in favor of the General Electric Co. while owning GE stock. The U.S. Code  of Judicial Ethics forbids a judge from presiding in a case in which he or she  has a financial holding. The Associated Press discovered the incidents by  reviewing Curran's financial disclosure statements and cross-referencing his  stock holdings with his case files. In a telephone interview from Chicago,  Appeals Judge William J. Bauer said he would probe both cases closely and then  announce whether any action should be taken. On Friday, Curran, 64, said he  would notify counsel of the conflicting interest and avoid future involvement  in cases involving GE.  </P></p>

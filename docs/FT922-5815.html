			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Profits up 26% at Body Shop A FIRST profit contribution from the US and strong growth in continental Europe helped The Body Shop International, the beauty products group, to increase pre-tax profit 26 per cent to Pounds 25.2m in the year to February 29. Turnover rose from Pounds 115.6m to Pounds 147.4m, with overseas sales growing 45 per cent to Pounds 61.5m. The group trades in about 40 countries. Outside the UK, more than 100 store openings took the total to 517, while the domestic tally went up by 37 to 210. In the US, where 41 new stores brought the chain to 78, turnover rose 76 per cent to Pounds 23.4m, overtaking continental Europe, which went up 40 per cent to Pounds 22.3m. The group made Pounds 1.5m profit in the US, compared with a Pounds 600,000 loss the previous year when the transplant was at an early stage. Ms Anita Roddick, managing director, said there were 23 competitors trying to copy Body Shop in the US but she was confident of staying ahead because of the company's approach to product development and its campaigning values  -which she termed a 'magic 2 per cent'. Overall, overseas trading profits grew 59 per cent to Pounds 11.4m. Mr Stuart Rose, director, said the share of profit had grown from 33 per cent to 41 per cent. With 300 stores seen as the optimum number in the UK, there would be up to 25 openings a year, compared with 130 to 150 overseas. In the UK, where like-for-like sales growth slowed to 1 per cent, profit rose 11 per cent to Pounds 16.5m. Mr John Jackson, director, said there was no sign of a retail recovery. However, through store openings the company had pushed up sales by 17 per cent. The company had finished a Pounds 40m investment programme in its Watersmead site in Hampshire. Most of its products are made in the UK. The capital spending lay behind an increase in net debt to Pounds 32m, and gearing of nearly 43 per cent compared with 26 per cent in February last year. Net interest paid increased to Pounds 2.67m from Pounds 1.95m. On a slightly lower tax charge, earnings per share rose 31 per cent to 8.8p, against 6.7p. A final dividend of 0.92p makes a total of 1.6p (1.22p). Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Our Views" column: "Embargo of Dependence"] </F>   [Excerpts] The Greek Government's measures against the  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] have undoubtedly  achieved a very important result in every way. The measures  have deepened our country's dependence on the United States and  European Union, something that today, one month after the  measures were imposed, cannot be denied. What has followed the  measures leaves no room for misinterpretation or different  views. The Western allies who caused the problem with the  barrage of recognitions of the neighboring republic have  aggravated things anew by ignoring the positions of the Greek  Government. They now come as mediators, brokers, and cool  evaluators of the situation, with advice and threats, judgments,  and criticism. [passage omitted]    The course of developments should change, even now. The  measures against FYROM should be lifted and the stirring of  nationalism and chauvinism should stop. If nothing else, when  these feelings reach extremes, as in the case of the former  Yugoslavia, they only bring war, hatred, and the bestiality of  man. Direct dialogue with the neighboring state should begin  now, away from the tentacles of the "protectors." Doesn't their  involvement in the Cyprus issue over 40 years prove that they  bring tragedy to a country?</p>

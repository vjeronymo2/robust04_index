			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / US in dilemma on dealings with China: Can differences be contained or are the two sides closer to rupture? WINSTON LORD, the US under-secretary of state, could hardly have expressed the American dilemma over its dealings with China more succinctly. 'Our policy challenge is to reconcile our need to deal with this important nation with our imperative to promote international values,' he told the Senate earlier this year. 'We will seek co-operation with China on a range of issues. But Americans cannot forget Tiananmen Square.' Just how difficult it is proving for the two sides to achieve harmony in their relationship was amply demonstrated again this week when the US, in protest at Chinese sales of missile technology to Pakistan, imposed sanctions on the export of high-technology items to China, and Beijing responded angrily. Scarcely a week passes, it seems, without some further irritation to relations, involving disputes over a whole range of issues, from human rights to the transfer of military technology. In Beijing, US officials say that given domestic pressures on any US administration by vocal and well-organised interest groups, it is inevitable that Sino-US relations will have their ups and downs. The question is whether differences can be contained, or whether the two sides are coming closer to serious rupture. 'The problem is', said one official, 'that there is no over-arching concept of what the relationship should be. When Nixon signed the Shanghai Communique in 1972, no one had any idea that within a couple of decades it would have developed as it has. For example, in the 1972 document there was hardly a reference to business. 'Another problem,' he said, 'is that Chinese tend to entertain higher expectations of the relationship than we do. They have convinced themselves the relationship is more important to us than it really is.' Whatever the truth, there is no doubt that there is often a dis-connection between US policy towards China and expectations in Beijing. This tends to heighten disappointment among Chinese officials when things go wrong, and risks provoking an overreaction. So far, and certainly since relations began picking up again in 1991, after the chill caused by the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, periodic rows have been contained, and business has proceeded more or less as normal. US officials appear confident it would take a fairly extreme development to push the Chinese into some form of retaliation that might in turn invite further American measures, say on the trade front. They point out that China's trade surplus with the US reached Dollars 18.2bn (Pounds 12.2bn) last year, is second only to that of Japan, and is growing faster. In evidence to the US Congress this month, the Central Intelligence Agency predicted Chinese exports to the US this year would exceed imports by Dollars 24bn, 30 per cent up on 1992. With Congress increasingly restless over the US trade deficit, China, along with Japan, can expect a rocky road ahead. It would be surprising if Chinese patience were not wearing thin. Starting last year with the row over President George Bush's decision to allow the sale of F-16 aircraft to Taiwan, irritations have included the long argument over renewal of the Most Favoured Nation trading status, frequent exchanges over human rights, and recently a row over US interference with the passage of a Chinese ship to the Middle East that Washington claimed was carrying material to be used for making chemical weapons. Most galling for China, which has set its heart on securing the 2000 Olympics, may well have been last month's congressional resolution opposing Beijing's candidacy. Indications that the Clinton administration sympathises with the congressional majority have sharpened Chinese annoyance. Mr He Zhenliang, head of China's Olympic Committee, said recently he was 'totally against' Congress's action 'because it's an infringement of the Olympic principles, and that's unacceptable'. No country is perfect,' he added, 'even the US.' Adding to present uncertainties about how China might react to persistent American pressure on a number of fronts is the fact that the Chinese are undergoing a leadership transition, with various groups and individuals jockeying for power in preparation for the passing from the scene of the ageing paramount leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping. Harder-line elements have made little secret of their unhappiness over what they regard as unwarranted American interference in Chinese affairs. They harbour suspicions that the US is motivated partly by a wish to weaken, or at least restrain, China's growing power and influence in Asia and beyond. They are also outraged by what they see as high-handed US opposition to Chinese arms sales, arguing that China's weapons exports amount to only a fraction of those of the US. Mr Lord would not necessarily have endeared himself to the present generation of Chinese leaders when he told the Senate that the US should 'conduct a nuanced policy towards Beijing, until a more humane system emerges'. 'Shunning China is not an alternative,' he added. 'We need both to condemn repression and preserve links with progressive forces which are the foundation of our longer-term ties.'</p>

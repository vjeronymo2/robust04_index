			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: A MOMENT OF HAPPINESS AT THE SHORE OF GALILEE  </P> <P> We rushed through the Old City of Jerusalem, visiting various mosques and  shrines and holy places. Here and there priests of one sect or another were  singing their prayers before altars, oblivious of the herds of tourists. The  places seemed too ancient and too holy to be profaned by mere tourists.  </P> <P> The shops along the narrow lanes in the Arab quarter closed at noon. Our guide  told us that Palestinian protesters had insisted on the closing. Graffito was  scrawled on shop walls as a warning. But he said they needed the business, so  the half-day closing was a compromise. "Business before politics," he said  cynically.  </P> <P> That afternoon we drove the short distance to Bethlehem to see the birthplace  of Jesus in the Church of the Nativity, brushing past swarms of peddlers  outside the doors. The birthplace and the manger were contained in a grotto or  cave. It seemed strange to me that the exact site would be known, but our  guidebook explained that the knowledge had been passed down from father to son,  and the Christian emperor Constantine's pious mother, Helena, found it and  built a basilica over it in 325.  </P> <P> The next day we set out for Tiberias, on the Sea of Galilee. Everywhere I was  struck by the newness of Israel and the antiquity of its setting. At the foot  of the Mount of Olives we passed an automobile junkyard. On the desert roads we  passed several low-slung Bedouin tents surrounded by sheep, goats and donkeys.  Outside one, a woman on a horse was leading 200 to 300 sheep. A man on a horse  was following with some kind of flute. Our guide said, "Most of them use  cassette recorders now."  </P> <P> In Jericho, a green oasis in the desert and perhaps the world's oldest city, we  stopped at a stand where brilliantly colored fruit was laid out for sale.  Tangerines, grapefruit, melons, dates, kumquats, apples and prunes. The prunes  were imported from California.  </P> <P> Above the Sea of Galilee we stopped to visit a kibbutz. It seemed strangely  tranquil. Its residents lived in small row houses behind small yards filled  with bright flowers. A very young man sat at a table outdoors in front of his  house with his wife and a small child. His garden was vivid. "My grandfather  planted that garden," he volunteered as we strolled past. Another young man  rode down the walk in a John Deere tractor pulling a wagon full of children. It  seemed almost too idyllic, especially when one remembered that the hills of  Lebanon were not far away.  </P> <P> We arrived in Tiberias in time for lunch aboard a boat on the Sea of Galilee.  Though the day was clouded and the sea was not its storied blue, it was indeed  beautiful in its ring of mountains. I was offered a Joseph's fish but elected  chicken. The fish was large and whole, the shape of a deflated football, and I  did not like its baleful eye.  </P> <P> In the afternoon we visited several sites where Jesus is said to have preached  or performed miracles, including Capernaum, where he preached in the synagogue  and "healed great multitudes," and the Church of the Beatitudes, where Jesus  spoke the immortal words -- "Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the  kingdom of heaven. . . ." and the spot where he is said to have fed 5,000  followers with five loaves of bread and two fishes. A new church stands over  the site of ancient Byzantine mosaics. On a stone that served as the altar is a  mosaic of a basket of loaves and two fishes. Our guide asked for someone to  read an appropriate verse. One of our group, Ann Conway, obliged:  </P> <P> "He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? Go and see. And when they knew,  they say, Five, and two fishes. . . ."  </P> <P> She read it beautifully, and then we were on our bus again, arriving finally at  the beautiful Galei Kinneret Hotel at the Sea of Galilee.  </P> <P> Our room had a small balcony that overlooked the sea. It was late in the day  and the sea was dark bronze. A magnificent eucalyptus tree stood on the shore  against the cloudy sky. We had no sooner entered the room than my wife went out  onto the balcony and sat in the chair, facing the sea. I left her alone.  </P> <P> Half an hour later she came in. By then the sea was dark and a nearly full moon  had risen. She said, "I don't know when I've had time to spend half an hour  just looking at something beautiful. I cried."  </P> <P> I think it was the high point of our trip.  </P></p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Refugee record in Germany A RECORD 274,000 people have sought asylum in Germany so far this year, the Bonn government announced yesterday. This is 94 per cent higher than the figure for the same period last year. The announcement coincided with attacks by right-wing extremists on refugee hostels in several east German towns, including Markersdorf, Thuringia, and Spremberg in Brandenburg. Several people were arrested, but no one was injured in the incidents. However, a Pole was hurt when stones were thrown at his car and that of two others Poles while they drove through the border city of Frankfurt on the Oder. Mr Rudolf Scharping, Social Democrat premier of the Rhineland Palatinate state, called for the dismissal of Mr Rudolf Seiters, federal interior minister. He said he must bear responsibility for the backlog of 400,000 asylum applications.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kazakhstan to sell three oil concessions KAZAKHSTAN is trying to speed up western investment in its oil industry by offering three oil exploration blocks for competitive tender early next year. Deputy prime minister Baikenov said in London yesterday that if the first licensing round is a success, he will develop plans for offering other areas for international exploration. The three blocks on offer are in the Pre-Caspian basin: two in west Kazakhstan and the third in the province of Aktiubinsk. The newly-independent country is soliciting bids from the oil industry by May 1993 and the winners will be announced in July. Mr Baikenov said a 640km stretch of the oil pipeline from Tengiz to the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk would be completed in April, with a further 720 km to be added by November next year. He said this pipeline would be operational by 1995. He said the Kazakh authorities are eager to attract foreign investment for the improvement and construction of oil refineries and petrochemicals plants as well as for exploration. Kazakhstan has secured several big deals with international oil companies since declaring its independence from the former Soviet Union in December last year. Mr Baikenov said 28 projects are currently under discussion with foreign partners. Chevron, the US oil company, is involved in a joint venture with Tengizneftegaz to develop the huge Tengiz and Korolev fields in the Pre-Caspian basin. British Gas and Agip, the Italian gas company, received exclusive negotiating rights to develop the Karachaganak oil and gas field, which is estimated to contain two to five billion barrels of oil.</p>

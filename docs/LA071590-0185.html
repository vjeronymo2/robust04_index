			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREES GO TO ROOT OF URBAN PROBLEMS  </P> <P> If Joan Milke Flores and Gloria Molina are representative of the L.A. City  Council's understanding of the importance of trees to our urban environment,  then we are in serious trouble.  </P> <P> Trees are more important to all of us than we apparently realize. Few things  offer us so much for so little. Trees offer shade from hot summer sun and  harmful radiation due to the ozone depletion problem. Shade can cut cooling  costs up to 40%. Trees can also lower heating bills by acting as windbreaks.  Trees help combat "urban heat islands," which is the heat-gain in cities due to  a concentration of buildings, traffic, and dark, paved surfaces. Up to 10% of  urban electric demand is spent cooling buildings to compensate for this  heat-gain. On a more global perspective, trees help reduce the "greenhouse  effect" by replacing carbon dioxide (spewed into our atmosphere by cars,  industries, etc.) with oxygen, which we can't live without.  </P> <P> So dollar for dollar, we need to nourish and love the trees we already have. In  addition, we need to plant many more of them. We must plan ahead for our oxygen  supplies and reduction of electricity use which is produced by burning fossil  fuels.  </P> <P> The tree counting project is to help this urban area know where the trees are,  and how to maintain them on a regular basis so they can provide all of the  benefits enumerated above. An urban forest needs to be well-managed. Good  management needs data. The tree counting project provides needed data.  </P> <P> Flores said if the trees in the whole city couldn't be counted, then "they  shouldn't do any of the city." Molina said, "I think it is more important to  count police officers than it is to count trees . . ." And in the meantime, the  city heats up, our oxygen supply needs help, and there is too much carbon  dioxide in the atmosphere.  </P> <P> I suggest an intensive course for the L.A. City Council in how to increase our  oxygen supply, how to reduce electric use by greater dependence on a thriving  and well-nourished urban forest, and how to think beyond mere politics.  </P> <P> ULA PENDLETON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Cleaning up the farmyard THE spectacle of European Community farm ministers on the point of yet another stab at reforming the Common Agricultural Policy is never edifying. Bleary-eyed from all-night negotiations, they still manage to summon up energy for the struggle over concessions with which to soften the impact of any deal on their own country's farmers. The result, invariably, is a mess. So it was in Brussels yesterday. It remains profoundly unclear whether the reform deal which the farm council struck last night - after ridiculous last-minute blocking tactics by an Italian government that does not exist - will succeed in breaking the deadlock over agriculture in the Uruguay round of world trade talks. It is likewise moot whether ministers, in modifying the original blueprint for reform produced by Mr Ray MacSharry, the farm commissioner, have undermined some of its better intentions. Yet there is reason to give at least one and a half cheers to yesterday's accord. In accepting cuts in guaranteed prices of the order of 29 per cent for cereals over three years and shifting the basis of agricultural assistance from price support to direct income supplements, paid to most farmers in return for removing a chunk of their land from production, the farm council is doing much more than tinkering. It is laying the groundwork for transforming the CAP into what it should have been from the outset: a method of supporting farmers that does not turn the principles of world trade completely on their head. Export subsidies The reform will bring prices of farm products more closely in line with world levels, and thus reduce the need for wasteful export subsidies. It may make a significant dent in the EC's embarrassing farm surpluses. And if it is pursued relentlessly in the coming months and years, it should erode one of the CAP's more pernicious aspects - its lack of transparency - by curbing the proportion of assistance to farmers paid through indirect taxes on consumers. True, the transformation is at an early stage, and subject to many questions. The direct income payments, for example, are almost certainly cast too widely. They were originally proposed as a social and environmental subsidy to small farmers: how can ministers justify giving them to the 'grain barons' of Norfolk or Schleswig-Holstein as well, in exchange for taking only 15 per cent of their land out of production - a move which will not cut output by as much, and whose effects will eventually be wiped out by advances in productivity? Would it not be better to lower prices further rather than attempt to police the bureaucratic nightmare of 'set-aside'? Will income support, rather than simply providing transitional relief to hard-pressed farmers, become a permanent and costly fixture? Importantly for the Gatt talks, will the way ministers have twisted the MacSharry plan mean that EC farm policy still has unacceptable trade-distorting effects? US response Understandably, this last question is uppermost in the minds of the EC's American sparring partners. Yet it would be unwise for the US now to stick to an unduly dogmatic position in the Uruguay round. After all, Washington has over the years blamed many agricultural ills on the EC's high internal prices and the large export subsidies the Community pays to bridge the gap with the world market, while conveniently glossing over the trade-distorting deficiency payments it makes to its own farmers. The EC's plan is not just a different way of rigging the market in a business characterised by market-rigging in virtually every part of the globe. The policy agreed yesterday is, in fact, superior to the US system in important respects, since its income supports are not directly related to output as they are in the US. If recognition of that helps smooth the way to a Gatt agreement encompassing agriculture, then last night's deal will go down as a significant achievement. If the EC now keeps up the momentum for reform  - by working to make its food market more open to imports, by intensifying the price pressure on products in surplus, by moving to eliminate set-aside in the long term and by targeting support for farmers more closely on those who need it - it will come to be seen as historic.</p>

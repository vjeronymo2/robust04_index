			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CUOMO SIGNS BILL TO REAUTHORIZE SIMULCAST BETTING  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today signed legislation that reopens and expands New  York's shuttered simulcasting operations and could lead to renewed racing at  Tioga Park near Binghamton in Upstate New York.  </P> <P> The bill also promotes twilight racing, allows race tracks to operate their own  telephone betting lines and permits the New York Racing Assn. to run simulcast  teletheaters in New York City, on Long Island and in Westchester County.  </P> <P> The new law came one day after hundreds of Off-Track Betting parlors and race  tracks were left without live broadcasts of horse races because the old  simulcast law expired at midnight Saturday.  </P> <P> The state Legislature passed the racing bill in the waning hours of the regular  legislative session.

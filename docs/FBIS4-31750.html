			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] The workers on strike from the Warsaw Luchini  Steelworks are staging a demonstration in front of the Council  of Ministers' building. The demonstrators intend to hand in a  petition demanding implementation by the government of the  undertakings included in the agreement on the take-over of the  Warsaw Steelworks by the Luchini Italian industrial group. Jan  Szul is in front of the Council of Ministers building:    [Szul] About 3,000 steel workers are taking part in the  demonstration. They have marched 10 km from the steelworks gate  to the Council of Ministers building. Apart from the fact that  they want to hand in a petition to a government representative,  the steel workers also want to point out the fact that in the  process of negotiating the agreement by the Ministry of Industry  and the Ministry of Ownership Transformations employee interests  have not been taken into account. Trade unionists are prevented  from taking part in such negotiations. They usually learn what  the agreement entails when it becomes a fait accompli.    The government claims that it should not be the addressee of  the steel workers' demands. It believes that they should  approach the steelworks board, because the steelworks is a  private company now. The Italians own 51 percent of the shares.  The steelworks board, however, claims that it is unable to meet  the workers' pay demands because this would undermine the  plant's financial situation. It does not want to launch any  large investment projects either because, according to the  board, the legal position involving the ownership of the land  where the steelworks is located has not been properly sorted out.    At this time the demonstration is ending. In a few minutes  the steel workers will set off on their way back to the plant.</p>

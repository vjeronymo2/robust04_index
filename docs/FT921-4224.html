			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Gatt report welcomes Ghana trade reforms GHANA's trading partners in Gatt yesterday welcomed the 'substantial progress' in liberalising the Ghanaian economy but urged further reforms to boost economic performance. At the same time, they acknowledged a more open economy made Ghana more dependent on better access to foreign markets and a strengthened international trading system, and thus on a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round trade talks. A report on Ghana's trade policies by the Gatt secretariat, discussed yesterday by its governing council, says sweeping reforms since 1983 have made a highly protectionist economy an outward-looking one. In face of constraints posed by Ghana's dependence on primary commodities and high indebtedness, the reforms had succeeded in improving economic efficiency and reviving the traded-goods sector. Despite export diversification, cocoa still accounts for about half Ghana's export receipts, with minerals and timber products accounting for a quarter. Half Ghana's trade is with the EC, which gives preferential access to its cocoa and other agricultural exports under the Lome Convention. Ghana's reforms have included several currency devaluations and introduction of a market-based exchange rate system, a near-halving of average (unweighted) tariffs to about 17 per cent, and the scrapping of comprehensive import controls. But the Gatt report notes Ghana still has relatively high tariffs on consumer and 'luxury' goods, protects much of domestic industry with special import taxes, and maintains a variety of state aids, discriminatory tax policies and export incentives and curbs. Mr Kojo Amoo-Gottfried, Ghana's ambassador to Gatt, said yesterday Ghana was committed to more reform.</p>

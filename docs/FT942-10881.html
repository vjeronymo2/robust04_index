			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Halifax plans drive to increase lending share Halifax, the largest building society in the UK, hopes to take a 'significantly bigger share' of mortgage lending as part of an ambitious expansion put forward by Mr Mike Blackburn, its chief executive. The new strategy, which includes diversifying into new forms of lending and expanding existing operations such as estate agency, is a further sign of growing competition in retail financial services. Following Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn bid to take over Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society last month, several banks have said they would like to buy societies. In a document sent to its 24,000 staff, Mr Blackburn says a large proportion of its 1.8m mortgage borrowers currently buy nothing else from Halifax, 'which is not the case with our closest competitors'. Although the document says Halifax has 'an excessive dependence on mortgage income', it also argues that it should expand its 19 per cent share of the mortgage market by organic growth, and by buying mortgage books from others. Mr Blackburn, who was recruited from Leeds Permanent last year, has set a new 'mission' for it to be 'the biggest and best personal finance business in the UK'. It already has the largest share of mortgages, and personal savings. He said that Halifax, which has assets of Pounds 67bn and is about twice the size of Nationwide, the second-largest society, had not expanded other services enough. The strategy includes: Achieving 'stronger growth' of current account and personal lending business. The society also wants to expand its share of 'risk investments' based on the performance of shares, such as unit trusts and personal equity plans. Having the highest credit ratings of any of its peers. Mr Blackburn said the society should raise its current Aa1 long-term debt rating to the highest Aaa. Halifax also wants to diversify its funding base by issuing debt in a variety of international capital markets. The society is among those pressing for limits on wholesale funding to be raised by the government. Diversifying into new lending markets. An example cited by Mr Blackburn is private rental accommodation, which he said would be profitable 'with the right kind of tax breaks from the government for landlords'. Expanding Halifax's network of 530 estate agencies, possibly in Scotland and the south west. Mr Blackburn said that despite losses, it had potential. He said Halifax had no plans to convert to a public company because it believed it could achieve its ambitions under its current mutual ownership.

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Managers find block on career progress THE NUMBER of upwards career moves made by managers has declined by nearly 40 per cent since a peak in 1987, the Institute of Management says. In contrast, horizontal or downwards moves have doubled since 1980, Diane Summers writes. The institute says assumptions about 'onward and upwards' management careers may have to be dropped and managers adapt to sideways or even downward moves. But managers change jobs more frequently than in the early 1980s. The institute carried out a survey of more than 800 of its members' careers over the past 13 years. It found about 21 per cent changed their jobs each year from 1980 to 1982, while 29 per cent changed jobs in 1992. The reasons behind the moves have also changed, with those voluntarily choosing different jobs dropping sharply. Enforced moves - particularly redundancies and changes resulting from company restructuring - are now the main type. The study says it is not possible to link the most recent changes in managers' careers directly to the recession. Instead, changing patterns might reflect longer-term changes resulting from company restructuring. The Institute of Personnel Management today warns companies to tackle age discrimination voluntarily 'before social pressures force legislation to outlaw discrimination against older workers'. The institute says the recession has made the position worse. Are Career Ladders Disappearing? Institute of Management, Management House, Cottingham Road, Corby, Northants NN17 1TT. Free.

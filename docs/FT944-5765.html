			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Five groups seek Dutch mobile phone deal Five international consortiums submitted bids yesterday to set up a second Dutch mobile communications network to compete with the one established by KPN, the country's partially privatised telecommunications operator. The government will decide by April 1 which of the competing consortia - grouped around the Netherlands' three biggest banks, Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Telecom Finland - will win the right to challenge KPN's monopoly in providing pan-European GSM (global system of mobile communications) services. The long-awaited second licence is designed to inject competition in mobile communications in the Netherlands, which until recently had lagged behind its European neighbours in embracing the new digital standard. It is also seen as a dress rehearsal for next year, when the government hopes to issue a licence to the country's electricity companies, other utilities and Dutch Rail, the state-owned railway, to start building a fixed telecommunications infrastructure. This proposed domestic rival to KPN, which will initially be restricted to offering data communication services to business customers, is widely expected to seek a partnership with a foreign telecommunications group. The deadline for submitting GSM business plans of up to 500 pages was yesterday afternoon. The public works ministry declined to identify the bidders by name, but industry sources identified the consortium leaders as ABN Amro Bank, ING Bank, Rabobank, Deutsche Telekom and Southwestern Bell. ABN Amro's partners include Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, while ING's main partner is Britain's Vodafone. Rabobank's consortium consists, among others, of Schiphol Airport and Getronics, the Dutch computer services company. Deutsche Telekom's partners in the 'GSM Nederland NV' consortium include the newspaper group De Telegraaf and RCC, the Netherlands' former national computer centre. Telecom Finland has teamed up with Visa Nederland. The winning consortium will have to scramble to catch up with KPN, which launched its GSM network on July 1 and which has already signed up more than 50,000 subscribers. The 'GSM Nederland' consortium has previously said it could have its network up and running within three months, suggesting that KPN could start to face competition from mid-1995. KPN has already invested more than Fl 500m (Pounds 183m) in building its network, with future investments expected to take the total cost of its network to Fl 1.2bn. Despite the head start given to KPN, the second GSM operator is virtually certain to benefit from high profit margins in the early years of its licence.</p>

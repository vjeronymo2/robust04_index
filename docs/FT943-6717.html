			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / SNP to help with Tayside fuel bills A council controlled by the Scottish National party intends to help elderly and poor people pay their electricity bills by purchasing pre-payment electricity stamps from Hydro-Electric at a discount. The stamps will be sold at the discounted price through social-work offices in Tayside region, where the SNP won control from Labour in May. The SNP says the scheme will mitigate the increase in fuel bills caused by the imposition of value added tax. Hydro-Electric said it sold the stamps at a 3 per cent discount to shops for resale and had also sold them to the charity Age Concern. It said, however, that it had only had preliminary talks with Tayside. The SNP says the only cost to council taxpayers will be that of administering the scheme. It hopes to arrange a similar one with British Gas. The prospect of industrial action by electricity workers receded yesterday after National Grid, the transmission system for the power industry in England and Wales, made an improved pay offer worth 2.95 per cent plus a one-off payment of between Pounds 450 and Pounds 650. Unions are likely to accept the deal. b</p>

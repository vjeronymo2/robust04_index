			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Purchases boost Perkins Foods ACQUISITIONS spurred a 24 per cent rise to Pounds 11.4m in interim operating profits at Perkins Foods, the fresh, chilled and frozen food manufacturer and distributor. However, interest charges of Pounds 445,000 (receivable of Pounds 1.3m) left pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 up just 4 per cent at Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 10.5m). The group spent Pounds 20.6m on four acquisitions with up to another Pounds 17.4m of deferred consideration. It made three significant purchases in the last two months of 1991 and another in the first half of this year. The two divisions unaffected by acquisitions suffered profit falls. Fresh produce saw profits down to Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 3.5m) as good growing conditions in Europe produced an over-abundance. Prices began to fall sharply after the period end, falling 20 per cent in July and August. The division usually makes higher profits in the second half, but Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said that this year the two halves would produce about the same result. Profits from the mushroom division fell from Pounds 889,000 to Pounds 583,000 and management changes are being made. Frozen foods profits rose 38 per cent to Pounds 6.5m, all the increase from acquisitions. Profits from chilled foods rose from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2.9m, with about two thirds coming from acquisitions. COMMENT Now that the share price has ruled out acquisitions, Perkins will have to show it really can generate organic growth from its existing businesses. The 4 per cent decline on an acquisition-adjusted basis in the first half is not a good start, though other food companies may report even worse news. Sentiment has turned sharply against Perkins. Mistrust of the fresh produce business is likely to continue even after the current year's problems end. To hear that of four earlier acquisitions now past their earn-out deadlines, only one is performing well ahead of its earn-out profit target is hardly encouraging. There are still concerns over the deferred liabilities, especially if these are likely to restrain capital expenditure, and over the convertibles which now look unlikely to convert. Forecasts are for a fall in year pre-tax profits to about Pounds 23m (Pounds 24.3m) and an even greater slide in earnings per share. A prospective p/e of little over 6 is of less interest than the yield of 9 per cent on an unchanged dividend.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Christian-led army troops and pro-Syrian Muslim militia members battled with  tanks and artillery on the fifth consecutive day of sectarian fighting in  Lebanon, security sources said. At least 50 people have been killed and 155  wounded. The latest flare-up came a day after a car bomb exploded in front of a  crowded East Beirut bakery near the British Consulate, killing 15 people. Each  side blamed the other for the renewed violence, which followed four days of  fighting along the line that divides the capital city of Beirut and its suburbs  into Muslim and Christian sectors.  </P></p>

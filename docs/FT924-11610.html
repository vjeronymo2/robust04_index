			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Tube drivers offered payment to accept deal LONDON Underground has offered train drivers an extra Pounds 500 a year in an attempt to persuade staff to accept a radical shake-up of pay and conditions. Both Aslef, the train drivers' union, and TSSA, the white-collar rail union, are to ballot members on the revised package, which takes the pay of instructor-drivers to Pounds 24,000 a year. The result is expected by November 23, the date by which London Underground says staff must sign the contracts. The offer, made after four days of talks supervised by Acas, the conciliation service, includes concessions on earnings protection and travel allowances. TSSA said it was extremely disappointed that London Underground had refused to delay the November 1 date for phasing in the package, as it would be unable to complete the ballot procedure by the end of next week. The RMT rail union is also expected to ballot members. RMT described the package as 'unsatisfactory and unfair'. The deal would mean 29 per cent of the 21,000 staff suffering a reduction in wages after two years.</p>

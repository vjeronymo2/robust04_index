			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Relationship as 'special' as ever Sir, I was somewhat disappointed to read the article by Philip Stephens 'US and UK affirm unity on policies' (March 2) concerning John Major's visit to the US. I think there is a great danger in playing down the significance of Britain's relationship with the US. Americans, as we all know, are loath to indulge in self-deprecation and would find such an article difficult to understand. The facts of Britain's trading relationship with the US are nothing short of impressive. Britain is America's largest investor, and vice versa. Joint trade between the two countries is currently at about Dollars 70bn and there is absolutely no reason to think that the British-American trading and investment axis will not grow in strength, in particular as both countries are important stepping stones to their respective expanded marketplaces of the EU and Nafta. May I commend Mr Stephens to a more positive 'American' outlook? Peter M. Felix, Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The news conference of the Russian and Spanish  leaders ended in Madrid an hour ago. Boris Yeltsin and Felipe  Gonzalez spoke about the development of relations between our  two countries and about the documents they had signed. They  also answered questions from journalists. Among other things,  Boris Yeltsin was asked about his health. Here is what the  Russian president replied.    [Begin Yeltsin recording] I would like to wish every person  to be as healthy as I am at my age. Can someone who constantly  plays tennis very hard for an hour and a half at a time -- and  mind you, playing against masters of sports and honored masters  of sports; someone who swims in the Black Sea in March, with the  water temperature at four degrees; can someone who does all this  be in poor health? Someone who works 16 to 18 hours a day,  virtually without any days off. You have got to envy me!  Here's what I told the doctors: This year, let us arrange a  24-hour health check, to be attended by all journalists who so  desire. Any lab, you know, blood test, come on then, whatever,  so much urine [Yeltsin laughs]; and so on, for 24 hours, so that  not just Russia but the whole world may know what I've got  inside me. [end recording]</p>

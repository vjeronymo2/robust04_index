			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. OFFICIALS URGE BOEING TO HIRE LOCAL  WORKERS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council and the county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday  called on the Boeing Co. to hire local workers for B-2 Stealth bomber jobs in  Palmdale instead of importing about 450 employees from Seattle.  </P> <P> In separate unanimous decisions, the two governing bodies asserted that the Los  Angeles area has a large pool of qualified and available aerospace workers, so  the Seattle-based company need not maintain its $10 million-a-year,  government-funded practice of temporarily relocating its employees.  </P> <P> The two votes added to criticism of the program -- in which Boeing pays $25,000  to $50,000 per employee in annual per diem expenses in addition to salaries --  already voiced by several elected officials.  </P> <P> In a response issued Tuesday, Boeing Executive Vice President Jerry King  reiterated the company's claim that it has been unable to find enough qualified  workers locally. King called the relocations "neither an example of poor  management nor fiscal extravagance."  </P></p>

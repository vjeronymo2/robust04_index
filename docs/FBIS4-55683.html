			<p>BFN     [Text] Doboj, May 18 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces were on  Wednesday [18 May] attacking Bosnian Serb positions on the  fronts in northeastern and central Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serb  army command in Doboj reported the most violent attacks as being  on the Teslic front in the northeast, where Moslems launched two  abortive infantry attacks. Doboj's residential areas came under  artillery fire, which fortunately claimed no casualties.    Moslem troop movements were reported south of Doboj, on the  Ozren front and along the Banovici-Olovo line. The U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is increasingly blatantly supporting  the Moslems, the statement said. During Moslem attacks on  Tuesday night, UNPROFOR armoured cars would light the Serb  positions in the Bradinja area, which would then be subjected to  strong small-arms fire, the statement said. The Moslem  offensive on Mt Majevica in the vicinity of the U.N.-designated  Moslem 'safe area' of Tuzla shows no sign of abating, with  civilian facilities becoming the favourite targets, the local  Bosnian Serb army command said. On Wednesday, the eighth day of  the Moslem offensive on Mt Majevica, the Moslems fired more than  200 shells on the Stolice television relay and intensified  artillery and infantry assaults on other points in the area.    Bosnian Serb positions were not moved, however, nor were  there casualties among the Serb troops. The statement further  said that the Moslem offensive was receiving wholehearted  support also from NATO, whose planes buzzed the area on  low-flying reconnaissance missions, breaking the sound barrier.    The area of Bijeljina in the east, 20 km from the border  with  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), was on air-raid alert until  around 8 P.M.    In central Bosnia, two Moslem units attempted attacks on the  Serb positions 15 km from Kupres in the morning, but sustained  heavy casualties and retired in disorder in the direction of  Bugojno in the southwest. The local Serb army had no losses in  life or limb, army sources said.</p>

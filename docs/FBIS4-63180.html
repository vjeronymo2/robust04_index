			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Olga Gerasimenko report under "Very Personal" rubric: </F> "Shumeyko Is a Cossack, Although He Has a Ukrainian Surname"]    [Text] Yesterday journalists were invited to the  Federation Council for another rendezvous with Vladimir  Shumeyko. In his characteristic manner the speaker of the upper  chamber of parliament talked a lot, mainly in hints. From  Shumeyko's replies to written questions submitted the previous  day the journalists learned that Vladimir Shumeyko is a Cossack,  although he has a Ukrainian surname, that he was most  comfortable in the post of general director of a Krasnodar  plant, where "there was real power," and that he, Shumeyko, has  many pluses as a politician: communicability and loyalty to his  political ideals regardless of the political situation.  Vladimir Filippovich admitted that at first he had had a hard  time in Moscow because of his provincial origins, but then life  hardened him.    Answering the journalists' meticulous questions about the  cadre leapfrogging going on in the state, Shumeyko did not hide  the fact that he was directly involved in forming the Cabinet of  Ministers just once -- in December 1992 -- and even then on the  president's direct orders. He made literally this assessment of  the present premier's activity: "Russia is lucky that  Chernomyrdin is the premier at this stage." Vladimir  Filippovich spoke severely of Shakhray, who had resigned the  previous day, declaring that this will have no effect whatever  on the state of interregional problems, with the possible  exception that "with Yegorov's accession the resolution of these  problems will move from the theoretical phase to the phase of  their practical resolution."    Shumeyko was understanding about Nikolay Travkin's recent  ministerial appointment, declaring that Russia needs people with  practical experience. The speaker of the Federation Council did  not deny that he has close ties to the president, but exactly as  much as is necessary to engage in joint state activity.    He complained: "I have been told repeatedly that I am  Yeltsin's man, and he constantly transfers me now to parliament,  now to the executive. But I have never been unfaithful to  myself: I favor strong state power, and this is why I am in the  president's team."</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> MASKED YOUTHS BIND VICTIMS, TAKE $20,000  </P> <P> A Westminster man told police Tuesday that three masked youths entered his  home, bound and gagged him and a friend and fled with more than $20,000 in cash  and valuables.  </P> <P> "I was scared for me . . . my friend and my two children," 38-year-old Ngoc Le  said. "I told them (the robbers) I would give them everything . . . if they  don't kill (us)."  </P> <P> Westminster police spokesman Tim Broderson said detectives are investigating  the incident but said no details were available.  </P> <P> But in an interview with The Times, Le said the incident occurred shortly after  midday. Le, a storeroom clerk, said he was home on sick leave, nursing stomach  injuries received in an on-the-job accident involving a forklift. He said he  was feeding his 6-month-old daughter, Carol, when the doorbell rang. His son,  Ricky, 4, opened the door.  </P> <P> "One man came in. He (shouted in Vietnamese): 'Close your eyes.' He said if I  opened my eyes he would kill me," Le said.  </P> <P> Le said two men, wearing white and black masks, bound and gagged him. The other  bandit stood outside the bathroom door and waited for his friend, Linh Nguyen,  40, who was taking a shower.  </P> <P> "When I walked out of the bathroom," Nguyen said, "this man pointed a gun to my  head and told me to shut up." Nguyen, with only a towel around his waist, said  he was led into the living room where the robbers bound him and placed one of  his shirts over his face.  </P> <P> "They were going to (bind) Ricky," Le said, "but one of the men told (the  others) not to."  </P> <P> Le said the robbers took $456 in cash from his pants pockets and a gold  identification bracelet valued at $1,300.  </P> <P> Nguyen said the bandits took his watch and $82 in cash.  </P> <P> As the bandits barked orders and threats, Le said Carol began to cry. One of  the robbers placed the baby in an infant walker and ordered Ricky to push her  around the room to quiet her, he said. "Ricky cry too, but he stop after the  men tell him they would kill him," Le said.  </P> <P> "They were mad," Le said. "The first man (who entered) said he didn't want to  kill. He said I was not telling them the truth. He put the gun in my ear. I  could feel it in my ear. He said he would shoot" if he wasn't told where more  money was.  </P> <P> Le said that after one of the bandits struck him in his stomach, he directed  them to a chest of drawers where they took $810 and the Les' two diamond  wedding rings worth $16,500.  </P> <P> Le said the robbers also made off with his camera, videocassette recorder, Visa  card and checkbook.  </P> <P> After the robbers fled, Nguyen said they freed themselves and called  Westminster police.

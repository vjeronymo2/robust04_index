Last night and this morning the Serb  aggressors opened fire on all defense lines in the Bihac part of  the battlefield and on the Grmusa-Srbljani plateau. Several  defenders were killed in the bestial shelling. Karadzic's  terrorists intensified combat actions in the Bihac region zone  of responsibility of the Croatian Defense Council, particularly  in the [name indistinct] part of the battlefield, where they  tried to infiltrate commando units. The units were routed in an  energetic action by our fighters, but unfortunately several of  them were killed in the fighting.    Actions by joint forces of the paramilitary formations of  the  Kladusa autonomy and chetniks from the so-called Krajina  continued last night. Using 120-mm mortars, mountain artillery  pieces and antiaircraft weapons they continued destroying the  area of Cazin, and the villages of Skrivaja, Viskovac and  Hatici. A large number of defenders and civilians, who are  still fleeing this area from Fikret's demented blood-thirsty  phalanges, were killed in this round of fighting.    Also last night, Karadzic's terrorists, using howitzers and  mortars, shelled Bihac, Cazin, and their suburbs. Two people  were seriously wounded; eight others suffered only minor  injuries. Fresh material destruction is considerable.</p>

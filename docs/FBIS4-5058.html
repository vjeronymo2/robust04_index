			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- The Japan New Party (JNP)  led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Thursday [7 April]  it is suspending discussions on a proposed merger with new party  Sakigake, [Harbinger] another member of the seven-party ruling  coalition. The JNP reached the decision at a meeting of its  Diet members earlier in the day.    Many members voiced opposition to the party leadership's  plan  to suspend the proposed merger with Sakigake, which is led by  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, party officials said.    Hosokawa said Monday the proposed merger between the JNP and  Sakigake is "not a commitment."    The JNP, however, decided at Thursday's meeting to maintain  a  loose parliamentary group with Sakigake in the House of  Representatives.    Hosokawa and Takemura floated the idea of a merger last  summer while they were campaigning in the July 18 general  election for the House of Representatives.    The close ties of the two parties became a driving force in  creating the coalition government last August by uniting with  five other parties to oust the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  from its 38-year-old grip on power. But the relationship  between Hosokawa and Takemura has soured, making remote the  likelihood of a merger of the two parties, political sources  said.    The two leaders have differed over handling of tax system  reform. Moreover, in moves to form new political forces among  the ruling parties, it appears likely that Hosokawa and Takemura  will join rival groups, according to the sources.    The coalition government may separate into two groups -- one  formed by the JNP, Komeito and Shinseito, and the other mainly  by Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], they  said.    Takemura, meanwhile, indicated Thursday that his party may  scrap the merger plan with the JNP if the soured relations  between the two parties continue. In a meeting with reporters,  Takemura expressed dissatisfaction with the JNP's attitude  toward the idea, saying "if the JNP has changed its stance, I  want (the party) to respond a bit more fairly."    Takemura also said Sakigake will go back to the starting  point to reconsider the matter.</p>

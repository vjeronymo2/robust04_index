			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> FAVORITES;  </P> <P> WHERE A BOOK-REVIEW EDITOR GOES TO BROWSE  </P> <P> Vroman's on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, which is near my home, and Fowler  Brothers on 7th Street in downtown Los Angeles, which is near my office.  Vroman's won a lasting gold star in my editor's heart in November, 1987, when  it had, in stock, all five of the books nominated for the Los Angeles Times  Book Prize in biography that year.  </P> <P> Business at Fowler Brothers has been disrupted by the construction of the 7th  Street subway, but Bob Manners of the trade books department and proprietor  Sieg Lindstrom have a century of bookstore history behind them. Fowler  Brothers, having survived worse, will surely survive the subway.  </P> <P> Among specialist bookstores, Rizzoli's in Costa Mesa is admirable for the  beauty of its art-book displays and small, elegant exhibit space. For  children's books, I shop at San Marino Toy &amp; Book Shoppe (First Lady  Barbara Bush recently invited proprietor Betty Takeuchi to the White House in  connection with the Year of the Young Reader).  </P> <P> And for pure fun, it is hard to top Bart's Books in Ojai. In this used-book  emporium, an oak-shaded patio is enclosed by a maze of roofed bookshelves. The  cheapest books are in the open shelves facing the street. (After-hours  customers are instructed to throw their money into the patio.) There is also,  however, a small inner sanctum with treasures for serious collectors and a  glimpse of the book-cherishing spirit that makes this establishment possible.

NMFS proposes that these disaster relief funds, which were made available under the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act (IFA), be applied toward the following three programs, administered by the following intermediaries: A vessel permit buyout program_Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; and a habitat restoration program_Soil Conservation Service (SCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and a data collection program_Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), both of which would provide jobs to commercial salmon fishermen. The intent is to provide assistance to those fishermen who have recently participated in the salmon fisheries, who were substantially reliant on West Coast salmon resources for their income, and who suffered an uninsured loss as a result of a significant reduction in income because of the resource disaster.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments must be received by September 22, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be sent to Stephen P.

This aid is intended to alleviate the economic hardship imposed on individuals and communities by the collapse of salmon stocks in fishing areas along the Northwest coast. Included in this package is $12 million of aid that was made available, under the Secretary's declaration that a fishery resource disaster exists under section 308(d) of the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986, 16 U.S.C. 4107(d), to undertake the NEAP program as described in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, $3 million is being administered by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) of USDA. Grants by RDA will be made to public bodies and private nonprofit corporations to finance development of small business enterprises in cities under 50,000 in population. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) of the Department of Commerce is making $882,000 available, instead of the $700,000 originally announced as part of the $15.7 million aid package. Grants by EDA have been earmarked to communities for tourism development and to tribes for stream reclamation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the $15.7 million package, aid to salmon fishermen is also being provided by the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Farmers Home Administration, in the form of loans and debt restructuring programs, and by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Labor (DOL) in the form of unemployment assistance, up to $14 million, to dislocated Washington and Oregon fishermen who are unemployed as a direct result of the continuing effects of El Ni&ntilde;o on salmon fishing. A request for such aid for California fishermen is under review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On behalf of the Secretary, NMFS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28838), to solicit public comment on issues to be considered in development and implementation of the $12 million NEAP program. The comment period, as modified on July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35674), closed July 15, 1994; comments received are responded to in this notice. At the time the ANPR was prepared, NMFS anticipated implementing the assistance program through rulemaking. However, because codification of the program is unnecessary to comply with statutory requirements, implementation will be achieved through procedures proposed in this notice. Following consideration of all comments received, NMFS will publish a notice of the final NEAP program in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the ANPR, NOAA's Office of Sustainable Development and Intergovernmental Affairs (SDI) arranged a series of eight town meetings designed to gather information about the effects of the decline in the salmon resources on local communities and fishermen. Meetings were held between June 1 and June 10, 1994, in Fort Bragg and Crescent City, CA; Coos Bay, Newport, Portland, and Astoria, OR; and Port Angeles and Westport, WA. More than 700 people attended the meetings and provided more than 37 hours of testimony.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this notice is to solicit public comment on the limitations, terms, and conditions that the Secretary has determined are necessary to administer the program, within the conditions in section 308(d) of the IFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

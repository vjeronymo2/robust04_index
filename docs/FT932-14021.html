			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Election reform debate delayed THE ROW expected to erupt within the Labour party over proposals that it back proportional representation for Westminster elections was last night postponed for a month, Ralph Atkins writes. Labour's National Executive Committee had been due to discuss next week the proposal for electoral reform drawn up by Professor Raymond Plant, professor of politics at Southampton University, following a debate at the Parliamentary Labour party today. But after pressure from Labour MPs, the party's leadership agreed that the PLP should instead debate Bosnia today and proportional representation on May 12. Party leader Mr John Smith will now set out his views on the Plant report at the National Executive Committee meeting of May 19. Party officials were last night stressing that the delay will not stop a final decision being taken by Labour conference in October. A consultation period with Labour members had been promised over the summer but this will now be truncated. Last night the Plant committee of senior Labour figures was still finalising their report. Hopes that damaging splits can be partly ameliorated were raised after the committee decided there would be no 'minority report' - in spite of the opposition to proportional representation of several Plant committee members. Last month, Plant members agreed to recommend the supplementary vote system, similar to that used in France.</p>

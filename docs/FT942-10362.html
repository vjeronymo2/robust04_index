			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / The BBC makes a commercial break: The launch of a partnership The BBC intends to become 'number one in world television' to match its lead in radio, where the BBC World Service has 130m regular listeners a week, Mr John Birt, director-general, said yesterday. To complement its expertise and its lack of capital for investment in commercial ventures, the BBC yesterday unveiled its new international commercial partner - Pearson, the media group which has a 17 per cent stake in British Sky Broadcasting and owns Thames Television and the Financial Times. The public corporation and the publicly quoted media group will be responsible for the launch of two satellite television channels by this autumn aimed at the European market: a 24-hour news channel funded by advertising and an entertainment channel funded by subscription. Pearson is committed to investing up to Pounds 30m in the venture though this will fall to Pounds 20m if, as expected, a third continental European partner joins the project. As far as anyone could determine at the BBC yesterday the 'global strategic alliance' with Pearson is a unique example of a public-service broadcaster linking with a commercial group. 'We are satisfied, one with another, that we share a similar set of corporate values that underpin what we do,' said Mr Bob Phillis, deputy director-general of the BBC and a principal architect of the new strategy. The government has accepted in principle the idea of such an alliance ahead of a white paper on the corporation's future. But Mr Birt accepted yesterday that the government had neither seen nor agreed the details. Mr Phillis said the alliance was designed to lead Britain into a multi-media world. But it proved politically controversial. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow national heritage secretary, expressed deep concern that the decision had been taken before the launch of the BBC white paper. The Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom said the alliance as a purely commercial venture 'calls into question the very existence of the licence fee and the role of the BBC as a public-service broadcaster'. The Liberal Democrats said it would provide 'a British-based counterweight to Rupert Murdoch and to the other large international alliances'. The alliance will concentrate on provision of satellite channels outside the UK aimed primarily at continental Europe, Asia and the Americas. Programmes will be in English although other language channels could follow. Apart from taking World Service Television News around the world, the partners will look at the possibility of launching channels or part channels devoted to documentaries, children's programmes and education. 'These strengths are not particularly Rupert Murdoch's strengths,' observed Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames and managing director of Pearson Television Holdings, the subsidiary which will represent Pearson in the alliance. The BBC detailed a far-reaching reorganisation of its international and commercial ventures yesterday to make sure that 'no public funding plays any part in financing the international television developments'. A new organisation - BBC Worldwide - has been set up with three separate divisions all reporting to a Worldwide board chaired by Mr Phillis which will have no Pearson representatives. The BBC, which already works with Pearson in satellite channels such as UK Gold, the UK library channel, will take equity in the new joint-venture subsidiaries but will not usually put up capital. 'I have no doubt that this strategy will not just extend choice for countless millions of people around the world but also that it will represent better value than ever for British tax and licence-fee payers,' said Mr Birt.</p>

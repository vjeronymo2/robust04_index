			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Watching Germany RATES in the sterling cash market softened again yesterday as dealers continued to believe that the Bundesbank was positioning itself to cut its official interest rates. The German central bank's decision in recent days to reduce the rate at which it deals in the German money markets to 8.9 per cent has fuelled speculation that it could cut its official Lombard rate by about 50 basis points without causing a reversal in the D-Mark's fortunes. By contrast, Mr Norman Lamont's speech at the Conservative Party conference left dealers uncertain about the government's immediate policy on UK base rates. The chancellor said that he had 'not set a target range for the exchange rate.' However, he added that he did not propose to set a policy of of setting interest rates in relation to domestic criteria 'and then letting the exchange rate go where it will.' As one discount house trader said: 'The policy vacuum remains. We are no clearer about the UK's policy now than we were two weeks ago.' However, another suggested that the Bundesbank might end up 'saving Mr Lamont's bacon.' The December short sterling contract opened yesterday at 91.88, a level which assumes that there will be something close to a full percentage point cut in rates before the end of the year. As Mr Lamont's statements came out yesterday, the contract dipped to a low of 91.75, tracking a 2 pfennig fall in the currency. However, the contract later bounced back with sterling, to close at 91.93, 12 basis points up on the day. Cash rates were a little less volatile. The three-month offered rate for cash - seen as a good guide to the future direction of interest rates - closed at 8 7/8 per cent,  1/16 per cent down on the day. One month money eased for the second day running, closing at 9 1/16 per cent offered, from 9 3/16 per cent. Dealers were slow to offer bills to the Bank of England yesterday until Mr Lamont's speech was over. A shortage of Pounds 800m was forecast and later revised up to Pounds 950m. The Bank purchased Pounds 20m in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent, Pounds 138m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 170m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent. There was late assistance of Pounds 455m.</p>

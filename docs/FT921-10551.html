			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Contractors may be paid in Tunnel shares EUROTUNNEL, the Anglo-French tunnel operator, could offer new shares in part settlement of claims for extra payments of more than Pounds 1bn being sought by contractors building the project. Such a move would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders but might get over a hurdle of how to finance part of the increased cost of the project which since 1987 has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds 8bn. Eurotunnel's share price yesterday fell 15p to 445p following speculation that settlement of claims might include a share issue. Transmanche Link (TML), a consortium of five British and five French construction companies building the project, have been locked in negotiations with Eurotunnel over claims for extra payments since November. A member of the consortium said yesterday: 'Various possibilities are being explored including the possibility of Eurotunnel issuing new shares. 'These discussions are continuing and no deal has been agreed. If such an an offer was made it would form only a very small part of any settlement.' Eurotunnel yesterday declined to comment on speculation of how it might fund payment of claims. It said: 'At present there is no agreement in prospect either on the amount or on the possible form of payment.' It added that any issue of new shares 'would require the consent of Eurotunnel shareholders which has not been sought.' Transmanche is claiming extra payments of up to Pounds 800m at 1985 prices, including a Pounds 160m additional management fee, to cover the increased cost of fitting out the rail tunnels and building two passenger terminals at Folkestone, Kent, and Sangatte, northern France. Eurotunnel has told contractors that it has set aside contingency funds of up to Pounds 450m at 1985 prices to cover possible claims - although not all this money might be available if contractors do not substantiate their claims under the terms of the contract. TML has threatened to halt work on the project unless it is paid at least sufficient to cover the cost of the works. A bid by Eurotunnel to prevent contractors halting work on installing a cooling system in the twin rail tunnel was rejected last month by the British Court of Appeal. The contractors, however, are unlikely to halt work while negotiations are continuing. Lex, Page 18</p>

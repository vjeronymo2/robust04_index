			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Expansion at Lancashire Enterprises Lancashire Enterprises, the privatised regeneration company formerly owned by Lancashire county council, is to form a national economic development company. The new company will operate partnerships with construction companies and local authorities based on its successful Lancashire model. LE, which floated in 1989 to head off government restrictions on trading by councils, has had four years of profitable expansion, with turnover growth from Pounds 6m to Pounds 15m. Pre-tax profits rose from just under Pounds 1m to Pounds 3m last year. Its shares, which are traded on a matched bargain basis, were selling at 520p last week, compared with 116p at launch. LE's basic approach was to capitalise money given by the county council in 1981 and use it to redevelop closed-down factories and old mills in Lancashire. This provided property income from rent and trading, which was then channelled into economic development. The Labour-controlled county council - which has always given cross-party support - got dividends. A portfolio of start-up and venture capital funds followed, with subsequent corporate finance activities to help companies grow, as well as consultancy throughout Europe. LE now employs 270 people and has offices in Manchester, Brussels, Luxembourg, Ireland, Lublin in Poland, Brno in the Czech Republic, and Nyiregyhaza in Hungary. Only a third of turnover is now with Lancashire County Council. Customers include the EC, UK government, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Jim Mason, the chairman, who is a former deputy chairman of the Co-operative Bank, said yesterday: 'This will be a natural expansion. We have always acted as a bridge between public and private sectors and it has been consistently demonstrated that the market is willing to pay a fair price for our services.' The new company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, will be called UK Economic Development Partnership. It will be financed from retained profits. Ironically, the government's attempts to curb trading by local authorities triggered the growth: once privatised, LE was able to break out of its Lancashire base and establish the market for the new company.</p>

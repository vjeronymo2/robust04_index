			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / US consumer confidence up US consumer confidence rose nearly two points in December, to 102.2, its highest level in more than four years, the Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, reported yesterday. Confidence varied substantially by region with gains in central and southern regions offset by modest declines on the east and west coasts. Separately, the National Association of Realtors reported a 2.6 per cent decline in sales of existing (as opposed to new) homes between October and November, to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 3.81m. Sales were 7.5 per cent down from November last year. Analysts blamed sluggish sales on recent increases in mortgage rates.</p>

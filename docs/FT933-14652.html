			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro sees bigger loss ONTARIO Hydro, North America's second-biggest power utility, has raised its 1993 loss estimate to CDollars 1.6bn (USDollars 1.25bn), citing slack demand for electricity, write-offs related to restructuring, and continuing problems at a nuclear power station. Long-term borrowings this year are also likely to rise from CDollars 3.2bn to CDollars 3.6bn, due to lower funds generated from operations and an increase in the amount of bonds called so far this year. A further CDollars 400m increase in the borrowing requirement will be necessary if debt-restructuring proposals are approved. The provincially-owned utility, which is based in Toronto, earlier this year forecast a break-even in operations. But it said yesterday that it now expected a CDollars 200m loss. It ascribed the setback to a variety of factors, ranging from the weak economy to unusual weather patterns and higher fossil-fuel energy costs. It also said the economic outlook for future years was less rosy than anticipated. The extent of this year's loss will probably result in the depletion of the utility's fund for rate stabilisation and contingencies, which stands at about CDollars 1.6bn. However, it reaffirmed its earlier promise to freeze electricity rates next year following several years of steep increases. The rates freeze was among the early moves made by Mr Maurice Strong, who organised last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, when he took the reins of Ontario Hydro earlier this year. Mr Strong pledged a thorough shake-up and has also given notice of several thousand lay-offs. However, Energy Probe, a lobby group, expressed doubts yesterday whether the promise to keep rates unchanged next year can be met.</p>

Permit me  first of all to deliver greetings from the president of Russia  to this state authority, the State Duma.    Esteemed deputies of the State Duma! The Federation Council  and the State Duma of Russia today commence work. For the first  time in the history of our country, the representative and  legislative body has been elected on a multi-party basis in an  environment of a free contest of views, positions, and  philosophies. The Russian Federation parliament is beginning  its work under a real division of powers, which is not only  proclaimed by the Russian Constitution, but also is consistently  implemented in its provisions. This is the most important  condition for constructive interaction between the Federal  Assembly, the president, the government, and all bodies of state  in the country.    Before us stands one task that unites us all: to seek  decisions that take the fullest possible account of the  diversity of interests that is natural in any pluralist society.  A range of groups within society is represented in the current  Russian parliament -- a range of sentiments and opinions in  contemporary Russia are reflected here. I do not call upon you  to show unanimity, but it will be difficult to save our country  from upheaval without acknowledging and rallying toward shared  values. These values are civic peace, stability, the unity of  the country, and its renewal.    We are responsible for this. Our electors live and want to  live in a peaceful Russia. They desire stability and calm, and  all the arms of power should not confound the aspirations of the  people of Russia. We should all unite in our striving to  preserve the integrity of the country, the dignity of Russia,  and a sense of civic pride in our fellow countrymen.    One of the major tasks facing us is to overcome the economic  crisis, and to achieve a high standard of living in Russia. It  is not only possible but essential to pool our efforts to  resolve these problems.    On the eve of the New Year, I sent a letter to every Russian  parliamentarian seeking suggestions on how best for us to work  together. Many of you responded and displayed an interest in  cooperating. Every suggestion is being carefully examined and  analyzed. I thank you, and I assure you that it is possible to  conduct a civilized political dialogue that will exert a  favorable influence on the situation in contemporary Russia.    Ahead of you, esteemed deputies, lies a great deal of hard  work. I hope that in accomplishing it, you will manifest your  best human and political qualities, and that you will justify  your electorate's trust, for the good of our motherland. I  believe that the destiny of Russian Federation  parliamentarianism will have a successful outcome. Bon voyage,  esteemed deputies!    Boris Yeltsin, President of Russia. [applause]</p>

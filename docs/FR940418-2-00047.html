Mojave requests FERC authorization to construct and operate certain pipeline and compression facilities that will extend its system into Central and Northern California (Northward Expansion Project). These additional facilities would enable Mojave to transport 475 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to customers in the San Joaquin Valley and Northern California (San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mojave's application proposes two facility schemes. One plan includes the facilities Mojave would construct in the event the Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Kern River) also expands its existing system. The second plan includes the facilities Mojave would construct without any expansion by Kern River. This EIR/EIS will analyze the most construction-intensive combination of Mojave facilities. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Kern River's expansion application, filed with the FERC in November 1991 (Docket No. CP92&hyph;198&hyph;000), is pending before the Commission.

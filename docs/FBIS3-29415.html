The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told  KYODO  NEWS SERVICE that Defense Undersecretary Ernesto Gidaya had been  invited to Taipei "several times" to talk about acquisition of  the aircraft, though Gidaya is using veterans' activities as a  cover for his trips.    The source said that even before the informal meeting  between  President Fidel Ramos and Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui on  February 9 in Subic Freeport, 126 kilometers northwest of  Manila, "there had been low-key defense and military contacts  between the two countries."    The three-hour Ramos-Li meeting at Subic drew the ire of  China, and Manila has since been walking a tightrope in its  relations with Beijing and Taipei.    The Philippine Government had asked Taiwan in August 1992 to  either donate or sell its old aircraft at concessionary rates to  the Philippine Air Force.    The Foreign Affairs Department made a recommendation that  year to purchase the planes, in a memorandum to Defense  Secretary Renato S. De Villa, following the U.S.  Administration's decision to allow defense sales to Taiwan for  the first time since a break in diplomatic relations in 1979.    The Philippine armed forces, regarded as the most obsolete  of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), launched a  10-year program in 1991 to modernize its inventory of World War  II and Vietnam war vintage planes and ships. The 10 billion  dollar program has so far progressed at a snail's pace due to  lack of funds.</p>

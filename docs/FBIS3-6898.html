Top officials of the Japan Gas Association made the  pledge during a breakfast meeting with Hiroshi Kumagai,  international trade and industry minister.    Association chief Hiroshi Watanabe said the industry will  make efforts to serve the interest both of customers and regions  while enhancing competition under deregulation of government  controls. The government panel unveiled a report in late  January, calling for flexible price setting for large-lot gas  users and new entries into the gas business.    The industry will redouble efforts to reinforce its earnings  base in order to secure a stable gas supply, said Watanabe, also  chairman of Tokyo Gas Co.    Referring to a recent spell of explosions and other  accidents, MITI chief Kumagai asked the leaders to make the  industry safer. The industry will take adequate steps based on  the January recommendations, Watanabe said.</p>

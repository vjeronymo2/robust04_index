			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Europe-based staff reporter Tai </F> Pao-erh (2071 1405 0334); dispatched from London on 25 January:  "Ma Yuzhen Refutes Patten's Lies--Thoroughly Analyzing the  Development of Sino-British Relations and Disputes Over the Hong  Kong Issue"]    [Text]  <H5>  Chris Patten Cheats Public Opinion </H5>   Chinese Ambassador to Britain Ma Yuzhen criticized the  statement Hong Kong Governor Patten made in London attacking  China as a deliberate distortion of the Chinese Government's  position which was inconsistent with the facts, with the aim of  cheating public opinion. He expressed regret over the statement  and was not bullish about the development of current  Sino-British relations.    In an interview with this reporter, Ma Yuzhen made a  thorough  analysis of the development of Sino-British relations and the  disputes caused by the Hong Kong issue in recent years.    First, he refuted four points in the statement Patten made  when he returned to Britain last week to attend a hearing of the  Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee.    1. Patten accused China of just making a concession in the  Hong Kong political structure talks over lowering the voting  age. This was at variance with the facts. In fact, China made  major concessions in two other matters: Agreeing to let  district boards and the Urban Council practice the single seat,  single vote system and agreeing to abolish the appointed seats  in the Urban Council and district boards before 1997 so as to  reach an agreement.    "When he spoke at the hearing, Patten distorted China's  position in the 17 rounds of talks and ignored the facts. It is  unfair to try to overwhelm the other side by distorting its  position and viewpoint. If even the most rudimentary rules of  political negotiations are not followed, is there any  credibility to speak of?"  <H5>  Patten Misleads Britain and the Hong Kong People </H5>   2. Patten stated on many occasions that he did not believe  that China would dare overturn the three-tier council structure  that he was pursuing just out of consideration of the pressure  of world opinion. If he does think that, it means he is  dreaming. Otherwise, fully aware that China will keep its  promises, he still continues to pursue the three-violation  uncooperative policy. This way of doing things is utterly  irresponsible toward the Hong Kong people and Sino-British  relations. In terms of political and legal principles, China  can and must disband the three-tier councils in 1997. Patten's  remark was designed to mislead Britain and the Hong Kong people.    Ma Yuzhen also refuted Patten's analogy of installing panes  of glass for the Hong Kong people. He said: "The Hong Kong  people have lived in this house without any panes of glass for  more than 100 years. Now, when the British authorities are  about to leave, they say they will install panes of glass, and  in so saying they do not consult the host and residents. This  way of doing things is ridiculous. It is an expression of phony  benevolence. "    Regarding the pressure of world opinion which Patten  stressed, analyzing it, Ambassador Ma Yuzhen said: Of the 180  or so countries in the world, most are China's friends and Third  World countries. They have experienced suppression by the  imperialists. Will they now sympathize with Britain on the Hong  Kong issue? China is improving its relations with 20 or so  developed countries one after another. Moreover, since they  have their own agendas, they will not change their policies  toward China in accordance with London's wishes.  <H5>  Patten Tries in Vain To Continue Colonialist Rule </H5>   3. Patten criticized China's attitude as being  "unreasonable." Refuting the criticism, Ma Yuzhen said:  "China's response to Patten is based on an analysis of past  events concerning China and Britain in the last 100 years or so  and thus is very reasonable. It is really unreasonable for the  British side to try in vain to continue its colonialist rule as  the 21st century approaches."    4. Patten interpreted the spirit of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration as being "fair and trustworthy elections." Ma  Yuzhen pointed out: This is a distortion of the spirit of the  Joint Declaration. Deliberately misinterpreting and belittling  a document of great historic significance as a document  concerning elections in a narrow sense is an act far removed  from the spirit of the Joint Declaration.    "The spirit of the Joint Declaration lies in the Chinese  resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997. Britain  must return Hong Kong to China after 1997. This is a matter of  sovereignty complete with administration. After the turnover of  sovereignty, China will pursue the one-country, two-systems  policy and conduct elections in accordance with the Basic Law.    China does not oppose either elections or democracy.  However, if this is interpreted as the spirit of the Joint  Declaration, even though public opinion is misled, those who are  familiar with the Hong Kong situation cannot be misled."    When it came to the repeated British appeals for a  resumption of talks, Ma Yuzhen stated: Let him who tied the  bell on the tiger take it off. Unless the British side changes  its uncooperative and antagonistic Hong Kong policy and  withdraws the first-stage political structure draft which it has  submitted to the Legislative Council, the Chinese side must  otherwise accelerate its preparatory work, and, through the work  of the Preliminary Work Committee [for the Preparatory Committee  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] and the  concerted efforts of the Hong Kong people, China will ensure the  smooth transition of Hong Kong.    Nevertheless, he stressed: The Preliminary Work Committee is  a working organ. It is neither an organ of political power nor  a shadow government. Hence, there is no question of replacing  the Hong Kong Government. "In the situation in which the  British side is not cooperative and there are just three and a  half years left until 1997, the only way to guarantee a smooth  transition is for the Hong Kong people and Preliminary Work  Committee to intensify cooperation."  <H5>  Patten Plays the Same Old Trick Before Quitting the Colony </H5>   Ma Yuzhen accused Britain of playing the popular-will card  with a view to realizing the "three violations." This is a  replay of the small trick played by Britain every time in the  past when quitting its colonies. The Chinese Government  attaches importance to the opinions of the Hong Kong people and  this can be seen from the fact that four years and eight months  were spent soliciting the opinions of the Hong Kong people  regarding the Basic Law, but the British Government has never  valued the popular will in its rule over Hong Kong in the last  100 years or so.    Ma Yuzhen took over the job of ambassador to Britain in 1991  and has since then experienced the process of Sino-British  relations turning from good to bad. He discussed his views.    One was that China attached importance to developing  relations with Britain and regarded Britain as an important  country which carried considerable weight [you fen liang 2589  0433 6852] and maintenance of friendly relations with the latter  as being conducive to world peace. "Although there are  differences between China and Britain, they have common  interests, such as a long-term interest in maintaining Hong  Kong's prosperity and stability. The current situation of  retrogression is something China does not want to see. China has  never done anything harmful to its relations with Britain. The  responsibility for this situation does not rest with the Chinese  side."  <H5>  Britain Undermines Sino-British Relations </H5>   The other view was that in approaching Sino-British  relations, it was necessary to review past events from a  historical point of view. "During the 200 years from the visit  to China of a British envoy in 1847 to the coming to Hong Kong  of Patten as governor, Sino-British relations have been full of  twists and turns. Before the Opium War, it can be said that the  two countries treated each other as equals. However, from 1840  to 1949, Britain invaded China using military force five times  and China was thus in an unequal position of being invaded and  bullied.    "In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan,  Britain recognized the state of Manchuria set up by Japan in  northeast China and closed the Yunnan-Burma Railway when China  was facing the most difficult times. It was after Japan  attacked its colonies that Britain adopted a policy of opposing  Japan. After 1949, Britain recognized China quite early on. It  was not until 1972, when British Prime Minister Edward Heath  adopted a farsighted China policy and normalized Sino-British  relations, that the two countries began to exchange ambassadors.  Relations between the two countries developed smoothly up to  1989, when, together with other Western countries, Britain  imposed comprehensive sanctions against China because of the  Beijing disturbance."    Ma Yuzhen became ambassador to Britain in 1991, when China  and Britain resumed contacts between high-level officials. His  feelings about his work were that there were quite a few people  of foresight in British political, industrial, and commercial  circles, and they hoped to strengthen cooperation with China.  He has all along worked happily. However, it was a pity that  the formerly very good situation of cooperation between China  and Britain was undermined by the change Britain made in its  China policy in October 1992.  <H3>  An Impact on Cooperation in Other Fields of Endeavor Is Hard  To Avoid </H3>   As far as the current relations between China and Britain  are  concerned, Ma Yuzhen advised the British Government, which had  landed itself in a hole, to stop digging the hole and undo what  it had done so far by quoting the former Labor Party Minister  Dennis Healey as saying: "When you land yourself in a hole, you  must stop digging the hole."    However, he added: The termination of Sino-British talks  does not mean that the two countries do not have any normal  diplomatic channels. The British side has violated the  agreements on the issues of political structure and the new  airport, adopted an uncooperative and antagonistic attitude, and  undermined the cooperation between China and Britain step by  step. Consequently, an impact on other aspects of Sino-British  cooperation is hard to avoid.    He anticipated that it would be hard for Sino-British  relations to take a turn for the better in the short term.  However, he was fully confident that Hong Kong had a bright  future. In 1997 Hong Kong would be able to revert to China  smoothly.    After 1997, China also will be able to implement  sovereignty,  the Basic Law, and the one-country, two-systems concept to the  letter.    "Cast away illusions, have greater confidence, step up  preparatory work, heighten vigilance, guard against sabotage,  and rely on the motherland." These are words of advice Chinese  Ambassador to Britain Ma Yuzhen gave to the Hong Kong people.</p>

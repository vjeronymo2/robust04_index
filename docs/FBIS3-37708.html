			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 19 Feb, -- The Armenian authorities are  convinced that there is no alternative to a peaceful settlement  of the Karabakh conflict and that all strong-arm methods to  resolve it are doomed to failure. This is stated in a statement  published here today by the Armenian Foreign Ministry's press  and public relations service.    The Armenian side, the statement says, considers that any  mediation mission seeking a settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh will  only bear fruit if it involves plenipotentiary representatives  of the lawfully elected authorities of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic. The Armenian Foreign Ministry press service issued  the statement in connection with pronouncements by Azerbaijan's  foreign policy department accusing the Armenian leadership of  pursuing a policy of acting from a position of force and of  continuing the occupation of Azerbaijan lands.    The Armenian Foreign Ministry press service statement  emphasizes that the republic's authorities support all  peacemaking efforts to establish peace in the region, including  the CSCE and the Russian Federation initiatives.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the Commission has decided in this final rule to reinstate the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions, the NRC will cancel the FY 1993 annual fee invoices for those licensed activities exempt under this final rule. Accordingly, refunds will be made to those licensees who paid the FY 1993 annual fees and are now exempt under this final rule. Additionally, no further action will be taken on nonprofit educational institutions' exemption requests, which had been held in abeyance pending this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some nonprofit educational institutions filed applications requesting termination, downgraded, possession-only or combined licenses to avoid the FY 1993 annual fee. If those applications are still pending, the licensees should notify the NRC within 30 calendar days from the effective date of this rule if they wish to rescind their applications due to the exemption's reinstatement. Absent such notification, the NRC will process the applications as filed. There are instances where the NRC has already completed final action on some of the applications in question. The affected nonprofit educational institutions are advised that if they wish to reinstate their previous license authority, they must file an application to do so with the NRC. Such applications for reinstatement of previous license authority are exempted from fees under 10 CFR 170.11(a)(4) as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Section-by-Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 171.11&blank;Exemptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a) of this section is amended by adding nonprofit educational institutions, as defined in &sect;171.5, to the list of those entities exempted from annual fees by the Commission. A discussion of this change in fee policy is found in Sections I and II of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1). Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement has been prepared for the final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule contains no information collection requirements and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Regulatory Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to 10 CFR part 171, on November 5, 1990 the Congress passed Public Law No. 101&hyph;508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA&hyph;90). OBRA&hyph;90, as amended, requires that for FYs 1991 through 1998 approximately 100 percent of the NRC's budget authority be recovered through the assessment of fees. To accomplish this statutory requirement, on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), the NRC, in accordance with &sect;171.13, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the final amount of the FY 1993 annual fees for operating reactor licensees, fuel cycle licensees, materials licensees, and holders of Certificates of Compliance, registrations of sealed source and devices and QA program approvals, and Government agencies. Consistent with OBRA&hyph;90 and its Conference Committee Report, the Commission has ensured that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The annual fees are based on the Commission's FY 1993 budget of $540 million less the amounts collected from part 170 fees and the funds directly appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund to cover the NRC's high level waste program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The annual fees, to the maximum extent practicable, have a reasonable relationship to the cost of regulatory services provided by the Commission; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Annual fees are assessed to those licensees which the Commission, in its discretion, determines can fairly, equitably and practicably contribute to their payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, when developing the annual fees for operating power reactors, the NRC continues to consider the various reactor vendors, the types of containment, and the location of those reactors. The annual fees for fuel cycle licensees, materials licensees, and holders of certificates, registrations and approvals and for licenses issued to Government agencies take into account the type of facility or approval and the classes of the licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR part 171, which established annual fees for operating power reactors effective October 20, 1986 (51 FR 33224; September 18, 1986), was challenged and upheld in its entirety in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Florida Power and Light Company  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 846 F.2d 765 (DC Cir. 1988),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  490 U.S. 1045 (1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR part 171, which established fees based on the FY 1989 budget, was also legally challenged. As a result of the Supreme Court decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Skinner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mid-American Pipeline Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 109 S.Ct. 1726 (1989), and the denial of certiorari in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Florida Power and Light,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> all of the lawsuits were withdrawn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC's FY 1991 annual fee rule was largely upheld recently by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allied-Signal  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 988 F.2d 146 (DC Cir. 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII.

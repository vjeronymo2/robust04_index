			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Revamp for the loan guarantee scheme Budgets may come and go but the loan guarantee scheme, one of the most enduring government support schemes for small business, soldiers on. Like a well-worn suit, the LGS has been taken in, let out and restyled over the past 12 years but, unlike many other government programmes, it has survived. Last week's budget saw further alterations to the scheme, which provides a government guarantee for loans to businesses which cannot provide the collateral or track record a bank manager would normally require. One requirement of the scheme is that the business owner has already committed all of his assets to the business. In the view of most small business organisations, the changes will make the scheme considerably more attractive to companies. But will it prove more attractive to the banks which provide the loans and which carry the risk for the minority share of the loan which is not covered by the guarantee? Since its inception the scheme has depended on the willingness of the banks to make the loans. Some 20 lenders currently take part in the scheme, including the large clearing banks, many of the smaller banks and organisations such as the Doncaster Business Advice Centre, 3i, London Enterprise Agency and Yorkshire Enterprise. The latest changes to the scheme will see a reduction in the premium charged, an increase in the size of loan that can be made and an increase in the percentage covered by the government's guarantee. The premium will be cut from 2 1/2 per cent to 1 1/2 per cent for variable rate loans and to just  1/2 per cent for fixed rate loans. The lower charge for fixed rate loans is intended to encourage businesses to take a longer term view of borrowing and to compensate for the higher cost of fixed rate loans. The premium reductions are less generous than at first appears because the 2 1/2 per cent charge applies only to the guaranteed portion of the loan, and is equivalent to 1 3/4 per cent of the whole loan, while the revised rates apply to the whole loan. The maximum size of the eligible loans has been increased from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000 while the proportion guaranteed has risen from 70 per cent to 85 per cent. Small businesses frequently complain that bank managers are not aware of the loan scheme, or feign ignorance, and that the banks do not give it much publicity. At least one bank replies that this policy is deliberate. 'If we were to market the scheme aggressively we would find that security which might otherwise be available for a conventional loan would disappear and customers would ask for an LGS loan,' says David Laverack, Barclays Bank head of small business services. Customers who ask for an LGS loan make the bank manager uneasy. Barclays, at least, prefers the suggestion for an LGS loan to come from the bank manager once it becomes clear a business does not have the collateral to qualify for a conventional loan. But the big four clearing banks all came out with expressions of support for the LGS after the budget and it makes sense to remind reluctant bank managers of head office policy, says Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses. It is also worth shopping around for a loan and approaching some of the less well-known providers. Business owners, for their part, often resent the requirement that they must have already committed all of their assets before they qualify for the scheme. 'I have done my market research and I am all geared up to expand but my business assets are fully committed and I don't want to pledge all my personal assets to get an LGS loan,' said one businessman last week. It is hardly surprising, given the reservations of both banks and business owners, that the LGS has not taken off on the scale originally envisaged. Shortly after its launch the banks were making 1,500 guaranteed loans a quarter. But many of the early recipients went bust and loan numbers fell sharply after the government increased the premium and reduced the scope of the guarantee. The terms were eased again in the mid-1980s and in 1992-93 about 2,400 loans were made. In total Pounds 1bn of guaranteed loans have been made to more than 33,000 businesses and Pounds 184m has been written off in losses since the scheme was introduced in 1981. Compared with the amounts advanced each year under the equivalent German scheme, the LGS has had a marginal impact. For all its limitations, the LGS represents an attractive option for the many businesses that have seen their balance sheets eroded by recession and that may not now be able to provide the security necessary for a conventional bank loan.</p>

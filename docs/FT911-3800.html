			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Amax optimistic of a bright outlook for aluminium ALUMINIUM'S OUTLOOK remains exceptionally bright, in spite of the present very low prices, according to Mr Alan Born, chairman of Amax, the third-largest US aluminium producer. He told London analysts and institutional investors that he predicted the market would be about balanced - as long as there is no sharp deterioration in economic growth in Europe or Japan. His view contrasts with that of most analysts who expect a supply surplus this year. Mr Born admitted that very few of the west's aluminium smelters were profitable at today's prices. 'But we think the market is at or near the bottom of the current price cycle,' he said. Market sentiment had not been helped by the delivery to the west of about 100,000 tonnes of aluminium from the Soviet Union in the past 30 days. Aluminium for immediate delivery closed at 62.79 cents a lb on the London Metal Exchange last night. Mr Born suggested 80 to 85 cents a lb was more likely to be a sustainable price. The highest-cost smelters were in Europe and cuts would probably come in this region, he pointed out. Some of the older smelters in North America, which were benefiting from power contracts related to aluminium prices, might close as their power contracts came up for renegotiation. Amax estimated that primary aluminium demand would rise from 14.6m tonnes this year to 16.2m tonnes in 1995. This forecast indicated that a new 200,000-tonne smelter was required every second year, Mr Born said. But he added: 'I don't see that happening. Not enough new smelters are being built.' The group had enough faith in its forecasts to invest heavily in new primary aluminium capacity. It had a 25 per cent interest in the recently-completed expansion of the Becancour smelter in Quebec and was constructing a USDollars 1bn, wholly-owned smelter at Deschambault, also in Quebec. Together these projects would add about 50 per cent to Amax's primary aluminium capacity, taking it to an annual 750,000 tonnes. About 20 per cent of this would be surplus to Amax's own requirements. More than two-thirds of Amax's capacity by 1992 would be based on hydro-electric power, up from just over 49 per cent at present, and would put its costs 'among the lowest of the low.' Amax also expected to go ahead with the proposed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 588m) Antlantal smelter in Iceland in which it would have a 40 per cent interest. Mr Paul Drack, president of Alumax, the group's aluminium subsidiary, said negotiations about power contracts for the Iceland project were almost completed but capital costs needed to be trimmed and government permission to use foreign workers would be required. He hoped the Iceland smelter could be operating in 1995.</p>

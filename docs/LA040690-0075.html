			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GROUP TO STUDY HOW TO REVISE CITY CHARTER  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley this week announced the formation of a group to  study ways to reform the city Charter, including possible term limits for  elected officials and enlargement of the City Council.  </P> <P> The current Charter was adopted in 1925 and has been amended more than 400  times, but has never been thoroughly overhauled, Bradley said.  </P> <P> Like the Constitution on the federal level, the Charter spells out the  fundamentals of city government. Bradley did not endorse any specific reform  proposals but said a study group will be appointed soon to develop procedures  for amending the Charter, which is expected to be a lengthy process.  </P></p>

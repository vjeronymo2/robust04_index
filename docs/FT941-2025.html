			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Householders get free legal service A free legal service has been launched for people living in an area of Newcastle upon Tyne where harassment, vandalism and other crime has frightened local residents and driven some from their homes. The service, set up by Newcastle solicitors Pearson &amp; Caulfield, has been initiated by Newcastle City Challenge and funded by a Pounds 30,000 grant from a charitable trust, which requested anonymity. Mr Jonathan Blackie, Newcastle director of City Challenge, the government-backed scheme to regenerate urban areas, said he believed the problems which north Benwell had faced in the last few years were unparalleled in an area with mixed, predominantly privately-owned, housing. He said the free legal service would use every device within the law to take action against criminals. It will help residents take legal action against the effects of crime and harassment, and against absent owners and landlords of derelict property, anti-social residents and statutory bodies if they fail to take necessary action. This could include Northumbria police and Newcastle city council. Leaflets about the service, to be launched officially on Monday, are being circulated to all 2,500 North Benwell residents. Mr Blackie said: 'We believe it's the first time the residents of an area have been offered a completely free legal service to tackle their particular problems.' North Benwell's difficulties have caused property values to fall, leaving some owner-occupiers trapped.</p>

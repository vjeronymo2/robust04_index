Nursultan Nazarbayev said this in Kiev, where he is on an  official visit. The Kazakh president pointed out that he is  ready to sign a new agreement with Russia either on a bilateral  basis or on a quadrilateral basis involving Ukraine and Belarus.  In the next few days he will be going to Washington to discuss  these problems with Bill Clinton.    Russia believed that the matter of compensation for the  nuclear material in the strategic missiles due for removal from  Kazakhstan was in principle closed. There are agreements on  this point. Almaty, like Kiev and Minsk, should receive its  share after deduction of expenditure on the reprocessing of  highly enriched uranium and its transportation and storage at  Russian plants.    However, all the indications are that the method of  calculation adopted earlier does not suit the Kazakh side. It  intends to follow the example of Ukraine, which succeeded a week  ago in obtaining $1 billion on signing the trilateral agreement  with Russia and the United States in Moscow. This money is  being given to Ukraine out of the sum appropriated by the U.S.  Congress for the nuclear disarmament of the CIS countries under  the START I treaty. It has become known that Almaty is hoping  for similar compensation.    In other words, Kazakhstan, like Ukraine, has decided not to  wait for funds to come into its account from the sale of uranium  by its Russian partners, whom it is not inclined to trust very  much. It is obviously safer to get insurance now, in the form of  a guaranteed billion out of the U.S. quota.    Experts believe that in that event Russia will have to take  on additional expenditure for the safe dismantling of nuclear  warheads in the possession of its CIS neighbors. It cannot be  rule out that Belarus will demand its share in the same way,  although some of the uranium has already been shipped out of its  territory to Russia for reprocessing. When it hosted Bill  Clinton recently, Minsk received $100 million from this same  package. But now, REUTER reports, Belarus is laying claim to a  further $500 million.</p>

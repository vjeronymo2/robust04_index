			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Britain's Duchess of York has landed a fee of $125,000 from Redbook magazine  for serial rights to her first two children's books about a heroic helicopter.  "Budgie The Helicopter" will appear in the magazine's September issue, which  will be on newsstands next month, Redbook Editor in Chief Annette Capone  announced. The wife of Prince Andrew has penned one other "Budgie" adventure:  "Budgie at Bendick Point." The title character's name comes from the nickname  the duchess gave to the helicopter in which she learned to fly. Capone  described the books as about "the adventures of a feisty little helicopter  named Budgie who heroically risks his life to come to the aid of children who  find themselves in a jam." The books, illustrated by John Richardson, will be  published in September. Part of the duchess' income will be donated to charity.  Dave Johnson  </P></p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (8): Cutting through the hot air THIRD PARTY ACCESS IN EUROPEAN GAS INDUSTRIES by Jonathan Stern The Royal Institute of International Affairs, Pounds 12.50, 141 pages AS THE EC single market approaches, most of the attention of the energy industry has focused on Brussels' proposals to integrate the electricity supply - by, for example, obliging member states to grant access to their grid to suppliers from other states. Much less attention has been paid to Brussels' parallel proposal to open up gas supplies on similar lines, even though the effects could be just as far reaching. This timely study from Chatham House is an attempt to shed light on these issues. And what a tangle they are. As Stern points out, the European gas industry is a tight-knit community of monopolies, many state-owned, whose instinctive reaction to proposals of this sort is to say no. They have deliberately exaggerated the problems and marshalled obscure technical arguments in order to retard the pace of change. As a result the debate is getting bogged down and is not sparking the amount of public interest it needs. There are times when Stern himself seems to have difficulty rising above the complexities. He is frequently forced to comment that evidence is 'inconclusive', or to adopt over-wide generalisations in order to encompass the subject, which is frustrating for the reader. Nonetheless one does emerge from the study with a clearer sense of the issues and the direction the debate is likely to take. The Brussels plan is to open up third party access (TPA) to gas transmission systems so that new suppliers can enter national markets. The aim is to stimulate competition in a business where little or none has existed in the past and, ultimately, benefit the consumer by increasing choice and driving down prices. The question is whether the merits of this plan are outweighed by the potential threats to security of supply and to the stability that has enabled the gas industry to make large investments up to now. Although Stern dismisses some of the objections as scaremongering by the established players, he does believe that the plan still has shortcomings. His main concern is that while the Brussels TPA Directive lays out the principles, it falls far short of being the sort of practical plan to get things moving. He doubts that Continental EC members (the UK is different because of the privatised gas industry and its special regulation set-up) will be sufficiently motivated to put in place a pro-active regulatory framework. But Stern does see light ahead. He notes the key importance of the recent growth of competition in Germany where, rather to people's surprise, certain large players have forced their way into the market. By the middle of this year, he also believes that other major players 'began to appreciate that outright rejection was no longer a tenable position.' But this will not necessarily open the way for implementation of a grand, Brussels-driven plan. Instead he foresees 'a slow piecemeal, uneven development of TPA on a country by country and perhaps even case by case basis.' Change will be driven principally by the urge of the more aggressive members of the gas industry to break into new markets. This will increase the need for agreed international rules, at which point there will be a role for the Brussels plan, though that will still be several years away.</p>

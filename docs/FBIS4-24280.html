			<p>BFN     [Text] Military equipment to the value of N$4.2 million  [Namibian dollars] was handed over to the Namibian Defense Force  by the German Army at Luiperdsvallei outside Windhoek on  Thursday. The equipment consists of eight standard troop  carriers, five recovery vehicles, workshops, and the required  spare parts. The vehicles form part of the German Government's  donation of N$13.2 million of military equipment to the Ministry  of Defense over a three-year period. Although technical  assistance from the German Army was supposed to have been  suspended at the end of this year, Minister of Defense Peter  Mueshihange announced that the German Government favorably  considered Namibia's request to extend the assistance by an  additional three years. The minister said: "We appreciate the  assistance because it ensures the Namibian Army's mobility and  independence in the area of transportation."    Since the cooperation agreement came into effect in 1992,  certain members of the Namibian Defense Force were trained by an  engineering team from the German Ministry of Defense in MAN  mechanics. The members who passed the training exercise were  then allowed to train other personnel in the fixing of MAN  vehicles. MAN vehicles form the largest part of the Namibian  Defense Force's troop carriers and delivery vehicles. The  Ministry of Defense, therefore, has made a policy decision to  use MAN as the Army's standard troop carrier and delivery  vehicle. "The decision was made because of the vehicle's power  and reliability. A decision will be made soon on standard  control and administrative vehicles. Standardization is  necessary because it alleviates the problem experienced with  shortage of spare parts and improves the standard of  maintenance," according to Mr. Mueshihange.</p>

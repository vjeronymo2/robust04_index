			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAELIS BLOCK PALESTINIANS WITHOUT ID CARDS  </P> <P> Soldiers today began turning back Palestinians headed to work in Israel for  failing to have the government's new computerized identification cards.  </P> <P> Palestinian activists have called for a strike starting Friday to protest the  identification cards, which Israeli officials say are needed to improve  security.  </P> <P> The system was announced several months ago.  </P> <P> The issue has become primarily a test of strength between the army-run civil  administration in the Gaza Strip and clandestine uprising leaders, who are  trying to sever ties between Palestinians and Israel as part of their revolt  against 22 years of occupation.  </P> <P> Brig. Gen. Arye Ramot, head of the military government in Gaza, told Israel  radio today that 5,000 Gaza workers were allowed to enter Israel through the  Erez Checkpoint between 3:30 a.m. and 7 a.m.  </P></p>

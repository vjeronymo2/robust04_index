			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Greek morass AFTER A long spell of profligacy during the 1980s, Greece has made steady, though still inadequate, progress towards improving its chronically poor reputation for economic management. Restrictive monetary and fiscal measures undertaken by Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis have succeeded in halving the budget deficit from the 1990 figure of 21 per cent of gross domestic product. Inflation has fallen to 15 per cent from 20 per cent. The current account deficit has declined to less than 3 per cent of GDP, partly owing to increased EC transfers, now about 5 per cent of GDP. These changes, coinciding with Europe-wide recession and the consequences of the Yugoslav conflict, have been sufficiently painful to increase Mr Mitsotakis's electoral unpopularity. But they have not gone far enough to correct fundamental flaws in the economic and political structure of the poorest member of the EC. As a result of last week's resignation of Mr Mitsotakis's government, prompted by an internal revolt, Greece faces general elections on October 10, bringing political uncertainty that could delay or reverse necessary reforms. The opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement is ahead in the opinion polls. But its leadership looks unsuited to solving Greece's problems of low growth and investment, high subsidies, an undersized manufacturing base and a large, inefficient public sector. The party is headed by the ailing Mr Andreas Papandreou, whose wayward prime ministership between 1981 and 1989 greatly exacerbated these difficulties. Although the Socialists have toned down their interventionist policies, their return would disrupt Greece's efforts at privatisation and deregulation. Furthermore, the election campaign could stir up more squabbling over former Yugoslavia, further lowering Greece's ability to play a positive role in EC policies towards the Balkans. Last week's rebellion against Mr Mitsotakis was led by Mr Antonis Samaras, the former foreign minister, sacked last year for refusing to compromise over EC recognition of neighbouring Macedonia. Whichever party holds power must face up to unpalatable realities. Greece should put aside any illusions of participating in economic and monetary union for at least a decade, probably for much longer. Its main priority must be to bring its governmental and industrial infrastructure into line with modern requirements. EC funding has a considerable part to play in assisting this transition. But the money will not be forthcoming unless the country makes still greater efforts to achieve convergence with its European neighbours. That will require strict monitoring from Brussels, as well as strong will in Athens. Since it joined the EC in 1981, Greece has become an ever more marginalised member of a wider Community. Unless Greece achieves better macroeconomic balance, and presses on with administrative reform, that uncomfortable process will accelerate in the 1990s, as the EC turns its attention increasingly to new members in the north and east of the continent.</p>

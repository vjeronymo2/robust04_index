			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BASF Miserable nine-month results from BASF and the prospect of another dividend cut are a reminder of how bad conditions in European chemicals have become. Since BASF went into the downturn with more than half its production in Germany and a strong bias towards petrochemicals - where the erosion of prices is worst - the cycle has been especially cruel. A meeting of European petrochemicals producers this week could help stop the rot. An agreement to close ethylene capacity would help stabilise prices in plastics. The failure of similar efforts in steel is a reminder of the formidable political obstacles to closure, especially where state-owned producers are involved. One can only hope that the risks of not reaching an agreement are, in this case, enough to force a decision. With BASF's new Antwerp cracker poised to start production, there must be a risk of another downward lurch in prices unless action is taken. If prices can be stabilised, cost-cutting should contribute to a modest bounce in profits next year. The stock market may by then have the scent of recovery. BASF outperformed the German market by 30 per cent during 1987, two years ahead of its last peak in profits. Even allowing for capacity reductions in Europe and good news on growth, though, the market's willingness to anticipate good news could be sorely tested. It is difficult to see the next profits peak coming until well into the second half of the decade.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan's top business  officials banded together Tuesday [21 June] to oppose an early  dissolution of the Diet and a snap general election.    The heads of the country's four major business lobbies  agreed  in a joint statement issued after their meeting that "disbanding  of the Diet and a following snap election, which would create a  political vacuum, should be avoided at all costs."    The joint statement also said the ruling coalition and the  opposition camp should realize political reforms through  constructive debate and that the next general election should be  conducted under the new single-member constituency system after  the electoral map is redrawn.    The Tuesday meeting brings together Shoichiro Toyoda,  chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations  (Keidanren), Kosaku Inaba, Chairman of the Japan Chamber of  Commerce and Industry, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan  Federation of Employers Associations, and Masaru Hayami,  chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives.    At the meeting, Nagano, who attended a recent International  Labor Organization (ILO) meeting, reported that the European  economy has been showing healthier signs although a recovery has  not yet been in sight.    The four business leaders agreed that the Japanese economy  is  at a similar stage.</p>

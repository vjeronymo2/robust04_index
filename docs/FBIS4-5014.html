			<p>BFN     [Text] The Japan New Party [JNP] decided on 4 April to  call on Sakigake [Harbinger], Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  and the Democratic Socialist Party of Japan [DSP] for their  cooperation to form a parliamentary group consisting of these  four parties. It hopes to first carry out this plan in  preparation for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan to form  a framework for unity among the ruling coalition parties, in  view of the next general election.    Prime Minister Hosokawa has proposed setting up a "policy  study group," but a "freeze" has been placed on this plan due to  opposition from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and  other parties. Therefore, the JNP hopes the four parties, which  have many points in common regarding policies and other matters,  can act as a catalyst in promoting moves toward unifying the  ruling coalition parties. However, rough sailing is expected  since not only is the SDPJ, which has been left out of the plan,  reacting against it, but there is hardly any possibility that  Sakigake, which already has formed a parliamentary group with  the JNP, would accept the idea.    JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka and other JNP executive  officials met with Prime Minister Hosokawa on 4 April. They  informed him of their plan for the formation of a parliamentary  group, and Hosokawa approved the idea. A senior JNP official  explained: "As we have gained the understanding of Sakigake,  which has opposed the planned formation of a policy study group,  the four parties will come together first, and hopefully, the  SDPJ and Komeito will join us in the future."    At a 29 March meeting, executive officials from the JNP,  DSP,  and Sakigake agreed on a plan to form a parliamentary group  among the three parties. Later, however, the JNP decided to  change its original plan to form a parliamentary group among the  four parties because, among other reasons, the three-party group  would not be able to become a nucleus of the ruling coalition  alliance, since the total number of lower house seats these  three parties currently hold would only add up to 74 -- the same  as the number of lower house seats currently held by the SDPJ.    In reaction to such JNP moves, Sakigake has made critical  comments. A senior party official said: "The merging of  Sakigake and the JNP, which we have promised to the people, has  precedence."</p>

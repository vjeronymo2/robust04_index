			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sophie Benard report: "Monory Criticizes </F> Balladur"]    [Text] The Senate speaker had some harsh words for the  government yesterday. His main target was the prime minister.    Rene Monory likes to act the part of the unbiased observer.  Lapses in self-censorship are not unheard of, however.  Sometimes his rather grouchy disposition resurfaces. Such was  the case yesterday during a press luncheon during which he  directed a good many criticisms toward Edouard Balladur's  policies.    To be fair, Rene Monory does have cause for irritation. The  regional decentralization bill scheduled for discussion in early  July will not come before the Senate first. While the interior  minister had promised publicly that senators would be given the  first reading of the bill, Edouard Balladur has now issued a  statement to the contrary, which suits National Assembly  President Philippe Seguin just fine, but quite infuriated Rene  Monory: "This is not a question of pride or precedence between  the two assemblies. I just note that the government has not been  true to its word," he fumed. Mr. Monory thinks that senators  can legitimately expect to be given the first reading of the  bill, since after two years of work under the direction of  Jean-Francois Poncet (RDE [Democratic and European Rally],  Lot-et-Garonne), they had become the bill's true initiators.  "The government's attitude has a direct consequence: The bill  has now been made toothless or, at the very least, discredited,"  thundered Rene Monory. "This is a difficult bill, which  initially nobody can be pleased with since its positive impact  will only be felt in the longer term. Only the Senate can  shoulder this kind of unpopularity. National Assembly members  are not in a position to do this due to electoral constraints.  As a result, most of the effort put into the bill may now go to  waste. This was a fine idea which foundered because of too many  successive errors."    There was more to come, however. When the Senate president  feels the need to vent his aggravation, he does it  steamroller-style. He went on to criticize the general  political climate, which has been getting on his nerves: "It is  all getting rather suffocating, is it not? Instead of remaining  ostensibly reticent about it, would-be presidential candidates  should step forward," he stated, steering well clear of anything  remotely resembling a denial of the rumor which would have him  enter the presidential race should [former President of the  Republic] Giscard throw in the towel. An ambition that may  explain his tactical ill-temper.    The slight economic recovery which the government is  perceiving does not impress him either: "Whatever the hope for  renewed growth, no fundamental change will have taken place as  far as employment is concerned," he explained. As for the  government's employment policies, he feels there is room for  improvement: "Obviously, the five-year employment act falls way  short of what is needed. Its shortcomings are legion."    In short, Rene Monory likes everything in Edouard Balladur's  policies, apart from those concerning jobs, the economy, and  regional decentralization.    By way of conclusion to this onslaught, Rene Monory went for  the jugular in a roundabout sort of way, insisting that Edouard  Balladur has "the status of a statesman who may possibly lack a  little something."</p>

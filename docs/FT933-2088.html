			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / People: Police inspectors A 137-year tradition will end next month when two businessmen join Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. All previous members of the inspectorate, which monitors police standards and encourages improvements in efficiency, have been former chief constables. The appointment of Anthony Williams and Peter Hobbs is part of the government's Citizen's Charter drive to demonstrate the independence of inspectorates. Hobbs, 55, joined the Wellcome Foundation from ICI in 1979, and was until recently group personnel manager of Wellcome plc. He was the first chairman of the Employers Forum on Disability, and has twice served as international vice-president of the Institute of Personnel Management. Wide-ranging involvement in education and training initiatives includes the chairmanship of the Learning from Experience Trust. Williams, 57, a qualified occupational psychologist, is a partner in Hay Management Consultants. He worked on selection procedures for the police, fire service and civil service while at the Civil Service Selection Board. His has also been personnel director for the World Bank. On a practical level, min-isters hope that the two newcomers' outside experience will contribute to current attempts to improve managerial efficiency in the police service.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Lasmo Lasmo is an acquisitive company. It ambitiously acquired Ultramar. Now, in little more than 12 months, it has acquired a new chief executive, finance director, and finally yesterday, a new chairman. Such extensive bloodletting was the price demanded in the wake of the Ultramar deal. Perhaps the appointment of Mr Rudolf Agnew as chairman also hints that the company needs an old hand to rebuild goodwill with the institutions. Whether he can warm relations sufficiently for Lasmo to get a rights issue away is, however, an open question. It is also far from clear that fresh equity would help matters much. Further write-downs of expensively acquired assets will be needed if the crude oil price remains low. That would certainly tear large holes in an already moth-eaten balance sheet. But the company's gross cash flows are sufficient to meet current interest payments. This is hardly the time to spend on exploration, and Lasmo's record is patchy. Unless banking covenants based on net assets are likely to be breached there is little incentive to cough up funds to pay off some banks. Shareholders would simply have more money staked on a slightly less leveraged oil price bet. Lasmo's central problem is that it paid for expensive oil reserves and now the price is on the slide. Many of the corrective measures now being taken are necessary, but are probably not in themselves sufficient. The oil price will determine Lasmo's future, and shareholders have plenty invested in that hope already.</p>

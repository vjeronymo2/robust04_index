			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Investcorp expands into music with Camelot bid INVESTCORP, the Arab-led investment consortium, plans to expand its retailing operations into the music sector through the acquisition of Camelot Music, the third-biggest US music retailer. Investcorp is believed to be paying more than Dollars 350m for the privately-held Camelot, which had revenues of Dollars 421m in fiscal 1993. Neither company would reveal the terms of the acquisition, which is expected to be complete by the end of the year. Mr Paul Soldatos, a member of Investcorp's management committee, said Camelot had 'significant growth potential'. Investcorp is expected to expand Camelot's foothold in the music retailing business through other acquisitions. Investcorp has a significant presence in the US retail world through its ownership of Saks Fifth Avenue, the upmarket department store group which it bought in 1990 for Dollars 1.6bn from the UK's BAT group. The company's North American interests also include the Tiffany jewellery chain, Peebles Department Stores and the Circle K convenience store chain. Earlier this year Investcorp gained control of Gucci, one of the best-known luxury goods groups. In the UK, it bought Thorn EMI's Lighting division for Dollars 162m in what was effectively a management buy-out.</p>

"Sarajevo was a genuine tragedy, but the world should know  that there are others, perhaps more serious tragedies in a city  like Mostar," Akashi said as he arrived for his first visit here.    Some elements of an agreement that led to a ceasefire in  Sarajevo had also been tried in an accord reached between  Bosnian Moslems and Croats besieging the Moslem part of Mostar,  he added.    The accord provides for an interposition of UNPROFOR [United  Nations Protection Forces] troops between the belligerent  parties and the withdrawal of heavy weapons to between 20  kilometers (12 miles) and 10 kilometers (six miles) from the  city by March 7.    Akashi said ceasefire agreements should be signed "in as  many  cities as possible. UNPROFOR is prepared to do its best, but  we're short of troops."    In the Moslem-populated eastern sector of Mostar Akashi met  with members of the city's "war presidency." "President" Smail  Klaric said Mostar "will have to be an open and non-divided  city" and be a "part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory."  Croats have laid siege to the Moslem sector for the past nine  months and have said they want to make the city the capital of a  self-styled Bosnian Croat republic. Akashi is also to meet with  Croat officials in the western sector.    No fighting was reported in the city Monday after shells  rained down on the eastern sector Sunday in spite of Friday's  ceasefire agreement.</p>

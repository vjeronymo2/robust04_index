"This situation  will no longer be tolerated. Stirrers will not be tolerated in  the Army," the defence minister said in an open letter released  today.    Today's STANDART NEWS and KONTINENT reported that over the  weekend the Defence Ministry and top state institutions were  stricken by fear of mutiny.    Officers and NCO's in Khaskovo (Southern Bulgaria) launched  a  sign-in campaign calling on parliament to appropriate 37,500  million leva for the 1994 defence budget. According to the  dailies, the campaign is going on and has been supported by  servicemen in other parts of the country. The campaign was  discussed at a special meeting attended by the defence minister,  deputy ministers, General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General  Staff, General Lilko Yotsov, the Armed Forces prosecutor, and  other top brass. STANDART NEWS said Deputy Defence Minister  Boyko Noev proposed that the masterminds of the campaign be  dismissed on disciplinary grounds with immediate effect.  According to an anonymous source quoted in KONTINENT, "the  initiators avoided arrest by a hair's breadth." Aleksandrov  briefed President Zhelev and Prime Minister Berov on the  situation in the Army. STANDART NEWS said President Zhelev tried  to calm down the Defence Ministry leaders saying this was hardly  an organized mutiny. He called on them to seek ways to clear the  matter up with the initiators of the sign-in campaign who,  according to the President, demanded from politicians the same  as the leaders of the Defence Ministry.    In today's letter the defence minister said the Rakovski  Legion had organized several sign-in campaigns in breach of the  Armed Forces' statute. "Those who want an increase in the  defence budget through sign-in campaigns and statements, knowing  that their claims are absurd in the current difficult period,  are taking undue advantage of the common interests of the  military and are driving the Army to instability and  politicization," the defence minister says. According to him,  "in their attempt to protect their own interests, the organizers  and fomenters of the campaign are ready to oppose the Army to  society."    "The leadership of the Rakovski Officers' Legion is being  manipulated for political purposes," Aleksandrov says.    Today's STANDART NEWS quoted the Legion's leaders who  denounced "attempts to ascribe political ambitions to the  `Khaskovo initiative.'"</p>

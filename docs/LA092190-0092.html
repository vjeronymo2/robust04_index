			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: LOOKING AT THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT -- AND THE JUNK THAT POLLUTES IT.  </P> <P> Thousands of South Bay residents revel in beach-going. They sun, swim, play  volleyball, walk, jog or poke around tide pools. But how many are willing to  spend a few hours cleaning those sandy and rocky places they love to visit?  </P> <P> That question will be answered Saturday morning, when volunteers will be asked  to bring gloves and pitch in to remove debris from the tide pools of San Pedro  to the sands of Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> Organizers of the various cleanups say they don't know how many people will  show up, but they're encouraged by sign-ups by corporate employees and members  of service and garden clubs, senior citizens groups, and the Boy Scouts.  </P> <P> "Last year, there were approximately 60 volunteers that came out, and we hope  that increases this year," said Carol Belser, a recreation employee in Hermosa  Beach.  </P> <P> Some beaches will have contests or displays to add a little fun to the work of  filling bags with such debris as cans, plastic bags, fragments of fishing nets,  and cast-off appliance and vehicle parts.  </P> <P> However, those boosting the cleanup effort are mostly counting on the devotion  of people who don't like their beaches to look like watery dumps. Mike Schaadt,  exhibits director at the Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, said litterers  provoke "a certain amount of disgust."  </P> <P> But, he said, "there are people down there to care, to take a modicum of pride  that can make a difference. The enjoyment is seeing how much better a place can  look."  </P> <P> The Saturday cleanup marks the nationwide Coastweeks program, which was  organized by marine-related scientific and environmental organizations, and the  California Coastal Commission's Adopt-A-Beach Day.  </P> <P> Belser said that in addition to being a cleanup, the day aims to make people  aware of beaches and the importance of caring for them. "They're our natural  resource," she said. "People clean the beach, give something back to it and  learn something about it."  </P> <P> * The Cabrillo museum at 3720 Stephen White Drive, San Pedro, will coordinate  the cleanup of the Point Fermin Refuge, which stretches along the coast south  of the museum. Volunteers will gather at 10 a.m. for two hours of  trash-gathering.  </P> <P> Steve Vogel, the museum's educational curator, said the tide pools and rocky  beach within the refuge become repositories for debris thrown from yachts and  commercial ships -- down to the small resin beads used to slide cargo  containers aboard ships. The cliffs above the beach invite people to toss over  surprising trash.  </P> <P> "People are at the end of the world as far as they're concerned," he said.  "We're getting bottles, street signs, and real estate signs and flags."  </P> <P> During last year's cleanup, a mural depicting tide-pool life was painted on the  remnants of a military bunker. It has been all but obliterated by graffiti, and  people will be invited to help repaint it during the cleanup.  </P> <P> Competitive spirits will be aroused at noon with a contest to select what Vogel  calls "five of the funkiest garbage items discovered." Judging by last year's  collection -- which netted a refrigerator compressor and part of a street  barricade that still had a light attached -- Vogel said the contest should be  lively.  </P> <P> The day ends with the showing of films on beaches and tide pools at the museum.  </P> <P> * The Los Angeles chapter of the American Cetacean Society is organizing the  cleanup of San Pedro's Royal Palms Beach, located at Western Avenue and Paseo  del Mar. Volunteers will meet at 8 a.m. at the bottom of the road down to the  rocky beach. The cleanup will last until noon.  </P> <P> Dan Zembrano, a Cal State Long Beach marine lab technician who is heading the  event, said the first cleanup last year netted everything from clothing to  drinking straws. "How much we clean depends on how many show up," he said.  </P> <P> * Torrance Beach, located south of Riviera Village in Redondo Beach, will be  cleaned between 9 a.m. and noon. Volunteers will meet at the parking lot.  </P> <P> * In Redondo Beach, volunteers will meet at the Redondo Pier at 9 a.m. The  cleanup will last until noon.  </P> <P> * Hermosa Beach holds its cleanup from 8 a.m. to noon, with volunteers  gathering at the city pier. Belser said more than 1,200 pounds of trash was  collected on the beach last year, much of it recyclable cans and plastics.  </P> <P> Recyclable items found this year will be taken to Hermosa Valley School, which  is having a recycling drive Saturday.  </P> <P> During the cleanup, Los Angeles County lifeguards and the Cabrillo museum will  have displays and provide information. Children will be entertained with a  scavenger hunt.  </P> <P> * In Manhattan Beach, the cleanup -- from 9 a.m. to noon -- begins at the  Manhattan Beach Pier.  </P> <P> One aim of this year's beach cleanup is to identify the type of trash being  dumped. Vogel said this will help the Center for Marine Conservation, which  works to protect the ocean, to pinpoint where marine debris is coming from and  take steps to stop it.  </P> <P> Vogel said the object is to develop educational material aimed at "the people  who are responsible" for the trash.  </P> <P> "The whole idea is to focus peoples' attention on the coastal environment," he  said.

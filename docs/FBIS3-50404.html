However, according to Draskovic, no agreement was reached  because the Socialists "rejected a compromise". Depos, as the  leading parliamentary opposition party offered the SPS a  compromise to the effect that a deputy of the democratic  opposition of Serbia be appointed Assembly speaker, and in  return it would give up not only the post of prime minister, but  also all government ministries. As a sign of good will we  offered to have two deputy speakers in the Assembly presidency.  To reject the readiness of the largest opposition party to  support the formation of a minority Socialist government in the  name of national unity, while in exchange it would obtain only  the post of the first among the equal in the Serbian Assembly,  is the proof of the Socialists' utmost intolerance," Draskovic  said.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / EU hopefuls given boost by Brittan Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, yesterday predicted that this week's EU summit in Essen would be a 'milestone' in efforts to bring central and eastern Europe into the European Union. In a pre-emptive strike against critics, Sir Leon said Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania could expect new trade concessions and a guaranteed minimum Ecu5.5bn (Pounds 4.3bn) over the next five years to pay for preparation for eastern enlargement. In addition, the European Commission would next year produce a blueprint for EU accession for the six countries. A white paper would set out steps to adapt laws, state aid, norms and standards to adjust to the single European market. 'We want to embed the principle of membership and create irreversible momentum behind it. That is what Essen is about,' said Sir Leon. In the run-up to the two-day summit which opens on Friday, critics seized on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's hesitation about inviting the central and eastern European leaders as symptomatic of a half-hearted approach to enlargement. Doubts grew after it emerged the German presidency of the EU did not include in its Essen discussion paper a commitment to reform structural funds and the common agricultural policy. The London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research claimed yesterday that the proposals for Essen were deeply flawed. 'They are piecemeal and much more limited in areas such as market access, anti-dumping, rules of origin, agricultural policies and medium-term finance'. Sir Leon conceded that the EU had avoided a commitment to reform of the CAP and structural funds which, on cost grounds, was vital if enlargement were to take place. But he derided the CEPR's proposal for a new secretariat comprising EU and eastern European officials to monitor implementation of the accession strategy. People would not be dancing in the streets of Prague in anticipation of a new layer of bureaucracy in Brussels, he said. Sir Leon said it would be 'artificial' to set a date for membership of the central European states, or for opening accession negotiations. He advocated waiting for the end of the 1996 intergovernmental conference whose primary task was to adapt the EU's decision-making machinery to cope with an expanded Union of up to 25 members. After institutional reform, some eastern European countries might wish to move faster than others toward membership. Sir Leon will hand over responsibility for relations with central and eastern Europe to Mr Hans Van den Broek, the Dutch commissioner for external political affairs in the new European Commission which takes office in January. However, he will retain responsibility for external economic relations and yesterday's performance underlines his commitment to eastern enlargement. Editorial comment, Page 21</p>

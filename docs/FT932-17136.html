			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: Call to veto aircraft subsidy laws - Brussels voices concern over Washington attacks on Airbus THE European Community has urged President Bill Clinton to veto proposed legislation relating to subsidies for aircraft manufacturers, claiming it could run counter to existing trade agreements. EC officials voiced concern about the bills, introduced over the past few weeks, during consultations with their US counterparts about last year's EC-US agreement limiting subsidies to manufacturers of large civil aircraft. The legislation put forward by leading US senators calls for dumping and subsidy complaints against the European Airbus consortium, as well as increased indirect support for US manufacturers. US officials said after the talks ended in Brussels yesterday that the administration had already expressed doubts about some of the proposed measures. It would inform Congress where it believed legislation was contrary to other trade commitments. The EC used the consultations to express its unhappiness with recent US pronouncements attacking subsidies for Airbus. EC officials said they were pleased that the Clinton administration had made clear that last year's agreement should not be renegotiated, but criticised him for adding to uncertainty in the fragile civil aircraft market. 'These declarations have let the genie out of the bottle,' said one. The US, in turn, complained about EC suggestions that it might already have breached the limits on indirect subsidies to its manufacturers. 'We don't believe there's any question that the US is living up to its obligations,' said one senior US trade official after the talks, which both sides described as constructive. The EC is calling on the US to provide more information about indirect support to the US aircraft industry since the agreement came into force last July, in line with clauses calling for greater transparency.</p>

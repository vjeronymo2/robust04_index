			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Sales of M-registered cars lower than hoped New-car registrations in the first 10 days of August, the most important sales month of the year, were 3.7 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The increase was smaller than was forecast by some carmakers and has undermined industry hopes of achieving record sales this month. It is understood that new-car registrations rose to 258,392 in the first 10 days of August from 249,153 in the same period last year. In August registrations are boosted by the change of prefix and account for about 25 per cent of new car sales. Britain has led the European new-vehicle market out of recession. In the first seven months new car registrations rose by 13.3 per cent year-on-year to 990,752. In view of this performance and with strong order books, carmakers had forecast that sales this month would rise by 13 per cent to 14 per cent year-on-year to about 500,000, challenging the previous record of 500,112 achieved in August 1989. Carmakers are retreating from the most optimistic forecasts, however, and several leading manufacturers said yesterday that sales of M-registered cars were unlikely to exceed 470,000 or 480,000. Sales of new cars last August totalled 440,206. The industry has become increasingly disenchanted with the registration system, which distorts the pattern of annual sales with the creation of the August sales 'bulge'. The transport industry yesterday joined the campaign to change the system. Mr Paul Bates, general manager of Vehicle Management Services, part of NFC, the logistics and moving services group, said that the August workload created 'undue pressures and costs . . . for no discernible gain.' The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is investigating a number of alternative registration systems which it hopes to present to the government before the end of the year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service Press </F> Bureau report on "Speech by B.N. Yeltsin at Meeting with  Leadership and Staff of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service":  "Rights and Duties of Intelligence Officers"]    [Text] Russia is currently going through one of the most  crucial stages in the formation of its statehood, the Russian  Federation president said.    The Constitution has been adopted by a nationwide vote. The  country has received the legal basis for continuing its profound  economic and political transformations and for organizing normal  activity by state institutions.    One of the main tasks today is to expand the Russian  Federation's legislative infrastructure and develop the  mechanisms for cooperation among power structures at federal,  regional, and local level.    Without this we will be unable to resolve Russia's numerous  problems or to overcome the economic crisis.    Our state is obliged to ensure stability and to guarantee  the  security of the country and of citizens. That is why it must be  strong.    The Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] is directly involved  in solving this problem.    Some two or so years ago the decision was made to split the  former KGB into separate services. Serious reform of the  Russian special services began. A number of fundamental issues  have been successfully settled.    For the first time in its history Russia has a law on the  foreign intelligence service. A statute on the FIS has been  ratified. Thus, a firm legal base has been provided for your  activities. Guarantees have been created for the legal status  of and social support for intelligence officers and for the  confidentiality of information about them.    The necessary reorganization has been carried out. A number  of new subunits have been set up. Important steps have been  taken within the FIS structure in the direction of greater  openness on the part of the intelligence service toward society.  Taking account of specific situations, of course.    The recently adopted Constitution has consolidated the new  procedure for regulating the questions of safeguarding the  state's security. These come under the exclusive jurisdiction  of the federal authorities. Leadership of the relevant organs  is provided by the president.    The FIS too is directly subordinate to the president. The  supreme purpose of Russia's foreign intelligence is to serve  Russia's national and state interests. We will be strengthening  the service and enhancing the prestige of those who work for it.  This is not only the president's principled view, it is my  policy.    The country's leadership has a clear and unambiguous opinion  -- at a time when military budgets are being cut, intelligence  information is becoming a most important guarantee of security.  This means that the role of intelligence should and will  increase.    Extensive use is made of the methods of secret diplomacy in  the practice of international relations.    We should be able to look under the cover of these secrets  so  as not to be caught napping.    Your service has direct access to the Russian leadership,  and  this means it is obliged to supply it with objective,  up-to-the-minute, and full information.    I must say that the FIS has a high reputation within the  system of Russian state power. I expect that henceforth your  operational information, analytical conclusions, and  recommendations will receive only high assessments.    The time when the intelligence service's merits were mainly  measured by how vigorously it served ideological precepts and  expanded zones of ideological influence on different continents  is a thing of the past.    We expect foreign intelligence to produce the intelligence  information needed for the adoption of fundamental state  decisions on the issues of Russia's foreign and domestic policy,  the implementation of our economic policy, and the securing of  scientific and technical progress.    I am well aware that the FIS has probably never faced a more  complex period than it does at present. And this is determined  above all by the present-day international situation.    Its main feature is the scale and high speed of the changes  which are continuously complicating an already complex world.    The vector of world development is, on the whole, favorable  for Russia, but we should bear in mind that its direction can  change. The world is at a crossroads, largely because one of the  greatest powers -- Russia -- is in transition.    You know just as well as I that there are forces abroad  which  would like to keep Russia in a state of controlled paralysis.  But I am convinced that only a strong, democratic, and  prosperous Russian state will be a factor in helping the world  acquire a new outlook. Making Russia just such a factor is our  common task.    The period of global confrontation in international politics  is over, but its inertia is still strong. The Cold War has left  behind a smattering of burning and smoldering conflicts. The  norms of international law are proving difficult to assert.  Strong-arm military factors could be brought into play at any  time.    The priority task for the FIS is to anticipate problems  which  the state may encounter in the immediate and more distant  future. Consequently, intelligence should be one of the leading  think tanks for stabilizing the situation in the world and for  averting any threats to Russia's national security.    We are improving the activeness of Russian foreign policy  and  doing the groundwork for the 21st century.    Relations between Russia and the Western countries have been  improving radically of late. We have achieved a level of  partnership with some of these countries. But now it is  particularly important to differentiate between partnership and  attempts to dominate us and to impose on us actions that run  counter to Russia's interests. This is unacceptable to us.    The fundamental point in Russia's military and foreign  policy  doctrines is that they view no state as an enemy. This approach  should also underpin Russia's intelligence doctrine.    We have concluded important arms reduction agreements and we  want to be confident that our partners are strictly observing  them. It is the intelligence service's constant duty to issue  warnings about attempts to create [o popytkakh sozdaniya] new  types of weapons or about breakthroughs by other countries  [otryv drugikh stran] in the military-technical sphere.    This is all the more important because the majority of  countries working on the development [sozdaniye] of nuclear and  other types of weapons of mass destruction are located  relatively close to Russia. Our direct duty is to prevent any  escalation of this danger and to avoid it turning into a direct  threat to Russia.    Russia has its own view of its foreign and domestic policy  priorities, and it has its own interests in the international  arena. This is graphically visible in the settlement of the  Bosnian crisis, and in our actions in nearby foreign countries  and on other issues.    Recently we have clearly seen that this activeness on  Russia's part sometimes gives rise to irritation. A clear  illustration of this is the political campaign over the  so-called "Ames affair." The real motives and goals of this  anti-Russian action have clearly political overtones. U.S.  intelligence is stepping up its efforts to acquire agents in  Russia. But the U.S. special services believe that the FIS and  its military counterparts have no right to act in the same way.    I can assure you that Russia does not intend to put up with  this kind of discrimination any more. We are prepared to take  every measure provided for by international law in order to  rectify the situation.    Russia advocates equal and mutually advantageous cooperation  and mutual respect. And I believe that our partners will learn  to take our position into account.    I see the occasional outbreaks of nervousness as evidence of  a gradual recognition of the fact that the newly independent  states are areas of vital interest to Russia [novoye  nezavisimoye gosudarstvo -- zona zhiznennykh interesov Rossii].    We want there to be a zone of stability, mutually  advantageous cooperation, and good-neighborliness around the  perimeter of the Russian border. And nobody can rebuke us for  that.    We are interested in stepping up integration processes  within  the CIS framework and we are striving to play a more active role  in them.    It is no secret that certain politicians in the West see  this  as evidence of a revival of Russia's former imperial ambitions.    We can clearly see that this far-fetched thesis is being  used  to artificially exacerbate relations between the CIS and Baltic  countries and Russia. Some of the newly independent states are  also trying to derive an advantage for themselves. They are  rushing to demonstrate their readiness to accept dubious  proposals from outside [so storony].    The FIS faces the crucial task of acquiring preemptive  information on the corresponding plans and intentions of the  leading Western countries in respect of our neighbors. And of  providing timely proposals for neutralizing schemes of this kind.    Rejecting the concept of "global" and "total" intelligence,  it is necessary above all to systematically monitor the  situation along the entire perimeter of our borders.    Russia faces near its borders a direct threat from armed  conflicts which threaten here and there to spill over into  Russian territory. A great deal of effort will be needed to  find ways to neutralize conflict situations in adjacent  countries.    The intelligence service is obliged to expose in good time  the driving forces behind each conflict and the potential for a  political, compromise settlement.    Guarantees for Russians living in neighboring countries are  a  special issue. We will vigorously protect their interests in  the Baltic countries and in other states.    We need profound and accurate assessments of foreign states'  attitudes to Russia itself and to the processes taking place in  it. It is important to expose and skillfully thwart any  attempts to influence the situation in our country from outside.  All the more so if these actions are aimed at stepping up  disintegration processes.    International financial and economic support for our country  is a special issue. I have already said and I repeat that we do  not reject it but nor are we linking the fate of reform to  foreign support.    Intelligence can also make a weighty contribution to  safeguarding Russia's economic security. It is far more  important for Russia's economic interests to ensure free access  to other countries' markets for goods and other Russian  products. The solution of this problem is an important task for  both our foreign policy and our intelligence service.    Organized crime has already gone beyond the confines of the  country and is establishing links with European and U.S.  criminal clans. The intelligence service and Russian law  enforcement organs must expose these links and prevent them  becoming part of an established criminal system.    A useful role in combating global threats may be played by  partnership ties with foreign special services. The FIS has  such powers and, as is well known, is making successful use of  them. The fact that you are organizing collaboration and  exchanges of information in a number of areas -- the struggle  against international terrorism, the illegal trade in  radioactive substances, drug trafficking, organized crime, and  so forth -- can only be welcomed.    In conclusion I would like to note that foreign intelligence  should help to consolidate positive trends in Russia, in the  world, and in relations with our new partners.    Under no circumstances should we leave any loopholes for  those who are interested in our secrets or who are trying to  infiltrate Russian state institutions. Firm barriers must be  put in the way of that. In short, we expect a lot from you, as  we do from your military counterparts.    The FIS is a special organization. Its ranks boast  top-notch specialists with rare and valuable skills. People who  have confirmed their lofty patriotism and devotion to Russia  through their intensive work abroad are employed here. Your  work requires exceptional efforts. For my part, I wish to  assure you that the state will provide every possible support  for the FIS.    All intelligence officers, wherever they may be, can be  firmly confident that their homeland needs their work, and  Russia will always show proper concern for them and their  families.</p>

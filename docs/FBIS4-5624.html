			<p>BFN     [Text] On 11 April, MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide  survey of 250 eligible voters on who should succeed outgoing  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and found that one-third of  the respondents want Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, to be the next prime minister.    The survey was conducted in major cities, such as Tokyo,  Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, by conducting personal interviews or  interviews over the phone. In answering "who should be the next  prime minister?" 78 people (31.2 percent of the respondents)  supported Hata, 35 (14 percent) Masayoshi Takemura, and 30 (12  percent) Michio Watanabe as the next prime minister. Lower  house member Makiko Tanaka and Hokkaido Governor Takahiro  Yokomichi were also favored as the next prime minister.  Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi, however, is not eligible to become  prime minister because he is not a Diet member.    As the reason for supporting Hata, a 28-year-old man in  Tochigi Prefecture said: "He has made a contribution to the  Hosokawa government. Also, he has been known as Japan's foreign  minister in other countries. He seems to be an able man." A  25-year-old woman in Yamaguchi Prefecture said: "Because he has  strong backing, he will be able to exercise leadership."    Takemura ranked second to Hata as a favorite figure to be  the  next prime minister. He was popular mainly in the Kansai area  where he is from. A 47-year-old woman in Osaka said: "He has a  relatively clean image." A 27-year-old man in Hokkaido also  said: "He will inherit Mr. Hosokawa's good points."    Watanabe was popular among elderly people. Because of his  career as foreign minister and finance minister, many hoped that  "Watanabe should carry out Japan's diplomatic policy saying what  it has to say to the United States, as well as the work to  reconstruct the economy."    Takako Doi and Masaharu Gotoda were also popular because of  their "clean" image. A 45-year-old woman in Tokyo put her  expectations on Doi, saying: "I hope that the Diet will take  the plunge and name Doi as the first female prime minister."</p>

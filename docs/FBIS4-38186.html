			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 28 Jun (INA) -- Trade Minister Dr.  Muhammad Mahdi Salih has met with Ahmad Shakir, head of the  society for promoting Arab-French relations, and his  accompanying delegation.    During the meeting, the minister reviewed the repercussions  of the continued criminal, unfair economic blockade imposed on  the Iraqi people in violation of international and humanitarian  laws and norms, as well as the Iraqi people's suffering due to  the severe shortage of food and medications.    The French delegation expressed its appreciation for the  construction achieved in Iraq, which was based on its own  capabilities despite the blockade imposed on it. The delegation  also said that it hoped the blockade will be lifted as soon as  possible and that French-Iraqi relations will return to normal  in order to serve the interests of both countries.</p>

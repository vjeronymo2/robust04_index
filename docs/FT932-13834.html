			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities wanted A switch in sentiment in the water and electricity sectors sent shares in both racing forward. Panmure Gordon was one of a number of brokers seeking to take advantage of the sectors' recent underperformance. Analyst Mr Angelos Anastasiou said the run-up to the results in a month's time will begin to anticipate the expected good results and dividend rises to be reported in the season. He believes both sectors will outperform the market in this period. Kleinwort Benson was another house to switch its 'take profits' advice to a buy on the water stocks. Among these, Southern forged ahead 12 to 529p, Wessex 15 to 628p and South West 13 to 541p. In the electricity group, Yorkshire added 5 at 527p, Norweb 8 at 526p and Manweb 7 at 532p.</p>

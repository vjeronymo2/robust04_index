			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Arts: The Taming of the Shrew - Royal Shakespeare Company, Stratford-upon-Avon Montaigne knew that good marriages abjure the company and conditions of love and endeavour to present those of amity: 'It is a sweet society of life, full of consistency, of trust and an infinite number of profitable and solid offices, and mutual obligations.' But the connubial coup in Bill Alexander's exciting Taming of the Shrew (Royal Shakespeare Company) has nothing to do with Kate and Petruchio; it has to do with the plot. At last a director has succeeded in marrying the shabby Christopher Sly scenes to the lustrous central action of the Shrew. This is, as Shakespeare nearly said, a true marriage of impediments which nobody minds. As a piece of theatre, it is intelligent, magical, and wholly absorbing. Christopher Sly has always troubled directors. Jonathan Miller (RSC 1987) excised him, but here, Alexander has rewritten his scenes and made them germane to the action. A group of jeunesse doree (1992 vintage) comes across the drunken Sly and decides to take him home to an Elizabethan dress performance of the Shrew. The exterior scaffolding set gives way to a candlelit wood-panelled interior, sofas and sweetmeats on a dais. Sly sits among the floppy aristocrats, watching the performance which they share with the theatre audience. He intervenes occasionally, reassured by Petruchio, 'It's all right, it's only a play.' But what starts as a joke - fooling the drunk - transforms itself, by the alchemy of drama, and beguiles the tricksters. This revives the play's concerns with states of wakefulness and dreaming. Sly is put back, finally waking to see the actors arriving for an after-show drink. By framing the action, Alexander sidesteps the play's political difficulties in the post-feminist 1990s, since his Shrew has become a performance within a play. Alexander is not hamstrung by the self-censorship of political correctness: Kate's final speech no longer has to be ironic, for she speaks it not to the theatre but to a self-possessed 20th-century woman in the closet audience. A feminist reaction is one among many in a complex and crowded scene. The Shrew itself, played on a bare stage, has great energy and verve. It will tighten and quicken as the season advances. The principals are apt and subtle. Anton Lesser's Petruchio is the confused New Man of the 1980s: a soft centre baked to a hard exterior, and never simply the brawling braggadocio of tradition. Opposite him, Amanda Harris as Kate appears in a poisonous crouch, every vituperation wrenched from her like a concession. When she lightens up and agrees with Petruchio that the 'sun' is indeed the 'moon - or what you will', one senses the strong, uneasy accommodation of two strong wills. Below stairs, Geoffrey Freshwater as Grumio plays the natural roustabout man's man. He involves the drawling closet onlookers in the dangerous homecoming scene (Dorian MacDonald and Barnaby Kay are particularly good at playing non-actors acting) ahead of Petruchio and Katherine. Elsewhere, the parallel plot which Dr Johnson thought exquisitely entwined with the wooing of Kate, is carried by Trevor Martin as a sonorous Baptista, Rebecca Saire as a willowy Bianca, and a trio of suitors lead by John McAndrew's bland Lucentio. The staging is meticulous and exact, the lighting imaginative, the overall effect consistently winning. This production calls up the visceral world of the Sonnets, also from the 1590s: 'Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter: In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.' In repertory until January 1993 at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. Box Office (0789) 295623</p>

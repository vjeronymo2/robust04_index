			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GOODWILL GAMES ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BARROWMAN SWIMS TO A RECORD  </P> <P> Mike Barrowman of the United States set a world record in the men's 200-meter  breaststroke Friday at Tacoma, Wash., in a time of 2:11.53.  </P> <P> Barrowman bettered his own record of 2:12.89 set Aug. 20, 1989, at the Pan  Pacific Games in Tokyo.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Matt Biondi defeated fellow American Tom Jager in the 50-meter  freestyle for the first gold medal.  </P> <P> Biondi, who won five gold medals at the Seoul Olympics two years ago, swam the  fifth fastest time ever in the 50 in beating his archrival. Biondi won in 22.10  seconds. Jager was second in 22.31, far off his world record of 21.81.  </P> <P> It was only the seventh time Biondi has beaten Jager in 19 meetings in the 50.  Vladimir Tkachenko of the Soviet Union was third in 22.57.  </P> <P> The Chinese women's volleyball team overcame a slow start to defeat Peru at  Spokane, Wash., as the round-robin tournament began with a rematch of the  teams' 1988 Olympic silver-medal encounter.  </P> <P> In another match, Brazil beat Canada, 15-5, 15-2, 15-3.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, which won the gold medal at the Olympic Games at Seoul,  played the United States in a later Friday night.  </P> <P> China won in four games over Olympic silver-medalist Peru, 15-5, 7-15, 15-13  and 15-7, before a crowd of 1,000 at the 6,216-seat Spokane Coliseum.  </P> <P> "Seoul was a big game. This was for friendship, so we were not so nervous,"  Chinese player Li Guojun said. "This game was not as tough, but we both could  have played better."  </P> <P> Peru, with four players from the Olympic squad, suffered from a lack of  preparation, according to Cenaida Uribe Medina, a player.  </P> <P> "Many of the players were playing in Italy and Brazil and unable to practice  together," she said.  </P></p>

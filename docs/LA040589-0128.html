			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KRAFT DOES NOT TAKE STAND AT HIS TRIAL; DEFENSE RESTS  </P> <P> The defense rested in the Randy Steven Kraft serial-murder trial Tuesday.  </P> <P> To the disappointment of spectators crowded into a Santa Ana courtroom, Kraft's  lawyers closed their case without putting their client on the stand. They kept  him off after failing to persuade the judge to restrict cross-examination.  </P> <P> Among those upset to hear that Kraft wouldn't be testifying were some relatives  of his alleged victims.  </P> <P> "You bet I'm angry," said a shaken Rodger DeVaul, whose 20-year-old son, Rodger  Jr., was found slain in 1983. "Even if he got up on the witness stand and lied,  the prosecutor might have gotten something out of him, so that we might have  learned something about what happened. Now we will never know."  </P> <P> Kraft, a 44-year-old Long Beach computer consultant, has been on trial since  last July for murder in the deaths in Orange County of 16 young men between the  ages of 18 and 25. If Kraft is convicted, prosecutors have told the court that  they may present evidence suggesting that he killed up to 29 other young men,  including six in Oregon, two in Michigan and the rest in Southern California.  If convicted, Kraft will face the death penalty.  </P> <P> Kraft's lawyers told Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin last week that  their client wanted to testify about five of the 16 murders with which he is  charged but only if the judge would prohibit Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown  from asking any questions about the other 11. The judge refused to rule until  after defense lawyers completed their questioning of Kraft.  </P> <P> The courtroom has been two-thirds empty on most days since testimony began last  September. But after published reports that the defense planned to rest its  case Tuesday, the courtroom was crowded and the number of news media  representatives had quadrupled.  </P> <P> After calling three witnesses in the morning session, Kraft attorney C. Thomas  McDonald announced that he might have one more witness in the afternoon.  Instead, in the afternoon the judge permitted a rare hearing in his chambers --  outside public view -- for McDonald and co-counsel James G. Merwin to make  another pitch for limiting cross-examination. The judge refused again to rule  in advance.  </P> <P> "Mr. Kraft definitely wanted to defend himself, but the judge's ruling  precluded that," McDonald said later.  </P> <P> The defense argued that Kraft, under the constitution, has a right not to  answer prosecutors' questions concerning the 11 murders he chose not to testify  about. But prosecutor Brown claims that the 16 murders are linked by Kraft's  method of operation. If would be impossible for Kraft to discuss five murders,  the prosecution contends, without him touching on circumstances involving the  other deaths.  </P> <P> Kraft was arrested May 14, 1983, when two California Highway Patrol officers on  Interstate 5 in Mission Viejo found a dead Marine in the front passenger seat  of his car.  </P> <P> Kraft's decision not to testify has left jurors with no explanation of the  circumstances of the Marine's death. Nor has the defense offered much  explanation for pictures of some of the victims -- in lewd poses, and appearing  dead or unconscious -- found in Kraft's car and at his house.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers have said they recognize that jurors may have some questions  but believe that a defense has been presented to each of the 16 murder charges.  </P> <P> The judge excused the jury until Thursday, when Brown is scheduled to begin  calling rebuttal witnesses. Brown said that phase of the case would probably  take less than a week.  </P> <P> The judge told jurors that closing arguments would be made the week of April  17. Lawyers said closing arguments would take 2 days.  </P> <P> Once jurors begin their deliberations, Judge McCartin has scheduled to have  them sequestered at a local hotel until they reach a verdict.  </P> <P> If Kraft is found guilty, the trial then will move into a penalty phase, where  the same jurors will have one issue before them: whether to return a verdict of  death or life in prison without parole. Should Kraft be acquitted, he would  automatically be held for other jurisdictions where he is suspected of serial  killings.  </P></p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Controversy continues to dog EU banana regime - A problem highlighted by storm damage to the Windward Islands' crops The storms that devastated banana crops in the Windward Islands earlier this month have focused fresh attention on the controversy surrounding the European Union's new banana import regime. The tropical storm is estimated to have cut output from the eastern Caribbean islands by about 40 per cent. They normally produce about 290,000 tonnes of bananas a year, which go mainly to the UK. Geest, the main importer from the islands, wants the European Commission to allow it to import supplies from Latin America to make up the shortfall, treating them as if they were Windward Islands' produce and entitled to duty-free entry to the EU. So-called dollar bananas from Latin America, where production costs are much lower, are subject to strict quotas and tariffs under the import regime introduced by the EU in July last year. Ms Clare Wenner, Geest external affairs director, says the apparent inability to make such transfers between production areas in the event of a natural disaster is a 'major deficiency' in the new regime. Geest, which imports half its bananas from the islands and half from Latin America, is concerned that the Windwards may lose market share permanently, she says. 'We want them to be allowed to have some mechanism whereby replacement bananas can be sourced as if they were Windward Islands bananas.' The US group is hoping for backing from the French, because the storms caused serious damage in Martinique, one of their main Caribbean suppliers. Output there is expected to be down by at least 40 per cent, and possibly much more. However, the European Commission is believed to be reluctant to consider changes because this could be used by Germany, a fierce opponent of the regime, as an opportunity to renegotiate the whole basis of the regime. 'The Commission is terrified of bringing forward amendments,' said one national official close to the negotiations. Germany, which argues that the regime discriminates against its traditional suppliers in Latin America, is taking a second case to the European Court challenging the quotas. Final judgment in its first case is due on October 6, but the court's advocate general has recommended its rejection. The Commission has increased the quota for Latin American banana imports by 118,000 tonnes this year to 2.118m tonnes, but this is to take account of an increase in consumption. The situation in the Windward Isles is still under consideration and is expected to be discussed by the commission's banana committee on October 5. 'We have to assess the damage and see what would be the best way to help them economically,' an official said. Meanwhile, the new regime faces another threat from the US, where banana exporters have filed for Mr Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, to launch a formal investigation. The exporters, Chiquita Brands International and the Hawaii Banana Industry Association, claim it is damaging their interests by discriminating against US companies in favour of European ones in its allocation of eligibility for import licences. They are also unhappy about an agreement between the EU and four key Latin American producers - Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela - which is due to be implemented on October 1. It grants these countries specific quotas based on their past share of the market, within an overall ceiling of 2.1m tonnes of bananas from Latin America this year - up from 2m tonnes. The US exporters say it gives the four signatories preferential access to the EU market. However, the regime is specifically designed to ensure that bananas from former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) continue to find a market in the EU as part of member states' obligations under the Lome trade and aid convention. It allocates 30 per cent of import licences to traders on the basis of past trade in ACP bananas, 60 per cent on the basis of past trade in Latin American bananas, and 10 per cent to newcomers and traders in EU bananas.</p>

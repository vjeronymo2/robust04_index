			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The Hope Project has  helped 24,000 school-age children in east Anhui province return  to the classroom in the past four years, provincial education  officials said here.    With nearly 10 million yuan it has raised, the project has  set up schooling foundations in 21 counties and built 21 primary  and secondary schools, the officials said.    Poverty, plus the big flood in 1991, has led to the exodus  of  thousands of children in the province from their schools.    But the Hope Project, which is helping to reverse the trend,  has received wide support both from within and from outside the  province. Donors range from kindergarten children to professors  and government officials, as well as companies and other  institutions.    State Councilor Peng Penyun now personally underwrites one  child's schooling. Youths in Tianjin made donations to build  three schools. The China Pingan Insurance Company donated  500,000 yuan to help 1,000 children with their education. The  company also helped build a primary school at Liuan County.    Donators also included business people and artists from Hong  Kong and Taiwan.    Overseas institutions and individuals have also given a  helping hand. Chinese Americans in Los Angeles funded China's  first Hope Project school in Jinzhai County. A Hong Kong  entrepreneur donated 200,000 yuan. The United Nations  Children's Fund and a British organization for children have  also contributed to the cause.    In 1993, the province raised 11 million yuan through the  issue of a "love heart" lottery.    Zhang Zongyou, a sophomore at Fuyang Teacher's College, has  become China's first college student to reach campus through  Hope Project help.</p>

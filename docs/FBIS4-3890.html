			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Zhu Daian (2612 0108 1344): "Advanced </F> Security System To Be Installed in Potala Palace"]    [Text] Lhasa, 5 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--A responsible  official from the office in charge of repairing Potala Palace  said in an interview that the installation of a security system  using modern safety technology had begun recently.    Potala Palace, which was built more than 1,000 years ago, is  famous as the palace at the highest altitude in the world.  Being the crystallization of the wisdom of the Tibetan people  and the gem of Chinese culture, Potala Palace is the key object  of protection by the state and the Tibet Autonomous Region.    The safety technology and the security project is a new item  in Potala Palace's full-scale repair and maintenance project,  which has been going on for the last five years. The project  includes an automatic system to fight fires, an automatic  burglar detection system, a television monitoring system, and a  command and communications system. The equipment is all  technologically advanced by international standards. After the  completion of the project, the screens in the control center  will show the safety conditions throughout the palace, and the  systems will perform the automatic fire fighting and burglar  detection functions.    It has been learned that the safety and protection project  in  Potala Palace is costing approximately 3 million yuan, and it is  expected that it will be officially put into operation in early  August.</p>

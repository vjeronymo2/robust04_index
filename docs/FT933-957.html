			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Smith wins support in fight over party voting reforms MR JOHN SMITH was thrown a lifeline by his trade union allies last night as his battle to extend Labour's internal democracy turned its Brighton conference into a power struggle between the party's modernisers and traditionalists. After a day of horsetrading in seafront hotels, the public service union Nupe said it would support Labour's plan to replace union participation in the selection of parliamentary candidates with a 'one-member-one-vote' system. Three other unions - Cohse, representing health workers, UCW, the postal union, and Usdaw, representing shopworkers - also switched their support to the Labour leader. Usdaw's backing was by a margin of only two votes in the delegation meeting. Mr Smith, who has staked his political authority on the proposal, said the tide was now running in his favour, and senior party officials privately predicted a comfortable victory in Wednesday's crucial conference vote. But in a public display of acrimony reminiscent of Labour conferences in the mid-1980s, the leaders of the GMB and TGWU general unions denounced Mr Smith's plan as an attempt to exclude trade unions from Labour's decision-making. The final outcome on Wednesday may now depend on the extent of support for Mr Smith from many, as yet undecided, constituency delegates. The skirmishes on the eve of the conference's formal opening later today also revealed sharp differences running well beyond what for most outside the party represents an arcane internal dispute. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary and a leading party moderniser, launched a scathing attack on those in the party opposing change. In an interview in the Financial Times, Mr Blair described as 'eccentric' and 'deluded' the traditionalists who blamed the party's election defeats on a failure to be sufficiently bold. He declared that Labour had to face up to the fact that 'old-style collectivism has had its day'. But in a change of tone and emphasis, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, appeared to concede some ground to the trade unions leaders and leftwing MPs demanding a more expansionist economic strategy. Mr Brown derided a suggestion by Mr John Edmunds, the GMB leader, that the party should commit itself to a Pounds 10bn increase in public borrowing. He also refused to spell out any specific proposals for increases in income tax. But pledging to reverse the widening of the gap between rich and poor which had taken place during the 1980s, he insisted that redistribution of wealth was a central issue in terms of social justice and economic efficiency. 'If you're too poor to pay income tax, you shouldn't have to do so,' he said, 'but if you have the money, the progressive principle will apply'. That failed to reassure Mr Bryan Gould, the leading left-wing critic of the leadership, who accused the party of being effectively 'brain-dead' on economic policy.

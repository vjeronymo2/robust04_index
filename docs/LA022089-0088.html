NBC's "Hound Town," a half-hour comedy set in a typical American  suburb, "concerns the lives that dogs have of which humans are unaware,"  according to director Ralph Bakshi, who added: "The dogs have their own views  of humans and ultimately turn out to be more civilized than we are." The series  is tentatively scheduled for a Friday night time slot.  </P></p>

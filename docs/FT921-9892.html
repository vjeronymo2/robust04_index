			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance And The Family (London Markets): January's revival stutters to a halt THE JANUARY rally ended with the month. Since then, the stock market has been jumpy, with little buying or selling by investment institutions or the public. The FTSE index ended the first week in February at 2,517.2, down 54.0. There was another way in which the week marked a change of mood. As the chart shows, January was a month in which shares of companies in cyclical industries - GKN in car components, for example, Tarmac in building materials and British Steel in metals - outperformed the market as a whole. During 1991, these sectors lagged far behind the market as a whole where the good news came from 'defensive' stocks - especially the health and household sector of the FT-Actuaries All-Share index dominated by the big international pharmaceutical companies like Glaxo. In January, when the cyclicals were outperforming, Glaxo was unchanged relative to the index as a whole - scarcely a sign of poor performance but a signal that defensive stocks were, perhaps, about to give up the market leadership. This week, cyclical and defensive stocks suffered together. Tarmac, for instance, closed at 118p, down 3p; GKN at 315p, down 5p; and British Steel at 74p, down 4p. Glaxo also did badly, ending the week at 816p, down 29p. There is logic behind the cyclicals' stalled recovery, summed-up by Kleinwort Benson's recommendation to avoid all but the strongest shares in this category, at least until the results' season in March and April gives a clearer picture of their financial strength and trading experience. The imminent results of such blue-chip companies as BP, Hanson and the UK clearing banks are certainly not helping the market's jitters. BP shares closed the week at 275p, down 12p, after chairman Robert Horton called publicly for an OPEC production cut to raise oil prices. The market also was swept by apparently unfounded rumours of dissension on the board about dividend policy. BP's results are due next Thursday. Hanson is expected to report its first-ever quarterly decline in profits next week; and the first of the clearers, Lloyds, will report a week next Friday. One important influence on the UK recovery, the interest-rate war between the US and Germany, took a turn for the worse during the week. In Germany, Monday saw a 6.4 per cent wage settlement for the steel workers' union, probably too high to give the president of the Bundesbank, Helmut Schlesinger, any incentive for a speedy cut in interest rates. He went on to underline the need for monetary stringency in a newspaper interview on Thursday. The next day, the US payroll numbers came in much worse than Wall Street economists had expected, raising hopes of even lower interest rates there. The pound rose against the dollar sharply on Friday, establishing itself above Dollars 1.83. That is not good news for companies exporting to the US (although it is better tidings for the substantial band of companies with big US operations). Against the D-mark, sterling weakened slightly but is still above its floor. Hopes that the UK might be able to manage a unilateral interest rate cut before the general election seemed to have weakened: short-term money market rates were indicating no expectations of a change in base rates in the near future. The car industry this week was the recipient of ambiguous news. On the one hand, it was spared any wholesale change in its distribution arrangements by the Monopolies Commission, which recommended a very restrained set of changes despite evidence that UK customers were paying too much for new cars. On the other hand, the car sales figures for January, published on Thursday, were the lowest for that month since 1982 and 30 per cent below those in in January 1989. Still, the monthly year-on-year fall was the smallest since March 1990, perhaps a sign that the slide in sales is at last slowing. Not fast enough for Ford, though: on Friday, the company announced that 2,100 jobs would go at its UK plant. It was just one of a series of announcements of redundancies by big companies during the week. While Ford was making headlines by shedding thousands of people, Granada group was in the news for sacking one: David Plowright, the head of its television subsidiary, who departed amid an unusually intense flurry of petition-signing. The share price suffered to start with but closed at 220p, down only 4p on the week. Any share price weakness might also have reflected, of course, on the way Granada was listed by UBS Phillips and Drew's quantitative research team as one of seven stocks to sell. Its recommendations, which reflected in part a shift to a belief in continued recession in 1992, singled-out three sectors - health and households, hotels and leisure, and telephone networks - as sells, and three as buys: chemicals, other industrial materials, and motors. On the face of it, these chosen sectors look suspiciously like the cyclicals that should do well when recovery comes. So why pick them when you expect continued recession? The UBS team argues that the continued economic sluggishness will affect domestic consumer and service stocks worse but that internationally-orientated manufacturers, which have cut costs hardest, will do well, especially if a new Labour government tilts the tax and regulatory balance in their favour. If that is right, the UK is about to enter a period when making things is more profitable than moving paper, something that has not happened on a sustained basis since the early 1960s. Let us hope it happens in the 1990s: without such a shift, it is hard to see the UK surviving inside the ERM.</p>

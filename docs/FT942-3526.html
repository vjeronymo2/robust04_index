			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Foreign investors favour Cemig - Brazilian electricity group attracts interest Brazil's Cemig, Latin America's biggest electricity company in geographical terms, has become a favourite of foreign investors. They have been attracted by Cemig's productivity gains, its low debt and the potential privatisation of Brazil's electricity sector. However, Cemig's prices are among the lowest in Brazil, raising questions about whether the company can raise profitability in the long term. Cemig, or Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, is controlled by the state of Minas Gerais, which owns 84 per cent of its voting shares and 57 per cent of its total capital. The company was created in 1952 by Mr Juscelino Kubitschek, the modernising state governor and future president, as a generator, transmitter and distributor. The state has used the company, covering an area larger than France, to gain access to international capital markets. In January, the state sold Dollars 200m of eurobonds with equity warrants in the company and it is now planning a private placement of non-voting American depositary receipts (ADRs) for at least Dollars 150m. Overseas interest was stimulated by a Level 1 ADR programme launched last year, and the company is adapting its accounts to US standards for a possible capital issue of Level 3 ADRs next year. Currently, about 12 per cent of Cemig's capital is held by foreigners, compared with almost nothing three years ago. Cemig has proved attractive to international investors in spite of an operating loss of Dollars 165m last year following combined operating losses of nearly Dollars 200m in 1991 and 1992. Cemig blames the losses on the government's policy of keeping electricity prices artificially low to try to control Brazil's chronic inflation. It also says a change in accounting policy in 1990, adopted by most of the industry, led to an increase of about 60 per cent in depreciation costs. However, a new electricity price structure introduced ahead of the real, Brazil's new currency due to enter circulation in July, will lead to a one-off 20 per cent increase in prices for the company, according to Mr Luiz Fernando Rolla, a Cemig finance official. Mr Rolla predicts the price increase will help the company to make a small profit this year. He says investors have been attracted by its low debt, its reputation for being well managed and prospects for a long-term increase in demand in Minas Gerais state. Another attraction has been the prospect of privatisation, leading to price increases over the longer term. The government is said to be looking at the industry's privatisation but no clear decision is expected until after presidential elections at the end of the year. Cemig's total debt is only 9 per cent of shareholders' capital, partly because of under-investment, particularly since the early 1980s when many publicly-controlled companies were starved of funds. The company has also avoided the highly expensive local debt market and sought funds from agencies such as the World Bank. Productivity has grown in the past three years, helped by 1,000 job cuts, reducing the payroll to 17,000. Another 4,000 to 5,000 jobs could go by the year 2000, says company president Mr Carlos Aloy. Cemig's ability to cut costs is limited, however, because it is obliged by the federal government to buy 17 per cent of the energy from the Itaipu hydroelectric plant on the Brazil-Paraguay border. This amounts to 28 per cent of Cemig's energy needs, but 34 per cent of its operating costs. But a more important problem, according to analysts, is that about 70 per cent of Cemig's revenues comes from industrial users, which traditionally pay lower prices than residential users. This means Cemig's prices are on average the lowest in Brazil, according to Mr Antonio Zagatto, planning manager at Sao Paulo's electricity company Cesp, where industrial customers make up about 50 per cent of revenues. Many of Cemig's industrial consumers are in electricity-intensive sectors, such as aluminium production, which have won large discounts from the company. There is also a question mark over Cemig's capital investment. Mr Luiz Henrique Michalick, company spokesman, says Cemig should be investing about Dollars 450m a year, instead of the current Dollars 300m, to cover depreciation costs and prepare for increased demand. He points to proposed generating partnerships with large consumers, such as the mining company Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), as a way of increasing electricity supply in the long term using shared capital investment. Mr Aloy highlights the need for 'maximum partnerships with the private sector'. However, he adds that when a new plant in the western area of Nova Ponte comes into operation later this year, Cemig will have sufficient capacity to cope with current demand, even without energy from Itaipu.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRLINE SEVERS TIE WITH CBS IN DISPUTE  </P> <P> Because CBS refused to cut stories about air crashes and other airline problems  from the daily in-flight news shows it provides American Airlines, it is losing  American's business on Feb. 28, a CBS official said.  </P> <P> Thus, in March, only taped CNN newscasts -- without pictures of airline crash  stories -- will continue on the airline, thanks to an unusual contract that  Turner Home Entertainment said it expects to sign next week with American.  </P> <P> American's rationale may be to avoid alarming its passengers, but "it's like  passing out newspapers with holes cut in them," said David Berman, a vice  president of CBS Broadcast International.  </P> <P> "The agreement is limited to (stories about) air crashes," said Steve  Chamberlain, vice president of Turner Home Entertainment, which merchandises  programs of Cable News Network, part of Ted Turner's cable empire.  </P> <P> "There will not be any other wholesale editing of our product," he adds. "Above  all, we have to preserve the journalistic integrity of our network."  </P> <P> Although he said air crash stories would be edited from CNN's in-flight news  packages for American, Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the airline, said  Thursday that this doesn't mean a complete blackout of such stories.  </P> <P> "What the contract with CNN calls for is that CNN will not show the video," she  said by phone from American's headquarters in Dallas. "They will talk, in the  audio portion, about these kinds of incidents. But they will not show the  video."  </P> <P> She called this an arrangement worked out after American's surveys showed that  its passengers complained that pictures of airline crash scenes disturbed them  deeply.  </P></p>

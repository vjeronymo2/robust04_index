			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> YANKEES SEND STEINBRENNER OUT WITH A VICTORY  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner's 17 1/2-year reign ended Monday night with one more news  conference and the New York Yankees' 6-5, 11-inning victory over the Toronto  Blue Jays at New York.  </P> <P> "He's still part of us," Manager Stump Merrill said. "That's the important  thing."  </P> <P> The loss dropped the Blue Jays one game behind Boston in the American League  East as the Red Sox beat Baltimore, 2-1.  </P> <P> The Yankees won the game when Alvaro Espinoza missed a squeeze sign and chopped  a bases-loaded single over the head of shortstop Tony Fernandez.  </P> <P> "I was lucky," Espinoza said. "I missed the sign all the way."  </P> <P> Greg Cadaret (5-4) pitched 7 2/3 scoreless innings for the victory, yielding  three hits.  </P> <P> Kevin Maas, who hit his 15th homer in the Yankees' four-run first inning,  opened the 11th with a walk off Jim Acker (2-3) and took second when catcher  Pat Borders dropped Bob Geren's sacrifice.  </P> <P> Acker pounced on Jesse Barfield's bunt and fired to third, but third baseman  Luis Sojo failed to touch the bag and was charged with an error, loading the  bases.  </P> <P> Jim Leyritz struck out, but Espinoza singled on the first pitch.  </P> <P> "I saw Geren running to third but I didn't see Maas at all," Espinoza said. "I  was lucky I got a pitch over the plate."  </P> <P> Boston 2, Baltimore 1 -- Ellis Burks' sacrifice fly in the eighth scored Carlos  Quintana with the Red Sox's winning run at Boston.  </P> <P> Quintana opened the eighth with a hit off first baseman David Segui's glove and  took second when Segui threw to an uncovered base for an error.  </P> <P> After Jeff Ballard relieved starter Pete Harnisch (9-8), Wade Boggs beat out a  hit to first before Burks delivered.  </P> <P> Greg Harris (10-5) matched his career high for victories with ninth-inning help  from Jeff Gray, who got his fourth save. Harris gave up a run and three hits  and seven walks in eight innings. Harnisch gave up three hits but walked eight  in eight-plus innings.  </P> <P> Chicago 11, Oakland 1 -- Jack McDowell pitched a three-hitter to lead the White  Sox past the Athletics at Chicago.  </P> <P> Frank Thomas hit a two-run triple to cap a three-run first inning, and Sammy  Sosa added some insurance in the sixth with a two-run homer off Oakland starter  Dave Stewart (17-9). Chicago turned the game into a rout with a five-run  eighth.  </P> <P> The win moved the White Sox to within 5 1/2 games of first-place Oakland in the  AL West.  </P> <P> McDowell (10-6) settled down after allowing a first-inning run. He struck out  eight and walked three to win his fourth straight start and post his fourth  complete game of the season.  </P> <P> Stewart, who entered the game having won six consecutive decisions, allowed  nine hits and five earned runs in seven innings.  </P> <P> Texas 6, Seattle 5 -- Julio Franco singled home the winning run with the bases  loaded and none out in the bottom of the ninth to give the Rangers a  come-from-behind victory at Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> Franco's third hit scored Pete Incaviglia and handed the Mariners their fourth  loss in a row.  </P> <P> The Rangers rallied from a 5-0 deficit to give Mike Jeffcoat (4-5) the victory.  Mike Jackson (5-5), who came in during the Rangers' three-run seventh, was the  loser.  </P> <P> Seattle's Erik Hanson, who missed his last start with a stomach flu, left after  Gary Green opened the Texas seventh with a single. Hanson was charged with  three runs.  </P> <P> Kansas City 7, Minnesota 1 -- Willie Wilson and Frank White hit two-run doubles  at Kansas City and the Royals handed the Twins their sixth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Kansas City's Storm Davis (7-8) yielded a run and four hits in eight innings.  Jeff Montgomery pitched the ninth.  </P> <P> White's double in a three-run sixth inning finished Minnesota's David West  (6-8), who yielded six Kansas City runs and and gave up seven hits. Wilson's  double gave the Royals a 3-1 lead in the first.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 4, Cleveland 3 -- Dave Parker homered and drove in three runs to lead  the Brewers at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Tom Edens (3-1), used primarily in relief, made his second start of the season  and fourth of his career, lasting a career-high 5 2/3 innings to get his first  victory as a starter. He gave up seven hits and three runs.  </P> <P> The Brewers broke a 2-2 tie on Bill Spiers' bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the  fourth, scoring Robin Yount, who walked, took second on Rob Deer's infield  groundout and went to third on an error by shortstop Felix Fermin.  </P> <P> Jim Gantner hit a liner off third baseman Brook Jacoby's glove for a single,  loading the bases against Steve Olin (1-4).  </P> <P> Milwaukee's Gary Sheffield singled in the fifth, stole second and continued on  to third on catcher Sandy Alomar's throwing error. Parker singled to make it  4-2.  </P></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (10): Europe waits for floodgates to open - Futures Funds A STRONG performance by futures funds so far this year could help get the nascent European market off the ground. According to industry estimates, around Dollars 20bn is under management in futures funds in the US, but the size of the market is much smaller in Europe - probably between Dollars 2-3bn. The European market also remains fragmented. Most funds are registered in offshore financial centres, and pitched at high net-worth individuals or small institutions in specific regions. Variations and inconsistencies in the regulatory framework make it more convenient for fund managers to register funds offshore, although most European futures fund managers are based in London. In the US, the strong regulatory environment and strict performance reporting standards have helped futures funds to gain a respectability which they have yet to acquire in Europe. For example, a number of US state pension funds now publicly invest a portion of their portfolios in futures funds. Ms Nicola Meaden, managing director of TASS Management, which tracks futures funds, says that there has been an increase in the number of funds launched in Europe this year, but mainstream institutional interest has been slow to develop. 'We are not seeing the floodgates open. In the short term, institutions are finding it easier to tackle the hedge fund managers,' Ms Meaden said. However, this year's strong performance may provide the European futures fund business with some fresh impetus. In the first eight months of this year, the average total return achieved by futures fund managers was 17.45 per cent, according to the TASS index of CTAs (commodity trading adviser - the industry term for the manager who decides the investment strategy of a particular fund). The reason for this strong performance is that 'we have had trending markets', according to Mr Peter Swete, chairman of Sabre Fund Management, a futures fund specialist which is now partly owned by Henderson. Unlike most other investments, the performance of futures funds depends less on whether markets are up or down, and more on the patterns of those movements. Although the strategies of futures fund managers vary considerably, what they have in common, apart from their use of derivatives, is that they are based on data analysis and computer power. Mr Swete, whose funds have risen 30 per cent over the past 12 months, says that their strong performance has attracted new money, doubling the size of funds under management for the same period. 'I think it has been a better year generally in Europe, mainly because there has been better performance after two or three grim years,' said Mr Mark Fox-Andrews at Mees-Pierson Derivatives. The increase in investor interest comes mainly from continental Europe, not the UK, according to many industry specialists. One reason is that 'continental European banks are moving into the futures fund business,' Mr Fox Andrews says. A number of French banks, such as Indosuez, have been active in the market for some time, but are now being joined by more Swiss, German and Dutch banks. US banks are also becoming more active, though they tend to take a slightly different approach. A number of them had lost traders from their proprietary trading desks, who had decided to apply their skills by setting up their own funds. Seeing an opportunity, several banks decided to take advantage of this home-grown talent by setting up futures fund departments staffed by former proprietary traders. 'Every major bank is now looking at this area,' according to one futures fund manager, but many still have bad memories of being scalped by futures brokers in the 1970s. This has also haunted the retail side of the industry in the UK, which has not taken off in spite of the authorisation of futures funds in the form of unit trusts. Only a handful of futures and options funds (Fofs) and guaranteed futures and options funds (GFofs) have been launched, partly because futures fund managers are not able to pay themselves the high fees to which they are accustomed. 'If you really want the top people you must pay them the top fees,' said one fund manager. Standard performance fees on offshore futures funds are 15-20 per cent. However, management fees have fallen in recent years from around 4 per cent to 1-2 per cent. There are plans to relax the rules on fees for UK-listed futures funds, but so far retail investors have not appeared hugely enthusiastic. However, one regulatory development which should help the UK futures fund business - or at least prevent practitioners from moving offshore  - is the proposal by the Securities and Futures Authority to recognise fund managers in the sector as a separate category, defined as DFMs (derivative fund managers). Because they do not hold any funds directly, they are to be allowed lower capital requirements. However, this is set to change when the EC Investment Services Directive comes into force in 1996. At present, it is hard to predict the shape that the futures fund industry will take over the next few years. It is still highly entrepreneurial, one of very few areas of financial services where it is possible to start from scratch, establish a track record, and grow very rapidly. Recent interest from banks suggests that the industry may become more institutional in character. In addition, the growing use of derivatives and of highly analytical computer trading techniques has blurred the lines between different types of investment. In particular, it is increasingly hard to draw a line between futures funds and hedge funds.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / UN force bolstered on Iraq border Bangladesh is sending 700 troops to the Iraq-Kuwait frontier to bolster the United Nations force monitoring the volatile border, Agencies report. A Bangladeshi official said the deployment was 'in response to a long-standing request from the UN'. A UN spokesman said: 'The Bangladeshis will be armed and under certain circumstances they will be able to open fire.' The zone has been patrolled by the UN since shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf War that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait after a seven-month occupation. Iraq has not recognised the border demarcated by the UN about a year ago. On Saturday, more than 500 Iraqis, mostly women and children, crossed into Kuwait to protest at work on a trench which the emirate is digging along the disputed border. A Kuwaiti contractor working on the trench fired a shot in the air after the Iraqis started throwing stones, said a spokesman for the UN Iraq-Kuwait observer mission. The US State Department condemned the border crossing, the second such incursion in a week. Shooting incidents along the 130 mile line have escalated since work on the trench reached Abdali where scores of Iraqi farmers still live. Kuwait has also reported several border shootings at its posts. The border line, drawn by a UN commission a year ago, also put 11 oil wells and an abandoned naval base that used to be in Iraq on the Kuwaiti side. Kuwait says it will compensate Iraqi farmers who lost their farms.</p>

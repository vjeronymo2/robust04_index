			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Minding Your Own Business: When the good life goes bad - John Taylor of the Rural Development Commission tells Nick Garnett that fledgling businesses in England's countryside and small towns are in poor health THEY WERE, in a way, the opposite of the Not-In-My-Back-Yard syndrome. During the 1980s, thousands of businesses made an exodus from the grime of the conurbations to villages and market towns, setting up offices and workshops right in their own backyards. Converting bedrooms into workstations and setting up companies in converted barns next to their new rural homes were goals for many keen to marry the making of money with the good life. This migration has pushed up the number of companies in the countryside. The Rural Development Commission has just conducted a survey of the health of tiny businesses in England's countryside and small towns. It estimates that in England 300,000 to half a million businesses employing less than 50 pockmark villages and towns of less than 10,000 inhabitants. The Commission, an arm of the Environment Department, says operating in rural areas still offers considerable advantages over large towns and cities. But it acknowledges that during recession companies in the countryside endure headaches over and above low orders, slow cash flow, late payments and pressure from banks which now bedevil the small business venture. As a result, more of the Commission's Pounds 38m yearly budget is now directed at helping them survive the recession. 'I think there are three or four specific problems that rural businesses face,' says John Taylor, the Commission's operations director. 'First, the client base tends to be much narrower in rural areas than in urban areas. It is not so easy in the midst of rural Herefordshire to go and find more customers during a recession. I think it is a lot easier if you are in the middle of, say, Birmingham. Geographical position definitely causes difficulties.' Second, says Taylor, there is the issue of being what the Commission refers to as a singleton business. 'That means that in that locality there is no other similar business doing what that company does. If you were a bank manager in Leicester you might have on your stocks scores of clothing firms, small, medium and large ones. You will have a view and feel for that industry. If you're a bank manager in the middle of a rural county, then you might have only one clothing firm that you deal with. The bank manager's expertise may well be in lending to the agricultural community rather than to industry.' Does that mean that Taylor thinks rural businesses sometimes do not receive as sensible advice from banks as they do in urban areas? 'Well conceivably that is the case. That's a supposition on our part, but I think our customers are saying that they are not getting very sympathetic treatment. The bank in a city would see it as a sector problem rather than the difficulty of one individual company.' The Commission's survey of 6,000 of the 30,000 companies on its register indicated that those in the north-west and west Midlands were especially anxious about bank support. In the east Midlands and East Anglia, the Commission says businesses complained particularly about the Midland Bank regularly reducing overdraft limits. Then there is the issue of rustic loneliness. 'Companies are more isolated from advice institutions which tend to be not as well represented in rural areas,' Taylor argues. 'There just isn't the sort of range of support mechanisms that you find in large towns and cities. That includes the banks and small firms advisory services as well as local employer groupings, the CBI, chambers of commerce and enterprise agencies.' Some small businesses might be as much as 50 miles from their bank manager which they retained when they left a city. What is also often missing, says Taylor, is peer group support from other recession-hit businesses. This conjures up a compelling picture of isolated companies maybe 20 miles away from small colonies of other hard-pressed entrepreneurs. 'In recession, people actually feel frightened. Loneliness becomes terror. There just isn't this long-standing tradition of peer group support.' Finally, some of the benefits of working in rural areas have turned into handicaps during the recession. The opportunity of establishing a stable workforce has always been one of the prime attractions of operating outside cities. 'That has tended to work against them during the recession,' says Taylor. 'Low labour turnover has forced them into making more and therefore costly redundancies than they would otherwise have had.' Rural business premises, attractive because of their generally lower cost, often prove even more difficult to sell than urban properties when a company runs into the buffers. Taylor also argues that many small countryside businesses have really been caught in the neck by the uniform business rate. This is especially so for many of the more established service ventures such as shops whose profit margins already tend to be narrow. Taylor says most of the advantages of running ventures in rural communities, such as lower property costs, cheaper rents and a more relaxing lifestyle remain. The drift to the countryside will continue. Moreover, recessionary pressures are not felt everywhere. In parts of the north, rural businesses are doing better than their southern counterparts. Nevertheless, the Commission has felt compelled to issue a checklist of good business practice in the form of a pamphlet called Surviving the Recession, something it perhaps should have done earlier. Its 80 advisers around England are also providing more direct advice through seminars and company visits. The rural idyll is still alive. But it has endured a bit of a battering.</p>

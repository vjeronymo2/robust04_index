			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs in demand Regional electricity stocks (recs) staged another strong upward move, with many hitting all-time highs as the market continued to look for evidence of a big stake-building exercise, or possibly even a straight takeover move. Dealers said they expected a wave of share buy-backs to impact on the market before the recs go into their closed seasons, starting in mid-September. Sentiment was again boosted by news of share buy-backs in the sector, with Seeboard announcing that it had moved back into the market last Friday to purchase a further million of its own shares, this time at 439p. The company bought 2m at 425p a share last Wednesday. Whispers in the market suggested that a predatory move could happen in the next fortnight. Southern, up 21 at 834p and the sector's best performer yesterday, was seen as both a potential target and predator. There were rumours that the group could be lining up a pre-emptive strike against one of the smaller recs as a potential defence against a US predator or a UK group seeking strong cash generative assets. Eastern Electricity was hit by profit-taking as dealers decided that it might adopt a predatory stance among its smaller UK brethren. The shares slid 9 to 854p. The Scottish generators also attracted profit-taking ahead of next week's regulatory review of their businesses. Hydro-Electric softened 2 to 425p and Power relinquished 5 at 433p. Oil shares were among the market's better performing areas. British Petroleum touched 418p but eased back to close only fractionally ahead at 414 1/2 p in spite of more encouraging news from its exploration effort in Colombia - its Colombian operations encountered what it described as a 'major new gas and condensate field'. Energy specialists said the gas find was commercially viable and, more importantly, was in an area where BP held exploration rights over substantial areas. Burmah Castrol rose 15 to 916p, albeit in limited turnover of 717,000 shares. The group is scheduled to report interims on Monday, but the rise in the shares was said to have reflected a move by one marketmaker to fill in a short position exposed by a programme trade executed last week. High street retailer Kingfisher appreciated 7 to 554p on press reports suggesting that it might take over Madalan, a private UK discount retailing club. However, at least one market watcher thought the move unlikely. Boots raced forward early in the day as some dealers came to the view that SmithKline Beecham's Dollars 2.9bn acquisition of Kodak's Sterling Health division could help the UK group obtain a favourable price for its pharmaceuticals business. Boots has indicated that it wishes to sell the division. The shares, having jumped 14 on the talk, came off the top to finish a mere 3 ahead at 582p as brokers came to the view that there was little similarity between the two groups. Retailer Body Shop fell to the year's low of 204p as company attempts to counter criticism of its environmental policies failed to calm an already nervous market. A small rally saw the shares end a net 13 down at 205p. Irish paper and packaging group Jefferson Smurfit announced that it had bought an Austrian paper mill for IPounds 20.5m. The deal will provide a way in to eastern European markets, but some analysts felt that it was too small to impact significantly on the shares and suspected additional technical position-taking. The stock rose 11 to 426p. Paper group Bowater, which announced a Pounds 15.5m purchase in the Netherlands, saw its shares recede 6 to 478p. Textile issues were treading water ahead of publication of a big review by one leading UK investment bank. Conglomerates BTR and Hanson were actively traded, prompting some talk of a switch between the two heavyweights. Analysts pointed to a 400p chart resistance level for the former. BTR slipped 4 to 391 1/2 p on turnover of 5.2m, while Hanson, ex a 3.75p dividend, was off 2 1/2 at 257 1/2 p with 7.6m shares dealt.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy Since the UK economy has survived April's tax increases better than expected, it stands to reason that the impact would be felt on government finances. The gratifying feature of the first quarter of the current financial year is the buoyancy of revenues: Inland Revenue receipts are up 9 per cent, those from Customs and Excise 7 per cent. Since low inflation has also helped keep spending under control, the PSBR for the full year could turn out lower than the government's current forecast of Pounds 36bn. This is reassuring for a bond market which has been inclined to worry about oversupply. The ease with which the market absorbed last week's Pounds 800m tap is testimony to the renewed international appetite for gilts. So is the Bank of England's decision to auction conventional stock this month, even if the expected 2010 maturity only just falls within the definition of long. By comparison with other countries, such as Italy of which more below, UK government finances are starting to look in good order. There is no guarantee yet, though, that the gilts market can simply resume its bull run. Yields have already fallen some 90 basis points from their recent peak and there is always the risk of a weak dollar triggering further international upset. Above all, cyclical improvement in the PSBR does not mean the structural problem is solved. The market would still look askance if the authorities used the opportunity to ease up on spending or yielded to pressure for tax cuts.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYRACUSE VIOLATIONS ARE ALLEGED;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: NEWSPAPER REPORTS GIFTS OF FAVORS, MERCHANDISE, CASH TO PLAYERS.  </P> <P> Syracuse University will review a newspaper's allegations of wrongdoing in its  basketball program, but the initial reaction of school officials Thursday was a  sigh of relief that the alleged NCAA rules violations were not more serious.  </P> <P> The Syracuse Post-Standard reported that the third-ranked Orangemen might have  broken dozens of NCAA rules in recent years, such as allowing players to  receive free merchandise and meals, cut-rate use of cars and cash from  boosters, including NBA Hall of Fame member Dave Bing.  </P> <P> Among the most serious allegations raised in the newspaper's seven-month  investigation was that former Orangeman Rodney Walker said a grade was changed  so he could remain eligible for a Big East game in 1987.  </P> <P> The Syracuse basketball program has been nationally ranked since March 5, 1984.  </P> <P> "Obviously some are serious, but most are minor," Robert Hill, university  director of community relations, said of the allegations.  </P> <P> The university is neither confirming nor denying the allegations at this point,  Hill added.  </P> <P> Hill said the university has sent the NCAA a copy of the Post-Standard report.  He said the stories will be analyzed and the school will consult with the NCAA.  </P> <P> Also, in College Station, Tex., Texas A&amp;M has notified the NCAA that  violations have occurred involving the transfer of a Syracuse basketball  player.  </P> <P> Alleged violations became public when recruit Tony Scott told the Post-Standard  that a New York talent scout had arranged his transfer from Syracuse to Texas  A&amp;M. The newspaper also quoted Scott as saying the university paid for part  of his father's air fare and permitted the talent scout to fly on its plane.  </P></p>

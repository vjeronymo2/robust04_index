			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China's mobile  telecommunications business has maintained rapid development in  the first season of this year. The first three months saw  nearly 150,000 new mobile telephone subscribers, bringing the  total figure of national subscribers to 784,500.    Meanwhile, wireless paging subscribers increased by more  than  852,000, bringing the total number of wireless paging  subscribers to more than 6.456 million.    Mobile telecommunications appeared in China's mainland but a  few years ago. However, the rapid development of the sector has  been fairly surprising.    In 1993 there were 461,000 new subscribers of mobile  telephones, 2.7 times the total figure for previous years, while  wireless paging had 3.384 million new subscribers, 1.5 times the  total figure for previous years. At present China's wireless  paging system has become the third largest in the world after  those in the United States and Japan.    Experts believe that China's mobile telecommunications  business is now enjoying a golden time for development.    For several years in succession, China's economy has been  steadily developing at a fairly high speed, which poses an  urgent demand for speeding up the development of  telecommunications business. And the state has also been paying  special attention to this field, with some 40 billion yuan put  into posts and telecommunications fixed assets last year. This  year the planned investment in fixed assets has been raised to  53.6 billion yuan, in a bid to reinforce the capital  construction of telecommunications.    So far, all Chinese provincial capitals have begun mobile  telephone service, and over 300 cities have opened mobile  telephone systems.    The development of mobile telephones will at last realize  the  goal of national automatic roaming service. Sources said some  provinces, including Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hubei,  Guangdong, Liaoning and Shandong, have already provided roaming  services within their own territories, while the Zhujiang River  delta, including the cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Shenzhen,  has taken the lead in the country in carrying out inter-regional  roaming services.    At the end of last year, automatic roaming services also  opened in the Chang Jiang River delta, with Shanghai city,  Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces included.    Sources from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  said that at present the country is making efforts to construct  a national mobile telephone network. By the middle of this  year, over 80 percent of coastal cities and towns will be  covered by the network; by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan  (1991-1995), cities above the prefectural level will all open  their own mobile telephone services, and at that time the  network will cover all of the country's medium-sized cities.    The rapid development of mobile telecommunications business  also provides a good development opportunity for China's mobile  telecommunications industry.    Facing the present situation in which 90 percent of the  country's mobile telecommunications market has been occupied by  Motorola and other foreign companies, related Chinese  departments have marked the research and production of advanced  mobile telecommunications equipment as a field for key  development.    Materials show that in the past two years China's mobile  telecommunications industry has achieved considerable results.  The Hangzhou Telecommunications Equipment Factory has  constructed a production line capable of producing 200,000  mobile telephones a year. Last year it produced more than  80,000 mobile telephones, while this year it plans to turn out  105,000.    In addition, the Beijing Telecommunications Equipment  Factory  has just finished a production line, with an annual output  capacity of 150,000 digital mobile telephones; some  telecommunications enterprises in Nanjing, Guangdong, Wuhan,  Shanghai and some other places have also introduced foreign  production lines and will start production in the near future.</p>

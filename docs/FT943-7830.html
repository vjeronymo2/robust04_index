			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Railtrack advisers urge labour relations shake-up The privatisation of Railtrack could be delayed indefinitely if the company fails to overhaul working practices and make big productivity improvements, according to government financial advisers. The consultants believe the 10-week series of strikes by signalling staff has so damaged the company's image with potential investors that it would be impossible to sell before the next election without a big shake-up in labour relations. Some of the advisers, who are City merchant bankers and accountants, are pressing ministers to introduce personal contracts as the clearest signal to the City that Railtrack's working practices have changed for the good. The company, which owns Britain's rail network, would prefer to settle the industrial action without introducing personal contracts. But its directors increasingly favour offering the 4,500 signal staff individual contracts if the dispute is not settled by the end of the month. Ministers had hoped to sell Railtrack for more than Pounds 3bn before the next election as the final act of railway privatisation. The Department of Transport said yesterday: 'The dispute has made no change to the government's plan for privatisation nor has it affected the privatisation programme.' However, a senior Whitehall official said that since the timing of the sell-off had never been 'formally announced', ministers could argue that their privatisation plans had not been affected by the dispute if it was postponed. Most of Railtrack's revenue comes from track access charges paid by private rail companies for the right to run trains on the rail network. The access charges are set by Railtrack but need the rail regulator's approval. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: 'With the best working practices and industrial relations the owners of Railtrack would still not control fares or access charges - which is not how most people like to run their business.' According to figures released yesterday by Mr Dobson, British Rail and Railtrack are spending more than Pounds 27m on privatisation advice. The government has already paid out Pounds 19.9m to its consultants. 'Railtrack alone is spending Pounds 16.5m on privatisation - three times the cost of settling the signalling dispute,' Mr Dobson said. The original offer in June of 5.7 per cent, which was withdrawn because it would have breached the government's public sector pay constraints, would have cost Pounds 5m. Another 24-hour strike of signal workers is due to start at noon on Monday and a further 48-hour strike was called by the RMT transport union immediately after the August bank holiday weekend. It will last from noon on August 30 to noon on September 1. See Lex BR may draft staff to break strike, Page 6</p>

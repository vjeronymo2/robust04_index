			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gerd Brueggemann report: "Waigel Bets IMF Director"] </F>   [Text] Washington -- Prior to the meeting of finance  ministers and central bank governors on the occasion of the  spring meeting of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington,  Finance Minister Theo Waigel offered a bet to IMF director  Michel Camdessus: The German world economy will develop more  favorably than predicted by the IMF. Waigel deplored that the  IMF underestimated the dynamism in the new laender. The IMF  predicted a growth of 0.8 percent, but Waigel considers 1.5  percent possible.    Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer does not expect any new  criticism of its monetary policy. The difference in interest  rates between Germany and the United States has declined from 6  percent to 1.5 percent in the past two years. The long-term U.S.  interest rates have in the meantime even risen above the German  level. This was possible without a change concerning the  exchange rates.    The two German representatives reject plans by the IMF to  create new special drawing rights worth $50 billion. Waigel  described the IMF argument that this would lead to additional  funds for Russia as "shortsighted." Aid for Russia must be  provided in the form of conditioned loans.    Waigel will meet for talks with his U.S. counterpart Lloyd  Bentsen. He will discuss, among other things, problems  concerning the admission of German companies to U.S. stock  exchanges.</p>

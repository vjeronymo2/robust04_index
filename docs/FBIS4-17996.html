			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila Glazovskaya </F> and Mikhail Kalmykov]    [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat], 28 Apr -- All influential  forces concerned about the Bosnian crisis -- the United States,  Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations -- should  work together to propose a general plan for a peaceful  settlement to the conflicting sides, Alain Lamassoure, the  French minister delegate for European affairs, said here today.  Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the  prospects for a Bosnian settlement, he expressed satisfaction  with the fact that a kind of contact group has already been set  up at the level of experts. "France is in favor of convening a  meeting of representatives of the European Union, Russia, and  the United States with the participation of the United Nations."  Such a course should enable progress to be made in the search  for ways to a peaceful settlement in Bosnia, he believes.    Some aspects of the Bosnian crisis were touched upon at  talks  between official delegations and expert groups from France and  Turkmenistan within the framework of Francois Mitterrand's  working visit to Ashkhabad, which ended today. The French side  set out its approach to the Bosnia problem and expressed regret  in connection with the fact that Foreign Minister Alain Juppe  had not come to Turkmenistan. He was unable to leave Europe  because French diplomacy is currently undertaking active efforts  in the Bosnian sphere.</p>

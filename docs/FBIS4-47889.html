			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance] movement in Mozambique, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, has  attacked the United Nations' operation mission in Mozambique for  complaining about Renamo's slow demobilization.    Speaking at Maputo Airport yesterday on his return from a  two  week trip to Europe and Kenya, he said the UN's complaints that  Renamo is demobilizing its troops too slowly are meaningless.  The head of the UN operation has threatened to take issue  before the UN Security Council.    Mr. Dhlakama also said the was skeptical about a recent UN  announcement that various foreign countries have already pledged  13 million dollars to assist Renamo in its preparations for  October's multiparty elections. He said the UN always talks of  millions of dollars for Renamo, but they never see the money.    He welcomed the ANC's victory in South Africa's elections  despite a history of poor relations between the two  organizations. He has been invited to the ceremony to  inaugurate Mr. Nelson Mandela as president.</p>

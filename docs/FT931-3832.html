			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Hit by a horse A RUNAWAY horse ran into our car on a road at midnight. There is no dispute that the animal was to blame and the car was a write-off, although neither my wife or myself suffered serious injuries. My insurance company has paid me for the car but the other side, although admitting the horse was responsible, is refusing to meet such additional direct costs as hospital and hotel accommodation. Your remedy here would lie in sueing the owner of the horse for the loss which you have incurred and which the insurers are not prepared to meet. This might present difficulties if the horse was not being ridden and had escaped from private land; but section 8 of the Animals Act 1971 makes it possible to establish negligence in keeping the horse in such circumstances that it was able to get into the road in the way in which it did. You would be wise to consult a solicitor. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Canals board 'can still do better' The British Waterways Board, which runs Britain's canals, has become much more commercially minded but could still do better, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission said yesterday. In its second report on the board in seven years, the commission commended it for taking a more dynamic and businesslike approach to its work; it was better at planning, introducing standards, and computerising its operations. But the commission made 48 recommendations for improvement, including cost control and more active marketing of leisure facilities. Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, said: 'BWB has changed from a centralised organisation orientated towards administering a grant to one developing a strong commercial outlook, and the MMC commends the BWB and its staff for the work they are doing. 'Nevertheless, the MMC finds that BWB could continue to improve its efficiency and the quality of its services, and expects BWB to be able to generate higher net revenue.' The board said it would take account of the commission's recommendations to provide continued improvements to the waterways.</p>

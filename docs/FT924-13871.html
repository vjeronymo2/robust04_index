			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Control Securities wins bondholders' consent CONTROL SECURITIES, the property, hotels, brewing and leisure group in refinancing talks with its bankers, yesterday won the consent of holders of one of its Swiss franc bonds to delay interest payments until January 18. Holders of the group's two bond issues, which total SFr 200m, also agreed to waive rights to declare the bonds to be immediately due and payable until January 18. Further meetings of bondholders will be held on or before that date. The group's banks, which recently agreed to a third standstill arrangement running until October 31, are providing facilities so that it can continue trading. The group's shares were suspended in October last year, when the Serious Fraud Office sent in investigators. The company was built up by Mr Nazmu Virani, who is facing fraud charges relating to the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr Virani resigned as chairman and chief executive in April.</p>

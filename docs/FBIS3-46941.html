On the fifth of January, formations of nuclear-capable F-16  fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical  takeoff and landing] assault planes based in Japan and flying  corps of the U.S. Airforce present in South Korea and the puppet  airforce staged bombing exercises aimed at striking the  strategic depths of the northern half of Korea in the skies  above Yongwol, Wonju and Tokjok Islet under the command of an  E-3 early warning plane.    More 360 war planes of various types were flown in the  manoeuvres.    That day, KC-135 tankers refuelled scores of fighter-bombers  in the aerial war exercises in the sky above the sea off Kunsan.    On January 4 and 5, RV-1, RC-12, RF-4C, EH-60, and other  types of spy planes committed an all-round aerial espionage on  the coastal and frontline areas of the northern half of Korea in  the skies above Tokjok Islet, Pochon, Inje and Kojin.    Meanwhile, the South Korean puppets, instigated by the U.S.  imperialists, staged war exercises against the North near the  Demilitarized Zone of the Military Demarcation Line [MDL].    On January 4 and 5, ground units of the South Korean puppet  army fired large-calibre machine guns and automatic rifles in  night attack exercises aimed at a breakthrough on the MDL in  Inje, Paju, Chorwon and Yonchon Counties and large-calibre  artillery units fired 50 odd shells into areas near the  Demilitarized Zone and formations of helicopter gunboats and  helicopter transports staged exercises of support to ground  attack units and air-lifting of war supplies.    The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets must act  with discretion, clearly mindful of the possible consequences of  their war manoeuvrings against the northern half of Korea.</p>

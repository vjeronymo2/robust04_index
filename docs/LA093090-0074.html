			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: TESTIMONY AND DEMEANOR BY JOHN CASEY (AVON: $8.95)  </P> <P> The characters in these stories by the National Book Award winner seem to skate  over the surface of reality without ever touching it. In "A More Complete  Cross-Section," the narrator is so completely out of touch with his life that  the external world becomes something he can't quite believe in, like a bad  film.  </P> <P> The novella "Connaissance des Arts" is a sort of double Pygmalion story: As a  stuffy college professor helps a vibrant young woman learn how to enjoy life,  he discovers ways of sharing his emotions. Ironically, the title story is the  least interesting of the collection: John Casey sets out to create a boring  little man and his constipated milieu, and succeeds only too well -- Mr. Pelham  bores the reader as well as the narrator.  </P></p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Hands on, hands off - Richard Gourlay debates the merits for companies of a specialist approach to venture capital For UK managers blessed with a head office that decides to sell them the subsidiary they work for, choosing a venture capital company is one of the most important decisions to take. Pricing is obviously a consideration, in terms of the cost of finance and the amount of equity the management must give up to raise the necessary capital. Differentiating further between venture capital companies can be difficult. Many talk of the way they develop 'personal chemistry' with entrepreneurs. And they all stress how important it is to develop common investment goals - such as agreeing on how long investors might expect to wait before seeking an exit route. In an effort to stand out from the crowd, some UK venture capital suppliers, notably Apax Partners, have long tried to present themselves as specialists in particular industry sectors. Rather than being financial experts who know about structuring deals and who subsequently get to know the industry in which they invest, these 'specialists' reverse the approach. Apax, Advent, Trinity and Baronsmead all hire individuals whose industry expertise is used to tempt investee companies as much, if not more, than their ability to structure deals. But do the companies choosing these specialists get what they expect? And do budding management teams appreciate that the non-executive directors who are invariably appointed represent the interests of the venture capitalist? Four years ago Linda Wilkinson, was looking for a venture capital company to finance the buy-out of Midland Network Services, a telecommunications network company now called Imminus where she is chairman and managing director, from the Midland Bank Group. There was much international interest initially in the company, based in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, which had carved out a niche providing travel agents with direct data links to tour operators. But the potential buyers dropped away when they realised the incumbent management was putting together its own bid. Any outside buyer would have been dependent on the thwarted management to move the company's clients from its Midland's network to a new network. With profits of more than Pounds 1m on sales of Pounds 8m, there was no shortage of potential backers. Imminus chose Apax. 'They have a specific interest and knowledge in this sector,' says Wilkinson. 'If we were going to bring others in we wanted investors who were going to make a valid contribution and not just give us the money.' Apax offered industry expertise through John McMonigall, a former managing director of operations at British Telecommunications's communication systems division. He joined the Imminus board as non-executive director. Wilkinson says the association with Apax and McMonigall gave Imminus stature in its market. But she says the company is yet to receive the full degree of industry-specific input promised at the outset. Wilkinson and her management team are ready to consider strategic moves for the company, but are not clear how Apax's general industry knowledge can be translated into specific help. She recognises, however, that it is still early days. 'As yet we have not had the opportunity to test if we will actually get that.' Wilkinson says Imminus may require additional specialist help from independent consultants. This, she says, would inevitably lead to a more distant relationship with Apax. 'We all specifically agreed we needed to focus and had a busy agenda to complete,' she says. 'The acid test will really be over the next two to three months whether or not they (Apax) make an input that is of value.' McMonigall agrees that now Imminus has transferred clients to its own network, Apax must offer specific strategic input. 'In a sense, apart from monthly board meetings, I have done little else,' he says. 'In April we will do away-days off-site and work at answering the strategic questions.' This is typical of his relationship with the other Apax investments, he says. The time devoted to each investment varies greatly between companies and depends on what stage they are at. Some venture-backed companies, however, believe the benefits of specialisation are exaggerated. Many argue that specialist knowledge is quickly out of date once the 'specialist' has left his or her industry. Others say the last thing managers want after escaping the clutches of a large group is further interference from a shareholder who is second-guessing the management team. Many would agree, though, that the specialist knowledge is of great benefit in the early stages, helping the venture capitalist avoid deals which involve undue risk from the management, the product or its market. Stuart Evans, managing director of Cotag International, a maker of electronic security systems, chose not to seek specialist backers. The Cambridge-based company has been backed by ECI Ventures with three tranches of capital since 1984. 'For most companies it is not generally the case that you want specific industry experience,' he says. 'The experience you want, which is scarce, is people and personnel skills. For little companies the risk typically comes from restructuring. It is helpful if a (non-executive) is someone you can go to with senior personnel issues.' Evans says that the venture capital supplier which is prepared to provide second tranches of capital is more important than one offering industry expertise. Other venture capital suppliers agree. Paul Brooks, managing director of Prudential Venture Managers, says: 'In my experience people want a venture capitalist who understands the industry but who has not necessarily worked in the industry - they want a balance between knowledge and interference. Companies have to have a clear view about the construction of their board - if you want expertise then buy it in the market place.' This view is shared by Jonathan Baker, director of ECI Ventures. 'We would not pretend to add value by second-guessing management on industry trends but by changing management methods and controls and giving strategic input,' he says. Specialist industry expertise may help the venture capitalist avoid poor investments and make a more informed evaluation of new deals but the company seeking finance should remember that a venture capitalist's main focus is to find and win good deals and avoid bad ones, a quest which will not always allow it the time to nurture existing investments.</p>

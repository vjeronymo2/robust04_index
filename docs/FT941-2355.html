			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Gates and McCaw launch world telecoms odyssey Mr Bill Gates and Mr Craig McCaw, two of America's richest technology entrepreneurs, set out yesterday on an ambitious space odyssey: the creation of a Dollars 9bn global satellite communications system by the year 2001. The two billionaires, each using 'a few million dollars' as seed capital, aim to launch a fleet of 840 small satellites into orbit about 400 miles above the earth. The system would offer wireless data, video and voice communications services worldwide. The plan, however, faces technical and commercial doubts as well as daunting financial and political hurdles. Mr Gates, aged 38, is co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, the world's biggest software company. Mr McCaw, 44, built McCaw Cellular Communications into the largest US cellular telephone company. It is now being sold to AT&amp;T for Dollars 12.6bn. Mr Gates, Mr McCaw and McCaw Cellular each will own 30 per cent of Teledesic, the new venture. Mr McCaw is chairman, but Mr Gates does not hold an executive position. Microsoft itself is not involved. Teledesic revealed its plans yesterday by applying to the Federal Communications Commission for permission to begin construction of the satellite system. Using very high frequency transmissions, the refrigerator-sized satellites would send and receive digital signals from telephone directory-sized receivers and small antennas installed in homes and businesses. Each satellite would, in effect, be a telephone switching system. The small satellites could be launched in clusters, reducing the cost. However, low-orbit satellites tend to fall out of their orbits far quicker than the 22,300-mile-high geostationary satellites now used for telephone communications. They must therefore be replaced more frequently, adding to the cost of maintaining the system. Teledesic has yet to begin raising the Dollars 9bn needed to build the satellite system. It aims to draw together a broad alliance of manufacturers, telecommunications companies and governments to back the massive effort. Regulatory approvals would be required from the governments of the countries to which the system offered services. Alliances would also have to be formed with telephone companies all over the world. If it gets off the ground, Teledesic faces competition from less expensive satellite projects such as Motorola's Iridium, which will provide mobile communications to car drivers. Teledesic also envisages rivalry from stationary wireless communications services. Motorola has spent three years raising Dollars 800m to launch Iridium, which is expected to cost a total of Dollars 3.4bn. The new venture would also have to compete with Iridium for funding. According to Mr Russell Daggatt, Teledesic's president: 'The real promise of the system is to bring access for rural and remote areas of the world to the health and education services that you get in major urban centres.' AT&amp;T said yesterday: 'At this point, Teledesic is a gleam-in-the-eye venture, but we'll be delighted to benefit financially from it.'</p>

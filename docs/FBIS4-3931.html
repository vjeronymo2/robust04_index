			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 25 (XINHUA)--One hundred and  twenty-nine multi-national companies have invested in Shanghai,  China's largest manufacturing center, an official from the  Municipal Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation  said today.    The official said that in the first quarter of 1994,  Shanghai  approved the establishment of 15 businesses involving investment  by multi-national companies, including the McDonald's Company of  the United States and the Sony Corporation of Japan.    By the end of March, Shanghai had approved the undertaking  of  472 major projects, involving 10.24 billion U.S. dollars in  total overseas investment, he said.    Multi-national companies began to invest in Shanghai in  1980,  he said.    The Swiss elevator manufacturer, Schindler Holding Company,  took the lead, and was followed by the Foxboro Company, of the  United States, the Volkswagen Company, of Germany, and the Bell  Telephone Equipment Company, of Belgium.    He said that 60 percent of the 129 multi-national companies  began investing in Shanghai in 1993.    He praised these companies for helping speed up the  construction of the Pudong new area and build Shanghai into a  major economic, financial and trade center in Asia.    The Du Pont Company, of the United States, began to  cooperate  with Shanghai in the 1970s, in the form of merchandise trade, he  said.    In the 1980s, the company began transferring technology to  its business partners in Shanghai. In the 1990s it began  combining direct investment with technology transfer, the  official said.    To date, the company has set up a joint venture involving at  least 10 million U.S. dollars in investment in the Pudong new  area, where flexible policies are being pursued to encourage  Chinese and overseas investors.    It is now negotiating with research institutes in Shanghai  on  co- production of substitutes for freon (used in refrigerators  and aerosols), he said.    In 1992 the Sharp Corporation of Japan launched a joint  venture -- capable of building 200,000 air conditioners a year  -- in the Pudong new area, he said.    The company has decided to increase its investment in  Shanghai and transfer production of other electrical appliances  to the city, he said.    The Bell Telephone Equipment Company, of Belgium, plans to  site all its new investment projects in China in the Jinqiao  Export processing zone in Pudong.    The American Telegram and Telephone Company has set up three  joint ventures in Shanghai, the official said.    These ventures have achieved high economic returns by  combining American managerial expertise with specific conditions  in Shanghai, he said.    In 1993, the American company's business volume, including  economic returns from their joint ventures, in China amounted to  200 million U.S. dollars, half of which came from its  Shanghai-based ventures, he said.</p>

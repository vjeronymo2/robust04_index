			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENN S. DUMKE DIES; GUIDED STATE UNIVERSITY  </P> <P> Glenn S. Dumke, who as chancellor of the California State University system  melded 16 separate schools into a unified system during its greatest two  decades of tumult and growth, has died at his home in Los Angeles. He was 72.  </P> <P> Dumke, chancellor from 1961 to 1982, died of a heart attack Thursday night, a  spokesman for the university system announced Friday.  </P> <P> "This is a very sad loss for everyone in higher education," said the current  chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds, who succeeded Dumke when he retired in 1982.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Remarkable Accomplishment'  </P> <P> "Glenn Dumke did something that many people thought was impossible: He  organized 16 separate universities into a single system that has become a model  across the nation. It was a remarkable accomplishment and it happened because  Dr. Dumke was a visionary leader.  </P> <P> "He was respected by everyone who knew him," Reynolds added, "and he will be  greatly missed."  </P> <P> As president of San Francisco State in the late 1950s, Dumke helped draft and  remained a chief spokesman for "The Master Plan for Higher Education in  California."  </P> <P> The plan became the blueprint for the state's two-track University of  California and State University (originally State Colleges) system and a model  for other systems of higher education throughout the nation and the world.  </P> <P> In 1961, as vice chancellor of academic affairs and then as chancellor, Dumke  forged the once separate campuses into a viable system with unified academic  goals and standards and lobbying clout with the state Legislature.  </P> <P> During his tenure, the system grew from 16 to 19 campuses and enrollment  tripled, reaching 319,000 by his retirement.  </P> <P> (Although the New York college system is larger, it includes both junior and  senior schools; California is the largest senior system in the country in both  campuses and student population.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Survivor  </P> <P> A conservative, Dumke became known as a political survivor because of his  ability to get along with both the conservative and liberal boards of trustees  appointed by Democratic Govs. Edmund G. Brown Sr. and Jr. and Republican Gov.  Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> He muted the protests of continuing budget cutbacks under Gov. Reagan, and by  doing so, many believe, enabled the State University to fare better than the  University of California, whose officials were more outspoken in their  objections.  </P> <P> Dumke vociferously opposed militant student and faculty protests against the  Vietnam War and tuition and fee increases when those protests flared at San  Francisco State and other campuses in the late 1960s and early 1970s. But,  again demonstrating his political skill, few students were expelled and few  faculty members fired during his tenure.  </P> <P> When he announced his plans to retire on his 65th birthday, a year in advance  to give trustees time for a nationwide search for his successor, Dumke jokingly  told news reporters that the position required "someone who can walk on water."  </P> <P> Born in Green Bay, Wis., in 1917, Dumke moved to California in 1923. He earned  his bachelor's and master's degrees at Occidental College and his doctorate at  UCLA. During his education career, he garnered nine honorary doctoral degrees  from universities throughout the country.  </P> <P> Dumke taught history at Occidental beginning in 1940 and eventually became dean  of the Occidental faculty before leaving for the San Francisco State presidency  in 1957.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Remained a Historian  </P> <P> He remained a historian until his death, writing textbooks during his teaching  career and historical novels as a hobby during his years in administration and  retirement.  </P> <P> "I have always felt in teaching history that the best kind of supplemental  reading was the biographical novel of the kind Irving Stone writes," Dumke told  a Times writer in 1986 after the publication of his fifth novel.  </P> <P> "You can arouse people's interest in history without warping it or wrenching it  out of shape," he said. "I think people turn against history because it's often  so poorly written and poorly taught. I don't think history is a social science.  It's a humanity. It's an art."  </P> <P> An expert on western U.S. history, Dumke wrote three Westerns. He wrote three  other novels centered on Haroun-el-Rashid (the one-time Caliph of Baghdad),  England's King Richard III and Benedict Arnold.  </P> <P> He wrote under the names Jordan Allen and Glenn Pierce.  </P> <P> After his retirement in 1982, Dumke served as president of a San Diego-based  think tank called the Foundation for the Twenty-First Century. Among his  national awards were the USO Distinguished American Award and the George  Washington Honor Medal of the Freedom Foundation for his contributions to  education and to history.  </P> <P> Dumke is survived by his wife, Dorothy.  </P> <P> Services will be at the Church of the Recessional, Forest Lawn in Glendale, at  2:30 p.m. Wednesday. The family has asked that memorial contributions be made  to the Historical Society of Southern California.  </P></p>

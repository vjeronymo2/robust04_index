			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] In Abha this afternoon, their  highnesses the foreign ministers of the GCC [Gulf Cooperation  Council] member countries began the meetings of the 51st session  of the GCC Ministerial Council. His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud  al-Faysal, the foreign minister and chairman of the session,  delivered an address at the opening meeting in which he said:    [Begin al-Faysal recording] [passage omitted] Brothers,  while  we are holding this periodic session of ours, our brothers in  fraternal and neighboring Yemen are facing difficult and painful  conditions resulting from the outbreak of disputes between the  brothers. This led to this country and its people, which is  dear to all of us, entering a whirlwind of violence and  internecine bloody fighting, causing a large number of Yemeni  victims every day in both the north and south. At the same  time, the installations and potential of this country are being  subjected to destruction.    From the start, the GCC member countries sought to urge our  brothers in Yemen to work for what is likely to spare fraternal  Yemen the horrors of war and internecine fighting, and in so  doing member countries supported the various mediation efforts,  and took the initiative, through several contacts with the  leaderships of the two parties to the conflict, to warn them  against the dire consequences of the escalating disputes between  them, and to incite them to seek understanding and concord  between them. However, despite all the efforts and mediation,  matters have taken a grave turn and reached the point of armed  confrontation between the brothers in a bitter conflict that  makes hearts feel pain. [passage omitted]    What must be always present in our minds while we discuss  this matter is that the internecine fighting can in no way  entrench or protect unity. Quite the contrary, because the  persistence of bloody confrontation can only create rancor and  lead to deepening estrangement and differences. It will also  undermine the bases on which the foundations of harmony and  understanding could be built. If, in its Resolution No. 924 of 1  June 1994, the UN Security Council has stressed the eagerness of  the international community to secure stability and an end to  the fighting in Yemen, this eagerness is stronger in the GCC.  Therefore, our council must issue an affirmation that the  continuation of the fighting is not acceptable to us, whatever  the cause and source. Likewise, continuation of the fighting  will have repercussions on the GCC member countries, which will  lead to the need for member countries to take measures  concerning this escalating situation. [passage omitted] [end  recording]    [Announcer] With regard to relations with Iran, his highness  said: We have not been able, until now, to find in Islamic  Republic of Iran's policies anything that can put trust and  reassurance in our minds, which would be by Iran's commitment to  international conventions based on mutual respect and  noninterference in other states' internal affairs.    His highness the foreign minister expressed the Council's  member states pleasure at the beginning by the Palestinian  brothers of a new era of effective practice of their national  rights on a part of their territory, following the agreement  signed in Cairo in Dhi al Qi'dah 1414 AH, corresponding to May  1994, for taking over authority in Gaza and Jericho from Israel.    On the situation in the Republic of Bosnia Herzegovina, his  highness said: Although only a short time has passed since we  expressed our optimism regarding the agreement reached by  Muslims and Croats with regard to setting up a union between  them, we see now the Serb's continuation in their oppression and  aggression against Bosnian Muslims, and their defiance of the  successive resolutions of international legality for bringint to  an end the Serbian aggression and protection of the safe Bosnian  areas.    After this, the opening session was adjourned.</p>

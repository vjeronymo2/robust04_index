			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, on October 11, 1994, the NRC staff received an unsolicited letter from Rosemount, dated September 28, 1994. In this letter, Rosemount stated that it agreed with the NRC ``views'' expressed at the June 23, 1994, enforcement conference on the importance of 10 CFR Part 21. However, Rosemount stated that it could not concur in the view that Rosemount acted in careless disregard of NRC requirements by failing to adequately identify and report potential defects in its Model 1153 pressure transmitters prior to December 1988. Rosemount attached a 40 page enclosure to its letter that takes exception to a number of statements and conclusions delineated in the NRC inspection report. These exceptions included Rosemount's position that early (1984) transmitter failure mechanisms were never established as resulting from oil loss, and the oil loss problem could have resulted from other factors unrelated to transmitter design. Rosemount additionally disagreed with the position in the inspection report that early non-nuclear grade Model 1151 transmitter failures should have made Rosemount aware of a potentially generic problem affecting its nuclear grade transmitters. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Further, Rosemount disagreed with the portion of the inspection report that identifies the time that Rosemount began to track field returns of failed transmitters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> During this particular period of time, the sensor cell for both Model 1151, non-nuclear grade transmitters, and Models 1152 and 1153, nuclear grade transmitters, were manufactured in the same production line, utilizing the same manufacturing and production line process controls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The staff reviewed the information in the Rosemount letter and determined that the letter did not provide new information or arguments that would cause any change in the staff's position. The inspection report and the OI investigation identified numerous instances where problems with transmitters implicating the transmitter design, manufacturing or test processes were brought to Rosemount's attention but were not properly addressed by Rosemount for their generic or common-mode failure implications. The staff concluded that Rosemount failed to address these generic or common-mode failure implications, initially because it improperly dispositioned the failures as random rather than using available information to identify deviations that clearly, in the staff's view, represented a common mode failure potential. Despite having, as the OI investigation identified multiple examples of transmitter failures and several members of the Rosemount staff convinced that the failures were a result of manufacturing problems common to all the transmitter sensor cells, Rosemount failed to inform NRC licensees of the deviation. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The staff concluded that Rosemount's knowledge of this deviation, coupled with its failure to inform licensees, constituted careless disregard for the requirements of 10 CFR Part 21. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As defined in 10 CFR 21.3, deviation means a departure from the technical requirements included in a procurement document. The identified oil-loss problem was considered a deviation because sensor cell oil-loss caused Rosemount transmitters to depart from technical performance specifications that were delineated in Rosemount product data sheets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Since the mid-1980s, the NRC staff had been aware of several potential problems with Rosemount Models 1152, 1153, and 1154 transmitters (1150-series transmitters). In 1987, the NRC conducted an inspection at Rosemount because of a potential generic problem concerning degraded transmitter operation associated with contaminants in sensor cell oil, a condition referred to as ``latch-up'' identified in the early 1980s. During the same period that Rosemount was trying to resolve the latch-up problem, another sensor cell related problem was identified that also caused degraded transmitter operation. The second problem involved transmitter sensor cell oil-loss, which was not readily detectable because the sensor cell was sealed inside the transmitter. Rosemount pressure transmitter sensor cell oil-loss problems in nuclear applications occurred in a number of instances and at varying frequencies from 1984 on, indicating a potential generic problem with the transmitters. Rosemount nevertheless treated each licensee or Rosemount-identified oil-loss problem as an isolated occurrence, and handled the problems essentially on an individual basis as they arose. Although Rosemount indicated to the NRC staff and licensees that the failures resulting from oil loss appeared to be random and unrelated to any generic problem with Rosemount 1150-series transmitters, the staff nevertheless issued NRC Information Notice 89&hyph;42, `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Failure of Rosemount Models 1153 and 1154 Transmitters,'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 21, 1989, to alert licensees to this potentially generic problem. On May 10, 1989, Rosemount issued the first of four technical bulletins in which it discussed loss of oil in its pressure transmitters. The NRC staff continued to monitor the oil-loss problem and discuss the potentially generic problem with Rosemount and the industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff remained concerned that the transmitter oil-loss problem did not appear to be isolated, as Rosemount had been informing licensees. Therefore, on March 9, 1990, it issued Bulletin 90&hyph;01,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> ``Loss of Fill-Oil in Transmitters Manufactured by Rosemount,'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  to ensure that all licensees were adequately informed about the problem and would take appropriate corrective action. After obtaining additional information, the staff issued  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Supplement 1 to Bulletin 90&hyph;01 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 22, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In February and March 1993, NRC staff performed an inspection at Rosemount. On March 4, 1994, the staff issued Inspection Report 99900271/93&hyph;01, in which it identified an apparent violation of 10 CFR Part 21 regarding the transmitted oil-loss problem and asked Rosemount to participate in an enforcement conference on the matter. In the report, the staff also identified several other violations of 10 CFR Part 21 and several nonconformances regarding Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 50. On June 23, 1994, an enforcement conference was held at NRC headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

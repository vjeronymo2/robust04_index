In a press release issued on Friday, the Estonian ministry  welcomed Churkin's "condemnation" of the 1940 events but  denounced his refusal to qualify them as the annexation or  occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union or as a  Soviet aggression against them.    "International law did not begin in 1945, as Mr. Churkin  asserts," the ministry says.    It says Estonia has for a long time "shown patience and  goodwill and has made many concessions in order to solve  problems which it inherited from the 50 years of Soviet  occupation."    The ministry says the fact that Russian officials have  completely ignored Estonia's efforts and have instead made a  series of propaganda attacks and poorly concealed threats does  not serve to strengthen trust or ensure stability.</p>

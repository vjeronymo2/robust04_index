			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 27 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Member countries  of the Association of Coffee-Producing Countries (APC) have  decided to end today, Wednesday, the plan to retain coffee  beans, because the bean has experienced an important recovery on  the international market, official Salvadoran sources have  reported.    Ruben Pineda, president of the Salvadoran Coffee Council,  has  told ACAN-EFE the coffee-exporting countries, headed by Brazil  and Colombia, have decided to end the retention, because the  pound of the bean has exceeded the minimum price of 80 cents on  the world market.    "We received the notification at our offices this morning  from the retention plan coordinating office, located in New  York, stating there would be 0-percent retention as of today,"  Pineda has said.    The retention plan of the approximately 30-member APC  countries started on 1 October 1993, negatively affecting 20  percent of the coffee production in each country, but due to the  success of the measure, producers decided to reduce retention to  10 percent only four weeks ago.    Pineda has said the lifting of the retention plan "is good  for our country, because we have reached a good level of prices  on the world market," and he added El Salvador has only  approximately 500,000 quintals (22,727 tons) currently retained.</p>

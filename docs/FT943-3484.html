			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / London Underground signs Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, Marble Arch. London Underground believes there is money to be made from the name signs which adorn its stations, Charles Batchelor writes. Mr Mike Horne (above), London Underground commercial development manager, displays some of the 10,000 redundant station signs that will be auctioned on November 30 in what the company believes will be the biggest sale of its kind. Some of the signs date from the 1920s but others have fallen victim to more recent station refurbishments. Some are battered veterans of life underground while others have never been used and are in pristine condition. So confident are London Underground and auctioneers Brooks of interest in the collection of enamel, glass and aluminium signs that they have hired Olympia, one of London's biggest exhibition halls, for the sale. Mr Robert Brooks, chief executive, said: 'We have already been inundated with calls from as far away as the US, Japan and Australia by people who had got wind of the sale. We expect interest from rail enthusiasts, tourists, and the owners of restaurants and theme parks. This is a chance to buy a part of London's history.' The sale will include some of the best-known station names on the Tube as well as more prosaic indicators of the way to the Exit, the Ladies or the Gentlemen. The more popular and more unusual signs are expected to fetch several hundred pounds each but even the less glamorous destinations such as Turnham Green and Stamford Brook may attract interest from local residents. Football enthusiasts may want to acquire signs to Arsenal or Wimbledon. Mr Brooks said: 'People may want to own the sign of the station where they first met their future husband or wife.'

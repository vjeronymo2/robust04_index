			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ESPERANZA WINS WITH TEAM EFFORT;  </P> <P> GIRLS' SOCCER: AFTER A SEASON OF TURMOIL IN 1989, LYNN MURRAY, THE AZTECS' ONLY  RETURNING STARTER, LEADS SCHOOL TO 9-0-1 RECORD AND NO. 5 RANKING THIS YEAR.  </P> <P> Last season, the Esperanza High School girls' soccer team had a group of  talented players who didn't like each other much.  </P> <P> Egos and tempers flared. Grudges were nurtured. Disputes unrelated to soccer  were carried onto the field, and players involved in the disputes withheld  passes to each other from time to time.  </P> <P> It got so bad that after the season the players held three elections to  determine which players' honors would be awarded.  </P> <P> It was a fitting conclusion to a season that ended before anyone's  expectations. Ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section Division 4-A for most of the  season, Esperanza lost to Royal, 2-1, in the quarterfinals of the divisional  playoffs.  </P> <P> With the lessons of last year in mind, Lynn Murray, Esperanza's only returning  starter, has taken control of a young team and stepped forward to become one of  the most prolific scorers in Orange County and Division 4-A.  </P> <P> "It just fell apart last year," Murray said. "Eventually, we got it back  together but, by that time, it was just too late and that's a shame. We should  have done it two years in a row with that team because we had a lot of talent."  </P> <P> Esperanza might not have as many talented players as it did last year, Coach  John Coppage said, but it's a better team.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, the majority of the team last year was playing for itself," he  said. "Lynn was one of the few who was playing for the team.  </P> <P> "We have nowhere near the individual talent we had last year, but they are a  better team and she makes them that. She's the catalyst to take a lot of young  players and make them think they are better than they are.  </P> <P> "Don't get me wrong, we have five or six really good players but last year we  had 13 great players."  </P> <P> Murray, a two-time first-team all-division forward, has 18 goals in 10 games  for Esperanza (9-0-1). The Aztecs, ranked No. 5 in the Division 4-A preseason  coaches' poll, will play No. 1 El Toro for the championship of the Cerritos  tournament at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Gahr High School.  </P> <P> Although she led Esperanza in scoring with 23 goals her sophomore year and was  second last season (18), this is the first year Murray isn't sharing the  spotlight.  </P> <P> In each of her first two seasons on the varsity, Esperanza made it to the  championship game of the divisional playoffs. The Aztecs have a 79-5-7 record  since Murray has been on the team.  </P> <P> Murray, who scored six goals in a reserve role as a freshman, immediately  contributed because of her speed. She also runs for the Esperanza track and  field team and last spring anchored the 1,600-meter relay team to the fastest  time in Orange County and fifth-fastest in the state. Currently, she is  pondering whether she would like to run track in college. She has no doubts  about playing soccer in college and Coppage said he is certain she will be a  great Division I player.  </P> <P> "A lot of times you'll find players with great speed and that's all they have,"  Coppage said. "She's not as quick as she was as a ninth-grader, but she's  without a doubt the best forward in the county and possibly the Southern  Section."  </P> <P> Coppage said Murray, who also leads the team with 13 assists, has been patient  with teammates who are still learning.  </P> <P> "She doesn't stand around with her hands on her hips wondering why they can't  play up to her expectations," Coppage said.  </P> <P> However, as the team's captain, Murray said she has had to let loose on the  field when someone isn't playing her best.  </P> <P> "I tend to get really tense when I'm on the field," Murray said. "I'm always  yelling, telling people to do things."  </P> <P> But she makes certain no feelings are hurt, explaining after the game that her  exhortations are meant to help teammates play better.  </P> <P> "It never gets to the point where people stop what they're doing and yell at  each other," she said. "And often that did happen last year."  </P></p>

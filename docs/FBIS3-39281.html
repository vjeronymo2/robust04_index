			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mario Segni, leader of the "Pactists," </F> by Vito Biello; place and date not given: "Neither With Reagan,  Nor With the Man in the Street"]    [Text] The "Pactists": Segni speaks. His ideal is not the  Iron Lady, Mrs. Thatcher. Neither is it the former U.S.  president, Ronald Reagan. On the contrary, he is convinced that  efficiency and solidarity are not antithetical. Mario Segni is  not giving up, because he sees plenty of room for a political  force in opposition to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left].    [Biello] Well Deputy Segni, the progressive front has found  its identity. Where are the "Pactists" looking?    [Segni] The current objective is to create a  liberal-democratic and reformist group, an alternative to the  PDS's leftist group. Therefore, I launched the Pact for National  Rebirth, asking citizens for a million signatures. I explained  the key points of my program clearly: those who agree with them  can join the pact. I will never agree to place national unity in  discussion, just as I have already said that the MSI [Italian  Social Movement] or National Alliance is not an alternative to  the PDS.    [Biello] Let us go to the economic program. What will you do  about the budget?    [Segni] Spending must be reduced, but this does not mean  destroying the social state. For many years it was said that  efficiency and solidarity are irreconcilable; well, I want to  build a state that is able to guarantee both requirements. For  example, the South still needs assistance, but productive  assistance, not welfare.    [Biello] Quite a challenge. Unless you are thinking about  raising taxes.    [Segni] The tax burden absolutely cannot be increased, and I  have proposed setting a 40 percent ceiling on rates. The  obstacles that make the tax system a hindrance to development  must be removed. And decentralization is needed that will give  local administrations the means to govern.    [Biello] And the labor emergency?    [Segni] We must provide greater flexibility to the labor  market, especially to facilitate entry into it, aside from  eventual temporary departures. And we must invest in human  capital.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Proudfoot facing up to Pounds 5m bill for job losses Proudfoot, the management consultancy chaired by Lord Stevens, is expected to take a charge this year of between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m to pay for a wide-ranging redundancy programme announced yesterday. This will be in addition to provisions of Pounds 1.6m announced in September to pay for a rationalisation programme expected to result in savings of Pounds 15m. The announcement also follows a series of senior departures and rumours of an attempt at a boardroom coup to remove Lord Stevens. Some 200 jobs are to be cut by the first quarter of next year, bringing the group's staff to about 850. This is expected to bring further savings of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m. Mr David Gill, who was appointed finance director in May following the departure of Mr Neil Hamilton, denied that the rationalisation was in response to outside pressure. 'We believe this is the structure necessary to reflect the business volumes we are currently experiencing,' he said. Mr Gill also rejected suggestions that the company was seeking to sell its European operations. 'We are in the process of rejuvenating the company worldwide, with particular emphasis on the European region,' he said. Mr Gill said Proudfoot was 'not taking seriously' reports of a possible bid from former employees. The shares have fallen from 398p last year to close 2p higher at 65p yesterday.</p>

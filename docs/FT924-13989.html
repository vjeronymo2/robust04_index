			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE DERIVATIVES market had one of its quietest days in recent sessions with very poor turnover and little in the way of features to prise dealers away from the sidelines, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the first trade in the December contract on the FT-SE was struck at a poor 2,568. Sporadic buying, mainly from independent traders known as 'locals', on the back of speculation of a cut in interest rates sent December gently forward so that by 10.45 the contract had reached 2,595 in very light trading. However, that talk faded over the lunch time period leaving the contract to decline and then languish with a bout of sideways trading. December picked up in the afternoon, gaining momentum on the back of a strong Wall Street and strength in other European markets which sent the contract to the day's high of 2,610 just before the market close. Following some profit-taking, December closed at 2,604, around 14 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 32. Turnover was very thin reaching a meagre 5,604 contracts. Traded options business was even more dull with volume reaching only 17,500 contracts with the FT-SE 100 option accounting for a mere 5,896 of the day's total. Asda was the most actively dealt stock option at 4,712 contracts and was followed by British Steel at 1,000 lots.</p>

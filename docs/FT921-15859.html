			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Machine tool maker axes plant BRIDGEPORT Machines, one of the UK's largest makers of machine tools, is to close its manufacturing plant at Bridlington, Humberside, and transfer production to its Leicester site. The Bridlington factory will be phased out over the next six months, and only a few of the 162 employees will be offered jobs at Leicester. The closure is one of the biggest of the machine-tool industry recession, in which orders have fallen as much as 40 per cent in the past year. The purpose-built Bridlington plant opened in 1964 and according to Mr Malcolm Taylor, Bridgeport managing director, was restructured three times last year. Sales continued to worsen, however, in spite of the transfer from the US to Bridlington of production for the Far East.</p>

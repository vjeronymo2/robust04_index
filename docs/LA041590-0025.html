			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE FESTIVAL'S FEES TO CHOREOGRAPHERS  </P> <P> Had Sadownick gotten all the facts correct, perhaps there would be no  "controversy" surrounding "Generator Eight," the upcoming dance festival at Los  Angeles Theatre Center.  </P> <P> Most important is the article's blatant lack of balance. Sadownick reported  that dance producer Deborah Oliver raised the issue of the amount of government  money the theater center had received. What he did not explain adequately  (which I did both when he interviewed me and in a letter I sent to him) is that  the $19 million the Community Redevelopment Agency has invested in the theater  center has gone to the construction and maintenance of the facilities. Not one  penny has been spent on artistic programming. Had he fully questioned  representatives of the Cultural Affairs Commission, the CRA and the City  Council when he spoke with them, he would have heard this from them also.  </P> <P>  LATC is doing all it can at this time to support dance in Los Angeles. We are  in the midst of eliminating a substantial deficit acquired in the transition  from the Los Angeles Actors' Theatre to LATC in 1984-85 and have no funds to  spend on producing dance ourselves.  </P> <P> However, because a strong dance community is important to the growth of all the  arts in Los Angeles, we are providing what we can: space, equipment, personnel,  advisory support and mailing lists -- worth a total of more than $25,000.  </P> <P> The portion of the box office that LATC will receive, even if the festival  sells out all performances, will at best enable us to only break even.  </P> <P> LATC is sorry some dancers cannot afford to participate. But Sadownick's unfair  emphasis on the complaints of a few rather than on a balanced, carefully  researched story does unjustifiable damage to dance in Los Angeles, to the Los  Angeles Theatre Center and to The Times.  </P> <P> BILL BUSHNELL  </P> <P> Artistic Director, LATC  </P> <P>  On April 1, Calendar published an article by Douglas Sadownick on a June 7-17  dance festival at the Los Angeles Theatre Center that requires participating  choreographers to cover costs by paying up-front fees. The article, "Proposed  Dance Series at LATC Stirs Controversy Over Fees," said seven companies and  three soloists had signed up at that point but others in the dance community  had refused to participate because of the fees, ranging from $500 to $3,300.  Here are responses from Bill Bushnell, LATC artistic director, and others.  </P> <P> </P></p>

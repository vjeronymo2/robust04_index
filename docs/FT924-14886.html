			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Old fears erupt along Japanese fault lines: Last year's volcano victims are still suffering SEVENTY-year-old Mrs Shizue Kanegae's home escaped destruction when Mount Unzen erupted last year. The bad news is that her house will have to come down when a dam is built to halt the mudslides from the volcano on Kyushu island, off southern Japan. 'Life will not be the same again,' sighs Mrs Kanegae, a farmer, and one of the 6,054 people who are now living in one-room prefabricated huts provided by the local government. Unzen's explosion evoked one of the deepest fears of Japanese, who live in fear of earthquakes and volcanoes since the country lies on a fault line in the earth's crust. The death of 43 people and the destruction of rice fields, homes, and schools by the lava and hot ash perpetuated feelings of vulnerability. Some 15,000 were killed the last time Mount Unzen erupted in 1792. The volcano is still active, spewing out lava at least once a day. Lava domes are still growing, although specialists believe that large scale eruptions are unlikely for the time being. 'It will take more than 10 years for everything to return to normal again,' says Mr Kanichi Kanegae, mayor of Shimabara City, which lies at the foot of Mount Unzen. 'However, we're dealing with nature and there are limits to what we can do.' The eruption, which caused estimated damage of Y124bn (Dollars 1.03bn), has brought the local economies of Shimabara and its neighbouring town of Fukae to a halt. The designation of the populated areas as danger warning zones, prohibiting public entry, has hurt the area's tobacco farming, sewing factories, and tourism. In the danger zones, houses are deserted and overgrown grass and weeds cover the unkept gardens. Tattered decorations from the New Year flutter from an empty farmhouse rooftop. Bulldozers and trucks raise dust storms, as they clear away the debris left by the most recent mudslides. To the frustration of the evacuees and others affected by the volcanic eruption, the government does not provide direct financial aid to individuals. So far, calls from the residents for a special law to aid restructuring have been rejected. However, donations totalling Y16.1bn have supported the evacuees, as the disaster has evoked sympathy in the Japanese people. While office workers who commute to the neighbouring cities were quick to return to their jobs, unemployment for farmers who have lost their fields has presented problems. Trying to find new jobs for those in the agricultural industry is proving to be the most difficult task for the local authorities. 'It's hard to convince farmers, who have a strong affinity to their land, to move and change the way of living at the same time,' explains an official of the Nagasaki prefectural government. Local authorities are intent on easing restrictions limiting entry into the danger zones and the construction of a dam preventing the spreading of future mudslides. Some 300 homes are planned to be removed to make way for the construction of 120 protective dams and embankments. Mrs Kanegae says her son, who has been working on a construction site in Osaka since the eruption, will no longer have a house to come back to. 'I can't sleep at night when I think of the mountain and our future,' she says.</p>

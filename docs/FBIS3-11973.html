			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by dismissed JS Deputy Coordinator Violeta </F> Delgado; for related reporting on this issue see FBIS-LAT-94-038  pp 19, 20]    [Text] In the national committee during the 1993 evaluation  session for JS [Sandinist Youth] activities, we decided, based  on the need to define new strategies and political actions that  would enable us to achieve greater success in 1994, to increase  our involvement in the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation  Front] Extraordinary Congress and our work in middle education.    On 3 and 4 February three working committees were formed to  prepare reports on these issues for the National Council, taking  into consideration the grass-roots discussions held in each  department. Thus a consensus agenda was approved, and the  National Council session was scheduled for 19 February.    However, suddenly a devious maneuver took place, an ambush  prepared by some small departmental groups, led by the Managua  delegation, which persuaded the National Council not to discuss  the points on the agenda, but only one point: the internal  strengthening of the JS.    The National Council was persuaded to discuss issues that  Managua had been working on for the last eight months. A  document different from the agenda document was presented,  prepared by the Managua general secretary, using biased  arguments that had nothing to do with what the national  committee had approved for presentation to the council.    In the discussion it was said that the JS coordinator and  deputy coordinator should be removed; the discussion on how we  should now be preparing for our work with Nicaraguan youth was  simply ignored.  <H5>  Ambushing Unity </H5>   There was a vote. The Chinandega departmental  committee--which had only five of its 19 comrades present, and  because of financial problems had been forced to make a  selection of its delegates--also fell into the ambush that had  been prepared, and withdrew in protest, as did the delegations  from Granada and Leon.    This has created a definite division in Sandinist Youth, a  division brought about by the National Council, even though we  have been strong advocates of remaining open-minded and not  taking positions on the different currents of opinion in the  FSLN.    We have been promoting a JS leadership that works to  strengthen the party, without trying to back or strengthen  individual personalities in the front, but rather the party as a  whole.    In the vote, 45 voted for the partial removal of the  national  committee--this included the coordinator and deputy  coordinator--and 34 were opposed to this action. It was  suggested that the secretary for international relations be left  in place so as not to disrupt work in this area.    The consequences for JS are now sadly negative: there has  been an obvious polarization. For example, Bluefields and Esteli  were not present and Nueva Segovia and Rivas were opposed to the  results of that vote. The Matagalpa delegation's vote was  divided, and only Managua voted unanimously.    According to the bylaws, the only thing the National Council  can do, once 70 percent of its members are in agreement, is to  convene an Extraordinary National Assembly to choose new  national officers.    This is going to have a negative impact on our international  relations, as we serve as the vice president for youth in the IS  [Socialist International] and in COPPAL [Permanent Conference of  Latin American Political Parties]. Damage has already been done  both to JS and to the FSLN itself.  <H5>  Seeking a Mature and Honest Solution </H5>   The saddest thing is that in order to bring Sandinist Youth  into line with a particular position in relation to currents of  opinion in the FSLN, they had to get rid of those of us who  thought and who continue to think that JS should be broad and  openminded, and that instead of taking positions, it should help  create consensus within the party.    This action has been instigated by a group that proposed  that  Sandinist Youth be defined and guided on the basis of a position  in the FSLN. It would not have happened if the general  coordination of JS had already taken one position or another  among the FSLN currents of opinion.    JS should not ignore the debate, but it should try to focus  the debate within the confines determined by the FSLN's organic  roots, without trying to create a position of dominance for a  specific current of opinion. Unfortunately, this has already  created a clear division among youth.    The only solution that I see now is for each departmental  committee of Sandinist Youth to discuss this situation with its  grass-roots members, and with the national leaders who were  disregarded, because in no department was there any discussion  with the grass-roots members about a decision that emanated from  the Sixth National Assembly of Sandinist Youth held in November  1992.    The grass-roots members are the only ones who can decide on  new Sandinist Youth officers. I appeal to all JS members to  demand their right to decide in such an important situation. It  is up to the members of JS to seek a political solution that is  viable, acceptable, mature, and honest.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Gore firm on healthcare bill this year Vice-President Al Gore and the Democratic leaders of both houses of the US Congress yesterday reasserted their determination to pass a healthcare reform bill this year that would eventually provide medical insurance coverage for all Americans. Mr George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, said he would introduce a bill within the next week and that he intended to keep the Senate in session 'until we complete action on it', even if that meant delaying the summer recess due to start in three weeks. The vice-president, Mr Mitchell and Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, all conceded, as Mr Gore put it in a television interview, that 'the phase-in period may have to be extended' from the administration's target date of 1998. Mr Gore said that to wait eight to 10 years for universal coverage to take effect was 'way too long'. But he insisted that the administration had always accepted that in tackling 'the biggest social policy challenge this country has faced in 60 years' there would be 'give and take and a lot of changes' as Congress moved towards a final resolution. 'The one thing that can't change is universal coverage,' he said, 'and that has to pass this year.' Mr Gephardt added: 'The important thing is to plant the flag and make the decision' on the principle of coverage for all. Mr Gephardt and Mr Mitchell refused to speculate on the details of their respective bills, beyond noting that they would inevitably reflect compromises between the various bills already approved by four congressional committees. But Mr Gephardt agreed with Mr Gore it was 'reasonable' to expect delays in introducing so-called employer mandates, under which companies would pay for a substantial part of the insurance premiums of their workforces. He suggested a four- to five-year lag before full implementation, while Mr Mitchell said emphasis on introduction by a given year would be 'misplaced'.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: UK producer price figures for August showed signs that manufacturers were starting to pass on raw material price rises to their customers. September figures are expected to show a further increase in the annual rate of output price growth to 2.4 per cent. Wednesday: As well as the September inflation figures, the UK will release details of September unemployment (expected to have dropped by 20,000) and August average earnings numbers. The latter have been stuck at 3.75 per cent for some time; any increase will frighten the gilts market. Thursday: US producer price figures for September will give further clues to inflationary pressures in America. Nomura Research Institute expects a 0.2 per cent monthly rise in the headline figure Friday: A big day for US economic statistics, with the consumer price index, retail sales and capacity utilisation for September all being published. Following last Friday's mixed employment report, analysts now expect this batch of data to determine whether the Federal Reserve decides to tighten policy further.</p>

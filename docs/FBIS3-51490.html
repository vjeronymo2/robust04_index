Specifically, the Air Force will suspend its  fire, except in cases of aggression against Army personnel who  require its support in unpopulated areas.    They will continue to protect towns that requested their  help  to prevent possible attacks. They will not permit any movement  by these armed people to areas outside the region. They will  maintain the free mobilization of their personnel and equipment,  including ground patrol and air reconnaissance. They will  redouble their contribution to the government effort to  distribute food, medicines, and other items which are basic to  the affected population.</p>

Zuganov mentioned the issue of non-payment to enterprises,  unpreparedness for the cold weather, the reorganization of the  power structures of the defense and former security ministries,  and attempts to hinder the State Duma's activities among the  factors deteriorating the situation.    According to Zuganov, the recently signed Russian-Georgian  Treaty, which was not coordinated with the North Caucasian  republics, was one of the most significant destabilizing  factors. This treaty might stir up mass disturbances in North  Caucasus, Zuganov pointed out.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Major puts proposal for 'green' satellite A PROPOSAL that the G7 group of industrialised countries should combine to put an Earth satellite into orbit to keep a watch on the state of the global environment has been put forward by Mr John Major, the prime minister, John Hunt writes. He spoke of the plan when he met members of environmental organisations and representatives of business at 10 Downing Street yesterday to discuss the Earth Summit, which he will attend in Rio de Janeiro in June. The satellite would monitor the effectiveness of an international convention on global warming which is expected to be agreed at the Rio de Janeiro meeting, being organised by the United Nations. Mr Major gave full backing to the process and the proposed 'Earth charter' which will be drawn up there. He emphasised that it had to include practical actions that could be implemented by governments and international organisations. Members of 'green' organisations at the two-hour meeting criticised the government for not doing more to protect the environment. They were impressed by the prime minister's handling of the meeting, however, and the seriousness of his approach to the issues.</p>

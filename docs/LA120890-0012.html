			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS : COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS;  </P> <P> DISPUTE SENDS PLAY OFF CAMPUS  </P> <P> The first student-produced play at College of the Canyons is being staged off  campus because students did not want to pay newly imposed fees for use of  college facilities.  </P> <P> The play, "Feiffer's People," concludes a three-day run tonight at Saugus High  School.  </P> <P> Student government representatives moved it there to avoid fees the college  began charging student organizations for use of campus buildings.  </P> <P> The student government is paying $300 to use the high school, about $50 more  than the college would have charged. The issue is one of principle, students  said.  </P> <P> "We didn't want to accept the price or set a precedent to pay to use our own  facilities," student senator A.J. Jothikumar said. "We ignored the issue and  said we'd just take the play elsewhere."  </P> <P> College administrators decided to impose rental fees after budget estimates  last summer showed a $20,000 deficit for use of campus facilities, said John  Drislane, dean of community and personnel services for the school. Student  events cost the college money because campus employees provide labor to set up  stages, arrange seating and clean up afterward.  </P> <P> Students and administrators recently worked out an arrangement they hope will  avoid such disagreements in the future. Under it, student organizations can use  campus facilities a specified number of times for free. Student government, for  example, can hold two major events in the student cafeteria every three months.  JACI D. ANTRAM  </P></p>

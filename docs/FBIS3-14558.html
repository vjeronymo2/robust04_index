			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shlomo Dror] </F>   [Text] Settlers from the Hebron area, soldiers in a  reserve battalion, have written a letter to Yitzhaq Rabin, prime  minister and defense minister, in which they declared that  following the suspension of their battalion commander, Reserves  Major Yisra'el Blumental, they consider themselves discharged  from reserve duty. Soldiers serving with the battalion reported  that they intended to refuse to do reserve duty and turn in  their IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Reserve identity cards.    Blumental, a settler from Qiryat Arba', has been the  commander of a regional defense battalion in Hebron for several  years. Major General Dani Yatom, the commander of the Central  Command, suspended him after he described Dr. Barukh Goldstein  as "a soldier fallen in battle" in a television interview.    News of the suspension was revealed two days ago, during  Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq's testimony before the state  commission of inquiry on the Hebron massacre. Professor Menahem  Ya'ari, a member of the commission, told Baraq that the murderer  served in a reserve unit in Qiryat Arba'. During the massacre,  Ya'ari noted, he used a weapon which was issued to him by that  unit. The commander of that same unit publicy described the  massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs as a "battle." Ya'ari  asked how it could happen that such a man had been in charge of  issuing a weapon to someone who subsequently carried out such a  terrible deed.    Baraq declared that to the best of his knowledge, the man  had  been relieved of his post. "At any rate, this man cannot be  permitted to command IDF soldiers, not even reserve troops,  especially not in an area like Qiryat Arba', the chief of staff  said.    In reaction to this, Nahum Hoss, one of the soldiers in the  battalion and an aide to Rabbi Levinger, said: "This is a  political ouster. They are bringing politics into the Army.  Blumental should be judged according to his professional  ability as an officer and not according to some statement,  which, in my opinion, was taken out of context. As far as I am  concerned, Blumental is an excellent officer who I would follow  to any battle. If he is not reinstated as commander of our  battalion neither myself nor any of my comrades have anything to  look for in an army that serves the government rather than the  people."    An injunction issued after the Hebron massacre bars Hoss  from  carrying weapons. The police have so far not been able to hand  him the injunction. Yesterday, Hoss asserted that he would not  turn in his weapon. "I must continue defending the lives of my  family and myself. I think the Army is mistaken if it thinks  that it is serving the country by ignoring our request and doing  without our battalion's reserve duty. Many people will follow  in our footsteps," he said.    An officer in the battalion, who refused to reveal his name,  said: "What would have happened if the Army had ousted an  officer who was a member of Peace Now? Did the Army get rid of  officers with left-wing views after Mordekhay Vanunu or Udi Adiv  [who spied for Syria in the late 1960's]? Yatom should remember  that the IDF is the peoples' army and not the army of Meretz.    The officer added that attempts were being made to convince  the southern Hebron hills regional defense battalion to join  their struggle.    An IDF spokesman said that Maj. Gen. Yatom had indeed  decided  to suspend Blumental pending an investigation into the matter.  Blumental will be summoned for a hearing by Colonel Me'ir  Kalifi, the commander of the Hebron Brigade and Major General  Sha'ul Mufaz, the commander of IDF forces in the West Bank.  They will then decide which steps to take against him.</p>

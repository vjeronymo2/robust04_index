			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Palestinian leaders may quit talks A CRISIS simmering among Palestinian leaders boiled over yesterday as three senior leaders flew to Tunis to tender their resignations from the Middle East peace talks delegation. The move, which would threaten the flagging Arab-Israeli peace process, revealed old divisions between Palestinian leaders inside the Israeli-occupied territories and the Tunis-based Palestine Liberation Organisation led by Mr Yassir Arafat. It also exposed deep frustration about the lack of progress in the peace process after the visit to the region last week by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and the increasing desire of Palestinians in the occupied territories for greater democracy inside PLO decision-making bodies. In Israel, the move re-ignited debate on whether the government should open direct official contacts with the PLO - one of Israel's greatest taboos but recently under review. Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, chief Palestinian negotiator, said the three top leaders - Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Mr Faisal Husseini and Mr Saeb Erekat - were going to hand their resignations to Mr Arafat because of differences with the PLO leaders on how best to conduct talks with Israel. But the PLO would probably turn the resignations down, he added. During a transit stop in Amman, Mrs Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman, refused to confirm the resignation threat but said there were 'serious internal Palestinian issues' that had to be discussed 'frankly' in Tunis. Reflecting reports that the three leaders are upset about lack of consultation by Mr Arafat over recent positions presented to the US, Mrs Ashrawi said: 'There is a two-way street of consultations and discussions.' Mr Ziad Abu Ziad, a consultant to the Palestinian delegation, said the latest rift occurred over a PLO-drafted response to Mr Christopher's suggestions for an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. The Palestinian delegation in Jerusalem rejected the document and were upset that the PLO-draft had been put to Mr Christopher in Egypt before they were consulted. Even so, much deeper problems lie behind the latest issue. Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories have said recently that their ability to negotiate with Israel has been completely restricted by Mr Arafat, who remains the dominant decider. They accuse Mr Arafat of pursuing a strategy of remaining in the peace process without allowing substantial progress because such progress could lead to the development of alternative Palestinian leadership in the occupied territories during interim self-rule and thus could marginalise the PLO-Tunis. Mr Arafat, they say, wants to show Israel and the US that there can be no settlement without the direct involvement of the PLO-Tunis. This strategy leaves the Palestinian negotiators vulnerable to criticism by Palestinians who are increasingly angry about the lack of progress and Israel's continued abuse of human rights. All the Palestinians are united in calling for direct PLO involvement in the talks - this being opposed, so far, by Israel and Washington. Some Israeli politicians feel that the PLO-Tunis is more moderate and coherent than Palestinians in the occupied-territories, and that the PLO should be brought into the talks. Last week, it was revealed that Mr Yossi Sarid, the left-wing environment minister, became the first Israeli cabinet minister publicly acknowledged to have met PLO officials. Yesterday, Mr Sarid said: 'Palestinian negotiators are in an impossible position. When they stop, they are urged by Tunis to go ahead; when they go ahead, sticks are shoved between their wheels. Hence. . . we must talk to the PLO in Tunis.'</p>

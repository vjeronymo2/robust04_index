			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BIZNES-TASS report: "The Lower the Inflation, the Worse </F> the Recession"]    [Text] The first quarter of 1994 saw the greatest  reduction in industrial production since the reforms began.  Whereas in February there had been some slowing down in the  pace of the recession, in March the decline in production  accelerated again. This information comes from the Russian  Federation Ministry of the Economy.    In the first quarter of 1994 the depth of the recession in  industrial production was over 20 percent compared with the  corresponding period last year. Whereas at the beginning of  last year the dynamics of the recession were beginning to ease  off, this year the movement is heading upward (January -- 23.1  percent, February -- 24.1 percent, March -- 27.4 percent).    In the opinion of Economy Ministry experts, the greatest  reduction has occurred in the processing sectors. At 26.8  percent the fall in the production of consumer goods was greater  than the fall in industry as a whole.    As the chief of a ministry department said in conversation  with your BIZNES-TASS correspondent, the greatest cause for  concern today is the fact that the reforms have not touched the  technological structure of production. The majority of  enterprises cannot reduce production costs and thus cannot cope  with the reduced demand, especially at a time of substantially  increased competition in the domestic market from foreign  producers.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Chairman of Time Warner takes leave MR Steve Ross, chairman and co-chief executive of media group Time Warner, announced yesterday he was taking a temporary leave of absence from the group to resume treatment for prostate cancer, from which he has been suffering for a considerable time. Mr Ross said in a letter to Mr Gerald Levin, his co-chief executive that he had been advised he had not fully recuperated and must now resume treatment. Time Warner declined to comment further on Mr Ross's cancer, or on how long the leave of absence might last. Mr Ross, who began his business career as a director of funeral homes, built the Warner group into a leading film and entertainment business before combining it with Time, the book and magazine publisher, in a highly controversial 1989 merger. Earlier this year Mr Nick Nicholas, previously Mr Ross's co-chief executive, quit the group after a series of disputes over strategy, leaving Mr Levin as the chairman's evident heir apparent. Mr Ross said in yesterday's letter that he was 'completely comfortable' with Mr Levin taking over during his absence. He expressed confidence in Mr Levin's leadership skills and said the two shared the same vision for Time Warner.</p>

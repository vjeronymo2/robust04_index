The Health-Social Affairs's stern action, however is feared  to trigger trade friction with the United States which sent a  senior official of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office to  file a protest.    Peter Collins, assistant deputy U.S. Trade Representative,  arrived here March 11 to lodge a formal protest with the  ministry over its reluctance to allow the American products to  go through customs in Pusan.    At the same time, the incident has all the appearance of  turning into the discovery of major irregularities committed by  government officials who are under investigation for possibly  taking bribes from the importers.    At least 20 former and incumbent officials of the Pusan  customs and quarantine office, and the National Institute of  Health are facing a special audit by the ministry.    According to ministry officials, 24 importers of American  sausage, mostly chicken and turkey franks, have been taking in  shipments of frozen products since 1990 even though they should  have been refrigerated instead.    Among the 24 companies are Kotco Co., Yongmi Trading Co.,  Sejung Industrial Co., Oksan International, Ambrose Deli House,  E.A.C. Korea, Jinyong Food Co., Yonbang International and  Myongjin I.C.I.    Under the Food Sanitation Law, frozen sausage has an  expiration date of 90 days from the day of production whereas  refrigerated products must be sold within 30 days, an official  of the ministry's sanitation Safety Section said.    Realizing that it would be impossible to market the products  here since the time required for shipment and customs clearance  runs up to almost 30 days, the importers apparently resorted to  freezing the products to buy more time.    "However, freezing the products for shipment then defrosting  them in the process of distributing and getting them to  consumers through department stores and supermarkets, can only  result in the breeding of microorganisms, thus making them  obviously hazardous to health," he explained.    The official admitted that the legal period for distribution  varies from state to state with some providing longer periods,  at least more than 30 days, it is a rule of thumb that the  importing country's standards must be observed.    "We understand that while there are some frozen sausages in  the United States, most of them are refrigerated since heat is  applied on the products during processing," he noted.    Under related regulations, the heat-treated sausages are  recommended to be refrigerated at between 0-10 degree centigrade  depending on the ingredient and the processing methods.    The import of heat-treated sausages began in 1990 and an  estimated 4,800 tons, estimated to be worth 19 billion won  (approximately 25 million U.S. dollars), were shipped here,  almost exclusively from the United States.</p>

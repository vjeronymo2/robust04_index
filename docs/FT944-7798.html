			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor (3): Well paid, well equipped and subject to market forces Sir, Since the market rate for a chief executive of multinational calibre is Pounds 475,000, I hope British Gas will go to the market and find such a person, instead of retaining its present chief executive who, according to market forces, is worth only Pounds 270,000. Roland Davis, Wayside House, High Street, Shoreham, Kent</p>

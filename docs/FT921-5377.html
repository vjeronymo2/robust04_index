			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Management consultancies' sharp growth in fees halted THE recent spectacular growth in management consultancy fees came to an abrupt end last year and employment fell for the first time in 12 years, according to the Management Consultancies Association, which has 33 members accounting for about 60 per cent of the UK market. Members' fee income grew by 4 per cent last year to Pounds 843m from Pounds 810m the previous year, after average annual growth of around 30 per cent for three years. Mr Brian O'Rorke, executive director of the association, said that last year was 'one of the hardest trading periods in living memory' and predicted a 'more aggressive and competitive' market this year. The number of consultants employed by the association's companies fell 4 per cent to 6,963, the first annual decline since 1980. The figures appear to show the effect of sharp price competition - the total number of UK clients increased by 10.5 per cent to 16,909. Fee income fell in all fields except project management, which grew from Pounds 14m to Pounds 28m, and information technology and systems, where fee income accounted for Pounds 339m - 46 per cent of the big companies' Pounds 732m in UK fees last year. Work for local authorities and the National Health Service increased sharply last year, reflecting the impact of the government's health reforms and the drive for efficiency.</p>

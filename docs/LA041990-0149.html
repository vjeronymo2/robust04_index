			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH CLARIFIES HIS CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY, PUTS MORE STRESS ON ACTION  </P> <P> President Bush concluded an international gathering of scientists, economists  and environmentalists Wednesday by asserting that his Administration has "never  considered research a substitute for action" in addressing the threat of global  warming.  </P> <P> "We cannot allow a question like climate change to be characterized as a debate  (of) economists versus environmentalists," Bush said in remarks interpreted by  conference participants as a softening of the position he took only a day  earlier.  </P> <P> "The truth is, strong economies allow nations to fulfill the obligations of  stewardship -- and environmental stewardship is crucial to sustaining strong  economies," the President said.  </P> <P> Bush's remarks came as he closed a two-day White House session during which  delegations from 17 countries heard the President and top Administration  officials stress the scientific uncertainties and profound economic  implications of the global warming debate.  </P> <P> European delegates had criticized the conference agenda's emphasis on  scientific and economic research rather than steps to reduce emissions of  so-called greenhouse pollutants that many scientists believe may lead to  catastrophic warming of the Earth's climate.  </P> <P> But as he closed the heavily publicized session, Bush said: "Those who suggest  that we're only trying to balance economic growth and environmental protection  . . . miss the point. We are calling for an entirely new way of thinking, to  achieve both, while compromising neither, by applying the power of the market  place in the service of the environment."  </P> <P> The European representatives, who had complained that all of the public  conference sessions were taken up with American speeches, were pleased with  Bush's conclusion of the conference.  </P> <P> "I hope this is the start of a change in the American attitude," said Pier  Vellinga, director of the climate change program in the Netherlands.  "Yesterday, he said we cannot act until we have more facts. Today it was much  different."  </P> <P> Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly said there was  "no question that the President heard the delegates."  </P></p>

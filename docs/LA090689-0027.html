			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIS LIFEBLOOD IS RESTORED AFTER RARE MALADY HITS  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, John Beutlich of Escondido was the human equivalent of a finely  tuned sports car badly in need of an oil change.  </P> <P> Because of an extremely rare blood disorder, the man who nearly qualified for  the American Olympic team in 1978 had suddenly developed blood plasma so  clotted that every one of his major organs was in danger of collapse.  </P> <P> As a result, his lungs very nearly deflated, his heart was inflamed, his  kidneys were in danger of failing and he became so disoriented because of lack  of blood to his brain that he couldn't even give his wife's name.  </P> <P> For 10 straight days, doctors at Palomar Medical Center performed a procedure  called a plasma pheresis, in which Beutlich's blood was drained from his body  and replenished with fresh frozen plasma.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10 Pints of Plasma a Day  </P> <P> That's 10 pints of new blood plasma a day -- or a total of 200 pints -- the  entire amount of frozen plasma the hospital kept in storage.  </P> <P> "He emptied all the frozen plasma we had on hand," said Dr. Jerry Kolins,  medical director of the community blood bank of North County. "There wasn't any  left."  </P> <P> Just one week ago, Beutlich came so close to death that his family was summoned  from Chicago. On Tuesday, however, in what doctors are calling a miraculous  recovery, Beutlich was out of the intensive care unit, talking about going home  in a few days.  </P> <P> The college runner has won the race of his life -- against a deadly disorder  that once killed everyone who contracted it.  </P> <P> Now, thanks to friends and co-workers of the U.S. Customs Service pilot, more  than 250 new pints of blood plasma have been donated to the hospital in a  nationwide effort to replenish the drained supply.  </P> <P> How does a healthy, 32-year-old father of two strong school-age boys, a track  star at Loyola University in Chicago who once nearly qualified to run against  the Soviets, come so suddenly, so inexplicably, close to death? The answer is  thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a disease that has baffled the  medical world since it was first diagnosed in Philadelphia 60 years ago.  </P> <P> "It's like the Andromeda strain," Kolins said. "We're not sure if it's a virus,  and we're not sure if it's a bacteria. But one thing is for sure -- as recently  as 10 years ago, if you got it, you were dead within a couple of weeks."  </P> <P> Doctors aren't even sure what causes TTP. The only known cure is the plasma  pheresis procedure, in which the blood plasma is continually exchanged until  the patient begins to show signs of recovery.  </P> <P> Beutlich's was the first case of TTP treated at Palomar Hospital, according to  Peter Hein, the Escondido man's personal physician.  </P> <P> "It's very, very rare," he said. "It's not even known what triggers it, which  makes a cure doubly hard to come by. Most hematologists go through their entire  careers and never see a case."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 40 Known Sufferers  </P> <P> For humans, the chances of contracting TTP are 1 in 250,000, he said.  </P> <P> "In a city of 3 million, for example, it might happen to 12 people over their  entire lifetimes. In a city the size of Los Angeles, you might not see one case  a year."  </P> <P> A recent 10-year study on TTP conducted by the University of Pennsylvania  contained only 40 known sufferers of the disorder, Kolins said.  </P> <P> "We don't know what happened with John," he said. "One theory is that he was  subjected to some kind of bacterial infection one week before the disease began  to take effect."  </P> <P> The bacteria can be killed by antibiotics, but not before toxins begin to do  their damage, doctors say.  </P> <P> "There's some evidence that the bacteria might produce a poison that causes the  platelets to clump together and block the circulation of blood," Kolins said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It's Really Scary'  </P> <P> The clots occur throughout the body, affecting the brain, kidneys, heart and  lungs, vital organs that cannot be deprived for long of adequate blood flow.  </P> <P> "It's really scary," Kolins said. "It's a mystery to think how a healthy,  32-year-old airplane pilot in the best of health could almost die just like  that without us being able to do a thing to stop it."  </P> <P> For Beutlich, the nightmare began with a shopping trip to Tijuana with his wife  and father-in-law. After a day of browsing along the Avenida Revolucion, the  group ate dinner at a restaurant there.  </P> <P> A week later, Beutlich developed cramps at work one day and his wife, Susan,  saw blood in his stool. He was admitted to the hospital.  </P> <P> Doctors treated him with antibiotics and he was released a few days later. But,  after she got her husband home, Susan Beutlich knew something was terribly  wrong.  </P> <P> "I asked him how he was feeling, and his response was, 'How much does a cup of  chicken broth cost?' " she recalled. "He thought he was still in the hospital.  He had no idea who I was."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 50-50 Chance at Best  </P> <P> At the time, Beutlich's blood platelet level had dropped to 18,000 per cubic  microliter of blood. Normal human levels are more than 150,000 platelets per  cubic microliter, doctors say.  </P> <P> Doctors said Beutlich's chances of living were at best 50-50, Susan recalled.  </P> <P> "They told me to go home," she said. "But I was afraid I'd never see him  again."  </P> <P> That's when doctors surmised that Beutlich may have been suffering from TTP and  prescribed the only known cure -- plasma pheresis -- in which his body was  continually injected with frozen plasma.  </P> <P> "Right after the procedure I felt chilled, like I was outside on a 20-degree  day without a jacket on," Beutlich said. "I was so chilled no amount of  blankets could warm me up."  </P> <P> Beutlich came closest to death last Sunday when his lungs began filling with  fluid. The harder he tried to breath, the worse it got.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Passed Out Myself'  </P> <P> "I could see by his chest that his heart was pounding," Susan recalled. "He was  trying to tell me something, but his eyes were rolling into the back of his  head. I was so excited, I passed out myself."  </P> <P> Although the Beutlichs have no idea what caused the disorder, they have all but  ruled out their Mexico excursion as a factor. "All three of us ate the same  meal in that restaurant," Susan said. "It had to be something else."  </P> <P> The only bright side of contracting TTP, doctors say, is that recurrences are  almost nonexistent.  </P> <P> And, thanks to the donations of concerned friends and colleagues nationwide,  the hospital's plasma bank has been fully restored for the next TTP crisis.  Palomar Hospital received plasma donations from customs and law enforcement  donors from the Los Angeles area, as well as Atlanta and Washington. Several  North Island military men donated help to Beutlich, a Navy reserve pilot, as  did several Coast Guard members in Chula Vista.  </P> <P> Beutlich himself received emotional support from his two sons, ages 5 and 8. On  the wall of his hospital room hangs a poster that reads, "Please Get Well,  Daddy -- Jonathan and Jeremy."  </P> <P> Although Beutlich was the recipient of a huge amount of donated blood, doctors  say he has little chance of contracting AIDS.  </P> <P> "It's not impossible, although every pint of blood was tested and found to be  negative," Kolins said. "If this would have happened in 1985, I would have been  mighty worried."  </P> <P> Four years ago, 1 in 3,000 people who donated blood tested positive for the HIV  virus, he said. "Then his chances would have been 1 in 15 or 20 of getting the  disease," Kolins said.  </P> <P> "Now it's one in several thousands. And, since the alternative was almost  certain death, this was well worth the risk."  </P> <P> Although he will soon go home and back to work, the athlete who was almost an  Olympic 400-meter hurdler still worries about his future in the shadow of a  killer blood disorder.  </P> <P> "It scares me," he said. "I think it was a blessing in disguise that I was  mentally out of it most of the time so I never knew how bad off I was. I just  wish I knew what triggered it, so I could avoid that thing.  </P> <P> "The way I look at it, I got two choices: I can either avoid everything or  carry on with my life."  </P> <P> He gave his wife's hand a squeeze.  </P> <P> "That choice is pretty easy."  </P></p>

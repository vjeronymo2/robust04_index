			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Praise for Major may be fleeting For a party used to seeing its leader isolated and under fire from his own back benches, yesterday's statement by the prime minister was unusual. Mr John Major's speech on the Corfu summit won warm applause from Tory MPs on both wings of the party. For once the prime minister gave his troops something to cheer about and Britain's veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as European Commission president appeared to unite the party. Never mind that pro-European backbenchers privately warned that the battle over the EC presidency may be only the first of many to come, or that Britain may find itself bereft of friends when it mosts need them. As far as the majority of Tory MPs were concerned 'a victory is a victory'. Nothing was going to spoil their relief and delight at having something to applaud. Mr Kenneth Baker, a Euro-sceptic and former party chairman, summed up by telling the prime minister: 'The decision you took was not only right, but courageous and popular - popular not just in the Conservative party, but in the country as a whole and in many electorates across Europe.' The prime minister's reception was probably better than it might have been because of a disappointing response from Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader of the Labour party. In a speech which failed to inspire her own supporters she accused Mr Major of being 'humiliated' by being in a minority of one. The accusation only led to greater cheers from the Tory back benches. Perhaps the most significant indication of Mr Major's success in the Commons came from an intervention by Mr Ian Taylor, a member of the Tory Positive European group. To the surprise of some of his pro-European colleagues in the group, he said Britain was justified in using the veto. Members of the group said privately they were 'appalled' by Mr Major's decision to veto Mr Dehaene. Mr Robert Hicks, a member of the group, said on Sunday that he regretted the decision. But not one of the Positive Europeans decided to speak out against the use of Britain's veto in yesterday's Commons debate. It was left to Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, to air their views when he said the big task facing the government was to concentrate on 'how to resolve this crisis - for crisis it is'. The prime minister said he shared Sir Edward's regret that it was necessary to use the veto. He argued that it was a point of principle. Mr Major took obvious delight from the fact that the only cheers for Sir Edward's intervention came from the opposition benches. Even some Tory MPs who said they had no strong views about Mr Dehaene believed the government was right to block his appointment. As they saw it France and Germany were trying to 'railroad' their candidate through the Community which Britain could not allow. The only question being asked by Tory MPs yesterday was not whether Mr Major's leadership had been strengthened, but how long the new mood would last. Many Euro-sceptics warned that his position could quickly weaken if he allowed another federalist to be appointed at the special European summit on July 15 called to resolve the issue. Mr Baker, who was so full of praise for the prime minister, said: 'He cannot resile now.' Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the rightwing 92 group, said: 'The prime minister is in a much stronger position now. But it would be terrible if he reneged on it.' Mr Michael Carttiss, a Euro-sceptic, believes the prime minister 'would be finished' if he backed down at next month's European summit by allowing a federalist to be appointed president. Mr Bill Cash, another leading Tory Euro-sceptic, said: 'The government can and should veto every federalist for president.' He described Mr Major's decision to block the appointment of Mr Dehaene as a 'first intermediate step' and urged the prime minister to follow through by vetoing federalist policies. 'There is no room for compromise'. The prime minister was careful to avoid any suggestion that he would veto another candidate on the basis of 'federalist views'. He will not need reminding, however, that adulation from Euro-sceptics can quickly turn into hostility.</p>

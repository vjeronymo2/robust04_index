Yes, if They Pay Us One Billion Dollars!"]    [Excerpts] [Oreb-Jerkovic] The Slovene press is full of  accusations against the Croatian Electric Power Industry [HEP]  for nonpayment of debts to the Krsko Nuclear Power Plant for  electric energy that has been delivered. Mr. Begovic, in your  opinion, are the demands of the Slovene side justified, and is  it true, as the Slovene Government claims, that Slovenes are  providing electricity to the Croatian consumers on credit?    [Begovic] The claims by the Slovene side proceed from a  wrong assumption. Namely, Croatia does not buy electricity from  the Krsko Nuclear Power Plant, we produce it there. This is not  just a difference in the terminology, but in the understanding  of the problems that have arisen concerning the nuclear power  plant. The HEP regularly pays for the costs of electricity  produced in this facility, which, for us, is very significant  and valuable. This is not at all a matter of providing credit  to the Croatian consumers. Such claims are inappropriate and  unacceptable. [passage ommitted]    [Oreb-Jerkovic] In recent days you participated in a series  of talks with Slovene officials in connection with these  controversial matters. Boris Sovic, Slovene state secretary for  energy, stated that some new ideas have been examined. What is  at issue?    [Begovic] I have no knowledge of any new ideas. In past  talks we presented nine points of interest for the Croatian  side, in which we asked that the currently valid agreement of  1970 and 1974 be respected. The basic problem is that Slovenia,  from the moment it gained its independence, stopped complying  with existing interrepublic agreements and annulled them by  passing new decrees.    [Oreb-Jerkovic] Are you referring to the new law on  employment of foreigners?    [Begovic] Yes, among other things, I am speaking about this  new legal decree. It violates article 9 of the aforementioned  agreement of 1970, which legally regulates the issue of parity  of employment of specialized personnel in the Krsko Nuclear  Power Plant. With subsequent dismissals of our workers, we have  been gradually losing control over the management of funds. The  parity of employment was violated by the unilateral behavior of  the Slovenes in dismissing 19 Croat workers. Presently 110  Croats and 500 Slovenes are employed in the plant. [passage  omitted]    [Oreb-Jerkovic] What will you do if the Slovene side does  not stop putting pressure on the HEP to pay the unpaid costs?    [Begovic] Recently, Slovene Ambassador to Croatia Matija  Malesic stated in your paper that the Slovenes worry about their  weekend homes in our part of the Adriatic sea. We also worry  about our property. We feel that all these games about  nonpayment of debts are an attempt to gradually take away our  property. We will not accept the Slovene blackmail as long as  clearly established investor rights are not respected by both  sides. [passage omitted]    We at the HEP would have nothing against the Slovenes paying  us $1 billion dollars, which is the value of our share in the  nuclear power plant. We would be able to resolve the issue of  the entire energy system in Croatia with these funds. [passage  omitted]</p>

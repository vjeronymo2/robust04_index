			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> KEVIN KLINE'S 'HAMLET' PLAGUED BY STUFFINESS  </P> <P> No one makes Shakespeare boring on purpose, not even the BBC, which has done it  a lot. Good American actors, less bound up by tradition, have often brought  fresher, brasher takes to their Shakespeare. The freshness only fails them when  they begin to take the material or themselves too seriously.  </P> <P> The point is rudely brought home in the Kevin Kline "Hamlet" that airs tonight  (9 on Channels 15 and 24; 9:30 on Channel 28) on "Great Performances." There is  irony in the program's name, because Kline's performance as the neurotic prince  wants to be great. It works at being great. It seems to believe in its  greatness. But it's not great. Only predictable.  </P> <P> Some of the reasons for the disappointment are easy to identify. First, the  setting and camera angles. Kline, who with Kirk Browning also directed this  "Hamlet," which he first staged last May at New York's Public Theatre, keeps  the action on a visually dull theater stage. His shots are overdesigned in  self-important ways.  </P> <P> Martin Pakledinaz's mix of costumes (roughly Edwardian to modern) is never more  than pedestrian. Osric's foppishness, at the capable but powerless hands of Leo  Burmester, is reduced to an actor waving a derby a bit more extravagantly than  he normally might.  </P> <P> More perniciously, Kline's Hamlet takes his cue from any one of the celebrated  British ones, most notably John Gielgud's, and delivers not a single surprise.  It is clear, well spoken, plodding and blank. The words feel pre-digested, the  poses struck for effect.  </P> <P> If Kline's performance seems more a cloning than a creation, Josef Sommer's  Polonius is merely recycled. We've heard the same droning tones before. This  studied imitation of art infects much of the company, including Michael  Cumpsty's smug Laertes and Brian Murray's earnest Claudius.  </P> <P> Miraculously, Diane Venora's Ophelia escapes this contagion of stuffiness. She  delivers a plain but glowing girl, whose descent into madness is as moving as  it is unvarnished. She almost makes it worth wading through the rest of the  play to get to her harrowing, uncompromising mad scenes.  </P> <P> But not quite. This blunted "Hamlet" goes through its motions with too few  genuine emotions. It is facade without foundation. Except for a vigorous  exchange between Hamlet and a tormented Dana Ivey as Gertrude in the closet  scene, there's not much chemistry, anguish or passion anywhere.  </P> <P> "My words fly up, my thoughts remain below," says the guilty Claudius at  prayer. "Words without thoughts never to heaven go." Or to anyplace else. A  warning this production should have heeded.  </P> <P> By coincidence, Bravo is presenting Laurence Olivier's Academy Award-winning  1948 "Hamlet" tonight at 8 and 12:30 a.m. For those who have access to the  cable channel, it should make an interesting contrast.  </P> <P> (The PBS "Hamlet" also airs Saturday at 9 p.m. on KOCE Channel 50.)  </P></p>

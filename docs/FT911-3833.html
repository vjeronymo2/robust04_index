			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: BP nightmare haunts sale of stake in BT AS MINISTERS finalise their proposals for the sale of part of the government's 48.6 per cent stake in British Telecom, the 1987 flotation of British Petroleum is weighing heavily on their minds. BP was the last major secondary sale, valued at Pounds 7.5bn, including a Pounds 1.5bn rights issue, and proved something of a nightmare. Although considered a one-off because of the collapse in the stock market government officials believe there is much to be learnt from the issue. The shares were originally offered at a 20p discount to the 350p market price. But when the world's markets crashed in late October potential investors were looking at a 70p loss. No-one is expecting a collapse in the market this year; however, even the smallest of movements between pricing the BT sale and trading in the new shares could have a significant effect on the issue. A fall in the market wipes out potential investors' discounts while a rise leaves the Treasury open to Labour accusations of a giveaway. Government advisers believe the key lesson from the BP sale is that the time between pricing and trading was too long. Government sales normally take three weeks, a week to print and send the prospectus after pricing is announced, a week for investors to receive and fill in the form and a final seven days for allocation and processing. If the prospectus could be sent out without the price officials believe they could shave off seven days. This was suggested in the sale of the regional electricity companies but rejected on the grounds that two weeks can create as much nervousness as three. For the BT sale to be made BP-proof and immune from market movements the gap between the pricing and trading needs to cut to less than two weeks. Shareholders need a guarantee that their discounts will not be wiped out by movements in the market. If this can be achieved Government advisers believe they may be able to do without sub-underwriters. (Primary underwriters were dispensed with in the last privatisation). There are two other main lessons to be learnt from the BP sale. The first is that ringfencing allocations to different markets is counter-productive. In 1987 BP wanted more shares to be sold abroad. Government officials now believe it was a mistake not to do so since it would have generated greater competition between the institutions. The Treasury is expected to introduce more flexibility into the BT sale, allowing more than half of the shares to be sold in foreign markets, creating fierce competition between institutions, thereby maximising the price. The second lesson is that while advertising can work wonders in druming up interest in a issue - more than 6m people registered for the BP shares - it does not mean that those registered will buy shares. A little more than 200,000 of the 6m parted with their money. As a result much of the funds earmarked for advertising may end up paying banks and building societies bigger commissions to trade BT shares, making it easier for the small investors to take part in the sale.</p>

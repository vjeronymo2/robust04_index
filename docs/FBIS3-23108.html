The group said that hardline Islamists in Egypt  will begin to attack the Americans and Israelis.    Carrying the report, REUTER said that the group made the  threat in a statement seemingly faxed from Beirut. The  statement gave the Americans in Egypt 48 hours to leave the  country. The statement said: We warn every American in Egypt  that he will be a target for the Islamist mujahidin in the  country.    The group claimed responsibility for a device exploding in  front of the Egyptian American Bank in Cairo last night.    The Islamic Group in Egypt earlier claimed responsibility  for  the same explosion as well as for recent attacks against banks  and policemen in Egypt.</p>

			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / UK hurdles remain for Maastricht approval THE finishing line is in sight for the British parliament's lengthy consideration of the Maastricht treaty on European union. But yesterday's completion of a marathon committee stage in the House of Commons does not guarantee Mr John Major's Conservative government a problem-free run to ratification. Four more hurdles have still to be cleared, starting with the Commons report stage which is likely to get underway early next month. Then will come the second Danish referendum on May 18, quickly followed - if the Danes vote Yes  -by what should be a comparatively untroubled 'third reading' debate. The government has promised that this will not happen until after the Danish result is known. After that, the bill moves to the House of Lords where Euro-sceptic peers spearheaded by Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, and Lord Tebbit will press the case for a Maastricht referendum, which the Commons early yesterday rejected by a majority of 239 votes. The Commons would have the power if necessary to vote out any unwelcome amendments but this would require an additional debate that the government wants to avoid. Finally, if the measure is still on course, there is an outside chance the government could trip up in an eleventh-hour debate on the treaty's social chapter, due to come after Maastricht has been made part of British law. The critical question at next month's report stage is whether the opposition Labour party manages to engineer a vote on its amendment which would delete the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from the social chapter. This could be important as it is the only mechanism yet devised which might force the government to choose between the social chapter and the treaty without requiring at least some Tory Euro-sceptics first to vote explicitly for the chapter. The bill's passage through the Lords is arguably the least predictable obstacle still in the government's path. This is because its rules of procedure leave anti-Maastricht peers with virtually limitless scope to delay it. For example, any proposal can theoretically be voted on at the request of just four peers. Hundreds of amendments are expected to be put forward, as they were in the Commons. In practice, the flexibility of the Lords rules is rarely exploited to its limit. But with emotions running high and a passionate anti-Maastricht campaign in prospect, the government may have to bide its time for a month or two. If all else fails, Tory Euro-sceptics could conceivably make a last-ditch effort to derail the treaty by voting explicitly for the social chapter - which they loathe - in a separate debate due to take place after the bill has received Royal Assent. If they did so, Mr Major could be forced to choose - as Labour hopes - between accepting the social chapter, from which he took such pains to negotiate a British opt-out, and tearing up the treaty. Mr Major last night underlined his determination to keep Britain 'at the heart of Europe'. He told a Conservative party dinner: 'Outside Europe Britain can survive; inside we will thrive'. Operating at the centre of the EC, the UK could press its case for a wider, free-trade, liberal community which would in turn render irrelevant the idea of a centralised European superstate, he said. 'The idea of a centralised Europe had resonance in a Community of six. But for 12, soon 16 and eventually 20 plus nations it is a grandiose doodle'. Mr Major said Britain had to take its 'rightful place' in the world. 'Though no longer a global power we still have global interests. We need to defend them with determination but also with subtlety. We cannot afford to subject ourselves to the despotism of nostalgia'.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Skoda chief urges Siemens rethink MR LUBOMIR Soudek, the new chief executive of Skoda Pilsen, Czechoslovakia's largest engineering group, has called for the renegotiation of its two joint ventures with Siemens, the German electrical and electronics group. His move follows the Czech government's decision to sell him and two leading Czech commercial banks a 38 per cent stake in Skoda Pilsen. Mr Soudek was appointed chief executive last Monday. KWU, Siemens' energy unit, last December acquired 67 per cent of Skoda's energy subsidiary. The German group is also planning a second joint venture with Skoda's transport arm, and is close to acquiring a 51 per cent stake. However, Mr Bernhard Weiss, head of the Siemens team which negotiated the transport joint-venture, ruled out a renegotiation. 'We discussed 99 per cent of the joint-venture contracts with the old management last year and are not willing to start the whole procedure again. We will make it clear to the Czech government that we are only willing to discuss on the basis of what has been agreed so far,' he said. The Czech government has been hard-pressed to find ways of privatising Skoda, which has an estimated SKr4bn (Dollars 140.35m) of debt and recently laid off 1,200 workers.</p>

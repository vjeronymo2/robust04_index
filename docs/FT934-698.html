			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Arts: The panto is in good shape - Antony Thorncroft finds tradition flourishing and the young audience loving it Throughout the land the familiar seasonal sounds can be heard - the crunch of popcorn under foot; the thump of lifting seats as wailing children are led to the lavatory; the screams and shrieks as chocolate bars are fought over in the stalls: it is panto time again. Playwright David Hare recently admitted that the British, as a nation, could not care less about the theatre. He should pop into one during the next few weeks and cheer himself up. Your local theatre is likely to be packed (hurrah); with children, the audience of the future (double hurrah); in family groups bonding in traditional values (triple hurrah); and enjoying a live entertainment which draws on the past but embraces the contemporary (mass delirium). How stands the panto? Exceptionally well. Business is up on last year, which is excellent news for those theatres which pay for their serious productions with the profits from this annual wallop of nostalgia. It also suggests that there is at least one British art form which continues to flourish. Pantomime traces itself back to the early 18th century but in its current form it has a noble enough history of a century or more. Any Victorian time traveller would have felt immediately at home at the Wimbledon Theatre the other night with the Fairy Courgette on one side of the stage rhyming her couplets and setting the scene while on the other Blackspider, melodramatic evil incarnate, threatened his worst. Plots, characters, jokes, very little has changed. It is also quite acceptable that most pantos feature at least one audience-pulling star of an Australian TV soap; they come over by the planeload for the chance of trying their hand at acting - and a percentage of the box office take. A century ago music hall stars like Dan Leno and Marie Lloyd were lured into panto, and a generation ago it was the turn of pop stars like Cliff Richard and Cilla Black to spend their Christmases on the boards. Of course some adjustment is necessary to incorporate Kristian Schmid (formerly of Neighbours) into the Orchard Theatre, Dartford, or Stefan Dennis (currently of Neighbours) at Wimbledon, or Ray Meagher (of Home and Away ) at Woking, or home grown soapers like Nick Cotton (Eastenders) at Croydon, and Seeta Indrani (The Bill) at Wycombe, and so on. The Australians especially are not always up to carrying off Aladdin or Cinderella so they tend to end up, like Schmid and Dennis, as Idle Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk. The more seasoned TV stars, like Graham Bickley of Bread, can cut the mustard as Aladdin (at Woking), but it means that we get a cheeky man playing the role rather than the saucy girl of Christmas Past. There are pantos which still offer the frisson of thunder thighed, strapping lasses courting each other like mad (I was much struck by Bromley's Cinderella, which fielded Elizabeth Watts as a diminutive Cinders being chatted up in turn by Sophie Corbett as Dandini and Lisa Hollander as Prince Charming), but there is a danger that panto is becoming sensible. Perhaps the biggest criticism after taking in half a dozen pantos on the fringe of London is that pantomime is susceptible to political correctness. There is a blandness about many of the cavortings. Evil is played down so that the agreeable sensation of fear, and the relief at the triumph of good, hardly featured. There is a concentration on spectacle and the familiarity of safe routines (the cast cannot wait to get into the 'Oh, no you can't'; 'look behind you' audience responses). There is also a profound disapproval of good old fashioned smut. Alice no longer sighs 'almost midnight and still no Dick', in Dick Whittington; Dames are allowed a little nostalgia about their long lost sex life, but now concentrate on their costumes and slapstick. The overwhelming impression was that pantos are aimed at children, specifically at girls between the ages of three and eight. Certainly watching the faces of these neat little spectators, often a giggle of Brownie packs or school parties, remains one of the joys of the adult pantogoer. They still rustle noisily during the love songs and the exposition of the plot; they are still totally captivated by the magical effects and the moments when the hero or heroine is in danger. They enjoy most the sweet throwing; the chance to go on stage; watching other little girls from the local dance academy do their bit; and any animal that takes to the stage. They are a spontaneous, extroverted, whole hearted audience. All the pantos seem to offer excellent value to their audiences. The scripts could be wittier and make more use of local jokes but there were few signs of skimping, apart perhaps at Stratford East where Red Riding Hood had a slightly makeshift air. Apart from mild regrets about the freezing out of some Principal Boys and the preference for the squeaky clean over the good old fashioned English innuendo, my only criticism is that less use is made of popular contemporary songs. This is a pantomime tradition but now listless, newly composed material is often favoured over the latest hits. But in the main pantomime has smartened up its act. There are few references to television commercials, indeed to the day's events. Mr Blobby pops up, as does Prince Charles, but the time when panto was just an excuse for pop stars or comedians to perform their usual routines while the panto proceeded unsteadily around them seems to be over. Tradition rules. Here are some memories of pantos 1993-94. The beguiling Ronnie Corbett as Buttons at Bromley, bringing the first act to a triumphant conclusion with his dying swan ballet routine. Tudor Davies as a vigorous non-camp Dame at Wimbledon and Danny La Rue managing to be both motherly and nostalgically rude as Widow Twankee at Woking, a panto which also contains a sweet voiced Alison Young as the Princess; Hugo Myatt as a convincingly straight villain at Dartford and Alan Cowan as a pleasingly theatrical Wolf at Stratford East. Perhaps panto is a little too pleased with itself these days. The barriers have been lowered between performers and audience and this can create self-indulgence among the cast. But it remains a vigorous dramatic tradition, confirming for millions that a visit to the theatre can be a magical experience. Roll on next Christmas.</p>

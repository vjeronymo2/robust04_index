			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats as year-end rally falters Wall Street Stocks retreated from the gains of the past four sessions yesterday as Wall Street's year-end rally stumbled, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 22.20 at 3,839.49. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 1.61 at 460.86, the American Stock Exchange composite gained 0.25 to 429.62 and the Nasdaq composite fell 3.73 to 742.46. Trading volume on the NYSE came to 244m shares. Analysts attributed yesterday's losses to profit-taking, but said movements were exaggerated by the day's low volumes. Many were optimistic that the late-blooming year-end rally, begun late last week, would continue through the end of the year. Upjohn shares closed down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 1/8 after the company announced it was stopping trials of a drug for head injuries after the pharmaceuticals company found a higher death rate among trial participants taking the medication. The announcement fuelled rumours that Upjohn might be the subject of a takeover bid. Toys R Us, down Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 30 1/8 , declined to discuss its Christmas sales or comment on a lowering of the 1994 earnings estimate by a US broker. The plan announced on Tuesday by Home Holdings to cease underwriting and transfer some business to Zurich Insurance Group of Switzerland, left the shares down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 9 7/8 . Mexican and other Latin American ADRs, which had been depressed in the wake of Mexico's currency crisis, bounced back as officials from that country discussed the possibility that the US and Canada would extend a credit facility to their southern neighbour. Telmex was up Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars 41 1/2 , Vitro rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 13 3/8 , Compania Telefonos de Chile rose Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 80 and Telefonica de Argentina gained Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 50 7/8 . Canada Surging gold stocks masked a day of broadly-based losses for most stock groups on the Toronto Stock Exchange today. After a sharp rise at the opening that breached the 4200 mark, the TSE-300 drifted downward for most of the session, ending the day with a slight gain in light trading. The composite index added 8.32 points, or 0.20%, to 4201.52 with advances over declines 359 to 312. The gold group added a remarkable 5.22% as the New York spot price for gold added 2 US dollars to USDollars 383.75.</p>

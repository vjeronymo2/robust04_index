			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the  border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    The reports we received from the NKR a short while ago  indicate that the situation is far from being stable. The  reason is the Azerbaijan military forces' systematic violation  of the cease-fire understanding. The Azerbaijan National Army  [ANA] units have intensely shelled the NKR defense positions  with artillery and then attacked them. It must be noted that  the Armenian side has tried to refrain from retaliating against  ANA attacks to create an opportunity for the implementation of  the measures in the protocol that was signed in Bishkek.  However, they have not always been able to do so.    Apparently certain forces in Azerbaijan wish to obstruct the  peace talks. The war serves the interests of those circles that  believe that their political ambitions are more important than  the people's interests. The maintenance of the fighting [words  indistinct]. However, we hope that Azerbaijan's leaders will  honor their signatures on the protocol signed in Bishkek and  will work to implement its provisions, otherwise the  confrontation may deepen. That state of affairs would not be in  Azerbaijan's favor.    Undoubtedly, Azerbaijan has realized that the maintenance of  the confrontation [words indistinct]. However, the combat  operations have not been halted and the situation has continued  to be unstable. The NKR Defense Army Headquarters has disclosed  that the ANA units launched an attack on [place name indistinct]  in Mardakertskiy Rayon at 0500 this morning. A preparatory  artillery barrage preceded their onslaught, but their attack  failed to achieve its objective. The Armenian defense forces  counterattacked and forced them to withdraw to their previous  positions. As usual, the ANA units suffered many casualties.    A high-level agreement has been reached to end the fighting,  so why should the war continue?    The combat operations were not limited to Mardakertskiy  Rayon. The NKR defense positions in Askeranskiy Rayon in the  eastern theater of the war were also shelled by artillery units.  There were combat operations in that part of the front line  this afternoon, too.    The ANA units shelled the Armenian defense positions in  Askeranskiy Rayon yesterday. Later they attacked Yarymdzha in  Mardakertskiy Rayon. However, their attacks were rebuffed.  Dozens of ANA officers and men have been killed over the past  three days in Azerbaijan's unjust war for Armenian territory.    No incidents occurred in the border between Armenia and  Azerbaijan last night and this morning. We hope that this will  continue.</p>

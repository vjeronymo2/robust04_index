Segni's call for direct election of a premier has long been a  sticking point with the People's Party and its predecessor, the  Christian Democratic Party.    The announcement comes just days after Segni signed a  programme deal with the federalist Northern League, a deal which  broke down last night when League chief Umberto Bossi said he  would have nothing to do with the People's Party.    Segni is continuing a round of meetings with representatives  from the Liberal, Socialist and other lay parties, aides said.</p>

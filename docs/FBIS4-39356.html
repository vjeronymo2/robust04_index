			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev has sent to the  leaders of CIS countries a draft document on the formation of an  Eurasian Union, a new integrating association of post-Soviet  countries.    The plan INTERFAX has at its disposal implies that potential  members of the union should sign a treaty forming the legal and  organizational prerequisites "for deepening integration with the  purpose of forming an economic, currency, and political union."  According to the plan, associated membership in the union is not  permitted. The termination of hostilities is one of the  preliminary conditions for entering the union.    The preamble of the document says that the potential of the  CIS has not been exhausted. The Commonwealth plays a positive  role in offering a legal framework for relations between its  member-countries. However, according to the Kazakh leader, the  existing structure of CIS bodies does not allow to fully benefit  from the potential of integration. Nazarbayev believes that  economic integration prompts the need to develop political  institutions having sufficient powers.    Among such supernational political structures of the future  union Nazarbayev named the Eurasian parliament -- the supreme  consultative body formed of an equal number of MP's from  member-countries or through direct elections. The main purpose  of the parliament would be the coordination of laws of  member-countries guaranteeing the development of a common  economic space, social security and human rights. Under the  plan the decisions of parliament would come into force after  their ratification by member-countries of the union.    Nazarbayev also suggested forming a permanent executive  committee. He feels that a ministry for the Eurasian Union  should be set up in each country for better coordination and  more effective joint activities.    The plan sent to CIS leaders also implies the formation of  several supernational economic bodies such as the economic  commission of the Council of the Heads of State that would work  out the strategy of economic reforms, a commission for raw  materials that would coordinate and approve prices and quotas of  exported raw materials and fuel as well as gold and other  precious metals. An international investment bank would be set  up as well as a commission for a common unit for settlements.  Nazarbayev also suggests setting up a commission for  international financial and industrial groups and joint ventures  and economic arbitration. The latter would settle disputed  matters and impose fines.    In keeping with Nazarbayev's plan the Eurasian union would  have a common defence space and coordinated defence activities.  For the purpose a treaty on joint efforts to strengthen the  armed forces of member-countries and on the protection of the  common borders would be signed. A collective peace-keeping  force would be formed and the UN Security Council would be asked  to give the contingent an appropriate status. "All union  members, except Russia, would keep their nuclear-free status,"  the document says.    Nazarbayev favors the formation of an environmental fund of  member-nations. The plan also speaks of the need for an  international treaty on dumping nuclear wastes. Among the  long-term joint programs for restoring the environment  Nazarbayev named the Aral sea, Chernobyl, and the Semipalatinsk  nuclear test ground.    Under the plan, if a citizen of a union member-country  chooses to move to another Eurasian country, he or she will  automatically become citizen of the new country of residence.    It is suggested to make Russian the official language of the  union and a city near the dividing line between Europe and Asia,  for instance Kazan or Samara, the capital of the union.    IF [INTERFAX] Note: Nazarbayev came out with the idea of a  Eurasian Union during his Moscow visit last March. CIS leaders  have regarded the idea with reserve, except the Kyrgyz President  Askar Akaev who welcomed it. It was not discussed at the latest  CIS summit in April. In a recent statement for newsmen the  press secretary of the Kazakh leader Nurlan Danenov said  Nazarbayev's idea became the subject of an incorrect political  debate which is allegedly aimed at driving a wedge between CIS  leaders due to their different approaches to Nazarbayev's  concept.    Analysts believe that Nazarbaev's plan will hardly become  the  subject of an official discussion of CIS leaders in the nearest  future. Neither do they foresee great changes in the attitude  of most Commonwealth leaders to the plan despite Nazarbayev's  assurances that the union would be only an additional  integration structure, not an alternative to the CIS.</p>

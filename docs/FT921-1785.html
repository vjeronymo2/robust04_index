			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Finland's central bank comes to the rescue: The country's banks are reeling from the effects of the recession FINLAND'S banks are reeling from the worst economic blow in recent history. Faced with heavy credit losses and debtors who have halted the interest payments on their loans, many of the Finnish banks reported large losses for 1991 and expect this year to be just as bad. However, a godsend came last week in the form of a Bank of Finland proposal for a rescue package. This is aimed at bolstering the banks' capital adequacy ratios, improving their profitability, and restoring confidence in the troubled sector by setting up a FM20bn (Pounds 2.54bn) government deposit guarantee fund. Finland's financial markets flourished in the deregulated environment of the mid-to-late 1980s. However, the Finnish economy is now suffering from a severe recession: GNP fell by 6 per cent in 1991, unemployment has reached 10 per cent, and the number of bankruptcies soared by 70 per cent to a record 6,138 last year. The sharp downturn in the Finnish economy has taken its toll on the banks, leading to a dramatic increase in non-performing loans (where no interest has been paid for 90 days or more) and credit losses. Total credit losses for the Finnish banks jumped from FM2.34bn in 1990 to FM7.59bn last year, raising fears about the ability of the banks to meet the international capital adequacy requirements in future. The Basle accord on international bank capital adequacy sets a minimum capital-to-assets ratio of 8 per cent which must be met by the end of 1992. Of the 8 per cent total capital requirement, at least half must be core, or Tier One, capital (consisting of common equity, perpetual preference shares and retained earnings), while the rest can be non-core, or Tier Two, capital (consisting of subordinated debt instruments, reserves and general provisions.) 'Finnish banks on average met the capital adequacy requirements fairly comfortably (at the end of 1991),' said Finland's working group on banking conditions last week. 'However, there were big differences between banks, and at current balance sheet levels, this year's losses threaten to bring the total banking sector's capital ratio down to close to the 8 per cent minimum or in the worst cases even below it.' To meet the 8 per cent capital adequacy requirement banks would either have to raise new capital or cut their loans - a move which would have serious consequences for the economy. The Bank of Finland announced that the government would make up to FM8bn available to invest in banks' core (Tier One) capital. The result would be to improve the banks' lending capacity by between FM90bn and FM110bn (or about 25 per cent of the stock of loans). 'It is quite possible that the banks may not need to draw on this capital at all, but the point is that at least it is there to avoid a credit crunch,' says Mr Jyrki Laakso, head of the international department at the Finnish Bankers' Association, who sees this measure as an important precaution. To help banks further, the central bank said it would take steps to improve the banks' meagre interest rate margins by raising the base rate by one percentage point to 9.5 per cent on May 1, and increasing the rates on low-interest loans. It has been a sore point for Finnish banks that over half of their loans are tied to the base rate (which has remained at 8.5 per cent since late 1989) while their lending is funded at a much higher rate in the money market, where three-month Helibor rates shot up to nearly 15 per cent in 1991 and are now around 12.3 per cent. Traditionally bankers' pleas for a higher base rate have met with stony resistance from the parliamentary supervisory board of the central bank which is responsible for base rate decisions. The politicians who sit on the board have been unwilling to raise the rate because of the impact on individuals with mortgages and personal loans. However, while the board was sharply divided on last week's decision to raise rates, Mr Rolf Kullberg, Bank of Finland governor, said he wanted to see the base rate increased still further to reduce the gap between credits tied to the base rate and those tied to market rates. Bankers believe that as market rates fall and approach the base rate, it will become easier to abandon the base rate altogether as a marker to loans.

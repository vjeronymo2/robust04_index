			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Genuine Efforts Should Be Made To </F> Maintain Stability"]    [Text] At the moment, it is a matter of great importance to  safeguard social and political stability and to promote reform  and development in a more satisfactory way.    Safeguarding stability is neither empty talk, nor  ostentation, nor simple, passive handling of the contradictions  and problems in social life. It is a valuable experience and a  profound lesson we have learned from the smooth practice of  reform and opening up to the outside world, as well as economic  construction, over the past dozen years. It requires a clear  understanding of the overall situation; a sense of mission and  urgency in maintaining the good developmental trend in reform,  opening up to the outside world, and economic construction; and  the courage to blaze new trails and use down-to-earth methods to  tackle the contradictions and problems cropping up in the course  of progress.    To safeguard social and political stability calls for  genuine  efforts. For leading cadres at various levels, first of all  they must make earnest efforts to improve their style of work.    First, it is necessary for them to plunge deep into practice  in order to undertake investigations and studies, pay close  attention to the implementation of the policies and measures for  reform and development already adopted by the central  authorities, combine general calls with concrete guidance, and  discuss together with the masses concrete programs for reform  and development, as well as measures for overcoming difficulties  and developing the economy.    An urgent topic at present is how to imbue state-owned  enterprises -- especially those state-owned enterprises that are  incurring losses -- with real vitality in the reform to change  operational mechanisms and to establish a modern enterprise  system. For governments at various levels, it is necessary for  them to actively explore changing their functions, improving the  management of state-owned assets, establishing a social security  system, improving the market system, and reducing enterprise  burdens, so as to continuously create a good environment and  good conditions for enterprise reform.    The steady development of agriculture is also of paramount  importance. It is imperative for us to strictly carry out the  party's principles and policies concerning the countryside,  truly increase the peasants' comparative return on grain crop  cultivation, provide serialized quality services, help resolve  specific problems in production, raise the peasants' income, and  render guidance to them so they can enter the market more  smoothly.    Second, in the spirit of being highly responsible for the  people, we should always heed the cries of the masses, show  concern for their hardships, safeguard their personal interests,  and lead them in overcoming difficulties and solving problems,  so as to spur on the development of various undertakings.    To stabilize the market and keep prices down is a key issue  in correctly handling the relationship between reform,  development, and stability; it is also an important task  confronting governments at all levels. They have adopted a  series of measures or countermeasures to hold excessively rapid  price increases in check -- from controlling the scale of  fixed-asset investment and ensuring food grain and staple food  supplies, to launching general checks on prices, requiring  clearly marked prices on goods for sale, and taking measures  against staggering profits. These measures have reaped initial  results. New efforts are needed in studying the problem of how  to establish and improve the price regulation and control system  under the conditions of a market economy.    While making efforts to conduct the reform in depth, it is  necessary to take into simultaneous consideration the interests  of all sectors, in both urban and rural areas. In practical  work, particular attention should be given to that part of the  masses which is not yet well-off or which even faces  considerable financial hardship. They should be given earnest  help in overcoming financial hardship, and their basic needs  should be guaranteed. At present, some places have adopted a  compensation system that links basic old-age pensions with the  cost of living index; others have established help-the-poor  funds in urban areas to subsidize those families with low  incomes and those who are extremely poor.    Third, it is necessary to be good at observing the people's  conditions; to pay attention to coordinating interest relations;  to give correct guidance to and straighten out people's  feelings; to resolve contradictions in a timely fashion; and to  guide, protect, and give full scope to the enthusiasm and  creativity of the masses.    The overall advance of reform inevitably will lead to a more  profound readjustment of all kinds of interests, and will give  rise to many new situations, new problems, and new  contradictions. This requires us to pay further attention to  doing a good job in strengthening communication with all  sectors; to be aware of the will and demands of the masses; to  uphold a correct orientation in press coverage; to give  necessary explanations so as to remove misgivings among the  people; and to guide the masses to correctly understand the  necessity, arduous nature, and complexity of the reform; have  the overall situation of reform and development in mind,  correctly understand the relationship between personal and  collective interests, between partial and overall interests, and  between short-term and long-term interests; and to plunge heart  and soul into the reform. In addition, it is necessary to do  painstaking work to solve contradictions among the people and to  mobilize all positive factors to maintain a sound social mode  and a sound atmosphere in public opinion.    Fourth, it is necessary to adopt specific measures to tackle  hot social issues for which the broad masses show great concern,  be honest in performing our official duties, and work  industriously for the people until good results have been  achieved.    Continuous efforts should be made to do a good job in the  struggle against corruption and in promoting clean government.  The Third Plenary Session of the Central Disciplinary Committee  recently reiterated the "five requirements" for leaders at all  levels to keep a clean government and be self-disciplined.  These are rules of behavior that government leaders must  follow. In terms of society as a whole, greater efforts should  be made to strengthen discipline and halt unhealthy tendencies.  Continuous efforts should be made to investigate cases that  violate the law and discipline -- particularly the major and  important ones -- and to punish and purge those corrupt elements  that offend the law and discipline.    Social mode has a direct bearing on social stability. It is  necessary to further encourage healthy social trends, advocate  the tradition of standing up for justice, and strive for a  fundamental turn for the better in the social mode. It is  necessary to explore new and comprehensive ways to maintain  sound social order, and to improve and perfect the new mechanism  of mass participation. In addition, severe punishments are  needed in order to deal resolute blows to law-breakers and to  create a stable and harmonious social environment for reform and  development.    With stability there will be prosperity, and with stability  there will be a future.    Overall social and political stability should be treasured,  protected, and maintained by society as a whole.</p>

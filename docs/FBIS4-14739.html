			<p>BFN     [Text] The Crimean president's military advisor Valeriy  Kuznetsov believes that it is inexpedient for Ukraine to keep  such numerous armed forces in Crimea. He told Interfax that  Ukraine had a 50,000-strong contingent of land troops in Crimea.    "Crimea is overly stuffed with land forces," he said. "Given  this, only the Russian Black Sea Fleet should stay to protect  Crimea, Ukraine and Russia," he said. He is convinced that  "Russia is strong enough to maintain a modern, reliable and  combat-ready Black Sea Fleet."    Kuznetsov emphasized that the Crimean leaders were not  planning to create military formations of their own, because  they were simply redundant. "Besides that, we simply cannot  afford them," he said.    "There are official bodies, such as the Crimean security  service and interior ministry, which will maintain order and  combat crime," said Kuznetsov.</p>

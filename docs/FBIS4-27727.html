			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 3 (ANTARA) -- PT Wijaya Karya [private  company] and its brokering company PT Prima Comexindo signed a  trade contract here Thursday with the Government of  Turkmenistan, a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States  (CIS), to supply the former Soviet republic with construction  products.    During the signing ceremony, which was attended by visiting  Turkmenistan President Saparmurad Niyazov, Indonesia's  coordinating Minister for Political Affairs and Security Susilo  Sudarman and Indonesia's Ambassador to CIS countries Rachmat  Witular, the chamber of commerce and industry from both  countries also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to  encourage economic relations between their entrepreneurs.    In his welcoming speech, President Niyazov said that the MOU  and the trade contract constitute the basis for closer bilateral  economic cooperation as well as an official framework for  business activities conducted by the two countries'  entrepreneurs.    He also said that Indonesia may find it attractive to invest  in the raw material processing industry now being developed in  Turkmenistan.    Turkmenistan, he explained, has oil deposits of some 13  trillion cubic metres but huge investments are needed for  processing and transportation.    Niyazov also hoped that cooperation might be established  with  Indonesia in developing a textile industry in view of  Turkmenistan's annual production of one million tons of cotton  and Indonesia's established textile industry.    In the meantime, general chairman of Indonesia's Chamber of  Commerce and Industry Aburizal Bakrie said that the newly signed  MOU will provide opportunities to Indonesia's and Turkmenistan's  businessmen to develop opportunities in trade, industry and  investment.    President Director of PT Prima Comexindo Hashim S.  Jojohadikusumo meanwhile said that bilateral economic relations  have great potential given that, at 511 thousand tons annually,  Indonesia is the world's largest cotton importer.    According to Jojohadikusumo, in addition to textiles,  cooperation in investment and trade between Indonesia and  Turkmenistan could also be established in cement, oil and gas.    He added that Indonesia will likely export frying oil, tea,  aircrafts and railway coaches to Turkmenistan.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Tender feelings The Bank of England must have known that yesterday's Treasury bill auction would cause a stir. Since three-month money market rates have crept up over the past week, it had an awkward choice. It could withdraw the tender, in which case it might be accused of forfeiting credibility by resisting upward pressure on rates. Or it could proceed on schedule, in which case the markets might assume it was somehow endorsing higher rates. In the event it chose to do the latter but offset the signal effect by dealing shortly afterwards at its normal rate in the money market. Such a sophisticated approach may seem natural to an organisation with 300 years of experience. But the simple message that no interest rate signal was intended was lost on the broader market. Instead it concluded that the Old Lady was finally losing her grip. Much as the Bank prizes its discretion over the timing of interest rate changes, the uncertainty could have been avoided if decisions taken at the monthly meeting between the chancellor and the governor - most recently on Thursday - were implemented at once. The Bank's right to choose the moment supposedly reflects its technical grasp, but it did not show much talent in this regard yesterday. Moreover, the authorities may be missing an opportunity if they have decided to leave rates alone. Though the markets may have read too much inflationary risk into this week's CBI quarterly trends survey, policy should aim to pre-empt any acceleration of price rises before it actually happens. Parliament is now in recess and no gilts auction is on the cards for August. There could hardly be a better time to move, especially since the markets will remain restive until the authorities finally show their hand.</p>

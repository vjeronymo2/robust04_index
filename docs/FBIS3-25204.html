			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] In Burundi, the 13 experts of the  international inquiry commission yesterday published their  preliminary observations on the massacres that took place after  the aborted coup on 21 October. These experts, which were  appointed by a consortium of nongovernmental organizations, say  that between 25,000 and 50,000 people were killed. This is a  frightful figure, although it is smaller than what had initially  been announced -- a few weeks after the aborted coup, some  observers said hundreds of thousands had been killed. The  massacres took place in the wake of the aborted coup by the  army. Philippe Retiens [not further identified] spoke to  Monique Mas:    [Begin recording] [Retiens] The coup was seemingly carried  out by the majority of army officers. That is to say, the Army  was responsible, actively or passively, for the coup, contrary  to what sources close to the Burundian Army said. They held  that a few specific units were responsible.    [Mas] Who is behind the massacres that followed the aborted  coup?    [Retiens] The responsibility is shared. Hutus killed Tutsis  in reprisals. Especially when the news of the death of  President Ndadaye was announced, many Tutsis were killed.  Moreover, massacres were carried out by the Army, sometimes  with the help of Tutsi civilians.    [Retiens] What is the situation in the country today?    [Mas] It remains quite unstable, especially in Bujumbura.  [end recording]    [Announcer] The international inquiry commission's final  report will be published by April.</p>

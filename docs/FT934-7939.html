			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Kantor expects Gatt progress THE Seattle summit of the 15-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum will produce 'concrete' offers for the bargaining table in Geneva which will help the Uruguay Round towards a successful conclusion by December 15, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said yesterday. In high spirits and confident of approval by the House of Representatives of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr Kantor said an administration victory on Nafta would provide President Bill Clinton with 'the moral and political authority to go to the Apec and work with his counterparts - and they will respond'. He said he expected further momentum to come from his meetings with Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's chief trade negotiator, in Washington next week. 'We will get a Uruguay Round (deal),' he said. Mr Kantor said the US was taking the leadership on trade 'to grow the world economy' and would continue to do so. Vital to this was Mr Clinton's belief in the link between US economic and national security and between both of those and trade. Mr Kantor was optimistic about US relations with France, which are vitally important to final agreement. He said one 'big mistake' the previous administration had made was in not directly engaging with the French. He, himself, has twice met French officials in the past month. 'They have their own interests,' he said. 'We cannot question their motivations. We may disagree with their conclusions, but we don't personalise this.' In Geneva it has been presumed that the Clinton administration has been distracted by the Nafta battle. Mr Kantor, however, insisted that US officials have been 'busily engaged' in Geneva. Other US officials say the numerous side deals which gave dozens of congressmen the political cover to support Nafta are not likely to impede progress in Gatt. For example, President Clinton was pressed to seek a 15-year phase-out of textile quotas rather than the 10-year period contained in the negotiating text. In a letter to textile interests, the president ultimately promised to 'achieve the longest possible phase-out' and to ask Mr Kantor to explore the prospect of a 15-year phase-out with nations believed to favour it. Mr Clinton promised to ensure that the impact of the Uruguay Round was eased as far as possible, 'including specifically addressing the question of gradual and even staging of tariff reductions and quota integration'.</p>

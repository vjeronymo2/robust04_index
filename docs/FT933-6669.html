			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: News Corporation The plan to beam Bart Simpson into Bangkok via satellite has, if nothing else, restored News Corporation's forward momentum. Before the acquisition of a controlling interest in Star TV last month, its shares were becalmed. They have since risen by 20 per cent, adding another leg to the bull run stretching back to 1991. Since Star is unlikely to contribute much by way of earnings in the near-term, that appreciation might seem curious. After two years restoring order to News Corp's balance sheet, though, the deal has been taken as a signal that Mr Rupert Murdoch is feeling expansive. There is no shortage of recovery potential within the existing empire. Having driven margins higher in the depths of recession, UK newspapers should be well geared to any cyclical upturn in advertising. The network of US television stations continues to grow, while Fox films must surely come up with a blockbuster movie before too long. Even the investments in BSkyB and Ansett are starting to look less of a drag on earnings. But there is scarcely a stock market where cyclical profits recovery is not now taken for granted. Investors are now looking to News Corp for more. So long as equity and bond markets are receptive, Mr Murdoch will not have to rely on the banks to fulfil his ambitions. Although interest cover is comfortable and no large debt repayments fall due until the second half of the decade, that will doubtless be a relief. The Star acquisition was paid for with equity and cash raised from an issue of convertible stock. Having driven the shares higher in anticipation of the next move, the market should expect more of the same.</p>

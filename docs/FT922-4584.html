			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maxwell brothers seek Dollars 10m for media venture MR KEVIN MAXWELL and his brother Ian are trying to raise Dollars 10m to launch an international media investment partnership. The aim of the venture is to take stakes in promising media businesses in the UK, the US and in a number of countries in central and eastern Europe. In a strategy reminiscent of their late father, Mr Robert Maxwell, the brothers apparently believe that the recession in the UK and the US and the political changes in eastern Europe provide investment opportunities. The areas seen as potential investment include electronic publishing, academic and professional journals, free newspapers and directories. Following the circulation of a letter from Mr Kevin Maxwell seeking investment funds, it is believed that a draft prospectus for the new partnership has been produced. It seeks to raise the funds by the end of the month. The brothers have been working from offices at 2 Wardrobe Place, London, rented in the name of Sphere Inc, a Californian video games company. Mr Robert Maxwell took an 80 per cent stake in the company in 1987. The holding is controlled by the Maxwell Charitable Trust in Liechtenstein, which is outside the present reach of administrators, creditors and pensioners. Yesterday, after the Financial Times identified the location of the offices, it appeared that they had been, at least temporarily, abandoned. Photographers waited outside and there was no sign of life. It is believed that, as well as the Maxwell brothers and their secretaries, it was planned that Mr Michael Stoney would also work from the offices. Mr Stoney is former deputy managing director (finance) of Mirror Group Newspapers and deputy managing director of AGB International, the market research group once owned by Maxwell private interests. Earlier this year, along with Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell, Mr Stoney declined to answer questions from the House of Commons select committee on pensions which concerned more than Pounds 400m missing from the pension funds of Maxwell-controlled companies. However, Mr Stoney's own pension is intact. It is in the executive pension plan of AGB International, a small fund for about 20 people that was not raided during the final months of Mr Robert Maxwell's life. The fund, unlike a number of other Maxwell pension funds, will not be wound up because it has been judged by its trustees Clay &amp; Partners to be still viable. The planned new Maxwell investment fund would take minority stakes in a range of existing media enterprises. The Maxwell brothers would be involved in the management of the investments in return for a fee. Meanwhile the Serious Fraud Office said it would investigate the Liechtenstein-based companies linked with the Maxwell family. The SFO said that although, six months after Mr Robert Maxwell's death, no one from the organisation had yet approached the Liechtenstein authorities, inquiries into the companies were 'inevitable'. There was no reason to believe the SFO would receive anything other than co-operation from them, the SFO said.

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Fed chief predicts pick-up in US economic growth ECONOMIC GROWTH in the US will soon pick up again, and any effort by Congress to hasten the recovery by cutting taxes will probably be counterproductive, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, said yesterday. 'I expect that the economic expansion will soon gain momentum, which lower inflation should help to maintain,' Mr Greenspan told the Senate banking committee in presenting the central bank's twice yearly report to Congress on monetary policy and economic pros-pects. Mr Greenspan faced a hostile congressional audience, led by Senator Donald Riegle of Michigan who attacked him for lowering interest rates too slowly and for believing that monetary easing alone would be enough to lead the US economy to recovery. 'I don't hear you saying anything different to the people out there in the country who are in trouble except: 'hang on',' Mr Riegle said. Mr Greenspan acknowledged that the unemployment rate was much worse than he had anticipated a year ago. This, however, was because a greater proportion of the population than expected was entering the workforce, rather than following alternatives such as further education or home-making. The size of the federal budget deficit had severely limited the choices available, he said, and any effort to 'jump start' the economy with a package of tax incentives would be dangerous. 'I will not deny that there is a possibility that if some fiscal stimulus were enacted we would accelerate near term. I think that is highly risky . . . and could probably be counterproductive,' Mr Greenspan warned. 'I do not believe this notion that we can jump start the economy . . . The relevant analogy is turning an ocean liner around.' In a session notable for its almost total lack of any reference to exchange rates or to Monday's concerted intervention by central banks to halt the slide of the dollar, Mr Greenspan spent much of his time defending the Fed's slow but steady policy which has resulted in 23 easings of monetary policy over the past three years - the last of which cut the discount rate (at which the Fed lends to banks) to 3 per cent earlier this month. Any attempt to lower short-term interest rates faster, he said, would simply have pushed long-term rates higher because it would have provoked fears of a revival of inflation. Mr Greenspan said the Fed expected consumer prices to rise by between 2 3/4 per cent and 3 1/4 per cent next year. 'Were this to be realised, inflation would be about back to a pace last seen on a sustained basis around a quarter century ago,' he said.

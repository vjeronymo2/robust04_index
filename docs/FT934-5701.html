			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Reduction in interest rates demanded More than 70 of a panel of 100 top businessmen, industrialists, politicians and other opinion formers want reductions in interest rates, with three-quarters seeking a cut of 1 percentage point or more, John Willman writes. Interest rates fell 0.5 percentage point last week. The opinion formers, polled regularly by Opinion Leader Research, are overwhelmingly against Budget increases in income tax or value added tax. They are also opposed to extensions in the scope of VAT, but there is support for reducing or abolishing mortgage interest tax relief. There is comfort for the chancellor in the panel's growing optimism in the economic situation. Sixty nine expect the economy to improve in the next 12 months. A year ago just 48 of the panel were optimistic. And 73 believe that the economy has improved in the past 12 months, compared with one a year ago. A quarter believe that the government's policies are the right ones for the economy. But two-thirds believe that there has been no 'economic miracle' in recent years, and that the British economy is no stronger than it used to be.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERMAN FASHIONS HIT THE MARK  </P> <P> Not long ago the phrase "German fashion" would have been considered a  contradiction in terms.  </P> <P> France, Italy, America -- even Japan -- were considered the world's fashion  leaders. The Germans, it seemed, were on the dowdy side.  </P> <P> No longer. Today the best German designers are highly regarded throughout  Europe. And what's more, West Germany's sales in the apparel industry are  comfortably ahead of any other European country's -- more than $13 billion last  year.  </P> <P> West German exports of clothing are second in Europe only to Italy's, mainly  because of Italy's production of knitwear.  </P> <P> The lean, leggy women strolling along Duesseldorf's Koenigsallee, or Munich's  Maximilianstrasse, are as elegant and stylish as their counterparts on Milan's  Via Monte Napoleone or Paris' Avenue Montaigne. German women spend half again  as much on clothing as do French women.  </P> <P> "The German fashion industry has always been important," Manfred Kronen,  chairman of the Igedo International Fashion Fair here, told a visitor recently.  "But to many it seems to have been a very well-kept secret."  </P> <P> Now the secret is out: German designs, while not up to Paris' haute couture,  have become fashionable. They are increasingly popular throughout Europe, not  only with women but with men who appreciate quality at a reasonable price.  </P> <P> Last year 180,000 buyers attended Duesseldorf's four fashion fairs. There were  8,000 exhibitors.  </P> <P> The Igedo fashion fair has an office that is open year around, with dozens of  fashion houses maintaining permanent displays of clothing, accessories and  cosmetics.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spread-Out Industry  </P> <P> Duesseldorf claims the title of West Germany's fashion capital, but Kronen  acknowledges that the industry is spread out. Duesseldorf bases its claim on  the fair, which brings fashion people together, and for its large number of  glossy advertising agencies.  </P> <P> Kronen, aware of the mundane reputation German clothing used to have, said:  "Let's face it, the Paris label still means fashion. Milan has come up in the  last 20 years. I realize that not many women are dreaming about a German dress.  But they have it, they like it, they wear it.  </P> <P> "Sometimes stores even take out the German label. But we do the business, and  we leave the glory to others."  </P> <P> In the past, German houses were known for their reliability, he said, adding:  "But it's pretty hard to take a good fashion-press photo of a punctual  delivery. Today German fashion is acquiring an identity and gaining worldwide  recognition."  </P> <P> Among Germany's top houses are Jil Sander, Hugo Boss (which placed its clothes  on U.S. TV shows such as "Miami Vice" and "L.A. Law"), Wolfgang Joop, Wolfgang  and Margaretha Ley's Escada, Bogner, Klaus Steilmann and Herwig Zahm's Mondi, a  favorite with the trendy Princess of Wales.  </P> <P> There are a number of up-and-coming young German designers: Reimer Claussen,  Brigitte Heiner, Daniela Bechtolf, Yuca, Barbara Bernstorff, Sandra Pabst,  Caren Pfleger, Beatrice Hymphendahl, Uta Raasch.  </P> <P> Klaus Steilmann has coaxed expatriate Karl Lagerfeld, one of fashion's  supernovas, to design a line for his firm, which is based, improbably, in  Bochum in the industrial Ruhr Valley. Steilmann, the largest clothing  manufacturer in Europe, is one of the continent's real success stories. His  sales last year were about $800 million, and $66 million of it went to the big  British chain Marks &amp; Spencer.  </P> <P> "We increased our business last year above what we expected," he said in a  recent interview. "I think the secret of our success is quality and on-time  delivery.  </P> <P> "Before the war, Berlin was a major capital of European fashion. After the war,  clothing production was gradually rebuilt, and it spread to other parts of West  Germany. For years the clothing need in Germany was simply to cover the body.  Now we can concentrate on fashion."  </P> <P> Toward that end, Steilmann, who is 60 and wears sober business suits, makes  sure that his company has the flexibility to adapt rapidly to changing tastes  in fashion.  </P> <P> "You have to react quickly," he said. "A couple of years ago, green was all the  rage, and we managed in a short time to produce 750,000 garments in green."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personal Touch  </P> <P> In order to have a feel for the changing tastes of his customers, Steilmann  surveys retail outlets personally and often.  </P> <P> "You've got to keep abreast of what is moving in stores so that you can react  fast to supply the demand," he said. "Are jacket lengths coming up or going  down? What colors are becoming popular? You need this information."  </P> <P> To ensure a quick response, he employs 8,000 workers in his West German plants,  which account for 55% of his total production. This way he doesn't need to wait  for garments from the Far East, where 20% of his production is based to reduce  overall costs.  </P> <P> Steilmann, with his KS label, concentrates on the middle range of the market.  Jil Sander, West Germany's most famous woman designer, aims at the top of the  market with her simple, soft "avant-garde classics," as she calls them.  </P> <P> In her cool white office in a Hamburg townhouse, dressed in a casual gray  pantsuit and simple white shirt, Sander projects the restlessness and energy  that catapulted her to the top in Germany's male-dominated business world.  </P> <P> After studying at the Krefeld School of Textiles, where she took a diploma in  textile engineering, she completed her studies at UCLA, then worked as a  fashion journalist in New York and Hamburg. She switched to free-lance  designing and presented her first collection in 1974.  </P> <P> "When I started," she said, "German fashion buyers all went to Paris, then to  Italy. It took some doing to make my own country believe there could be high  fashion in Germany."  </P> <P> As for her design ideas, she said: "I don't like overdressing. I don't like to  see women looking like clowns. But I like to see their personality come through  in what they wear.  </P> <P> "So I emphasize good design, good material and patterns, and a feel for the  body. If you don't feel comfortable in something, what's the point in wearing  it? I like the fact that people say when you wear Jil Sander you feel the  difference.  </P> <P> "If you're going to pay a thousand dollars for a suit, you want to get  something back, not keep it 24 hours and then throw it away."  </P> <P> Like most other top houses, Sander has branched out into cosmetics and  perfumes, and she has set a precedent by using her own striking face in her  advertising. Her business has doubled in four years, and she worries about  overexpansion, which can mean suddenly mushrooming costs.  </P> <P> "Now I've got to spend time on administration and management," she said. "When  we were smaller, it was easier."  </P> <P> Sander, Steilmann and other fashion leaders here look increasingly toward the  American market.  </P> <P> "It will be very important," Sander said. "I feel that if you can please  fast-moving working women in Germany, you can please Americans too. But we have  to be careful and not throw ourselves all over the place."  </P> <P> Steilmann put it this way: "I think America is wide open for German fashions.  Americans appreciate quality and style at the right price."  </P></p>

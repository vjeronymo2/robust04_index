			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Romanian banker sacked Mr Dan Pascariu, Romania's leading commercial banker, was last night sacked as president of the state-owned Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade, after losing a long-running battle with conservatives within the ruling left-wing Party of Social Democracy in Romania. Mr Pascariu had attempted to resist government pressure to finance imports for insolvent state companies and to grant low-interest credits to the central bank and finance ministry. He becomes the latest reformer to be forced out of a senior position. 'This is very serious,' said a senior London-based banker. 'Dan is honest, professional and highly respected in international banking circles.' Under Mr Pascariu the RBST joined the ranks of the world's top 400 banks and consolidated its position as one of Romania's most profitable companies. It has declared a provisional pre-tax profit of Dollars 46m for 1993. Mr Pascariu has been replaced by Mr Razvan Temesan, previously first vice-president.</p>

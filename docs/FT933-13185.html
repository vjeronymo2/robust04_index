			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / BR sell-off attracts few would-be buyers GOVERNMENT plans for privatising British Rail's passenger services are in danger of being undermined by a lack of interest from would-be train operators. Although inquiries by the Financial Times have identified 16 companies interested in bidding for passenger franchises, the overwhelming majority are bus companies planning to operate a handful of local or regional railway services. Most of these companies are too small to contemplate bidding for high-profile InterCity or Network SouthEast franchises because the risks associated with these larger businesses would put too great a strain on their financial resources. As a result, most of the passenger service franchises are attracting little or no interest from potential bidders, so raising the possibility that the government will have to leave them in the hands of BR. The government's plan is to split BR's passenger services into 25 franchises and start putting them out to tender next year. Seven of the franchise areas are currently operated by the InterCity division, 11 are operated by Network SouthEast, and the remaining seven are operated by Regional Railways. Among the InterCity services on offer, the relatively small Gatwick Express service appears to be attracting some interest. The larger operations appear to have been targeted by only three companies - Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based shipping group; Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group; and Badger Rail, part of the Badgerline bus group. Of these, Virgin says that its only interest is in bidding for the East Coast main line as part of a larger consortium, and Sea Containers, which wants to bid for the Great Western main line, is in danger of disqualifying itself by insisting that it should take control of the tracks as well as the trains. Badger Rail, which is also interested in the Great Western main line, may well prove too small to take it on. On Network SouthEast, the only franchise areas so far attracting interest appear to be the South Western division comprising routes out of London Waterloo; the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line; and the 8 1/2 -mile Isle of Wight railway. Elsewhere, almost all the interest in privatisation appears to come from bus companies wanting to take over rail services in their area and integrate them with their bus operations. Transport ministers say concern about the apparent lack of interest is unfounded because, at the very least, management-employee buy-out teams will emerge as bidders for most of the franchise areas. But private sector bus companies say that buy-out teams will find it difficult to secure the necessary financial backing to bid for the larger InterCity and Network SouthEast businesses because lenders will not be prepared to accept the risks involved.

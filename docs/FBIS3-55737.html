			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 10 January RAHVA HAAL, POSTIMEES, HOMMUKULEHT, </F> PAEVALEHT, p 1,3]    [Text] Monday, January 10 -- One of the authors of the  constitution, MP [member of parliament] Juri Adams, described  the situation as leading to a constitutional crisis, and hoped  that the president will accept the candidates. He claimed that  the president's actions convey a message of no confidence in the  prime minister and the government coalition to the voters. "The  president will have to provide a good explanation, why the  candidates recommended by the prime minister are unacceptable,"  Adams said.    Prime ministerial legal advisor Aino Lepik von Wiren  described the presidential decision as arbitrary and stressed  that the constitution was not intended to delegate such powers  to the president.    Riigikogu [parliament] foreign affairs commission Chairman  Vello Saatpalu claimed that the president is seizing more power  than the constitution allows and described his manners in  signing agreements with other states as "incomprehensible."  Saatpalu further claimed that foreign ambassadors had expressed  their amazement at the vagueness of the president's powers.    Coalition Party member Academician Endel Lippmaa claimed  that  the economic development has been successful and there was no  need to replace the ministers. He criticised the refusal of the  appointed new ministers to start performing their duties as  "excessive party loyalty" and described the situation as a  crisis of interpreting the constitution rather than a  constitutional crisis.    Leader of the Liberal Democrats Tiit Kbin was of the same  opinion, stressing that the constitution should have been more  accurate about the president's authority in the matter.    Former MP Jaan Kross invited the appointed ministers to  start  working and expressed his regret at the "politically  uncomfortable" situation.    Environment Minister Andres Tarand described the situation  as  a threat of a crisis, rather than a crisis itself. But he  claimed that the president is not to decide over the suitability  of ministerial candidates.    MP Valve Kirsipuu expressed her confidence in Heiki  Kranich's  ability to handle the functions of the finance minister and  described the president's actions as "petty".</p>

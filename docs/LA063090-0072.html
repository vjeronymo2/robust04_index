			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATION MANAGERS ARE UPBEAT ON CBS PILOTS  </P> <P> A team of CBS executives, led by chief executive Laurence Tisch as pitcher,  lost a softball game against a team of CBS station managers Thursday night at  Dodger Stadium. Other than that, there was surprisingly little competition  between the network and the stations that carry its programming at CBS' annual  convention here this week.  </P> <P> "People were screaming and yelling several years ago when CBS first dropped  into third place in the ratings," said Lee Wagner, general manager of KMVT-TV  in Twin Falls, Ida. "But this time everybody came here more upbeat."  </P> <P> Station managers said that they liked the pilots for CBS' upcoming prime-time  schedule and were encouraged about CBS' prospect for improvement in the ratings  under Jeff Sagansky, the new entertainment chief at the network.  </P> <P> "I don't see anything that looks like a breakaway hit, but this schedule is  definitely commercial this time," Wagner said.  </P> <P> "This is the best group of pilots I've seen in several years," said Marshall  Noeker, president of Lamco Communications, which owns several CBS stations  around the country.  </P> <P> Another reason the affiliates were upbeat, Noeker suggested, was that the  network's performance during the May sweeps, when it finished second ahead of  ABC, had benefited the stations' local news.  </P> <P> Several affiliates cited "Lenny," a sitcom with a blue-collar hero, and "WIOU,"  a drama about a down-and-out TV station, as shows with potential. (The gallows  humor in the "WIOU" pilot -- showing the news of overnight Nielsens upstaging a  funeral for an anchorman -- was well received when the pilot was screened for  the TV managers.)  </P> <P> On Friday, CBS trotted out the anchors of its news programs, from Dan Rather to  the casts of "60 Minutes" and "CBS This Morning," which has been showing gains  in the ratings against NBC's "Today."  </P> <P> During a closed-door session between affiliates and network executives, a  question was raised about whether CBS might consider a co-anchor such as Connie  Chung for "CBS Evening News." But CBS News President David Burke noted that  audience research did not favor co-anchors in general and that such a concept  was not being considered.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires Stock Exchange President Julio Macchi  stated on 22 June that the decline in the value of shares and  government securities "is not worrisome" since it is linked to  the generalized slump in stock markets worldwide.    Macchi said that he wished "our stock market was an  exception, but it is really impossible to escape from these  trends once they take place," adding that he is not greatly  worried about the current situation.    Macchi -- speaking on the radio from Canada, where he is  accompanying President Carlos Menem as part of his retinue --  asserted: "It is the rise in the price of commodities that is  causing a decline in securities that represent capital and --  concurrent with this -- a rise in interest rates."    He further stated that this situation may act as a brake on  the inflow of capital into Argentina, but at the same time, "we  will have a better exchange balance parity as the dollar loses  against other currencies and the prices of beef, grain, and oil  go up."    With regard to Menem's state visit to Canada, Macchi said:  "We have met with businessmen and have come to the conclusion  that Argentina is now considered a more credible country."    He also underlined that Argentina "stands out from other  countries in the so-called emerging markets as it is more  attractive for the direct investment of capital."</p>

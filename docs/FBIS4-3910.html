			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Last year the average  per capita income of Chinese workers was 3,236 yuan, up 19.4  percent over the previous year.    This was revealed by the China Labor Development Communique,  jointly issued here today by the Labor Ministry and Statistics  Bureau.    Liu Guanxue, spokesman for the Labor Ministry, quoted the  communique as saying that in 1993 the country's total payroll  reached a record 477 billion yuan, a rise of 21.1 percent over  1992. After allowing for price rises, the actual increases in  the workers' total payroll and their average per capita annual  income were 4.3 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively.    The spokesman attributed the rise to the reform of  enterprise  operational mechanism and to the ongoing reform of the state's  wage distribution system, which now cover 18,000 enterprises and  14 million workers across the country.    An elastic wage plan, the core of the current wage  distribution reform, has been carried out in 30 provinces,  autonomous regions and municipalities. The plan is designed to  set the total payrolls in light of the economic efficiency  targets of various localities.</p>

Arriving, Darawshah said the delegation met Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad, who stated that Syria wants a just and  comprehensive peace in accordance with UN resolutions and that  it is ready to apply the principle of "full peace in return for  full withdrawal."    Darawshah said al-Asad stressed that Syria wants to  strengthen and unify Arab coordination to mark real achievements  for the Arab parties. Al-Asad explained that Syria has a free  Arab will and that no solution can be imposed on it through  pressure or coercion.    Darawshah said he also met Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar', who stressed Syria's readiness to receive Israeli Arab  delegations any time.    Darawshah said the Syrian Government did not ask him to  convey a specific message to the Israeli Government. But what  he heard is considered a message of peace, which he will  sincerely convey to the Israeli Knesset and Government.    Concluding, Darawshah said: We trust the Syrian stance,  which seeks to achieve peace. The ball is now in Israel's  court. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin must frankly  declare that he is ready for a full withdrawal. Darawshah said  Syria is against settlement activity in the occupied territories  and demands international protection for the Palestinians.</p>

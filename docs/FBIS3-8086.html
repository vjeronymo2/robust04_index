Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary  Gabor (Bagy), upon presenting the credentials of President Arpad  Goncz, emphasized that Hungary is also looking after a sizable  number of refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina.    President Izetbegovic, upon receiving the credentials, said  that this action confirms Bosnia-Herzegovina's international and  legal legitimacy and at the same time represents support in the  struggle against the aggression, for freedom and democracy.  Then President Izetbegovic added:    [Izetbegovic] Our people know of the support that [words  indistinct] offers in the struggle for the defense of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and they know the fact that a great number of  our refugees are there [words indistinct].

Hungary hails the new  element in the resolution of the crisis and the greater activity  of the international community, the United States, and other  international factors, as well as active participation in the  resolution of the crisis in this area, and supports these  initiatives.    In bilateral relations we have many possibilities for trade,  however, [word indistinct] present war-restricted circumstances,  but Hungary has a lasting interest in developing relations with  Bosnia-Herzegovina, not merely in bilateral relations, but also  in relations of the multilateral integration of the central  European territories, were Hungary ascribes an important role to  Bosnia-Herzegovina.

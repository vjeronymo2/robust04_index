			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Honda picks 136 'local' suppliers HONDA has appointed 136 European and two US component manufacturers to supply parts for its new car range to be built at its nearly completed Pounds 300m factory at Swindon, Wiltshire. UK suppliers have, as expected, gained the majority of the European supply contracts for the Synchro range which it will start building in October. The cars will have 60 per cent 'local' or European content at the start of production, rising to a scheduled 80 per cent by mid 1994. The 89 UK-based suppliers include most of the industry's biggest names. BBA subsidiary Automotive Products is to supply clutch assemblies; five Lucas Automotive divisions are to supply parts ranging from brake systems to wiring harnesses; Hardy Spicer is to supply driveshafts; Unipart subsidiaries Premier Exhausts and Oxford Automotive Components exhaust systems, catalytic converters and fuel tanks. Honda told a Swindon meeting of the suppliers that it will spend Pounds 500m with them annually when the plant reaches its target output of 100,000 cars a year in the mid 1990s. This figure is based on the output of Synchro and the replacement for Honda's Concerto model, currently built by its Rover Group partner at Longbridge. The sourcing of both models exclusively from Swindon, and indications from Honda that company spending on European components could rise to Pounds 600m-Pounds 800m, has increased expectations that Honda will move to substantially higher output levels at Swindon from the late 1990s. The Concerto's replacement is due to go into production by 1995. Honda said yesterday that initial Synchro output would be left-hand drive for Continental markets, with right-hand drive versions for the UK not becoming available until May 1993. The first cars will go on sale in Germany in January. The plant, which occupies a 360-acre site a few miles from Swindon, is expected to produce about 30,000 cars next year. Of the non-UK nominated suppliers, 19 are from France, including the Valeo group; 13 from Germany; four from Italy; two each from Spain, Belgium, Ireland and Austria; and one each from Portugal, Denmark and Sweden.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Only the foreign banks that can boast a first-rate  reputation and are regarded as reliable partners should be  attracted to Russia. This has been stated by the chairman of  Russia's Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko.    Speaking in Moscow at a conference of the Consultative  Council for Foreign Investment, he emphasized the necessity to  preserve protectionism in respect of home banks.    Mr. Gerashchenko also said that in 1993 Russia's gold and  hard currency reserves had tripled. By the first of this month  they amounted to $5.6 billion.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Kresimir Zubak, leader of the Herceg-Bosna </F> Croats, to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly in Sarajevo on 30  March -- live]    [Text] Esteemed Presidency, ladies and gentlemen,  deputies, and guests. We are drawing close to the moment when  you gentlemen and lady deputies in the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Assembly -- in line with your rights and duties -- have to  decide with your vote on what we, as representatives of the two  peoples, agreed on and signed in Washington, which is contained  in the draft constitution before you for adoption.    I have no doubt that today you will -- as individuals and as  delegations of the Croatian and Bosniak peoples, or others --  give your vote and endorse our agreement. I share the hopes and  convictions of all of you that -- after we adopt the  constitution, which is to take effect tonight at 2400 -- we will  start to implement it. Then your decision of today, and I have  said that I am convinced that you will endorse it, will not only  be a solemn act but also a historic moment, and you have the  honor to be historic participants in this act.    Both during the signing and the coordination of views  concerning the contents of the constitution, I have stressed --  and I have the right to say this in the name of the Croatian  people -- that the Croatian people are ready and willing to  implement fully the agreement contained in the draft  constitution. I would also like to say -- and express my  gratitude at the same time to the delegation of the Bosniak  Muslim people -- that through the coordination of views, and  after long and exhausting talks, we have as a result a draft  constitution that I am sure will enable us to realize all the  interests of the Bosniak and the Croatia people.    For that reason I appeal to you and call on you today to  cast  your votes as deputies for the reconstruction of  Bosnia-Herzegovina according to the principles envisaged in the  document.</p>

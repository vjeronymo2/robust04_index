			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATOR'S METHODS NOW GETTING STRAIGHT A'S;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: THE 'COMER PROCESS' AIMS FOR A CARING ENVIRONMENT, FOCUSING ON  STUDENTS' GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. IT ALSO SEEKS TO GET PARENTS INVOLVED.  </P> <P> When Yale psychiatrist James P. Comer started trying out his educational ideas  in two of New Haven's most troubled inner-city schools in 1968, initial signs  were not encouraging.  </P> <P> Teachers and administrators began the experiment with high hopes, but soon were  squabbling over apparent failures. Parents grew so angry that they planned a  protest march. And in the classrooms, children were confused and  uncontrollable.  </P> <P> But 15 years later, students in these two elementary schools, which had  previously ranked at the very bottom of New Haven's 33 schools, were showing  the third and fourth highest achievement levels, and their attendance rates  were the city's best. What seems to have made the difference is the solid link  that had been forged between home and school -- the most important forces in a  student's life.  </P> <P> These days, the method that has become known as the "Comer process" is standard  procedure in New Haven schools, and has been adopted since 1984 by more than 70  schools in nine systems. Last January, the Rockefeller Foundation pledged $15  million over five years to expand Comer's program.  </P> <P> His idea sounds simple enough: Get parents, teachers and administrators to  agree on a set of goals, and how to work toward them. Comer also establishes a  mental health team of social workers, counselors, school nurses and others to  deal with the social and emotional problems that children bring to school.  </P> <P> "That's all this is," Comer says. "This is common sense."  </P> <P> While Comer's process is not the cure for all the ills of urban schools, those  who have tried it say it is one of their best hopes.  </P> <P> "I see a big difference in our school climate. The kids seem to walk a little  taller," said Jan Stocklinski, supervisor of the Comer Process for Prince  George's County in Maryland.  </P> <P> "We're getting calls from all over," she added. "Last week, we got a call from  Arizona asking us to bring a parent and teacher out there." Stocklinski  recently met with a team of officials from San Diego's Valencia Park Elementary  School, the first school on the West Coast to adopt the Comer process. More  than half of its 1,200 students come from families on welfare, and the school  has suffered from a lack of parent involvement and high teacher turnover.  </P> <P> Principal Richard Cansdale said he expects to have the program in place by next  year, and adds: "I'm convinced it's going to help."  </P> <P> "No matter how hard we were working, it just wasn't meeting the needs of the  kids," said Patricia Carpio, principal of a Denver elementary school that is  studying the Comer approach. " . . . We found out you can't do what needs to be  done in the school. It needs to be a shared responsibility and you don't get  people to share responsibility if you don't give them a voice in what you are  doing."  </P> <P> But as Comer learned in those early, difficult years in the New Haven school  system, schools must first bridge the gap between what a child experiences at  home and what is expected in class. Particularly in disadvantaged homes,  parents -- who often did not do well in school -- are likely to feel disengaged  and hostile toward the school. When their children fail, it further increases  their alienation.  </P> <P> The 1960s were a time when other educational experts were touting open  classrooms and less formality, but Comer put more structure into running a  school.  </P> <P> He set up in each school a "governance team" led by the principal, and  including the elected representatives of parents, teachers, professional staff,  and, in some cases, custodians. Its job was identifying the school's needs,  coming up with a plan to meet them and measuring the progress. The components  of the plan may range from improving vocabulary skills, to boosting attendance,  to organizing social events that will draw parents to the school.  </P> <P> Belinda Brown acknowledges that she was "very hostile" when she first visited  her son's third-grade classroom in Benton Harbor, Mich., to see why he was  complaining. The teacher invited Brown to work with one particularly disruptive  child who had fallen behind in math, reading and spelling. Now, the 30-year-old  mother of three is on the school system payroll, working part-time at minimum  wage -- such positions being a standard feature in the Comer process.  </P> <P> Brown says the Comer process has given her "a burden to get other parents  involved, because I see what happens when they don't."  </P> <P> Mistrust and cynicism can exist on both sides, particularly in troubled schools  that have been buffeted by one reform fad after another. "There were some  schoolhouse people, I think, who were afraid that parents would take over  everything. . . . There were parents who believed this would be a passing  thing," Stocklinski said.  </P> <P> In the economically depressed Benton Harbor area, the Comer process has had  mixed reviews and produced uneven progress on achievement tests.  </P> <P> "If you looked at it generically as a school improvement plan, used all the  components, followed the guidelines, it's almost foolproof," the official said.  "But you generally have not had a strong commitment on the part of the  principals. For a lot of people, it's a pain."  </P> <P> In some school districts, resistance has been so strong that Comer's  consultants have opted not to even try the program because they knew it would  fail, said James Boger, coordinator of the Comer program at the Yale Child  Study Center.  </P> <P> Still, he said he has seen a marked rise in interest in the last few years.  </P> <P> "People are beginning to understand . . . that a student will not achieve  unless he or she is in a warm and caring environment," Boger said. "Schools are  beginning to understand and appreciate that parents are the primary teachers."  </P> <P> Comer draws many of his ideas on child development from his own experiences  growing up in East Chicago, Ind., during the 1930s and 1940s. He recalls  attending an integrated school with three other black youngsters, all of whom  had similar backgrounds and abilities. One ended up in jail, another died of  alcoholism and a third lived much of his life in mental institutions. Comer was  graduated from medical school.  </P> <P> "Why did my life turn out better?" he has written. "I think it was largely  because my parents, unlike those of my friends, gave me the social skills and  confidence that enabled me to take advantage of educational opportunities."  </P> <P> If anything, he says, the disadvantages that black children face today are even  larger. Most of the politically popular approaches to school reform in recent  years have emphasized test scores, basic skills and teacher credentials --  strategies that have been criticized for their failure to reach the poor and  minority children of inner-city schools. Comer, who is associate dean of the  Yale medical school and a child development expert, says that is because they  miss the basic problem.  </P> <P> "We have focused on academic content and teaching methods, rather than growth  and development," he says. Where children in the traditional supportive homes  of earlier generations were prepared for what would be expected of them in  school, the youngsters growing up in poor, single-parent homes "go to school  and present themselves differently."  </P> <P> To deal with these differences, Comer added another component to school  management -- a team that focuses on mental health. This group meets weekly to  discuss problems and assigns one of its members to work with students who need  help.  </P></p>

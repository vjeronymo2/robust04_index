			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TAIWAN TO BOOST U.S. IMPORTS  </P> <P> Taiwan said today it will slash more tariffs to help boost imports and narrow  the island's surplus with its trading partners, especially the United States.  </P> <P> "We are certainly worried about the rising trade surplus with the U.S. and hope  to correct that," said Augustine Wu, deputy director of the Board of Foreign  Trade.  </P> <P> The Finance Ministry said it will reduce 75 tariffs by 20% to 50% for foreign  products, including passenger cars and trucks, steel sheets and other  industrial materials. The cuts will go into effect in January.  </P> <P> Similar cuts in more than 4,700 tariffs were made between May and July this  year.  </P> <P> Taiwan's surplus with the United States jumped about 18% from a year earlier to  $11.2 billion in the first 11 months of 1989, according to official figures  released on Tuesday.  </P></p>

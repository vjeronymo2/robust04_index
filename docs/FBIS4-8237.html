			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "There Has Been Never and Will Never </F> Be Northern Epirus -- Minister Zhulali Declares in the Funeral  of the Victims of the Massacre of the Greek Commando"]    [Text] Tirana, April 12 (ATA) -- The funeral of the first  captain, Fatmir Sali Shehu, killed on April 10 by the bloody  hand of the Greek chauvinist forces, was held on April 11 in  Gjirokaster. "The act committed by the Greek commando has  certain anti-Albanian aims. It intends to create tensions in  the south, in the context the Greek-Serb Orthodox  fundamentalism, as well as aims to stir up old and fresh  appetites of the Greek chauvinists towards Northern Epirus,"  declared the Albanian minister of defence, Safet Zhulali, during  the funeral.    Giving the last farewell to this martyr also on behalf of  the  president of the republic, Sali Berisha, the minister of defence  said that the Albanians intend to bother no one, but certain  political circles, the Greek Government, the Greek church, hatch  up deliberate criminal plots against free and friendly people,  against a neighbouring country. This is a manifestation of a  savage and absurd chauvinism intending to destroy friendship  between the two peoples. At a time when the democratic  governments of Europe are making efforts to establish peace, the  Greek Government, with its constant support to Milosevic, does  the contrary. We tell them: "Halt their criminal hand, no one  can alienate the Albanian soil and the albanian nation," Mr.  Zhulali said adding that there has been never and will never be  Northern Epirus.    Further on he said that the Albanian Government strongly and  resolutely denounces this act, which is a very grave violation  of the Albanian people's sovereignty, before the Greek  Government and those of other countries and to the international  organisations. We ask the governments of the democratic  countries to put pressure on and halt the criminal hand of the  Greek Government against Albania, we ask the Greek Government to  make public the authors of the crime and their punishment.    The Greek Government must put an end to the policy which  intends destabilization in the Balkans and incitement to extend  conflict to the south, Mr. Zhulali said underlining that the  Greek Government bears full responsibility for these acts, which  will face punishment if repeated in the future.</p>

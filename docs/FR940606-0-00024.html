			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes the Agency retains substantial discretion, within the statutory framework, to set MACT Floors at appropriate levels. For example, because Congress did not define the term ``average'' in section 112(d)(3), or in the legislative history, it implicitly delegated the authority to EPA to do so. The choice of methodology_whether mean, median, mode, or some other measure_can often change the results. (The mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements in the set. The median is the value in a set of measurements below and above which there are an equal number of values, when the measurements are arranged in order of magnitude. The mode is the value that occurs most often in a set of measurements). As some commenters noted, the ``average of the best performing 12%'' corresponds to the 94th percentile when the word ``average'' is construed to be the ``median.'' If, however, ``average'' is construed to be the ``arithmetic mean'' or ``mode,'' a different result may obtain. EPA construes the word ``average'' in section 112(d)(3) to authorize the Agency to use any reasonable method, in a particular factual context, of determining the central tendency of a data set. In addition, EPA has discretion to use its best engineering judgment in collecting and analyzing the data, and in assessing the data's comprehensiveness, accuracy and variability, in order to determine which sources achieve the best emission reductions. EPA also has discretion in determining how to analyze the data, and thus in determining the appropriate ``average'' in each category or subcategory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are other important ways that EPA retains discretion in setting MACT floors. For example, Congress authorized EPA to subcategorize source categories based on classes, types and sizes of sources, which will result in different Floors for different subcategories. CAA section 112(d)(1). Using this authority, EPA can tailor standards to certain characteristics of particular emission units and sources. EPA retains flexibility, for example, to conclude that the production processes used at particular sources in the relevant category are sufficiently different from processes used at other sources in the same category to justify the creation of a new subcategory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These examples are not meant to be exhaustive. EPA has only begun the process of setting MACT standards. As EPA gains experience in setting MACT Floors, other issues may arise that will require EPA to exercise its discretion in determining, for each case, what represents the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12% of existing sources (or the best performing five sources, in categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Precedential Impact of Today's Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its March 9, 1994 document, EPA stated that ``the MACT floor decision *&blank;*&blank;* in this rulemaking will have broad precedential effect, and will be presumptively followed in subsequent MACT rulemakings.'' 59 FR 11018. Several commenters objected this statement, arguing that the issue of how best to interpret section 112(d)(3)(A) should have been addressed in a separate, generally applicable rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA wishes to emphasize that, although today's decision concerning the interpretation of Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3) for purposes of the HON will be precedential for future rulemakings, it will not be binding. Specifically, EPA will fully consider all comments on individual MACT standards, including those regarding the proper interpretation of the language in sec. 112(d)(3)(A), received on or before the close of the comment periods for those standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Application of MACT Floor Decision to Medium Storage Vessels at Facilities Subject to the HON <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described in the March 9, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reopening the comment period, EPA requested comment on whether the control requirements for medium storage vessels previously proposed by EPA would be appropriate in the event those proposed controls were to be determined to be more stringent than the floor. Only four commenters addressed the question of the appropriate controls requirement for medium storage vessels and provided rationale for their opinions. Of these commenters, only one submitted information which purported to represent control information for SOCMI storage vessels. This information was reviewed and found to not provide any information on control performance and to represent storage vessels associated with non-SOCMI processes (i.e., other source categories) as well as SOCMI processes. Therefore, the submitted information could not be used to revise the database. The EPA review of this information is contained in item VI&hyph;B&hyph;62 in docket A&hyph;90&hyph;19. This section of the preamble, therefore, only presents the basis for the final decision on control requirements for medium sized storage vessels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

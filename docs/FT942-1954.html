			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Relief in sight on high petrol prices - Michiyo Nakamoto on moves to liberalise Japan's oil imports and pursue deregulation At a glance, there is nothing unusual about the petrol stand just off the Komaki interchange, about 200 miles west of Tokyo. But the price of Y100 (63p) a litre at which Kanare Beikoku sells its petrol is about 20 per cent cheaper than the norm and the service station has attracted six to seven times as much business as the average station in Japan. Kanare's bold pricing strategy, which has earned it the wrath of the oil industry, highlights the high price Japanese consumers pay for petrol. Japanese petrol, at an average of Y121 a litre in May, is about four times the price of petrol in the US and 20 per cent more than in France or Germany. There are expectations that a report on oil policy published this week will put the government on track to liberalise imports by March 1996 and bring Japanese petrol prices in line with those in other industrialised countries. The report calls for the abolition of a law restricting imports of petrol, kerosene and diesel to oil companies with the capacity to refine, upgrade and store these products. The law, it notes, has widened the gap between petrol prices in Japan and other industrialised countries. With growing calls by politicians and business leaders for the industry to be deregulated to help stimulate the economy, the high price of gasoline has become symbolic of the burden Japanese consumers bear as a result of tight bureaucratic regulation. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the powerful business organisation, the Keidanren, expressed support for abolition of the law. In a meeting with Mr Tsutumo Hata, the prime minister, Mr Toyoda suggested that regulations prohibiting self-service petrol stations be lifted to lower petrol prices, a proposal welcomed by Mr Hata. At most Japanese service stations cars are welcomed by a host of attendants who direct the car into the premises, fill the tank, wipe all the windows, empty the ash tray and guide the car out again with a chorus of thank yous and deep bows. Those who favour deregulation charge that such excessive service and a highly convoluted distribution system add to costs. They also note that restricting competition through tight regulations on imports allows the oil companies to keep petrol prices high, despite the fall in crude prices in recent years and the sharp rise of the yen. 'Oil companies admit that margins on gasoline are around three times margins on other products,' notes Mr Nicholas Smith, industry analyst at Jardine Fleming, the securities company. The high margins are partly explained by the fact that petrol is probably the only profitable oil product for Japanese oil companies and they need fat margins on petrol to make up for the others. Moreover, to support industry, oil companies were required by bureaucratic fiat to keep the price of oil products used in industry low and in return were allowed to keep petrol prices high. For similar reasons, tax policy on oil has favoured industry over the consumer. Regulatory controls on the retail sector meanwhile allowed oil companies to keep a tight-knit group of affiliated service stations to which they distribute petrol, and thereby protect their margins. This allowed a highly inefficient industry, badly in need of restructuring, to survive under the protective shield of regulation. But discounters such as Kanare Beikoku, which buy excess product made by oil refiners through an informal market, are widening the crack that has opened in that structure. Liberalisation of imports would push the industry further towards restructuring and possibly consolidation. If imports are liberalised, as seems likely, the profits of Japanese oil companies could be severely hurt, says Ms Lalita Gupta, industry analyst at UBS Securities in Tokyo. Mr Tadashi Maekawa at the Petroleum Industry Association warns that liberalisation would force domestic refiners to reduce their capacity, lead to a heavier dependence on petrol imports and make it difficult for Japan to secure enough petrol in a crisis. But the momentum behind liberalisation appears unstoppable. Neither can the industry count on the ministry of international trade and industry its long-time guardian, to come to the rescue. Recognising the need to introduce greater competition into the industry, Miti has gradually taken steps towards deregulation and the oil industry cannot remain immune to a wide-ranging and long overdue restructuring.</p>

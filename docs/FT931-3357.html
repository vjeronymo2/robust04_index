			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (18): Old new technology BEFORE THE COMPUTER by James W Cortada Princeton Dollars 55, 392 pages IT CAN sometimes be hard to convince today's young executives, brought up on a ever richer diet of personal computing power, that a mature computer industry with its own rules and disciplines existed before the advent of the Apple II. James Cortada's book steps back in time to examine a similar phenomenon: the belief that the modern computer industry grew out of scientific research during and after the second world war rather than as a logical development of the office equipment industry. Cortada's thesis is that the origins of the computer business stretch back a very long way, encompassing the companies and individuals responsible for bringing to market typewriters, calculators, tabulators, cash registers and accounting machines. 'Somewhere today,' he concludes, 'a broken computer is being repaired by a service representative, just as a broken tabulating machine in the 1920s was repaired by a customer engineer from IBM or Powers out on a service call. This is an industry with patterns of behaviour that stretch back a very long time.' The author is neither professional historian nor academic but a long-service International Business Machines executive who now works as an executive quality consultant for the company. While this gives him a unique insight into the working of the data processing industry, it may also have inhibited his style somewhat, especially where Thomas Watson Snr, the maker of the modern IBM, is concerned. His account, for example, of the US government's anti-trust action against NCR, for whom Watson then worked, and which might have resulted in some 22 NCR executives going to jail, is notably even handed compared with other accounts. (Watson and the others were saved by a flood which devastated Dayton, NCR's home town. 'The Cash' poured in finance for relief work, popular support swung behind the company and the government backed off.) Cortada's main argument is an interesting proposition, however. The transistor and the personal computer, two of the most important industrial developments of the 21st century, were not nurtured, in the US at any rate, by their traditional industries - the thermionic valve manufacturers and the mainframe computer companies - but by start-ups. America's first mainframe, the Univac, was marketed by a broadly diversified office equipment manufacturer, Remington-Rand, after IBM, NCR and others had failed to show much interest. It took the company from 1950 until 1966 to turn a profit on its investment. Inside Cortada's thick, tortuously written book is a thin, lively hypothesis struggling to be heard. A pity; historians will appreciate the detail. Other readers may not stay the course.</p>

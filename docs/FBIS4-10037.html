			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 6 Apr (AFP) -- Claudette Werleigh, foreign  minister of Haiti's constitutional government, will explain her  country's political situation to representatives of  international organizations and ambassadors to the Latin  American Economic System (SELA), it was reported Wednesday.  SELA headquarters are in Caracas.    SELA spokesmen said that representatives of the World Bank,  the Inter-American Development Bank, the OAS, UNESCO, the  International Organization for Immigrants, and the UNHCR will  attend the meeting.    The ambassadors from Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Suriname,  Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica will also attend.    During the last SELA Latin American Council held in Caracas  in October 1993, representatives of the 27 member states signed  a solidarity declaration with the Haitian people expressing  their "deep concern for the lack of constitutional order in that  country."    The Council recommended that the SELA Permanent Secretariat  "follow up on the situation in Haiti and remain alert so upon  restoration of constitutional rule," a cooperation program can  be immediately implemented.</p>

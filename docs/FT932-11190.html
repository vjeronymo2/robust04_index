			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: 'Notionnel' set to give further boost to Globex THE addition of the French government bond contract is expected to provide a further boost to trading on Globex, the after-hours electronic trading system, when it starts next month. The contract, on the so-called 'notionnel' bond, is set to begin on Globex on May 13. The 'notionnel' is the second most widely traded bond future in the world, after the CBOT's US Treasury bond future. The Globex system is jointly owned by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and Reuters. Globex volume, which had been lagging since the launch last June, more than doubled when Matif listed two lesser contracts in March. During April, Globex volume was 135,681 contracts, with Matif 3-month Pibor contracts and Ecu bonds representing 81, 120 or 60 per cent of the total. Matif's 'notionnel' bond future had been scheduled to begin trading on Globex in March, but a series of intermittent system failures delayed its launch. The 'notionnel' traded a daily average of 16,628 contracts on the French exchange's own post-market trading system last year, and exchange officials expect all that volume to transfer to Globex. That would be much more than the CBOT's US Treasury bond Globex trade, which hovers around 1,000 contracts a session. Matif also plans to list its CAC-40 stock index future on Globex before the end of May. It will be the first equity index derivative to be listed on the trading system. Matif's overall volume in April was 5.1m contracts, an increase of 57 per cent over April 1992. Last month the exchange reported net income, after tax, of FFr143m for 1992, up from FFr91m in 1991. That raised the exchange's reserves, after dividend payments, to FFr698m.</p>

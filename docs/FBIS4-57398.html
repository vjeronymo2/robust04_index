			<p>BFN     [Text] Humberto Rodriguez Gonzalez, president of the  People's Government in Santa Clara, has stated that the current  process in which delegates present progress reports to their  voters has begun in Villa Clara Province and is going well.  Rodriguez said that the idea of backing the measures approved by  the national parliament has prevailed at the meetings, and that  the delegates are well-prepared, fully informed on every matter  concerning the population, in an effort to find solutions, or at  least study the causes, of the difficulties.    The Santa Clara Administrative Council has agreed to begin  having locally run enterprises reflect upon application of and  compliance with the policy of (?cadres), very particularly those  things having to do with workers' living standards. For this  latter, an overall program will be formulated that will  encourage an administrative leader to feel like one of the  workers, but with greater responsibilities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lilya Kuznetsova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- Large-scale unemployment is  fraught with such a social explosion that consequences of  hyper-inflation will seem a trifle, Russian Vice-Premier Yuriy  Yarov told a seminar-conference on social development of Russian  regions here today.    In his words, the situation will run out of control in the  near future if the government, the federal employment service  and the local authorities take no immediate measures to prevent  large-scale unemployment.    According to forecasts of specialists, the number of  officially registered unemployed will reach three millions by  the end of this year. The concealed unemployment that is  currently estimated at approximately seven million will at least  double.    Unemployment has turned into a major problem of social  services. It should be settled by joint efforts of the  authorities, employment centers and trade unions, said Yarov.    In his opinion, the state should allocate money for payment  of dole from the federal budget to those regions and districts  that are in critical condition. The state debt of regions with  a high rate of unemployment should be paid fully and in the  first turn.</p>

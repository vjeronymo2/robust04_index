			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): More than just small beer - Microbreweries have transformed US bars Connoisseurs of beer say that 10 years ago a visit to an American bar was a dull experience. The choice was limited and beers were almost indistinguishable in taste from each other. However, the past decade has seen a revolution in American beer-drinking habits. These days, bars and supermarkets are often stocked with dozens of US brands, many put out by small, local breweries which aim to create uniquely flavoured products. Choice has widened substantially. Once, US brewers produced almost nothing but lager. Today, small producers have loaded shelves with dark beers, ales and such esoteric tipples as 'raspberry wheat beer'. Microbreweries, as these small, beer makers are called, have attracted a loyal following on the west coast and in the north-east of the US and the trend is starting to gain momentum in other regions. Small brewers were almost non-existent in the early 1980s. Today, there are almost 400 scattered throughout the country. The marketing strategy of the big US brewers has traditionally been to offer a good-quality beer with as wide a taste-appeal as possible. But critics claim this strategy has produced bland-tasting brews. 'The microbrewers have done well because they found a market niche the large brewers had ignored for a long time - Americans who enjoy a distinctive-tasting beer,' says Irene Firmat, general manager of the Full Sail Brewery in Oregon. Microbreweries in the US still account for a tiny portion of total market share - slightly more than 1 per cent, according to William Owens, publisher of Beer, The Magazine. Still, their rising success, which has occurred in the absence of any mass-marketing campaign, has been impressive enough to make even the large breweries sit up and take notice. To fight back, many larger brewers have now started to produce their own distinctive-tasting brands. 'The specialty beer market is growing by leaps and bounds,' says Ruben Valdillez of Coors Brewing Company, a leading US beer maker which now counts its strong-flavoured Killion's Irish Red among its most successful brands. 'I think the microbreweries have a lot to do with that. They have helped educate the American palate.' Taste is just part of the equation, though. Even the biggest fans admit that microbreweries do not always produce the perfect brew. Small brewers appeal to consumers for other reasons as well. 'There is a certain amount of local pride behind interest in the microbreweries,' says Nicholas Godfrey, marketing director of the Mass Bay Brewing Company in Boston. 'People like to drink a beer that they know was made around the corner.' To capitalise on local loyalties, many microbrewers also run bars, dubbed 'brew-pubs', where customers can drink a product made on the premises. In Boston, the John Harvard Brew House and the Commonwealth Brewing company have both been attracting constant flows of beer drinkers since they opened a year ago. Microbrewers can add humour to the market - for instance, the 'Alimony' brand, advertised as the 'bitterest beer in the world'. They also offer variety. Lind Brewery of San Francisco markets a wheat beer in the summer, switches to an 'Oktoberfest' brand for the autumn and then starts churning out a Christmas Ale for the holiday season. This type of marketing technique is starting to influence the large brewers, which say they are planning seasonal launches. Another trend boosting the microbrewing industry is the growing number of specialty beer magazines on the market. 'Magazines have been part of the exposure,' said Roger Lind, president of Lind Brewery. 'They stimulate interest by running taste constests, explaining the history of beer-making, and keeping track of what is new on the market.' While they may still be a small force in the overall market, microbreweries are making their influence felt. American beer connoisseurs say they are grateful. 'This is the way it should be,' said Alan Eames, a beer 'anthropologist' based in Boston. 'A trip to the local bar is no longer a boring experience.'</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN STILL TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS;  </P> <P> TRADE: WITH END OF HIS TERM NEARING, THE GOVERNOR CITES STEADY GROWTH IN STATE  EXPORTS AND SAYS CALIFORNIA MUST CONTINUE HIS AGGRESSIVE POLICIES.  </P> <P> With a little more than four months to go before his term expires, Gov. George  Deukmejian said Tuesday that he'd like to be known as the guy who gave  California "a foreign policy that can be summarized in one word: trade."  </P> <P> In an interview following his remarks to a trade group in Anaheim, Deukmejian  said he is "not looking to be labeled as California's trade governor, but I  think we will be recognized for taking a major step in getting California  involved in the international competitive marketplace."  </P> <P> During the past eight years, the governor said, the state has created trade  programs that have boosted California's exports, maintaining the state's  position as the leading exporting state in the nation, with foreign sales of  $43.4 billion in 1989.  </P> <P> "We have 700,000 new people coming into the state every year and growing  unemployment caused by a cutback in defense spending," Deukmejian said. "In  order for us to have jobs, we have to constantly do things to expand the  economy. One of the ways to do that is to improve our trade opportunities."  </P> <P> The governor, speaking to the World Affairs Council of Orange County, said this  trade-oriented policy has laid the foundation for the state's businesses to be  competitive in the world market in the 1990s. He cited the fierce trade  struggle that is expected when the economies of Western Europe are united in  1992.  </P> <P> Noting that 1 million Californians "receive a paycheck that directly or  indirectly depends on trade," Deukmejian said it is not enough to keep  California goods and services competitive overseas. He said the state has also  encouraged California business people to travel overseas and seek out new  buyers for their products and services.  </P> <P> The governor said his Administration created several programs to expand the  state's international trade. Those include providing low-interest loans and  export finance insurance to small- and medium-sized businesses, and encouraging  companies to participate in foreign trade shows.  </P> <P> To help businesses once they go abroad, the state has opened trade offices in  London, Tokyo, Mexico City, Frankfurt and Hong Kong since 1987.  </P> <P> The governor also warned California's businesses about becoming complacent  about international trade.  </P> <P> "The danger that exists for us is to take things for granted," he said. "If we  start to think that economic expansion and global outlook are luxuries rather  than necessities, then we risk sliding back to the days of stagnation and  decline."  </P> <P> He criticized opponents of increased foreign investment in the state and  offshore oil exploration, describing such attitudes as protectionist and  counterproductive to increasing trade.  </P> <P> "We must avoid short-term, easy answers that undercut the solid economic  foundation we have built," he said. That means encouraging foreign investment,  rejecting fears of foreign control of the local economy and a halt of what he  called "mindlessly locking away important resources," he said.  </P> <P> Foreign investment in the state reached more than $42 billion last year, which  the governor said created 300,000 jobs.  </P> <P> Deukmejian said he'd like to see his successor continue to build on his trade  programs.  </P> <P> "If the next administration holds to a view of involving the state in global  trading," he added, "then I'm confident that they will build on what we've  started and we'll have more involvement and more jobs created in trade-related  activity."  </P></p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Poles discover petfood is the cat's whiskers - The emerging consumer markets of central Europe have provided challenges and surprises for western companies Selling petfood for Dollars 1.50 a can might seem a thankless task in a country where monthly incomes average Dollars 150 (Pounds 82). But Mars, the US-owned manufacturer of Pedigree Pal, Whiskas and chocolate bars, has found a way. 'We tell our sales people to convince shopkeepers to open a can of petfood and taste it. Then they usually agree to stock it,' says Andrzej Szwarc, national sales manager of DMS, a Warsaw company which handles Mars' sales and marketing in Poland. Sales of Mars' petfood are now booming, says Szwarc, who knows one old lady who regularly shares a can with her cat. 'And in all-night convenience stores, Whiskas is selling rather well with alcohol,' he says. Though few western companies have resorted to quite such unorthodox sales methods in central Europe, most have found that the region's emerging markets present challenges and surprises to which conventional marketing textbooks offer few solutions. At first sight, the task seems deceptively easy. Consumers are eager for western products and many already knew of western brand names from watching western television long before the collapse of communism. Since then, consumer imports have flooded in and the region's nouveau riche classes have flocked to buy anything with a designer label. White goods manufacturers Electrolux and Philips-Whirlpool say one of their best-sellers in Hungary is microwave ovens, almost unknown in the country two years ago. However, this commercial bombardment risks back-firing by antagonising consumers who have not before faced the full blast of Madison Avenue techniques and are bewildered by the region's lurching progress towards free markets. Many foreign products in the shops have been dumped or imported illegally by middlemen interested in a quick profit, not in building a long-term business. Quality is often variable, deliveries erratic and pricing unpredictable. Rafael Lopez-Apparicio, general manager of Kodak in Hungary, says the result is confused consumers. Michel Olszewski of Research International, a market research firm, believes uncontrolled and indiscriminate imports have hurt the image of western brands. Building brand loyalty is a high priority for most western companies - and reaching mass markets is not difficult. In Poland and Hungary more than 90 per cent of homes have televisions and, despite recent rate increases, air time is relatively cheap. The problem is choosing the message. 'We aren't yet very clear about consumer habits,' admits Andre Mico, head of Unilever in Hungary. 'Western products are perceived as better, but that doesn't mean you can sell anything.' Many companies have plunged in with western-made commercials for western products - with mixed results. In Poland a commercial for Cola Cao, a Spanish chocolate drink, which featured a muscular black athlete, went down so badly that the product almost vanished from the market. Procter &amp; Gamble's heavy promotion of Vidal Sassoon's Wash &amp; Go backfired in Poland when sales fell on rumours that the shampoo-conditioner caused hair loss. P&amp;G's candid peak-time commercials for Allways, a sanitary tampon, have also proved controversial, while recent newspaper advertisements headlined 'We respect the Poles' were regarded by many as condescending. The company's commercials for Tampax and Ariel detergent have been better received. But many Polish consumers are baffled by the punch line of Henkel's German-made commercial for Persil, which translates as 'You know what you have'. 'The philosophy of most western companies is to sell first and understand the market later,' says Eugeniuscz Smilowski of Pentor, a private Polish market research company. He also warns that hard-sell advertising can easily rebound by 'creating suspicions that companies want to dump on us trash that they can't sell in the west'. Some companies, though, are praised for respecting local sensitivities. Unilever test-markets its central European advertising carefully and has continued a popular commercial developed by the Polish detergents maker it acquired last year. To appeal to Poland's Catholic family tradition, Johnson &amp; Johnson adapted a western commercial for its baby care products to include shots of a husband holding an infant and sharing household tasks. 'We stopped just short of putting a cross round his neck,' says Marek Janicki, managing director of ITI-McCann Erickson, the Warsaw agency which handled the commercial In Hungary, Shell has included local scenes in a west European commercial, while Philips' sales of consumer electrical and electronics goods have benefited from a locally-made campaign. 'People have had enough of western commercials, they want something designed for them,' says Miklos Cspregi, head of the Budapest office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which developed the Shell and Philips campaigns. He also believes a trend may be developing in favour of local products. Benckiser of Germany has begun to stress in advertisements the local origin of Tomi, a detergent it makes in Hungary, while Unilever is using the theme 'Produced locally to international standards' for products it makes in central Europe. However, care is needed. Warsaw shopkeepers say sales of some previously imported western products fell after they were re-packaged with instructions in Polish, because consumers feared the goods were no longer genuine. Opinions also differ about the use of 'aspirational' advertisements depicting glamorous western lifestyles. The approach seems to work for familiar items like toilet soap. But for new and more sophisticated products, a more down-to-earth, educational treatment often seems to go down better. But some western companies believe the power of advertising will remain limited until retail distribution improves. They are emphasising gaining control of the supply chain and ensuring that products are consistently available, in good condition and attractively displayed at the point of sale. Many bigger companies are also working with selected retailers to get them to offer better customer service. But in such rapidly-changing and poorly understood markets, experimentation is likely to remain important for some time yet. As George Swirski, head of PepsiCo Foods International in Poland, puts it: 'If you don't take risks, if you aren't prepared to make mistakes, then you don't deserve to succeed.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- World public is  strongly denouncing the U.S. belligerent moves on the Korean  peninsula.    The chairman of the Denmark-the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea Friendship Association in his report at a meeting of  the executive committee of the association held in Copenhagen on  April 7 said that the United States in the past deployed nuclear  and other weapons of mass destruction in South Korea on the plea  of thwarting "threat from the North" and today it is bringing  forward the "nuclear issue" of Korea as a pretext to keep hold  on South Korea.    If the United Nations wanted to call something in question,  it should have accused the United States of shipping nuclear and  other mass destruction weapons into South Korea in violation of  the Korean Armistice Agreement and called attention to the  non-compliance with the UN resolution on the withdrawal of  foreign troops.    The African regional committee for the study of the chuche  idea in a statement April 13 said that the nuclear issue of the  Korean peninsula can be resolved only through talks between the  DPRK and the U.S. as it originated from the U.S. deployment of  nuclear weapons in South Korea and its nuclear threat to the  DPRK, and the [word indistinct] in an appeal on April 14 urged  the U.S. administration to come out to a direct dialogue with  the DPRK before it is too late.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Tradition meets the new realism - The issues surrounding the future of the party's union links YESTERDAY'S debate on the links between the party and its affiliated trade unions was merely the public prelude to weeks of intense private debate. Out of that private debate will come - probably in the new year - a report on reforming the links, with huge implications for the party's finances, membership, policy-making and, above all, its ethos and public image. The trade unions provide just over half of Labour's financial resources and from next year will cast 70 per cent of votes at the conference which, supplemented by various policy forums, nominally decides policy. Those 'block' votes are based on the 4.5m union members who do not contract out of paying a political levy to the party with their union dues and who dwarf the 260,000 individual members from the constituency parties. Although links between unions and parties of the left are common throughout the industrial world, the link in this country is one of the most intimate, based on the fact that the unions founded the party and then with their block votes succeeded in moderating the excesses of left-wing members. Also, short of state funding for political parties or the creation of a 'mass' party - both highly improbable in the near future - Labour will continue to need a lot of union cash if it is to compete effectively with the Conservatives. But critics of the links believe the party can now manage without the unions' political presence. They believe affiliated unions are a sectional interest group - representing less than a quarter of British workers - and, especially in the south-east, helping to associate Labour with the past. There has been no groundswell of support for a complete separation, and union influence within the party is so entrenched that even shadow ministers who might have led moves to divorce - such as Mr Tony Blair or Mr Gordon Brown - have had to disguise their real views. Some people even detect a slight retreat from the mildly reformist proposals that the leaders of the big unions seemed ready to accept a few weeks ago, such as complete withdrawal from the electoral college to elect the leader and from the local block vote in constituency parties. 'We do not need a revolution, we do not need a divorce, we don't even need separate beds,' says Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, who inadvertantly launched the post-election debate on union power in the party through his television anointment of Mr John Smith as the new leader days after the election defeat. The make-up of the party's union link review body, where the private debate will now take place, also rules out a radical break, although it may be pushed slightly further than it wants to go by reformers in the shadow cabinet. Nonetheless, there is a wide consensus supporting the view that the links must be made more democratically legitimate and that the corporate clout of the unions, epitomised by the block vote, must be replaced with a new relationship to individual levy-paying trade unionists. Well over half of the 'phantom army' of the 4.5m levy payers vote Labour but a large minority do not and yet their votes are still counted at Labour conferences. At the heart of the review group's deliberations will be the question of how to represent these levy payers more defensibly. Several ideas are being canvassed. One of the most popular is to offer levy payers full membership or possibly 'associate membership' of the party, which would allow them to participate without any extra payment. The obstacle to giving levy-paying members the same rights as ordinary members is that the average levy payer contributes less than Pounds 2 a year and individual members pay Pounds 15. If fees were harmonised, as proposed by Mr Graham Allen MP, it would probably require a cut in the contribution rate which might not be covered by extra members. Drawing attention to the political levy might also cause more people to exercise their right to 'opt out' or attract hostile attention from the government. How far will the review cut the union vote at conference - the most visible manifestation of union power in the party? Over the past five years the unions have spent less than half of the money they raise through the levy on the Labour party. If the conference votes were linked to the proportion of the party's costs that the unions now cover, the union proportion of the vote would fall to just over 50 per cent. The review body may cut the union vote to slightly below 50 per cent. But the political trick, according to Mr Neil Stewart, a former adviser to Mr Neil Kinnock, is to switch the flow of union cash to fund elections alone. 'The voters do not believe Labour can speak for the whole country if unions provide its running costs but they do believe that general elections would be unfair contests without union contributions,' he says. Stewart does not believe that a mass party can be created by converting more levy payers into members or by cutting membership fees (which will be experimented with in a few constituencies). He points out that shop stewards are the key to increased membership among union members and they are usually keen to appear non-party so as not to alienate non-Labour voters. Instead, if membership income and donations are to rise to cover more of the party's costs, Stewart says the membership fee will have to go up to Pounds 30. That would confirm the fears of many Labour trade unionists that the party is intent on cutting its links with the working class. The evidence of yesterday's debate is that they have nothing to fear.</p>

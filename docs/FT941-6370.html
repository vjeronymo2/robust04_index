			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Management: Qualities that count - Lucy Kellaway studies a new list that attempts to set standards in Britain's boardrooms What does it take to make a good chief executive? And what to make a good chairman, or a good executive director? What about non-executives? These seem pretty basic questions yet they are ones which companies rarely ask themselves. While academics write papers about 'key competences', there are few signs that boards of directors take any notice. Last week the UK's Institute of Directors and the Henley Management College attempted to answer the questions in a way that they hope will be of practical use. With admirable precision, they have drawn up a list of no fewer than 29 qualities which are deemed essential in boardrooms of companies from the biggest to the smallest. They have considered each different role on the board and allocated the qualities accordingly. The chief executive turns out to need all but four of these qualities, the chairman needs 18, the executive directors need just 10, while non-executive directors need only nine. The idea is that companies have a yardstick against which to hire new directors and to measure existing ones (sending them off on courses to acquire those qualities which they do not possess). The lists are part of an even more ambitious project to set general standards for all aspects of board behaviour and performance. When IoD and Henley set about writing such guidelines - at the government's invitation - it quickly became clear that there was little point in discussing the tasks of boards without reference to the quality of its members. The lists are likely to be one of the most controversial parts of their report*. The authors are asking for comments, but may not be prepared for what may be a lively debate, to put it politely. There will be screams of protest from those who reckon the wrong qualities have been selected, as well as from those who feel directors are so diverse there is little point in looking for common characteristics. Victor Dulewicz of Henley Management College, co-author of the report, warns that it is still only in draft form, and that in any case the lists are meant to be applied with flexibility. 'We are not saying this is the list. We are saying: use it as a starting point.' He argues that the selection of British directors is dangerously amateurish. Companies use sophisticated tests when recruiting senior and middle managers  -sending them to assessment centres and running psychometric tests, yet when it comes to choosing the most important people, most decisions are made on a seat-of-the-pants basis. 'These lists are more systematic than the methods some companies are using,' he says. Even so, people are already arguing that the list is not complete, and is full of inconsistencies. For instance, it is not clear why chairmen need to be good talkers but chief executives do not. Nor why non-executives need to be good at criticising, but need not be so good at analysing problems. Worse, many people - Sir Adrian Cadbury among them - would say independence is the most important trait of the non-executive. Yet this is nowhere on the list. Colin Coulson-Thomas, academic and consultant in boardroom practice, agrees that the list contains some alarming omissions. Directors, he says, must be self-aware. They must be constantly learning. They must also be robust as individuals. 'Some people seem to be doing well, but they are skating on thin ice. The moment anything looks dangerous they resign.' In response, Dulewicz points out that the list was not something dreamed up by the authors, but reflects the distilled views of 340 experienced directors. As such, it says much about the current preoccupations of boards. The only two qualities which are deemed essential for all board members are integrity and a 'change orientated' disposition. Post-Cadbury, everybody feels obliged to pay at least lip-service to integrity, while managing change is a concept so fashionable that it is heresy to question it. More fundamental are the complaints that the very nature of the project is flawed. Headhunters who make a living by selecting directors reckon that lists are unusable as a practical tool. 'In theory it might be useful to have a checklist. But you couldn't recruit using this,' says Ian Butcher of Whitehead Mann. Coulson-Thomas argues that the main weakness of lists is that they cannot take account of the relationship between board members. 'People can be excellent on one board and hopeless on another. It is to do with whether they complement the strengths of other board members. There is no point in putting them through a test if they are going to prove incompatible,' he says. He reckons that the skills you need as a manager are relatively easy to define, and therefore lend themselves to formal assessment. By contrast, at board level an outstanding director might fail on many of the listed qualities, yet have two or three dazzling strengths that more than compensate for these weaknesses. 'Those people tend to be lost when people use models of identikit candidates,' Coulson-Thomas says. Even those commentators who are friendly to the idea of a list of qualities are worried about the application. John Hunt of the London Business School refers to academic research that has succeeded in linking certain qualities of directors to company performance. Many of these are similar to those on the IoD list. They include interpersonal skills, strategic awareness, information processing and motivational drive. However, he reckons the lists can still be dangerous in the hands of careless companies. 'They are an improvement on the 'do you know Fred, he's a good chap' sort of recruitment,' says Hunt. But there is a risk that some organisations are assessing people on these characteristics but are using dubious instruments. They might be looking for the right qualities, but they have no appropriate means of finding them. While not everyone agrees with the report, most would argue that the present boardroom practice is far from ideal. Recent research in the UK has shown that fewer than one in eight companies makes any attempt to measure the effectiveness of its directors. Regardless of the value of the 29 qualities, anything that gets companies to question whether their directors are suited to their jobs is progress. *Good Practice for Boards of Directors.

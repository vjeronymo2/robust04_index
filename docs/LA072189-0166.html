			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PHILIPPINE JET CRASHES; KILLS 8 ON ROAD;  </P> <P> AIRLINER OVERSHOOTS MANILA RUNWAY, HITS EXPRESSWAY TRAFFIC  </P> <P> A Philippine Airlines jet carrying 98 people overshot an airport runway during  a rainstorm today and slammed through traffic on a busy highway, killing eight  people in their cars, police said.  </P> <P> No one aboard the British Aircraft Corp. BAC 1-11 plane was killed but at least  85 passengers and two flight attendants were injured, PAL spokesman Enrique  Santos said.  </P> <P> Four people on the ground were seriously injured.  </P> <P> The dead were crushed in their cars when the twin-engine BAC 1-11 jet careened  onto Manila's 12-lane South Expressway, said witnesses and officials at nearby  hospitals. The plane then came to rest on a railroad track.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 93 Passengers  </P> <P> The plane had carried 93 passengers and five crew members on a flight from the  southern city of Zamboanga, Santos said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred during a heavy rain.  </P> <P> Crash survivor Roberto Mendoza, 56, said the aircraft bounced several times and  skidded before coming to a halt.  </P> <P> "The pilot tried the brakes but the plane continued to skid. Then that's it --  bang! -- the plane hit something on the ground and came to a halt.  </P> <P> "When it stopped, the windows shattered and I jumped out. I thought I landed on  the wings but then I found out it was the roof of a house," said Mendoza, who  suffered a gash to his head.  </P> <P> "We landed, three, four, five, six times on the runway. We were actually  bouncing," said David Tillson, a tourist from Tacoma, Wash.  </P> <P> Santos declined to speculate on the cause of the accident, saying that would be  left to an investigation.  </P> <P> "Visibility was within (safe) limits for landing" despite the rainstorm, Santos  said.  </P> <P> Part of the belly of the British Aircraft Corp. jet was ripped open.  </P> <P> Officials closed the highway to facilitate the rescue operation, which was  hampered by the heavy rain and traffic jams on streets leading to the scene.  </P></p>

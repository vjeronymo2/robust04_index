			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nine-month earnings at Degussa climb 15% DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals company, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 15 per cent to DM164m (Dollars 112m) in the nine months to June. This was achieved on turnover down 5 per cent to DM9.4bn. The company said it expected the benefits of a restructuring and cost-cutting plan to produce better profits for the final quarter, compared with the same period last year. In 1990-1991, total pre-tax profits dropped by 44 per cent to DM179m, reflecting difficult conditions in many markets. Degussa said yesterday it had cut losses in the metals sector 'significantly'. This sector, accounting for nearly half of group turnover, suffered through losses at the Leybold machinery subsidiary and because of a 30 per cent drop in turnover in precious metals trading, where trading volumes were significantly lower than the previous year. Excluding the drop in precious metals trading, group turnover rose by 5 per cent, Degussa said. But it added that 3 percentage points of this were due to the inclusion of the recently acquired Arzneimittelwerk Dresden (AWD) - an east German pharmaceutical group. Profits in the chemical division - where turnover climbed 2 per cent to DM3.54bn - picked up from the early weak months of the year. Degussa said that while prices remained under pressure volumes had at least returned to the previous year's levels. Degussa also announced details of its expected capital increase. It will be issuing 1.08m new shares in September at DM225 per share, raising DM243m. The funds from the one for seven rights issue will be used for 'general corporate financing purposes'.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Morgan Crucible issues Pounds 96m cash call MORGAN CRUCIBLE, the industrial materials manufacturer, yesterday announced a Pounds 96.1m rights issue, before reporting a 10 per cent increase in 1990 pre-tax profits to Pounds 60m. The rights issue, which Morgan said would allow it to take advantage of international acquisition opportunities created by the recession, comes 10 months after its last cash call of Pounds 78m, which was priced at 248p per share. Morgan chief executive Dr Bruce Farmer said it was exploring at least five acquisitions, including two in the US and one in Germany. The one-for-four issue at 218p per new ordinary share will also finance two acquisitions completed after the year-end, Dulmison in Australia and the Solder Removal Company in California, which together cost Pounds 13m. Morgan's shares closed 14p down at 256p after the news. Dr Farmer said the company planned to consolidate in 1991. But with net debt rising from Pounds 110m to Pounds 118m last year, a rights issue was the 'lesser evil' in raising finance for acquisitions. The restructuring will focus Morgan on its traditional core areas in carbon and ceramic products. Morgan plans to sell the car-care side of Holt Lloyd, which it acquired in 1987, and dispose of its defence businesses which account for much of the electronics business it has attempted to build up over the last decade. Dr Farmer said the case for the rights issue was borne out by the performance of last year's acquisitions, which contributed Pounds 67.4m to group turnover - which rose from Pounds 522m in 1989 to Pounds 580m  - and Pounds 10.3m to operating profits, which increased from Pounds 66.3m to Pounds 71.7m. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 60m against Pounds 54.5m last year were helped by a one-off fall in net financing charges and currency hedging. Morgan had a tough second half, with operating profits falling in three of its five divisions compared with the first six months. Capital expenditure was cut by about 40 per cent from Pounds 22m to Pounds 18.3m. Earnings per share fell from 25.8p to 24.7p after fully diluting for last year's rights issues. The directors are easing the way for the rights issue by recommending a final divided of 6.75p, to bring the dividend for the year to 12.4p, a 6 per cent rise. The issue is being underwritten by Morgan Grenfell and the brokers to the issue are Cazenove &amp; Co and County NatWest Wood Mackenzie &amp; Co. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUNDAY SCHOOL LIFTS BAN ON AIDS PATIENT  </P> <P> A church that had barred an AIDS-afflicted child from attending Sunday school  reversed its decision Friday after publicity over the ban sparked a community  uproar.  </P> <P> The foster parents of the 5-year-old boy, who is being called Joey, were asked  two weeks ago to stop bringing the child to Sunday school because several  parents were concerned that their children might acquire the disease through  contact with the boy, said the Rev. Irwin Lutzer, pastor of the Moody Memorial  Church.  </P> <P> But Lutzer said that the church had decided to allow Joey to attend Sunday  school at the church. Parents upset over his attendance "have the freedom to  keep their children from attending," he said.  </P> <P> "I want to state categorically, lest we be misunderstood, that here at the  Moody Church everyone is welcome," he said at an afternoon press conference.  "We love Joey and we want him in our Sunday school and Joey will be in our  Sunday school."  </P> <P> A small group of protesters marched in the rain in front of the church as  Lutzer announced the new decision. They chanted slogans such as "Fight AIDS,  not people with AIDS" and carried signs that read: "Remember Ryan White."  </P> <P> Ryan White was the AIDS patient who was refused admission to his Indiana school  and whose subsequent fight against bigotry captured the heart of the nation. He  died of complications from AIDS April 8, which was about the time that Walt and  Terry Rucker were asked to stop bringing Joey to Sunday school.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased that they reversed themselves. . . . I don't feel any bitterness,"  Terry Rucker told the Associated Press. She said she had not decided whether to  return to the nondenominational evangelical church on Sunday. "I have made no  plans to go elsewhere," she said.  </P> <P> Lutzer said Friday that the decision to bar Joey had been made before Ryan  White's death brought about a resurgence in publicity over the issue.  </P> <P> After Joey had been brought to Sunday school several times, parents expressed  concern and the Ruckers were asked to stop bringing the boy temporarily while  the church developed a policy, Lutzer said. Joey, who was born with the  disease, was not barred from attending church services.  </P> <P> Lutzer said the decision to allow the child to attend Sunday school would shift  the burden of dealing with the issue away from the church and to the individual  parents.  </P> <P> He said that personally he would not have concerns about his child attending  Sunday school with Joey because "I do think that the preponderance of the  evidence is that (AIDS) cannot be communicated casually. So to me it would not  be as big as deal as it is to other people."  </P> <P> AIDS is spread by a virus transmitted mainly through sexual intercourse, shared  hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during  birth. Health officials have said there has been no evidence that it can spread  by casual contact.  </P> <P> Joey was the second person with AIDS that the Ruckers have taken into their  home. Lutzer on Friday praised the couple: "Walt and Terry Rucker represent the  type of Christian compassion and love that we would want to see . . . We could  only wish that there were more people in our congregation who would do the same  thing."  </P> <P> Grant Anderson, Christian education administrator at the church, said that the  church's executive committee still had not formally approved the decision to  allow AIDS-afflicted children to attend Sunday school. Before that vote is  taken, church officials will continue to review literature on AIDS and possibly  will meet with health experts.  </P></p>

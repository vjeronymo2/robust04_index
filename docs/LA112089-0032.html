			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY FORCES ABUSED THEM, 2 AMERICANS SAY;  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR: THE U.S. EMBASSY CASTS DOUBT ON THEIR STORIES BUT SAYS IT WILL  INVESTIGATE.  </P> <P> An American working for a leftist rights organization here says she was beaten,  kicked and "sexually harassed" during 53 hours of detention last week by  Salvadoran military police.  </P> <P> U.S. Embassy officials said Sunday that they were stunned by the charges, made  to reporters by Brenda Hubbard of Los Angeles, because they contradicted what  she told them after her release Friday. But they said they would investigate.  </P> <P> Hubbard, 41, was one of seven Americans arrested here last week during a  government crackdown on leftists, foreigners and religious workers thought to  be sympathetic with guerrillas waging a major military offensive in the  capital. U.S. Embassy officials said Friday that all have been released and  that none were physically mistreated.  </P> <P> But Hubbard and Eugene Terril, an American who was arrested with her, told a  press conference Saturday that they had been kicked and beaten with rifle butts  at the headquarters of the Treasury Police, a branch of the Salvadoran armed  forces.  </P> <P> Hubbard, who gave the more detailed account, said police officers also lifted  her shirt and thrust their hands into the pajama bottoms that she wore at the  time of her arrest and throughout her detention.  </P> <P> Both Hubbard and Terril were seized Wednesday morning at the headquarters of  Comadres, a group that compiles information on leftists and suspected  guerrillas arrested or killed by the security forces. Seven Salvadoran  activists were arrested with them.  </P> <P> Leaders of the group have employed American volunteers on the assumption that  this would afford them greater protection. Hubbard had worked for the  organization since moving here in August. Terril, 42, of Eatonville, Wash.,  arrived Nov. 8 to work in a Salvadoran orphanage. Both lived at Comadres  headquarters.  </P> <P> They said that police ransacked the Comadres office and forced their nine  captives to pose for a photograph with a flag of the FMLN, the guerrilla  alliance. Each was blindfolded, handcuffed and taken to police headquarters,  where Hubbard said she was repeatedly interrogated on the whereabouts of a  Salvadoran labor activist.  </P> <P> Hubbard said the beatings started as the group was forced to stand all day  Wednesday and intensified that night amid the sounds of heavy combat near the  headquarters.  </P> <P> "That's when they started beating on us a lot," she said. "That night they  didn't let me sleep. They kept coming into my cell and kicking me."  </P> <P> Terril said he got the same abuse but that "they treated us like fine china as  compared with what they did to the Salvadorans. That was probably the hardest  part. When they hit you, it was easier to take than hearing the Salvadorans  scream."  </P> <P> The two said the seven Salvadorans arrested with them are apparently still in  jail.  </P> <P> U.S. Ambassador William Walker on Friday compared the arrests of Americans,  including four Lutheran church relief workers, during the guerrilla offensive  to the internment of Japanese-Americans in the United States during World War  II.  </P> <P> "You have a situation here in which the government and armed forces have reason  to believe foreigners are helping the FMLN wreak its violence on the country,"  he said. "I'm not condoning it. I have not seen hard evidence . . . that  foreigners are in the trenches with the FMLN."  </P> <P> But embassy officials cast doubt on the two Americans' torture stories.  </P> <P> "They were interviewed by male and female consular officers, then brought to  the embassy to meet with the consul general," said Robert Dance, an embassy  spokesman. "At no time did any of them allege physical torture.  </P> <P> "We're stunned," he added. "If they had made this accusation to us, we could  have jumped on it at the time and made a stronger case (with the Salvadorans.)  But nothing was said."  </P></p>

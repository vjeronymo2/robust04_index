			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Alliance of Palestinian Forces in </F> Jordan in Amman on 27 February]    [Text] Masses of our Palestinian people, and of the Arab  and Islamic nation, the mosque martyrs and all the bereaved  Palestinians curse 'Arafat and his traitorous gang, wash their  hands from them, and appeal to the nation, its youth, men,  women, and children to rise up to bury the treason and the  traitors, and from the positions they occupy, to protect the  relatives, pursue the revolution, escalate the heroic intifadah,  mete double retaliation against the enemy, and terminate its  crimes against our relatives and nation. The revolution is our  guarantor and the struggle is the means with which to protect  our people and regain our rights.    The mosque massacre and all the enemy's massacres,  practises,  and policies explicitly prove it is impossible to coexist with  this enemy, and that our people's only option is that of the  revolution and struggle to defend our existence and rights.  These crimes exposed for the umpteenth time the wretchedness  and futility of the settlement course, and the suspect peace  calls. More than this, these crimes offer new evidence as to  the catastrophic dangers posed by this course and these venomous  calls not only to the security of the nation and the people but  to the personal safety of the defenseless citizen who is  prostrated in prayer in God's places of worship.    Masses of our Arab and Islamic nation, in wake of all this,  will the supporters of the negotiations and of what is falsely  termed peace repent, or do they relish telling lies, forging the  people's will, conceding rights, reneging the martyrs, tampering  with the nation's destiny under claims of rationalism and waging  a struggle on the negotiations table, and competing to submit to  the enemy under the excuse that there is no other alternative?  Faced with the enemy's massacres and its plan to destroy us,  can there be any other option than self-defense? Has treason  and the course of capitulation protected anyone, even those who  are performing prayers in God's places of worship?    We call on the nation's masses and the Palestinian people to  cling to the intifadah and armed struggle option, and to  escalate, protect, and support the intifadah in a manner that  would topple the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its symbols, led by  traitor 'Arafat.    Glory and immortality to the righteous martyrs of the  Ibrahimi Mosque, and of our intifadah and revolution. Greetings  to our people's heroic intifadah. Shame on the traitors and  agents. We pledge to pursue the struggle until the attainment  of all the our people's objectives of liberation and  repatriation. Victory for the revolution and immortality for  our martyrs.    The odious bloody massacre by rancorous Zionist gangs devoid  of human feeling, and thirsty for killing and destroying all  that is Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim is a crime against our  defenseless people and the groups of worshipers in the Ibrahimi  Mosque at dawn on 25 February 1994. It testfies once again to  the racist and sanguinary nature of this entity, and clearly  exposes its persistence to carry out the policy of killing,  persecuting, and destroying all that is Arab, Palestinian, and  Muslim. At the same time, this reprehensible crime highlights  the meaning, nature, and upshot of the Zionist-U.S. peace and  the role of the Oslo conspiracy and the treasonous Gaza-Jericho  agreement and its subsequent chapters.    Masses of our Arab and Islamic nation, Yes, this is the  accurate interpretation of the Zionist-U.S. peace. It consists  of daily massacres, of persecution and starvation, and of  destruction and eviction. While criminal Zionist Rabin and his  traitor partner 'Arafat sign with one hand the documents and  chapters of the conspiracy in Oslo, Washington, and Cairo, they  hurl with the other hand bombs and open fire on the defenseless  sons of our people in mosques, streets, and houses, emphasizing  that the peace that is sought is one of surrendering to the  Zionist butcher's knife, and defining the form of the peace they  want with the blood of our people and sons.    While the Zionists pursue their massacres against the  innocent and the defenseless, the traitors persist with their  betrayal of the people, the cause, and the martyrs, and continue  to submit to the enemy, thus confirming to it that its methods  are successful and encouraging it to pursue the policy of  destroying our people. They did not learn lessons from their  agreement with Philip Habib, when they opted for their safety  and left our people in Beirut as prey for the Zionist and  islolationist gangs, under Sharon. Our people at the time were  massacred in Sabra and Shatila. They also did not learn lessons  from Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, and al-Dawayimah, and from all the  massacres the Zionist gangs committed to expel our people and  force them to become refugees. They never learned the lesson  and led our people from one massacre to the other under the  mirage of settlements, lies, treason, and the falsification of  facts as they had forged the people's will. Now, they  impudently claim that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron  seeks to foil the so-called Gaza-Jericho agreement, although  Rabin and Peres have been announcing that they were negotiating  with themselves and that they got all that they wanted. This  means that the traitors threaten our people with more massacres  if they do not condone their treason.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> URBAN LEAGUE ASKS CAWTHORNE FOR BACK FUNDS;  </P> <P> CIVIC AFFAIRS: THE GROUP'S CHARISMATIC PRESIDENT ABRUPTLY QUIT LAST JUNE, AND  HIS LAWYER SAYS THE URBAN LEAGUE IS NOW SEEKING MONEY CAWTHORNE DOESN'T BELIEVE  IS OWED.  </P> <P> The San Diego Urban League is seeking to recover money from former President  Herb Cawthorne, who suddenly resigned amid unexplained circumstances in June.  The group may take legal action against him.  </P> <P> The organization has demanded about $13,000 from Cawthorne, now an executive  for the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, according to one source familiar  with Urban League affairs.  </P> <P> "I'll confirm that they've made a demand," said Robert Baxley, Cawthorne's  attorney. "They've asked for money, and we don't believe it's owed."  </P> <P> It is not clear when the Urban League demanded the money or how the request is  connected to the still-unexplained circumstances of Cawthorne's resignation  from the Urban League on June 7. Baxley refused further comment.  </P> <P> Urban League attorney Beatrice Kemp and the organization's chairwoman, Deborah  Brady-Davis, refused to confirm or deny any demand for a payment from  Cawthorne, as did numerous other board members contacted this week. Cawthorne,  now vice president of the Chamber's local government division, could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> But one source said the Urban League will soon decide whether it is financially  worthwhile to file a lawsuit against Cawthorne and whether legal action is the  right move for the reputation of an organization that seven years ago endured  charges of financial improprieties by another president, Clarence Pendleton.  </P> <P> Pendleton, who died of a heart attack in 1986, resigned his post in 1982 after  being ordered to rehire the former controller who claimed Pendleton had  misspent $94,000 of a federal grant.  </P> <P> The outspoken, charismatic Cawthorne, perhaps the city's most visible black  leader in nearly two years as head of the Urban League chapter, organized  well-publicized marches of mourning for the victims of drive-by shootings and,  just a week before his resignation, led a march through downtown with Mayor  Maureen O'Connor and Police Chief Bob Burgreen to demand more state assistance  in the city's anti-crime effort.  </P> <P> He was a leader of the bitter, unsuccessful effort to enact a City  Council-sponsored growth limitation measure in 1988, and this year is  co-chairman of a group sponsoring another ballot initiative on growth written  primarily by the building industry.  </P> <P> Cawthorne inherited a financially unstable organization when he took over in  August, 1987, and was credited with significantly boosting fund raising as well  as forging better ties to the downtown business establishment.  </P> <P> But he mysteriously resigned at a June 7 board meeting, reportedly under  pressure after an audit questioned his use of Urban League funds. Neither  Cawthorne nor the Urban League has ever publicly explained the reason for the  resignation.  </P></p>

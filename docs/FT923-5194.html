			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Haynes Publishing shows sharp advance to Pounds 2.37m HAYNES PUBLISHING Group, the Somerset-based printer of workshop manuals, staged a sharp recovery over the 12 months to May 31. Profits before tax amounted to Pounds 2.37m, against just Pounds 26,000 in the previous year, on turnover ahead at Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 19.2m). Mr John Haynes, chairman, said a 'solid' performance in North America had supported the group during the restructuring of its UK operation. Exceptional charges of Pounds 928,000 (Pounds 957,000) reflected the cost-cutting programme in the UK which saw the volume of titles fall by 45 per cent and 25 per cent of the workforce made redundant. The charge also included costs of writing off unearned royalty balances and production costs. Mr Haynes said the elimination of non-recurring costs helped the US businesses record a 58 per cent profits improvement in dollar terms. The US side ended the year in a cash positive position, he added. Overall borrowings were cut from Pounds 4m to Pounds 1.3m over the year, with gearing falling from 47 per cent to 14 per cent. Interest charges amounted to Pounds 396,000 (Pounds 566,000). Reflecting the recovery, earnings per share emerged at 14.5p(0.1p); a proposed final dividend of 3.5p brings the total for the year to 6p (2.5p).</p>

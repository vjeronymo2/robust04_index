			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Premier rises 11% despite tough year Premier, the South African food, retail and pharmaceutical retail group, reported an 11 per cent rise in attributable earnings to R259.1m (Dollars 72m) for the year to April. Trading profit rose 45 per cent to R634.7m from R438.9m and after-tax profit increased 33 per cent to R416.9m from R314.5m. Group turnover jumped to R14.4bn from R10.15bn, a gain of 42 per cent, but the figures are not directly comparable as several subsidiaries have been consolidated for the first time. A final dividend of 6.5 cents has been declared, bringing the total for the year to 10.5 cents, a rise of 12 per cent on last year's 9.4 cents. Mr Peter Wrighton, outgoing executive chairman, noted that the results had been achieved during one of the most difficult years in the group's history given the political and socio-economic turmoil in the run-up to April's national elections. He noted the food and retail sector had been under strain because of the poor trading environment. However, Mr Wrighton singled out the group's pharmaceutical interests, which had increased its share of turnover to R2.1bn, or 14 per cent on the year from R0.5bn, or 5 per cent, for a 'magnificent' performance. Mr Wrighton said negotiations were under way with several international groups on ties and he expected a deal to be reached with one or more of them 'within the year'. He expressed confidence in Premier's future, noting that the company was well placed to take advantage of the new government's planned reconstruction and development programme. Mr Wrighton will step down at the end of the year. His replacement as chairman will be Mr Doug Band, formerly chairman of Argus group. Mr Gordon Utian, the deputy managing director, has been promoted to managing director.</p>

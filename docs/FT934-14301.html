			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Molyneaux says Hume-Adams initiative 'lunacy' MR JAMES MOLYNEAUX, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said yesterday that if the IRA ends its military campaign, a 'quarantine' period of 'years rather than months' would be necessary before the party would sit at the same table as Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. Speaking in a BBC interview he described as 'sheer lunacy' the Hume-Adams peace initiative, which he said has the objective of bringing about a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland within 25 to 30 years. Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, who together with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, launched the peace initiative three weeks ago, said that Mr Molyneaux had missed the point of the initiative. He said its aim was 'a total cessation of all violence . . . Mr Adams and I have not agreed a plan to impose upon anyone. It is a peace process which will involve both governments and all parties . . . we have no specific proposals for a solution.' Divisions over the peace initiative emerged within the UUP at its party conference in Craigavon at the weekend. The most contentious question was whether there should be talks with the government of the Irish Republic, which is supporting the initiative. Mr Ken Maginnis, the deputy party leader, said: 'It is important that the unionist position is very clearly articulated. If Dick Spring (the Irish foreign minister) is willing to hear that, we are willing to give it to him at first hand.' Last week the Irish Foreign Ministry said it has extended invitations to unionist leaders for discussions and was 'very much looking forward to a meeting'. But Mr Molyneaux said yesterday: 'It is not the appropriate time for face-to-face meetings with Dublin.' He said that for now he preferred 'quiet communications' through documents and letters, and confirmed that 'updates on our posi-tion' have been forwarded to Dublin.</p>

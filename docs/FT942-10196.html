			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / New terms for Ekostahl deal Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel company, will not buy eastern Germany's largest steel mill under the terms of the current contract, the Treuhand privatisation agency indicated yesterday. After failing yesterday to broker an agreement between Riva and IG Metall, the engineering union, the Treuhand, desperate to keep Riva on board, agreed with the Italian company to start drawing up a completely new contract, although any successful outcome cannot be guaranteed. In a move which could now jeopardise the entire future of Ekostahl, Riva wants to buy only the assets of the company, instead of its original intention to create a joint stock/share company. The disagreement between Riva and IG Metall had focused on how the workforce would be reduced by 700 to 2,300 by the end of this year, what would happen to the small companies which had been hived off from Ekostahl, but are still dependent on the mill for orders, and the composition of the supervisory board.</p>

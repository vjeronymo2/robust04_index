			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE TAX ON ALCOHOL  </P> <P> What "Stiff 'Nickel-a-Drink' Tax on Alcohol Proposed by Coalition" (Part A,  Nov. 10) neglected to point out were the measly amounts of yearly revenue to  California our decades-old booze taxes provide. In 1988-89, wine brought in  $922,000! Its 52-year-old tax -- the nation's lowest -- has been frozen at 1  penny per gallon!  </P> <P> Beer brought in $26,835,000 but, beer alone comprises a whopping 81% of all  booze gallons bought statewide. That is why the booze merchants' own, proposed  rival ballot initiative for November, 1990, which would up our beer tax from 4  pennies to 20 cents per gallon, is an insult to the voter's intelligence.  </P> <P> Can you just imagine what will happen to trauma and emergency care when "the  Big One" comes and local government was denied the yearly 25% (a modest $200  million) from the health and safety coalition's alcohol-tax statewide  initiative for November, 1990? It's high time the thinking taxpayer saw the  bottom line after reading Gov. George Deukmejian's lips.  </P> <P> No new taxes are needed -- only a reasonable surtax readjustment for inflation  and health and safety's sake from hitherto untouchable taxes on our most common  drug of violence. After all, barely 14% of the drinkers drink 74% of the booze.  Let the heavy user beware!  </P> <P> RAY CHAVIRA  </P> <P> Availability Committee Chairman  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P> <P> Alcohol Policy Coalition  </P></p>

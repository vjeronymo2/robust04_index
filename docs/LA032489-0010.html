			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A South Korean firm has seized the president of a Japanese machinery company  for the second time in four months in a business dispute, and his whereabouts  are unknown, his company said in Tokyo. Koji Kohno of the Japanese company  Osawa Press Seisakusho said the firm has received demands from Namil Machine  Co. in South Korea for $3.8 million. He said recent messages declared that  Osawa Press President Tokuo Osawa had been beaten and that one of his fingers  would be cut off and sent to back up demands for payment. The messages also  threatened Osawa's family, Kohno said. The dispute stems from six press  machines Osawa sold to the South Korean firm last year that Namil says are  defective. Osawa went to South Korea to offer technical assistance.  </P></p>

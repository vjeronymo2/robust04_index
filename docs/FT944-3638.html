			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Hopes fade on Wall St for year-end rally - New York Hopes for a year-end rally are fading on Wall Street as bad news seems to overtake the market every time it tries to edge up. With little economic news out last week, the market tumbled on Thursday and held flat on Friday amid uncertainty about the implications of the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history. Worries surrounding Orange County, California's financial troubles may be overtaken this week by fundamental economic data. Investors will take close note of the consumer price index for November to be released on Wednesday. Although most data shows rising raw materials prices, such increases have yet to pass through to consumer levels. So far this year the CPI has held relatively steady at an average of 0.2 per cent a month. Economists are once again predicting the CPI figure will show an increase and many remain puzzled that it has remained so low. Mr Bill Sharp, an economist at securities firm Smith Barney, foresees an increase to 0.3 in November's figure. But he is quick to concede that his firm has predicted an increase in the CPI figures since September, although it stayed even in that month and declined in October. Private sector economists are not alone in their belief that inflationary pressures will ultimately work their way into consumer prices. Last week Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the same to Congress's joint economic committee. In that testimony, Mr Greenspan implied that the Fed was not averse to further monetary tightening to keep inflationary expectations under control. Most economists now believe there will be another rate increase by early next year, and few rule out the possibility that the Fed could move after the December 20 meeting of its open market committee. In addition to the CPI data, the Fed and the market will take cues from figures on November producer prices and capacity utilisation due out Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Although producer prices showed a decline in October, economists believe the figures will pick up again for November on the assumption that car and truck sales - which fell in October, dragging down the overall index - will have increased for November. Perhaps more telling will be the capacity utilisation figures. Economists at Chemical Securities, a unit of Chemical Banking, predict the data will show 85 per cent of the economy's capacity being used for the production of goods, the highest level since 1979. There is no way to judge how the market would react to such news. In recent weeks it has alternately risen and fallen amid signs of inflationary pressures.</p>

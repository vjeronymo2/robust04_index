			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 20 Apr (EFE) -- In a new chapter in the  political clash between Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and  Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont, the municipality of Lima today  declared the Peruvian president a "persona non grata."    The municipal council approved the declaration by a 30-5  vote, with five abstentions.    In its whereas clauses, the declaration points out that  "citizen Alberto Fujimori" has damaged Lima by approving a law  reducing municipal income by 40 percent, and claims that the  president has refused to talk with the Lima mayor, instead  meeting with imprisoned terrorist leaders.    The declaration thus hints at Fujimori's meeting with  terrorist leader Osman Morote last week while inspecting the  Yanamayo top security prison in Puno Department, on the Bolivian  border.    The document declares "citizen Alberto Fujimori" to be a  "persona non grata" in order to distinguish his position as  president of the Republic, which according to the Peruvian  Constitution "represents a symbol of the nation."    The hassle between Belmont and Fujimori began three months  ago, when the government decided to redistribute the national  municipal promotion tax in a more equitable manner in order to  allocate more funds to the poorest municipalities.    This measure, however, involved a reduction in the funds  allocated to the Lima municipality, which was also interpreted  as a political maneuver aimed at preventing Belmont from  becoming a possible presidential candidate in the 1995 general  elections.    From the moment the measure was implemented, the Lima mayor  has been openly and totally opposing the government, while  Fujimori has been refusing to meet him as he feels the mayor  must reorganize his tax administration to secure more funds.</p>

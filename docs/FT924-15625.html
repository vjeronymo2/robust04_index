			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Big drop in house prices blamed on Pounds crisis HOUSE prices staged their biggest monthly fall for almost a year in September, according to Nationwide, Britain's biggest building society. It blamed the sterling crisis and the ending of stamp duty concessions in August for the decline. Average prices fell by 1.4 per cent in September compared with the previous month, Nationwide said. The previous biggest monthly fall was 2.4 per cent last October. It was the fourth month in succession that prices had fallen, the society said. The rate of decline, however, had reduced over the summer and prices appeared to be stabilising. According to Nationwide, on average house prices have fallen by more than 6 per cent in the past 12 months. In parts of southern England prices have fallen by more than 30 per cent since 1988-89. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst for UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said that even taking into account special factors, last month's fall was deeply disappointing. 'Every time prices decline people stay out of the market believing that prices may fall further. The more they stay out, the more likely it is that prices will fall,' he said. Mr John Hutchinson, Nationwide's corporate strategy director, said the turmoil in currency and interest rate markets meant that September was not a good guide to longer term price trends. The ending of the stamp duty holiday on August 19 for houses costing less than Pounds 250,000 meant that many people had brought purchases forward, 'leaving a vacuum in September'. The response of potential housebuyers has been mixed in the two weeks since Britain announced sterling's suspension within the ERM, say estate agents. Mr David Goodchild, associate director of Aitchisons estate agents in south Hertfordshire, said: 'In Watford and Berkhamstead there has been a sharp increase in people wanting to view properties. In Hemel Hempstead and St Albans, close to Hatfield where British Aerospace has just announced 3,000 redundancies, the market remains as depressed as ever.' Wreaking havoc, Page 9</p>

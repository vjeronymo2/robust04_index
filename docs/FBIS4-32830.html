			<p>BFN     [Text] Hector Rosada Granados, president of the Guatemalan  Government's Peace Commission, said on 25 May that the outcome  of the recently concluded round of negotiations cannot be called  negative, and that if an agreement was not reached or signed, it  is only because the topic is a very complex one.    In a statement made at La Aurora International Airport upon  his return from Mexico City, Rosada explained that the parties  believed it was necessary to discuss the topic further, because  it involves a situation that must be analyzed thoroughly.    Rosada added that the discussion of the topic will conclude  the week of 30 May since the parties have agreed to meet again  for two more days. The dates and location have not been  disclosed since they are still awaiting the summoning of UN  Moderator Jean Arnault.    As for the reason the negotiation was stalled, Rosada  refused  to comment because since the talks are not over he could not  make a public statement in this regard. However, Rosada did not  deny that the reason for the delay in the talks might be linked  to the Army high command stating that they plan to have command  posts in the region of Ixcan, Quiche.    Regarding an increase in military activity by the Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity, Rosada indicated that it  contradicts the goal of negotiating a peace agreement. Rosada  noted that it is not logical to sit at a negotiation table while  engaging in violent actions.    This belligerent conduct will compel the state to take  similar actions to counter the aggression. Any such actions by  the government will be justifiable and impending because it is  part of the government's constitutional mandate, Rosada  concluded.</p>

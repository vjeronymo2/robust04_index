			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Stephan Huber, who lives in Munich, mingles hints of Bavaria's history of  decorative arts and crafts with a wary take on post-industrial culture in his  large-scale sculpture. Highly finished in a fashion that evokes high-tech  luxury consumer goods and overtly presentational in ways that recall Baroque  art, this work nevertheless has a deadpan, close-to-the vest quality.  </P> <P> In "Gloria," an elaborate aluminum support holds the large silk-screened image  of a forbiddingly massive piece of equipment. It sits idle in a vaulted factory  space that looks like a cathedral. The artist seems to be arguing that  industrialism is as powerful -- but ultimately as useless -- a force in human  life as religion. Both have had great edifices built to their glory, but  neither has solved the basic problems of mankind.  </P> <P> "Kathedrale" offers double images of a highway superstructure, inserted into  twin billboardlike aluminum structures. The billboard may be the altarpiece of  the modern age, but it offers an unsatisfying and false salvation.  </P> <P> In several pieces, pool table imagery conveys a metaphor for the fragility of  life. In "Perfektes Spiel" (Perfect Game), 10 glossy green balls are frozen in  random alignment within a sleek metal box lined with green felt that hangs on  the wall, a set of rectangular metal "fingers" tilting it toward the viewer.  The game is up, and the devil may well be winning.  </P> <P> The presence of an Observing Force -- maybe God, maybe Big Brother -- is  nowhere as marked as in "Festung" (Fortress). The image of a huge pair of eyes  is visible within a rectangular slot in a veneered wood block attached to a  heavy-duty aluminum bar. If an American viewer's thoughts run irrelevantly to  the oculist's billboard that serves as a prominent image in F. Scott  Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," the symbolism is similarly troubled.  </P> <P> Still other works resemble compact monuments to nothing in particular. "Testa  Rosa" is a red lacquered, purified pagoda shape mounted on casters as if to  mock the very notion of permanent placement in an uncertain world. The stress  on finish here -- as everywhere else -- also suggests the difference between  useful and useless work, and the relative worth of impersonal machine-made  finish versus the patient employment of laborers' hands.  </P> <P> Arresting in a cold, glossy way, Huber's big toys are ultimately about  consumerism as the opiate of the people. But unlike much similarly themed work  by contemporary Americans, these pieces seem firmly anchored by a long view of  history and a searching, almost Ingmar Bergmanesque dialogue with God and the  Devil.

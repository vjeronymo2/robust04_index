			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Milan Initial dealings in Telecom Italia are expected to begin on Thursday. This is the successor company to Sip, Italcable, Telespazio, Iritel and SIRM, in the final phase of the restructuring of the Italian telecoms sector. Sip shareholders get a one-for-one share exchange, but Mr Evan Miller at Lehman Brothers says the creation of Telecom Italia will immediately enhance earnings per share prospects. Telecom Italia will be the world's sixth largest telecommunications company, with a turnover of L27,000bn and net profit of L1,025bn in 1993.</p>

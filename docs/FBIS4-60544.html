			<p>BFN     [Text] Our correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that  following a decision by Major General Ilan Biran, the commander  of the Central Command, from 1700 [1400 GMT] Palestinian traffic  will once again be permitted to enter and leave Jericho. In the  meantime, Israeli traffic will be permitted only along Route 90,  which cuts through Jericho, and no diversions will be allowed.</p>

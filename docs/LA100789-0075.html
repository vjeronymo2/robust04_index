			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> A.J. Foyt, who escaped serious injury in a crash earlier this week in  Charlotte, N.C., said he doesn't remember the stock-car accident that knocked  him unconscious.  </P> <P> Foyt was released from Charlotte Memorial Hospital Friday and immediately left  for his home in Houston.  </P> <P> Before leaving, however, he said, "It's the first time I've had an accident  where I don't remember what happened. . . . Whatever I hit, I hit real hard. I  feel pretty rough right now, and my neck is pretty sore. It's all swollen up  and bruised on the right side. I know it does hurt."  </P></p>

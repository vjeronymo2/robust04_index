			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Observer: Call me Bill President Jimmy Carter didn't suddenly become James E Carter when he stepped into the White House. So what are we to make of Bill Clinton's decision to start signing his name as William J Clinton now that he's commander-in-chief? Admittedly, he's not the first to brandish his middle initial. James K Polk started the trend in 1845, and although it has tended to be a rather pompous Republican habit, there have been some well known initialled Democrats such as Franklin D Roosevelt and John F Kennedy. The difference this time is that Clinton appears to feel that now he is president he needs a more dignified name for signing treaties and such. On the other hand he still wants to be known as Bill Clinton. All very confusing. Perhaps WJC will soon trip off the tongue like FDR, JFK and LBJ. At least he didn't resort to lumping in his original surname, Blythe. That would have given him the shortened monniker of WJBC, sounding like some local radio station's call-sign.</p>

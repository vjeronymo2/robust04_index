			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sale by BCH raises Pta55bn Banco Central Hispano (BCH), the large Spanish bank which has been squeezed by narrowed financial margins, has raised Pta55bn (Dollars 423m) through the sale of an 18 per cent stake in Cepsa, the domestic petrol refiner and distributor. BCH did not name the buyer but it is understood to be SMM Company, an international fund managed by Morgan Grenfell. BCH said the proceeds from the disposal would be injected into its core banking business and would help to increase its net interest income. The disposal reduces BCH's holding in Cepsa by half to 18 per cent but under the terms of the sale, it retains the full voting rights of its former 36 per cent holding. Cepsa's other main shareholders are the French Elf-Aquitaine group, with 33 per cent, and IPIC of Abu Dhabi, with 10 per cent. The sale forms part of the bank's strategic plan to slim its industrial portfolio to release funds that will underpin its flagging profit margins. Although BCH has the largest volume of total assets in the domestic banking sector, and also the largest branch network, its return on assets is well below that rival groups. The bank's net interest income shrunk by 4.8 per cent last year, although operating profit was up by 11.8 per cent due, in part, to mostly non-recurring foreign exchange and debt trading income. BCH is steeling itself for a sharp drop in treasury-based profits this year and posted disappointing first-quarter results with an 11.8 per cent fall in net attributable profit . BCH, which was advised by J. P. Morgan of the US in its Cepsa disposal, earned Pta3,425 per share for its equity in the refiner, a price that was considered good for the bank by analysts.</p>

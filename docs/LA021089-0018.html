			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK IN THE SMOG  </P> <P> The picture with the article "Smog-Ridden Burbank to Study How to Cut Car Use"  by Greg Braxton (Jan. 12) speaks for the smog-saturated downtown Burbank. Here  we see, in one picture, four RTD smog-producing buses. The city of Burbank  should now realize that light-rail vehicles are long overdue.  </P> <P> It is virtually impossible to "cut the number of single-car trips," as the city  fathers suggest. The only way to cut emissions feeding smog is to go with  cleaner energy, and that includes reducing the bus fleet and replacing heavily  traveled lines with light rail.  </P> <P> All the money that has been used just in rail studies could have provided the  whole Los Angeles mega-opolis with a super-transit system to the benefit of  all.  </P> <P> MORLEY J.

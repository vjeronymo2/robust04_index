			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DISAPPOINTED AT CSUN CUTBACKS  </P> <P> I was very disappointed to learn that Cal State Northridge is cutting back on  the number of applicants accepted to their business program for the school year  of 1989-90.  </P> <P> While this action may eventually ease the problem of over-enrollment, it does  not help students acquire the impacted classes needed for graduation. CSUN  should be offering more classes, especially those currently impacted.  </P> <P> I hope CSUN finds a solution to solve their problem of impacted classes, for it  is dearly needed, particularly by those students transferring from two-year  colleges such as Moorpark College.  </P> <P> LAURENCE BENNETT  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

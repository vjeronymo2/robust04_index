			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> IRVINE FALLS TO DANA HILLS BUT GETS PLAYOFF BERTH  </P> <P> Bob Flint, Irvine High School's baseball coach, predicted four days ago that  his team would miss the Southern Section playoffs by splitting a two-game  series with Dana Hills.  </P> <P> Irvine, Dana Hills and Mission Viejo went into the week contending for third  place and the final playoff berth in the South Coast League. Flint thought  Mission Viejo would sweep last-place San Clemente and get the final berth.  </P> <P> Flint was almost right. Dana Hills shut out Irvine, 2-0, behind the two-hit  pitching of Albie Sukut Thursday, getting a split with Irvine. Mission Viejo  shut out San Clemente, 2-0, to earn the sweep Flint had predicted.  </P> <P> But Flint failed to foresee Capistrano Valley's collapse. Capistrano Valley  lost to league-leading El Toro, 4-1, dropping its third game in its last four  outings and fading from the playoff picture.  </P> <P> The unpredictable outcome meant that Mission Viejo (11-11-2 overall, 8-6-1 in  league) was second while Irvine (13-13, 8-7) finished tied for third with Dana  Hills (14-10-1, 8-7). Irvine earned the final playoff berth by winning two of  three games against Dana Hills this season.  </P> <P> Dana Hills was eliminated Tuesday from the playoffs and hoped to return the  favor two days later. Sukut (2-0) retired 14 of the last 15 batters he faced.  </P> <P> Sukut, making his second start of the season, allowed only a triple to Irvine  designated hitter Bobby Garcia in the second and a single by leadoff batter  Mark Huffman in the third.  </P> <P> "Albie broke his collarbone and has only pitched in three games this season,"  said Dana Hills Coach Bob Canary. "I thought he pitched an outstanding game."  </P> <P> Dana Hills catcher Lance Marks failed in his bid to establish an Orange County  career home run record, going hitless in four at-bats.  </P> <P> Marks walked twice, struck out and flied out deep to left field, finishing his  three-year career with 22 home runs. Marks is tied with Valencia's Andy  Ruscitto, who set the county mark from 1984-86.  </P> <P> Leadoff batter Mike Robertson scored both of Dana Hills' runs and had four  consecutive hits. He singled and scored on a double by designated hitter Ryan  O'Leary in the third and singled, stole second and scored on a single by Sukut  in the seventh.  </P> <P> In other South Coast League games:  </P> <P> El Toro 4, Capistrano Valley 1 -- Pitcher Rob Johnson (8-1) scattered seven  hits as El Toro (20-6, 12-3) won 20 games in the regular season for the first  time in school history. Left fielder Tim Powers had two hits and leadoff batter  Chris Sauritch hit a homer for El Toro.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo 12, San Clemente 3 -- Mike Boucher hit a home run and drove in  two runs and Greg Parsons (3-3) earned the win by pitching six innings.  </P></p>

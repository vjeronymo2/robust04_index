			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "BOC Supports Satellite Launch With Export </F> Credit"]    [Text] The Bank of China (BOC) yesterday fueled China's  satellite launching industry by supplying seller credit to a  large exporter.    The loan to China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC)  represents the largest export credit ever issued by the bank,  one of its officials said.    Although he declined to reveal the total, the amount exceeds  the 660 million yuan ($75 million) credit made earlier to China  Machinery Equipment Import and Export Corporation.    The official said the credit this time is intended to help  the corporation launch satellites for overseas clients.    CGWIC is the country's only business organization with the  exclusive government authorization to provide commercial launch  services to foreign customers and handle international  cooperation in space technology.    By the end of last year, the corporation had performed seven  launch and piggy-back missions for foreign customers.    China's space officials announced earlier this year that the  country will launch a total of 30 satellites for overseas  clients before the year 2000.    A series of launch contracts is being honoured while more  are  being negotiated.    "The booming satellite-launch business needs more capital  support from the bank," said an official with the corporation.    The Bank of China is the country's first financial  institution to supply export credits. Its first such loan was  issued in 1980.    As the country's major foreign exchange bank, the Bank of  China has been paying great attention to supporting its export  of capital products.    The bank official said his bank has concentrated capital to  support the country's export of ships, aircraft, automobiles,  equipment, and high-tech products.    The bank so far has supplied 13 billion yuan ($1.5 billion)  in export credits to more than 300 projects, which have earned  more than $6 billion in foreign exchange.    Meanwhile, the bank has signed five export import credits  involving $160 million.</p>

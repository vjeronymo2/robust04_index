			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy </F> following his visit to Rwandan border areas in Burundi and  Tanzania by Claire Chazal in Paris -- live]    [Excerpts] [Chazal] Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy  has just returned from the refugee camps in the Rwandan border  area [passage omitted]. Mr. Douste-Blazy, you're just back from  the region; you came back just an hour ago. Can you give us the  latest on the situation -- how many injured, how many refugees?    [Douste-Blazy] I would like to say first of all: Stop the  massacre -- and especially let us prevent the massacres of  tomorrow. It is both terrifying and terrible. It is terrible,  because it is, I think, the greatest genocide of the end of the  20th century: Between 200,000 and 500,000 people have been  killed in two months; there are 2 million refugees. It is  terrifying because it is a genocide. We are dealing with  genocide: Not just the adults, but children are being killed.  This morning, before I left, I heard a radio station in Rwanda  saying: Let's not repeat the mistakes of 1959; let's not spare  the children, let's kill them.    This is absolute horror. From a humanitarian point of view,  it creates enormous problems. We have hundreds of thousands of  refugees coming to Tanzania, to Burundi, to Zaire. The Ngara  refugee camp [in Tanzania] where I was yesterday has some  250,000 people. It is the largest refugee camp ever seen, with  the attendant danger of epidemics. [passage omitted]. There is  a lack of drinking water. We brought two large water purifying  plants, which can process 125 cubic meters an hour, to save  these people. The children are suffering from malnutrition, so  we brought lots of energy bars, providing 2,000 calories a day.  If we don't do something there will be a horrific carnage.  [passage omitted]    [Chazal] Talking about the problem is one thing. What can we  do to help the humanitarian organizations on the ground, and  what can the UN force do?    [Douste-Blazy] On the humanitarian level, thanks to the  Development Ministry and to Development Minister Michel Roussin,  we have provided 200 tonnes of aid per air lift, and 300 more  tonnes are on their way. We really have to support Doctors  Without Borders, Doctors of the World, and International Action  Against Hunger who are doing an incredible job.    On the political level, there has of course been the UN  resolution. [Foreign Minister Alain] Juppe was one of the first  to call for this resolution. We have to send 5,000 men, but  those men will encounter an absolutely apocalyptic situation.    [Chazal] Will they be able to get to Rwanda in the first  place?    [Douste-Blazy] They will, but I would like them, instead of  being a buffer force, to be in the country in such a way as to  prevent the massacres being committed by the militias.    [Chazal] Their mission for now is purely humanitarian.    [Douste-Blazy] Yes, but one can wonder what an unarmed  soldier can do in a country like Rwanda. I think that before  the spark becomes a fire, we have to anticipate developments. I  want to send out a warning about neighboring Burundi. The same  ingredients are all in place: There are Hutus and Tutsis,  hundreds of thousands of refugees will arrive in the north of  the country, and are threatening to destabilize the precarious  balance there. Our role is also to prevent tomorrow's massacres.    I would also like to raise another question. UN observers  are present. We know that there are countries neighboring  Rwanda which are supplying arms. The Kalashnikovs are coming  from somewhere. I think the observers have to tell us where the  arms are coming from and when.    On Tuesday [24 May], the UN Commission for Human Rights will  be meeting in Geneva. This is [UN High Commissioner for Human  Rights] Mr. Ayala Lasso's first mission, and I think that we  have to bang our fist on the table, because crimes against  humanity are being committed in Rwanda. It is absolutely  horrible, the international community has to say this aloud.    [Chazal] Is France prepared to send troops to support the UN  force in Rwanda?    [Douste-Blazy] Yes, the prime minister has decided that  France should be present. France is very active in the  humanitarian field. France will of course be present with UN  forces.    I would, however, like to say -- of course we have to go to  Rwanda, we have taken anesthesiologists, emergency doctors,  surgeons, we have to act in the humanitarian field -- but we  must also prevent disasters in the political field, in  particular in Burundi. This is my point of view.    [Chazal] We have the feeling that we could fall in a  Bosnia-like trap, where the UN found itself almost impotent.    [Douste-Blazy] Absolutely. I think that the best thing for  the UN is to arrive at the moment when they are accepted by both  sides, and this is a way for the UN not to have to fight. The  UN is there then -- but if we already have a fire here, an  apocalyptic horror, then how can we ask the sides to respect  each other if we go in without guns.    I think that today we are seeing the limits of the UN. For  Rwanda, from a humanitarian point of view, these 5,500 men must  arrive immediately to prevent further massacres, but they must  especially go to the neighbors, to Zaire, Burundi, of course,  and Tanzania. Otherwise, I think we will be seeing similar  massacres there in a few months.    [Chazal] Thank you very much Mr. Douste-Blazy for giving us  your impressions so soon after returning from Rwanda.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOFFMAN REPORTED OUT AT CHAMINADE  </P> <P> Dave Hoffman has quit as Chaminade High's basketball coach just two months  after he accepted the job at the West Hills school, a source close to the team  said.  </P> <P> Rob Kurowski, an assistant in the program for three years, has served as  interim coach since Hoffman quit two weeks ago, the source added.  </P> <P> Chaminade Athletic Director Bernie Kyman was unavailable for comment and  Hoffman declined comment.  </P> <P> Hoffman, 34, was hired in May by his predecessor, Mike Lynn. Chaminade compiled  a 134-87 record in 11 seasons under Lynn, who has left the school and will move  his family to the Sacramento area.  </P> <P> Hoffman had served as Lynn's assistant and junior varsity coach for four  seasons until he took the varsity job at St. Genevieve in 1987. After a 12-10  season with the Valiants, Hoffman moved to Calabasas High and compiled a 22-24  record in two seasons.  </P> <P> At Chaminade, he led the junior varsity to three league titles in four years,  including a 21-1 mark in his last season. Lynn predicted a bright future for  Hoffman when he hired him in May.  </P> <P> "He's potentially one of the best coaches in the Valley," Lynn said at the  time. "I think he'll take Chaminade a step higher."  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hits new high as hopes rise for package Wall Street BLUE CHIP stocks climbed to new heights yesterday as hopes rose that President Bill Clinton's tax-raising deficit-reduction package would be approved by the House of Representatives, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.67 higher at 3,554.83, another record close. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, ended 1.03 off at 452.41. The American SE composite gained 1.80 at 438.93 and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.50 at 704.59. New York SE volume came to 301m shares. The markets picked up where they had left off on Wednesday, when heavy late buying lifted the Dow to its second record finish in a week. Analysts had anticipated fresh early gains, primarily because stocks traditionally do well in the days leading up to a long weekend. On Monday the markets will be shut for the Memorial Day holiday. Attention was firmly focused on Capitol Hill, where the House was due to vote on the Clinton economic package last night. Although investors are not particularly keen on Mr Clinton's plan to raise taxes, they fear that a defeat in the House would be a severe setback for his presidency. Moreover, the markets, especially the bond market, are generally supportive of the package as it appears to be the first meaningful attempt by a US government to reduce the huge budget deficit. Chevron jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 88 5/8 on news that the oil group planned to reduce the size of its businesses through a restructuring programme which will include the sale of some refineries and cutbacks in retail fuel sales operations. The restructuring will require a Dollars 550m second quarter charge. Morgan Stanley climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 66 after the securities house unveiled a 40 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits, and announced that it had found a buyer for Sweetheart, the disposable food service product manufacturer. The deal will allow Morgan Stanley to eliminate its costly bridge loan to Sweetheart. Student Loan Marketing, which has been hit recently by speculation surrounding the administration's plans to shake up financing for students in higher education, fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 45 in busy trading after broking house Smith Barney lowered its rating on the stock. Canada TORONTO again displayed a firmer tendency after a substantial day's business. The TSE 300 index ended 4.5 up at 3,869.7 and rises led declines by 415 to 298 after volume of 67.9m shares. Golds rose 2.3 per cent as the New York spot gold price gained USDollars 5.75 an ounce. Northern Telecom tumbled CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 45 3/4 on rumours that Goldman Sachs had downgraded the company. Seagram slipped CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 37 1/8 in brisk trade after the Dominion Bond Rating Service said it was placing the firm's debentures and commercial paper under review and Moody's said it may cut ratings on its senior debt. Earlier this week Seagram bought 2.1m Time Warner shares.</p>

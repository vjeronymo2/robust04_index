			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria April 21 SAPA -- The Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] said on Thursday  [21 April] it had initiated a strategy to secure the Transvaal  and Orange Free State as a base against a future communist  government. According to a statement by the AWB's General Staff  "thousands of members of the AWB are already busy moving into  the area".    This was to ensure sufficient manpower was mustered to ward  off any persecution or action against right-wingers by a future  communist government.    The generals warned that the "so-called peace" which had  been  found between the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the African  National Congress would not last. "The fact that the IFP has  now been drawn into the elections will definitely be an  opportunity for conflict and confrontation between the ANC and  the whole Zulu nation," the statement said.    The Zulu population, as the biggest single group in the  country, would never accept the outcome of the elections when  the ANC obtained the majority of votes. "The war between the  IFP and the ANC will then intensify. South Africa will be  plunged into a bloodbath."    The AWB declared that under no circumstances would it be  part  of the elections. It still regarded the April 26-28 poll as  illegal and it therefore had no confidence in the future  government. "The General Staff and the Executive Council have  therefore decided to protect members of the organisation and the  Boervolk [Boer nation] against the chaos, uprising and  revolution which will follow," said the statement.    It defined the territory which it had declared as its "base,  secure territory" as stretching from "Northern Transvaal to the  Cape border." Thousands of AWB members were already busy moving  into the area to ensure that sufficient manpower was mustered  against a communist threat.    Right-wing sources confirmed they were aware of AWB  mobilisation plans, with most activity centred on the Western  Transvaal.    Neither AWB leader Eugene Terre'blanche nor Gen Nico  Prinsloo, normally the only people authorised to speak to the  press from their Ventersdorp headquarters, were available for  comment on Thursday afternoon.    Their Johannesburg-based spokesman, Fred Rundle, was not  available.</p>

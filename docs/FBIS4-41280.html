However, Azerbaijan's military forces fired on the Armenian  defense positions with various types of arms from time to time.  The Armenian side refrained from returning the fire.    No serious incidents occurred on the border between Armenia  and Azerbaijan during the past day. The situation is relatively  peaceful. However, it is difficult to predict how long the  peaceful situation will continue. Everything depends on  Azerbaijan.

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Traders confused by new Italian tax arrangements THE arrangements for the Italian government's abolition of withholding tax exemption for Eurobonds issued by supranational institutions, announced as part of Wednesday's economic package, remained unclear yesterday, creating some confusion in secondary market trading of Eurobonds issued by the World Bank and European Investment Bank. Until now, Italian residents holding Eurobonds issued by agencies of which Italy is a member have not paid withholding tax. The decree will be published today. Dealers hope the following areas of uncertainty will be clarified: The Italian authorities specified that the loss of tax-exempt status would not apply to holders of existing bonds, but it was not specified whether tax-exempt status is lost once bonds are traded in the secondary market. However, sources close to the Italian Treasury said yesterday that the tax-exemption would continue to apply to all issues launched prior to the tax change, even if they changed hands. While the original wording of the tax changes suggested that the loss of exemption would apply only to supranational agencies - the World Bank, the EIB, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Agency - it appears possible that the wording of the decree will include Italy, and some Italian-backed agencies such as Ferrovie, which benefit from tax-exempt status. In the domestic market, these borrowers are subject to 12 1/2 per cent withholding tax, so such a change would appear logical. The effect on the active repo (repurchase agreement) market in World Bank and EIB Eurobonds is unclear. Banks and investors outside Italy have been able, through the repo market, to benefit from the tax-break for Italian investors. For example, a London-based bank sells a World Bank Eurobond to an Italian investor at 99, and agrees to buy it back at 98, the lower price representing the repo rate. Until now, the loss has been deductible as a business expense for Italian investors, but this tax break could also be changed in the decree. In this case, the Italian tax exempt repo market would be hurt by the disappearance of both the benefits of tax exempt status, and the tax deductible loss. A slight rally in prices in EIB and World Bank issues yesterday reflected expectations that the tax change would not be backdated. However, volume was thin, as few traders felt inclined to deal ahead of publication.</p>

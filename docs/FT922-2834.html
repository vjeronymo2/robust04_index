			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / UK Gilts: Prices slide on convergence worries WORRIES about the long-term pattern of economic convergence across Europe conspired with concern about the volume of gilt supply to push down prices, especially at the long end of the yield curve. These potential sources of turbulence for the market overshadowed a run of good news on inflation, which indicated that pressures pushing up prices of UK goods and services over the next year will be extremely small. Investors are concerned that the progress made in the past year in bringing gilt yields closer to those for German and French government bonds may soon grind to a halt, as a result of doubts about whether European economic and monetary union will take place as planned. At the same time, the large volume of funding to finance Britain's growing public sector deficits will probably drive yields upwards, particularly for long-dated gilts. Reflecting these fears, the long dated 9 per cent Treasury stock 2008 saw a yield rise of 6 basis points, from 8.95 per cent to 9.01 per cent. The price fell by just over half a point, to 99 13/16 . At the short end, interest was greater, and yields for short-dated gilts rose only marginally, if at all. For example, the 10 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 1994 saw its yield unchanged at 9.24 per cent. Its price was quoted on Friday night at 101 11/32 . These trends reflect a tendency over the past month for investors to switch down the yield curve, avoiding longer dated securities due to the funding worries. There is particular concern about whether the Bank of England will be able to sell the Pounds 2bn or so of long-dated stock it is expected to auction on June 24, without forcing up yields. Meanwhile, the pace of the funding programme - to finance a public spending deficit expected to be more than Pounds 30bn in 1992-1993 - was underlined by the Bank's announcement on Friday that it is to issue Pounds 500m of 4 1/8 per cent index linked Treasury stock due in 2030 from today. The stock is at the far end of the yield curve, of a maturity range unfamiliar to many gilt specialists. The market was, however, cheered by the rash of data on inflation which indicated an extremely slow recovery from the UK recession, an event which will put little rising pressure on gilt yields and should put a floor under prices: The rate of retail price inflation in the UK was unchanged last month, but underlying trends remained on a downward path. A 0.4 per cent rise in the retail prices index in May left the rate of increase in the 12 months to May at 4.3 per cent, the same as in April. The RPI excluding mortgage interest payments fell to 5.3 per cent in the year to May, the lowest since December 1988. A Confederation of British Industry distributive trades survey said shop prices were rising more slowly than at any time since the survey started in 1983. It also said any recovery in retail sales was likely to be sluggish after the depressed state of this sector over the past 18 months. The prices of manufactured goods leaving Britain's factories rose by 3.6 per cent in May, the lowest annual rate of increase for five years. The producer prices index, often taken as a measure of core inflation, rose 0.1 per cent on the month, compared with a 0.4 per cent monthly rise in April, supporting government hopes that upward pressure on prices will continue to ease. Further evidence of the disinflationary momentum in the UK economy came from the rise in the index excluding volatile food, drink and tobacco prices. This rose by 0.2 per cent in May compared with the previous month, bringing the year-on-year rate of change to 2.7 per cent, the lowest since June 1967.</p>

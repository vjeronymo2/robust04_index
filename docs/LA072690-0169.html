			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: HAWAIIAN GARDENS;  </P> <P> FIREWORKS BALLOT ISSUE OKD AMID SPARKS ON COUNCIL  </P> <P> The Hawaiian Gardens City Council has voted 3 to 2 to place a referendum on the  November ballot to ban fireworks. The action came Tuesday night after a heated  argument between Mayor H. M. (Lennie) Wagner and Councilwoman Kathleen Navejas  that drew applause and jeers from the audience.  </P> <P> Wagner, who opposes fireworks and supports the referendum, demanded order in  the council chamber and threatened to adjourn the meeting.  </P> <P> Navejas opposed the referendum because the $8,000 to $10,000 expense to put it  on the ballot "should be used elsewhere."  </P> <P> "These people who oppose fireworks; let them go out and get signatures and put  it on the ballot themselves," Navejas said. "Don't make us do the dirty work. .  . . You don't care about the people in this community."  </P> <P> The audience applauded and the mayor began to bang her gavel and threatened to  adjourn the meeting if Navejas did not stop.  </P> <P> The two continued to argue until one member of the audience called on Mayor Pro  Tem Dominic Ruggeri to "take control of the meeting."  </P> <P> Wagner later apologized for the quarrel.  </P></p>

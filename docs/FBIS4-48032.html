			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Antonio Barros in Zambezia Province] </F>   [Text] If the agreements reached between the government and  Gimo Phiri's Mozambique Democratic Union, Udemo, are not  complied with, a new war could erupt in Mozambique at any time  before elections are held in October of this year. That threat  was made by Jose Frederico Goncalves, Udemo's national chief for  organization and mobilization. The Udemo was formed in the wake  of differences between Carlos Reis, president of the Mozambican  National Union, Unamo, and Gimo Phiri at the congress which  resulted in Unamo's creation.    Gimo Phiri used to lead a force of some 2,000 men, who were  subsequently confined to an assembly area in Milange. Some of  those men have already been demobilized. Sources whom we have  contacted have told us that all those men have been disarmed.    Goncalves has told Radio Mozambique in Milange, Zambezia  Province, that the promises made by the Mozambique Liberation  Front, Frelimo, are a left-wing coalition [as heard] because  they are not being observed. He also said that the leader of  those former armed forces will only leave the jungle once he  obtains all the conditions that have been granted the Mozambique  National Resistance, Renamo, leader. Despite our reporter's  insistence, the Udemo national chief for organization and  mobilization did not give any details concerning the nature of  the agreements reached with the government. He simply said that  his organization had been promised transportation and premises.    Political observers in Quelimane speculate that the  government must have promised to confine and demobilize Gimo  Phiri's forces, as well as to pay the salaries and subsidies to  which all demobilized forces should be entitled. Gimo Phiri's  forces are confined and are being demobilized in the same  assembly area as the government forces in Milange. Goncalves  said that Udemo is to become official and, depending on the  government's response to the problem, it intends to participate  in the elections scheduled for October. Meanwhile, contacts are  continuing.    That Udemo official also said that the Mozambican ambassador  to Malawi has been liaising between the government and his  movement which, according to him, has its headquarters in the  Namuli mountains, in Zambezia Province's Gurue District.</p>

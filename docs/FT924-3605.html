			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / People: Study in journalism Peter Cole, founding editor of the short-lived Sunday Correspondent and editor of the Sunday Times News Review for the past two years, is exchanging Wapping for Preston to take up the newly created professorship in journalism at the University of Central Lancashire. He starts towards the end of January. Cole, 46, denies any unhappiness at the Sunday Times, calling the move 'positive rather than negative.' He says it is prompted 'partly by age' and adds that he likes dealing with students. He answered an advertisement, and remarks on the 'exhaustive 2 day interviewing process' - quite unlike the generally much less time-consuming affair for a journalistic job. In contrast with the US and some continental European countries, Britain has hitherto largely resorted to the cult of the amateur when educating its journalists. Last year, however, the University of Central Lancashire, then Lancashire Polytechnic, introduced one of the country's first undergraduate degrees in journalism. Can the profession be taught? A Cambridge economics graduate himself, Cole thinks that, given the increased complexity of the subjects journalists are supposed to report upon, there is indeed a lot that can usefully be learned as part of an academic discipline. And public relations, which features this year as an option in the combined honours programme? 'We'll find out' he says. Cole adds that his wide experience in the newspaper business - he was news editor and deputy editor of the Guardian before moving across for the Sunday Correspondent launch - will determine that the course is 'fairly practically directed.' Some 200 students are currently studying journalism or public relations in the department. The university, which strikes Cole as 'a very ambitious place', boasts a total of 14,000 students, including part-timers. ***** Jon Snow, Channel Four news presenter, is to become a visiting professor at Nottingham Trent University, associated with the new Broadcast Journalism degree and other related courses.</p>

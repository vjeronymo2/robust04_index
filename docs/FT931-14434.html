			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Chile closes book on pioneering debt-swap experiment - Foreign investors are now free to rethink their strategies HAPPILY for Chile's central bank the growth of direct foreign investment and the strength of the economy have done away with the need for special incentives such as debt-equity conversions. But the effects of the pioneering scheme are still working their way through the Chilean financial system. The bank is expecting a significant increase in profit remittances this year after relaxing the rules for foreign investors who acquired Chilean assets through such swaps. Contrary to expectations the central bank is relishing the prospect of a wider current account deficit - forecast to double to 3 per cent of GDP in 1993 - to ease a dollar glut which is putting pressure on the exchange rate and complicating monetary management. Chile's net international reserves climbed from Dollars 6.6bn to Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.9bn) in 1992, enough to cover a year of imports and equivalent to roughly half its foreign debt. The dollar bounty - product of a healthy trade surplus and net capital inflows - was inconceivable during the lean 1980s, when Chile pioneered debt-equity swaps to lighten its foreign debt. Between 1985 and 1991 Chile retired an estimated Dollars 10.5bn of foreign debt through debt conversions, most into equity in Chilean companies. To help nudge some of the dollar inflows out of the country the bank has lifted all restrictions on the repatriation of capital and profits, subject to a 3 per cent exit fee on the original value of the debt-equity swap. Previously these investments were subject to a four-year wait for profit remittances, while the capital was tied in Chile for 10 years. However, remarkably few multinationals appear so far to be taking up the offer. Unless a parent company is in financial straits at home, multinationals have chosen to plough profits into their Chilean businesses, which have been providing handsome returns. The central bank's 'very rough estimate' for 1992 places net reinvested profits at up to Dollars 700m, of which Dollars 400m correspond to debt-equity investments. Another rough estimate places the stock of foreign direct investment in Chile within the Dollars 10bn-Dollars 13bn range - roughly 30 per cent of GDP. About Dollars 4bn of this was acquired through debt-equity conversions. Bankers Trust, one of the earliest and most successful debt-swappers, has also been the first this year to call in part of its investments. In January Bankers Trust sold its majority stake in AFP Provida, the largest private pension fund in Chile, to local investors for Dollars 53.1m. It originally bought a 60 per cent share in AFP Provida for Dollars 9m in 1986, and later sold part of this to Chemical Bank and the Bank of Tokyo. The three banks say they will repatriate Dollars 44.5m abroad. The remainder will be reinvested in their fast-growing life-insurance business. The greater freedom conferred to debt-swappers has also prompted some foreign investors to rethink their business strategies in Chile. Citibank, which converted Dollars 145m of its own Chilean debt paper to invest in forestry, fishing and mining ventures, has now put many of these up for sale to expand its local financial services. Mr Carlos Fuks, Citibank's general manager in Santiago, says all the proceeds will be reinvested in Chile. Only a small portion of debt-swap profits will be remitted, for the first time, in 1993. Citibank took the unusual step for a bank of investing in new productive ventures - the biggest was a Dollars 460m pulp mill in partnership with Royal Dutch/Shell and Scott Paper of the US. Other foreign banks chose to buy into local banks, life insurance companies and private pension funds. Many built up stakes in Chile's privatised companies or simply gambled on the stock exchange. 'It would have been more profitable to get into equities,' Mr Fuks reflects. 'In retrospect, our debt-equity swaps benefited Chile more than they did our bank.' Although debt-swaps were authorised freely to finance everything from the Mormon church to Pepsi Cola bottling plants, perhaps the greatest impact of the programme has been in the development of the pulp and paper industry. Three new pulp mills costing Dollars 1.5bn have entered production since 1991. All of them included debt-equity conversions as a key part of project finance. The New Zealand forestry group Carter Holt Harvey, which came to Chile in 1987 with a Dollars 164m debt-equity deal, once described its Chilean assets as its 'most profitable off-shore investment'. Another New Zealand group, Fletcher Challenge, acquired a newsprint mill in 1987 using Dollars 130m of Chilean debt paper bought at a 34 per cent discount. Mr Bryce Whitcher, Fletcher Challenge's representative in Santiago, says the discount made the transaction attractive and the risk acceptable. 'It is difficult to be certain whether any investment would have been made without the debt-swap,' he says. 'There was and still is a strategic fit to our other forest investments, but it may not have been of the size or at the time of the actual investment.' Despite its success, Chile's use of debt-equity swaps had detractors from the start. Mr Ricardo Ffrench-Davis, a former central bank director of studies, estimates foreign investors were subsidised to the tune of Dollars 1bn by buying Chilean debt paper at a discount on the secondary markets and exchanging it at near face value for pesos in Chile. 'While it is true that swaps helped reactivate confidence and investment in Chile, this was done at a very great cost to the country,' Mr Ffrench-Davis says. 'No thought was given to which sectors of the economy would most benefit from debt-equity conversions. The subsidy was handed out with no criteria.' Central bank officials say privately they never felt comfortable as guardians of this huge subsidy for foreign investors. More than 300 swaps were approved between 1985-90, and keeping tabs on all the money proved an impossible task. The central bank knows of several cases of fraud which it cannot prosecute due to lack of evidence. Nor have they wished to create unnecessary hostile waves for the majority of bona-fide investors. While Chile is closing this chapter, other countries in the region are still actively using debt-swaps as an integral part of their privatisation programmes. Argentina has cancelled Dollars 12bn of debt through debt-equity conversions in the past three years. Peru is also studying the Chilean model as it puts its own privatisation programme into gear.</p>

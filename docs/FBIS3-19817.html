According to Eurispes, 350-400,000 votes, or about ten  percent of the Sicilian electorate are controlled by Cosa  Nostra, and about the same proportion of the island's elective  offices, through its 130 "families" each with 150-300 members.    The study said that the simple magnitude of the revenue  passing through Mafia organisations implies a need for financial  services and brokering to handle it -- and, at the same time, an  ability to exert pressure and influence decisions wherever the  mafiosi are active.    The study, which also confirmed that the Mafia is creating  "bridge-heads in Europe and East Europe," reported that Italian  organised crime as a whole boasts an an army of about 500,000 of  whom about 100,000 are professionals and the others ready for  the occasional job.    Of the Mafia, the study said about 20 percent of its revenue  comes from public contracting, which fits in well with figures  from the Sicilian Audit Court claiming that tendering  regulations are violated in 67 percent of all the public  contracts signed in the region.    The figures showed that over 26 trillion lire are invested  in  Sicilian public works contracts each year, with 14 trillion  going to local councils. Sicily's regional government is the  one that spends most in Italy, with an annual budget of almost  3.5 trillion lire a year.    "Today," said Eurispes Chairman Gian Maria Fara, "Cosa  Nostra  and other Mafia organisations control significant slices of  public life and the national as well as the southern market.    ``If the Mafia has a political dimension, it is because it  has managed to adapt to a service society, infiltrating various  sectors of local government and administration. Multiplying the  sources of expenditure has also opened new panoramas for Mafia  activities to take root.''</p>

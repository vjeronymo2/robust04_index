			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / BT comes top in telecoms poll British Telecommunications provides a better service than Mercury, says a survey of telecommunications managers in Britain's largest companies. The survey of 439 companies by the Telecommunications Managers Association says that, on a scale of one to 10, BT was rated at an average of 6.95 against 6.18 for Mercury. Nearly half the companies surveyed have an annual telecoms expenditure of more Pounds 5m. The survey reflects the tension between price and quality. Competing aggressively on price, Mercury has about two-thirds of outgoing long-distance traffic from the City, although its national market share is only about 10 per cent. Mr David Harrington, director-general of the association, said: 'BT's strength is the resilience of its network, which is widely seen to be greater than Mercury's. They have got more people on the ground.' Most telecoms managers claimed to have a good understanding of pricing packages but the growing complexity of tariffs was a source of concern. A large number of companies said they planned to use network operators which have entered the UK markets since the abolition of the BT/Mercury duopoly in 1991. Colt, a new operator building a network in the City, said yesterday that it expected to be serving at least 100 sites within a year. In the six months since gaining a government licence Colt has laid more than 20km (12.5 miles) of cable and is providing private networks for six City organisations. Colt plans to extend its network to Westminster early next year and to install a switch enabling it to connect traffic with BT, Mercury, and other long-distance operators.</p>

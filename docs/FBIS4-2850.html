			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Customs Gets Tough: Smugglers Can Be Shot"] </F>   [Text] Violent and armed smugglers who refuse or resist  Chinese customs examinations for contraband at sea will be shot,  according to a new policy that takes effect this year, customs  authorities warned.    "While checking smuggling suspects and ships at sea, armed  anti- contraband customs personnel can open fire on those who  resist, try to escape from the examination by using violence, or  try to recover their confiscated contraband or other smuggling  evidence," an official for the Beijing-based General  Administration of Customs (GAC) told CHINA DAILY yesterday.    The new policy indicates that the Chinese government is  intensifying its crackdown on the rising tide of smuggling along  the country's south eastern coast, said the official, who  declined to be named.    To tackle the widespread problem of smuggling at sea,  China's  law since 1989 has authorized anti-smuggling inspectors to use  weapons against violent and armed smugglers.    But the use of weapons by customs personnel has been  carefully controlled except in some dangerous circumstances.    The GAC, to regulate its anti-smuggling efforts at sea,  requires its staff to wear specified black uniforms and to show  their identity cards when checking suspects.    The inspectors should use designated anti-smuggling ships or  high-speed motor boats flying China's national flag and bearing  the customs insignia.    The official also stressed that Chinese and foreign ships  and  crewmen have the right to refuse an anti-smuggling check at sea  if the above stipulations are not followed by customs personnel.    A few cases of misunderstanding or disputes over customs  checking have been reported, as people generally are unfamiliar  with the GAC's regulations on anti-smuggling checks. In  addition, some unidentified agencies have illegally checked  ships at sea by posing as Chinese customs officials.    Earlier this year, China described some major achievements  in  its war against smuggling at sea, thanks to a large-scale joint  operation launched in the southeastern region last year.</p>

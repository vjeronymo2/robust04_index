			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Whitewater 'target' warned Special prosecutor Kenneth Starr has notified Mr James McDougal, a former business partner of President Bill Clinton, that Mr McDougal is a target in the Whitewater investigation, the latter's lawyer said yesterday. 'Responding to my inquiries, Mr Starr has informed us that Jim (McDougal) is, in fact, a target,' said the lawyer, Mr Sam Heuer. He said that Mr Starr had informed him in a letter of his wish to interview Mr McDougal as part of his probe of Whitewater. Mr McDougal was the partner of Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary in the Whitewater vacation real estate venture, in which the Clintons say they lost Dollars 69,000 before Mr Clinton became president. Mr McDougal also controlled Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the failed savings bank seized by US regulators in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of more than Dollars 60m. Mr Starr is investigating whether depositors' funds were improperly used to keep the Whitewater resort solvent or improperly channelled to back one of Mr Clinton's Arkansas gubernatorial campaigns.</p>

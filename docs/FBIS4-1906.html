			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, April 4 (XINHUA) -- Highways have been  built linking all the townships and 91.8 percent of the villages  in central China's Henan Province, greatly promoting economic  prosperity in rural areas.    The total length of the roads has reached 35,359 km.    Although it is rich in natural resources, 50 percent of  Henan  is mountainous, and transportation problems have hampered rural  economic development.    In the drive for reform and opening to the outside world,  the  provincial government has worked out a strategy for the  development of transportation by collecting funds from various  channels.    In the past eight years the province's Luanchuan County  alone  has invested over 14.9 million yuan (about 1.5 million U.S.  dollars) in rural highway construction.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1255 GMT on 2 February, during its "Doing Radio" program,  features an 18-minute roundtable conversation with Politburo  member Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers  Federation.    The program hosts introduce Ross for what they label a Radio  Assembly of the Cuban People. The hosts stress that the workers'  assemblies are not a passing notion but a mass movement that  includes over 3 million workers and now students, according to  recent statements by Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union  of Young Communists.    Ross says: "I believe it is one of the most important,  relevant political events of all time because no other country,  ever, has conducted a workers' assembly to discuss national  problems, particularly when the country is facing such a  complex, difficult situation. It is precisely the workers'  suggestions, their ideas, that become the basis for decisions.  It is not a matter of conducting a parliamentary exercise. The  goal is to conduct a true parliamentary operation to make  decisions, suggest ideas, and promote action. We are gathering  everything being said. There is even a computer program to store  all the opinions and suggestions offered."    Ross adds that the 1 million retirees in Cuba can join  former  workplaces to participate in the assemblies. Ross reiterates  that management's reports to the assemblies must be clear,  concise, and to the point, noting the exemplary report presented  by the manager of La Corona Cigar Factory at its ongoing  assembly.    At this point, Ciego de Avila correspondent Fernando Sanchez  states that approximately 120,000 workers will participate in  the provincial workers' assemblies which began 1 February.  Sanchez says that Ciego de Avila's Central Construction  Enterprise workers called for increasing efficiency and cost  reduction and discussed excess currency, unjustified sick  leaves, confiscation of the money of the so-called macetas, and  the need to increase production by increasing efficiency in the  commerce and food industries. Santiago de Cuba correspondent  Carlos Zanabria praises the concept of the workers' assembly as  brilliant. When Ross interjects that it was President Fidel  Castro's idea, Zanabria adds: "Brilliant, as is every idea of  our commander in chief who has always helped us overcome highly  complex national difficulties and thus enjoys such extraordinary  admiration and the unlimited trust of the Cuban people."  Zanabria stresses the need to make profits by producing with  quality and efficiency, following the collapse of the socialist  markets.    Ross announces that on 10 February he will be at Palma  Soriano's Abel Santa Maria Printing Enterprise in Santiago de  Cuba Province because it is an outstanding example of how  production and workers' efforts can be realigned. This industry  has sought ways of employing workers usefully instead of  releasing them from their posts; it has also added surplus  workers from other workplaces to its personnel roster.    Ross tells La Corona workers that he will visit the factory  later in the day to discuss their efficiency and the issue of  the 1 million cigars not produced. In response of a question by  the host, Ross notes that "the workers' main suggestions have to  do with increasing efficiency in the workplace" and gives  examples of effective implementation of suggestions at the  National Hospital, the Regla Fish Distribution Center, cigar  factories, and the Finlay Research Institute.    Pedro Ross adds that the key is efficiency, citing the  sphere  of sports, which is contributing to the economy in addition to  having become self-financing. He has visited a milk complex that  is producing a good quality soy yogurt through its workers'  efforts. Those workers discussed at length how to make the most  of available resources. Ross notes that the next phase of the  process is management's response and stresses that the measures  implemented will result from the workers' suggestions.    Ross says he has refrained from offering ideas in order not  to influence worker opinions, which he wants to come directly  from them: "We want the workers to assume their roles as  parliamentarians, as leaders of the country, and to determine  the solutions to the problems we have."    Ross goes on to say that the workers are being highly  responsible in pointing the finger at those who hamper efforts,  as well as at the bureaucratic tangle in many sectors that is  obstructing efforts to move ahead: "I have heard this in all 12  assemblies in which I have participated: Our superstructure  inhibits production and service efforts."    The host stresses that the workers can trust that whatever  economic measures are taken will most benefit the country while  least affecting the people. Ross agrees, thanks the hosts, and  adds that he may appear on the program again after visiting  Camaguey and Santiago de Cuba next week.</p>

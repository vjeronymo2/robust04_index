			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "own information" report in the "Poklonnaya </F> Hill [pun meaning the war memorial in Moscow and a place where  one bows to authority in a bid to obtain a favor]" column: "How  To Dispose of 111 Billion. New Facts About the Subsidy  Commission"]    [Text] According to informal reports from government  sources, Mikhail Poltoranin, current chairman of the State Duma  Information Policy and Communications Committee, intends to head  a subsidy commission (it will possibly be called more  "democratically" a public council) which is being set up to  distribute among the needy publications government funds  allocated to maintain the domestic press. The sum of 111  billion is not very large and therefore obviously many chief  editors will go hat in hand to Poltoranin like in the good old  days, and he will be making eyes at some and thumbing his nose  at others. An important question now being aired in the Russian  Press Committee, which has lobbied for increased government  subsidies, is the composition of this commission. It was  expected that the commission would include primarily experienced  journalists, enjoying the unquestionable respect of their  colleagues, people with a name. It seems, however, that its  bulk will be constituted by State Duma deputies who are already  actively seeking to take their chance to direct and boss the  media around. In all likelihood it will be Poltoranin himself  who will be selecting subsidy commission members.    It will be recalled that a similar, 1993-style, commission  to  distribute budget funds between the publications included two  representatives of the State Press Committee, two deputies from  the then Russian Federation Supreme Soviet's Mass Media  Committee, and two deputies from the Supreme Soviet Budget  Committee. It should be noted that the promised 111 billion is  not available so far. At first the Finance Ministry was going  to resolve this problem in April, but now it does not promise to  provide the funds until the end of May. Actually the subsidy  commission is to be established by the moment the funds come  forth.</p>

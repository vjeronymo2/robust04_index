			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Li Haifu (2621 3189 3940) and Jiang </F> Zuozhong (3068 0146 0022)]    [Text] Recently, authorities at the Shenzhen Nonferrous  Metals Exchange discussed the futures market for nonferrous  metals and predicted that prices for copper and aluminum, in the  first quarter, will rise rather sharply, after which they are  expected to stabilize at a definite price level.    This authority said that in 1933 the futures market for  nonferrous metals went through a "tightening and relaxing"  phase. At the beginning of last year, the national economy  heated up sharply, due chiefly to a rise in nonferrous metal  prices, which dropped gradually in the second and third quarters  to finally bottom out in October, the lowest point for the whole  year. After this, following an improvement in the national  economy, prices on nonferrous metals rose again, though not to  the level of the first part of the year.    Price fluctuations for the chief nonferrous metals this  past year are described as follows:    Copper: China has a short supply of copper. Output in 1993  was 710,000 tons, an increase of about 12 percent over that last  year. As copper use required 800,000 tons, the shortfall was met  partly by imports. International prices on copper which dipped  in early May and late October, led to sizeable increases in  copper imports. Adding the imports of copper, copper alloys, and  copper processing materials for the year, estimated to range  from 350,000 to 400,000 tons, the available copper supply  totalled around 1.11 million tons. After allowing 150,000 tons  for normal inventory stocks, the excess which added up to  200,000 to 250,000 tons created great pressures on the domestic  copper market.    From January to September, the price of copper inventories  at the Shenzhen Nonferrous Metals Exchange was maintained  between 19,000 yuan to 22,500 yuan per ton. Since mid-September,  copper prices began sliding sharply, finally bottoming out in  mid-October at 16,700 yuan per ton, but rising again to about  18,500 yuan per ton by the end of December. In comparison with  international copper prices fluctuating in the range of $600  U.S. per ton, the fluctuation range of 6,800 yuan per ton in  domestic copper prices basically reflect the trend in the  international market.    Aluminum: Aluminum output in China last year reached 1.2  million tons. Imports of aluminum and aluminum alloys were  roughly 170,000 tons. The total amount of aluminum expended  during the year was around 1.3 million tons, so supply and  demand of aluminum on the domestic market were basically  balanced.    From January to March, when the people's currency used to  regulate foreign exchange showed acute variation, aluminum  prices at the Shenzhen Nonferrous Metals Exchange remained  between 12,400 yuan and 12,950 yuan. Because of the great  pressure of imports and the effect that the rapid drop in  aluminum prices on the international market had, aluminum prices  at the Shenzhen exchange finally stabilized around 12,000 yuan  per ton.    Lead and Zinc: Besides meeting domestic needs, China's  supply of lead and zinc had surplus amounts available for  export. In 1993, the output of lead and zinc in China were  400,000 tons and 800,000 tons respectively, valued at 7,860 yuan  to 8,000 yuan per ton. The trend was stable.    Tin: Besides adequately meeting domestic needs, most of  China's tin output was exported. In 1993, tin output was about  49,000 tons, an increase of 34 percent over the year before. The  amount expended domestically was 13,000 tons, comparable to  amounts expended the previous year. Tin prices last year showed  great fluctuation, between 43,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan per ton.  One reason for this was partly excessive supply over demand, and  another was a sudden drop in international tin prices in  mid-September to $4,300 U.S. per ton.    Nickel: In 1933, China's output of nickel was about 30,000  tons, an increase of 1.72 percent over that for the year before.  The amount of nickel imports was about 9,000 tons, making the  total supply of nickel available at 39,000 tons. As the amount  of nickel expended was 38,000 tons, supply and demand were  basically balanced. However, affected by international price  fluctuations, domestic nickel prices in 1933 were found to range  between 58,000 yuan and 48,300 yuan per ton, a rather  substantial fluctuation.    The main trends concerning the market for nonferrous  metals in 1994 will now be discussed.    Because the supply of nonferrous metals on the  international market exceeds demand, inventories at the London  Metals Exchange were as high as 600,000 tons for copper; for  aluminum, 2.4 million tons; for lead, 300,000 tons; for zinc,  880,000 tons; for tin, 19,000 tons; and for nickel, 120,000  tons. This showed a considerable range of increases over  inventories for the year before.    Against such a background, and right at a time when the  building of China's socialist market economy is entering a new  stage, and reforms in finance, international trade, and capital  investment are opening up on a broad scale, China's nonferrous  metals market is facing an opportunity and a challenge at the  same time.    For 1994, output estimates for the main nonferrous metals  are noted as follows: copper, 800,000 tons; aluminum, 1.35  million tons; lead, 410,000 tons; zinc, 750,000 tons; tin,  35,000 tons; and nickel, 32,000 tons. These figures all showed  rather large increases in output. But output expended is  expected to reach 900,00 tons, 1.1 million tons, 350,000 tons,  709,000 tons, 15,000 tons, and 40,000 tons respectively. The  trading pattern in nonferrous metals will show that copper and  nickel will still depend on imports to meet part of their needs,  though some of the lead, zinc, and aluminum will have some  excess for export, while a good part of the tin will be exported.    In 1994, because international trade has great hopes for  economic recovery in countries such as Great Britain, the United  States etc., that within a quarter, the international price for  copper will undergo a substantial rise, though the range may not  be as broad as that for the year before. Under such  circumstances, domestic copper prices may show a noticeable rise  possibly to a figure as high as 22,000 yuan per ton, and follow  the slide of international copper prices and drop. For the year,  the fluctuations may range between 18,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan  per ton.    International prices for aluminum are affected by  international copper prices, in that at the beginning of the  year, prices may rise, though not steeply. Because of this,  domestic prices for aluminum at the beginning of the year can be  expected to stabilize at 12,500 yuan per ton, but very quickly  would be subject to depression. For the year, prices can be  expected to remain at an average of 12,000 yuan per ton.    Peak prices for lead, zinc, tin, and nickel in 1994 are  also expected to appear in the beginning of the year. As  domestic prices for lead and nickel in 1994 are affected by the  international market, they would likely stabilize at more than  3,900 yuan per ton and 48,000 yuan per ton, respectively.    Domestic prices for tin are most depressing, and their  overall level during the year is expected to remain around  16,000 yuan per ton. Zinc prices are expected to be sustained  around 8,000 yuan per ton.</p>

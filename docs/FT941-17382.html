			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Colombia finds friends in drive to open up  -Two free trade deals are blazing a trail which the government hopes will end in Nafta membership Colombia advances further on the road toward regional economic integration this month as it enters two important free trade agreements. A trade accord with Chile came into operation at the start of the year, while the Group of Three agreement between Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela is due to be signed later in the month. President Cesar Gaviria is also pushing hard to make Colombia one of the first South American countries to join the North American Free Trade Agreement. 'In practice, we can be eligible for Nafta on all conditions - democratic tradition, economic stability, foreign investment legislation and deregulation,' said Mr Juan Manuel Santos, the foreign trade minister. 'The Group of Three and our other regional integration accords are preparing the ground for this step.' Although Colombian products already enjoy special access to the US, the treaty would provide a more permanent trade framework and other benefits. The internationalisation of the economy has moved fast in the last three years. Colombian producers are no longer limited to an inward-looking market of 33m people, but can plan for an expanded community of 180m, says Mr Santos. Average tariffs have come down from 40 per cent to 11 per cent and imports are soaring. Foreign investment has also begun to grow in response to the government's efforts to sell Colombia abroad. The US is Colombia's most important trading partner - in 1992 imports from the US jumped by 40 per cent and they continue to rise. This year Colombia will have an overall trade deficit of more than Dollars 500m (Pounds 337m), something which does not alarm government economists because international reserves are more than Dollars 8bn, equivalent to at least a year's worth of imports. Colombia - already a member of the Andean Pact which groups it with Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia (Peru's membership has been temporarily suspended) - is already boosting exports among Andean Pact countries and trade between Colombia and Venezuela rose to Dollars 1.1bn in the first nine months of 1993, about 30 per cent up on 1992. The agreement with Chile will quickly lower tariffs on a wide range of agricultural and industrial goods - non-tariff barriers are being eliminated immediately and tariff levels on nearly all traded goods will be down to zero by 1999. The Group of Three agreement, planned to come into effect in April, will reduce tariffs gradually over 10 years and encourage investment flows between countries. The combined gross domestic product of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela adds up to Dollars 310bn and Ecuador and Bolivia have shown interest in joining the group. Next year Colombia also expects to formalise trade accords with the Caribbean community (Caricom) and with central American countries. The excitement generated by such moves has infected the private sector which, after hanging back rather fearfully, has become enthusiastic about new trade and investment opportunities. Improved policy co-ordination between government and industry is already apparent now that businessmen accept the official view that the opening of the economy is irreversible. Decades of protection from imports have stunted industrial development and competitiveness. Colombia has relied on its advantages - including resources, climate, location and cheap labour - to export products largely based on natural resources. Poor transport, energy and telecommunications put companies at a disadvantage, in particular those based in Bogota and the centre of the country. However, the government has begun to tackle some of these problems: for example, the restructuring of the ports has already speeded up operations and improved turnaround time. Violence plays a large part in discouraging investment, but for those who look at Colombia in more detail, 'it implies a cost and is a manageable risk', said Mr Armando Vegalara, director of the Colombia investment corporation, Coinvertir. 'The guerrillas are the most important factor for the foreign investor because they're against private property . . . but Colombia has political stability and a stable legal framework too. People often find this extraordinary.' Foreign investment - excluding the oil sector - rose by 55 per cent to Dollars 395m for the January-December period. The US and Venezuela topped the list and the most popular sectors were chemicals and finance. 'There's great interest in telecommunications, power plants and services associated with oil,' said Mr Vegalara. 'We've had several visitors from Japan, I think there's a change of attitude.' Colombians often blame the low rate of foreign investment on the country's bad image, ignoring the disturbing reality of assassinations, human rights abuse, terrorism and corruption. 'I tell people that everything they read about the violence is true - but that they should look at all the other things Colombia has to offer,' said a foreign economic expert. One of Colombia's principal advantages is its economic track record and outlook. Debts are being paid, economic growth is steady and inflation has not been allowed to run wild. The 1993 growth rate was about 5.2 per cent, and similar growth is expected in 1994.</p>

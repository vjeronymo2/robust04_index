The deputy foreign ministers of the two  countries, Hiroshi Fukuda and Aleksandr Panov, agreed on Hata's  visit during two days of meetings in Moscow that ended Tuesday,  the officials said.    The concrete schedule for Hata's visit will be set through  diplomatic channels, they said.    The officials said Fukuda and Panov have agreed to promote  political dialogue between the two countries and continue talks  on a decades-long territorial dispute over four Russian-held  islands claimed by Japan. The territorial row involves Etorofu,  Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets, which the  former Soviet Union seized at the end of World War II.    During the talks in Moscow, Panov welcomed a proposal by  Fukuda to invite a group of Russian parliamentarians and a team  of Russian youths in the Russian Far East to Japan, the  officials said. Details of the trips will be set through  further talks between the two sides, they said.    Russia's INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY reported Japan has reaffirmed  support for Russia's policy of reforms.    Interfax quoted Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigory  Karasin as saying agreement was also reached on how to  coordinate effort to boost economic cooperation between the two  countries.</p>

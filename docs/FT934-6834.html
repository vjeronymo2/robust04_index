			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Observer: Return to sender Observer would love to be able to break the news that the secretive Rothschild group recorded an income of Dollars 3.3bn last year. But sadly that claim is as bogus as all the others contained in a prospectus that has turned up in Monaco and Zurich using the Rothschild name to solicit funds for investments in eastern Europe. For instance, the document, inviting investors to part with their cash in exchange for 'guaranteed' annual returns of 25 per cent from east European property, is covered in versions of the house emblem, the five arrows. Allegedly chaired by Prince Rainier of Monaco, whose 'signature' and photo adorn the president's statement, the fictitious board is not short of illustrious fellow directors - one Eisenberg Rothschild, obviously a long lost relation, is joined by a Quandt, allegedly part of the BMW family, and a von Bismarck. A sharp solicitor's letter normally does the trick but no one knows who to send it to in this case, which explains why Barons Edmond and David de Rothschild and Sir Evelyn de Rothschild have had to resort to advertising across Europe to disassociate themselves from the rogues in the first place.</p>

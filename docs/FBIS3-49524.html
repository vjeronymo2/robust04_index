			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with reporter Volker Wagner in Bonn by </F> Karin Beindorf in Cologne -- live]    [Text] [Beindorf] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and  his Foreign Minister Mate Granic gave a news conference at the  Croatian embassy in Bonn two hours ago. Mr. Wagner, Tudjman  described the Petersberg talks as useful yesterday. Has it  become clear what he meant by that?    [Wagner] No. One cannot really say that things have become  clearer. Quite the contrary. This news conference has  confirmed an old truth -- that the more interesting pieces of  news become usually known before, after, or on the sidelines of  news conferences. One such news item that has leaked from the  surroundings of the delegation is that the 16-page confederation  document with 16 articles, presented by President Tudjman, was  primarily a tactical paper, a tactical paper designed to tell  the world: Look, the Muslims are not pursuing any consistent  policy at all in Bosnia. They are simply interested in  conquering territory in central Bosnia at the expense of the  Croats. Look, we Croats are developing ideas about the  political future, as to how Muslims and Croats might live  together in the near future. Yet this was a tactical move.    At the same time, however, Tudjman is serious about the  confederation proposal, even though the chances of its  implementation may lie in the distant future. Generally,  Tudjman repeated what he declared yesterday evening. He  expressed moderate satisfaction, but made very vague statements.  Thus, all kinds if interpretation are possible.    [Beindorf] What controversial issues were discussed? What  about Mostar or access to the Adriatic Sea for the Muslims?    [Wagner] It was difficult to find that out. The following  became known: Croatia wants to keep Mostar, Tudjman stated.  The reason he gave was that Mostar is the only large town that  the Bosnian Croats control in Bosnia -- even though not entirely  at the moment. The Muslims, however, largely control Sarajevo,  Senica, and Tuzla. The Croats need Mostar as an administrative  center for the state of Herceg-Bosnia that they proclaimed  unilaterally.    Tudjman also stressed that the proportional representation  of  the ethnic groups has changed at the expense of the Croatians  since the beginning of the war. It is very difficult to verify  that at the moment because, as we know, tens of thousands of  Muslims are living in a kind of ghetto in the eastern part of  the town at present. Nobody knows exactly how many there are.  The only thing that is certain is that the number of Muslims  and Croats was about the same in this town before the war.    As far as access to the Adriatic Sea is concerned, Tudjman  made it clear that Neum, the 10-km-wide strip that belonged to  Bosnia in the old Yugoslavia, will be taboo for the Bosnian  Muslims. It should only be used touristically. Thus, the old  proposal continues to be valid: A free port in Ploce, and a  small inland port on the Neretva river, which flows into the  Adriatic Sea about 10 km north of Ploce. Yet the river is not  navigable at present. That would require difficult construction  measures. This is all that has become known concerning Mostar  and access to the Adriatic Sea.    [Beindorf] Mr. Wagner, let me ask you a brief final  question. After yesterday's joint talks, Alija Izetbegovic was  expected to participate in the news conference. Do you know the  reasons for his absence?    [Wagner] Well, one can only speculate. It is known that the  German Government, the Foreign Ministry, declared its readiness  to arrange a joint news conference if agreement is reached  during the talks. This means that a joint news conference was  only planned in the event of a positive outcome. However, this  is not the case. No positive or specific result has been  achieved. Izetbegovic departed for Sarajevo this morning, and  he may present his report to the press there today. Franjo  Tudjman gave a news conference here at 1100. It has also become  known that a quarrel erupted behind the scenes between the  delegations of the Muslims and the Croats and the Foreign  Ministry because no joint news conference was arranged.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses mixed after Bundesbank meeting THE continent saw individual features predominating yesterday, writes our markets staff. FRANKFURT eased while the decision by the Bundesbank not to lower interest rates came as no surprise. The DAX index closed 1.21 lower at 1,573.67 after a day's high of 1,582.73. Turnover fell to DM5.2bn from DM6.2bn. Attention turns today to January inflation data which is expected to show an increase over the previous month, partly as a result of the increase in value added tax at the start of the year. While there was little corporate news to stimulate interest the banking sector was active after reports of downgrades. Lehman Brothers in London said in a note released earlier this week that 'the speed of the economic slowdown in the German economy makes us more cautious towards the banking sector as a whole' and has revised downwards its earnings estimates for 1992 and 1993 to reflect increased bad debt projections. Deutsche Bank lost DM6.50 to DM645, Dresdner Bank fell DM3 to DM352 while Commerzbank went against the trend with a rise of DM3.10 to DM251.60. PARIS continued to feature Lyonnaise-Dumez after the group forecast sharply lower 1992 net profit on Wednesday. The shares fell to a 12-month low of FFr392 before recovering to close down FFr25.50 or 5.8 per cent at FFr410.00. Suez, which has a shareholding in the group, declined FFr2.50 to FFr269.50, while Generale des Eaux slipped FFr36 to FFr2,056. The CAC-40 index closed 6.64 down at 1,812.18 in turnover of some FFr3.3bn. St Gobain lost FFr8 to FFr481 ahead of announcing a fall in 1992 earnings per share from 1991 after the close. MILAN closed firmer but off session highs as an initial flurry of buying gave way to profit-taking before bargain hunters returned. The Comit index finished 2.26 higher at 487.6. Interest by long-term investors in Generali was attributed to the planned introduction of pension funds in Italy and expectations that more people would rely on life insurance as the government squeezes benefits. Generali fixed L780 higher at L33,210, but retreated to L33,000 in after-hours trading. Shares in Cementir, the former state cement group, which was sold to the Caltagirone group of companies last year, surged in illiquid trading and the fixing was delayed to the end of floor dealings. The stock fixed L115 higher at L1,645 and rose to L1,680 after-hours. ZURICH ended just off the day's high on selective buying in blue-chips. The SMI index rose 24.7 to 2,087.4. Sandoz bearers, which fell SFr110 on Wednesday, picked up SFr30 to SFr3,060 as it said it expected profits for 1992 to be substantially higher than the previous year. However, an 8 per cent increase in sales last year was at the lower end of some analysts' expectations. The banking and insurance sectors remained strong following a slight decrease in some short-term interest rates. CS Holding bearers, benefitting in part from a large buy order, added SFr50 to SFr2,110 and Union Bank bearers put on SFr8 to SFr896. BRUSSELS was lifted by strong performances from Solvay and Petrofina and the BEl-20 index closed 13.67 higher at 1,164.41 in high turnover of some BFr2bn. Solvay advanced BFr625 or 5.3 per cent to BFr12,425 while Petrofina closed up BFr310 or 4.2 per cent at BFr7,620, off the day's high of BFr7,730, helped by news after Wednesday's close that it had sold its minority stake in Tractebel, up BFr90 at BFr8,220. Delhaize improved BFr36 or 2.8 per cent to BFr1,334 on a broker's upgrade. AMSTERDAM rose as investors absorbed news of plans by Bols and Wessanen to merge. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.3 up at 99.2. Bols shed 90 cents to Fl 46.10 while Wessanen lost 20 cents to Fl 98.30. Wolters Kluwer rose Fl 1.60 to Fl 88.90. STOCKHOLM saw Astra weaken after local newspaper reports suggested that the cost of implementing its co-operation agreement with Merck of the US could be higher than anticipated because of the appreciation in the US dollar. Its B shares lost SKr6 to SKr689. The Affarsvarlden index fell 5.9 to 927.2.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- January 21                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open      10.30       11.00        12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1092.24    1093.03     1092.94      1092.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1157.33    1157.22     1156.67      1155.71  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00      14.00       15.00        Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1091.08    1089.91     1092.37      1091.44 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1154.90    1155.43     1156.36      1154.96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jan 20    Jan 19    Jan 18    Jan 15    Jan 14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1091.84   1090.81   1097.15   1089.58   1076.93 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1153.29   1155.89   1166.50   1160.32   1154.08  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1094.19; 200 - 1158.37 Low/day: 100 - 1089.74 200 - 1153.99.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

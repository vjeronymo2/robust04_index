			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (b)(3) of the final rule OSHA emphasizes that this standard is not a totally ``vertical'' standard for logging operations. That is, the requirements of this final rule are to be supplemented by other applicable requirements found elsewhere in part 1910. When there is a corresponding provision elsewhere in part 1910 that addresses the same hazard or condition of work as a provision of the logging standard, the more specific logging provision takes precedence for logging operations. By contrast, when hazardous working conditions are not addressed or covered by the logging standard, the other requirements of part 1910 apply. For example, employers in the logging industry must provide employees protection against occupational noise exposure by meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.95. Employers in this industry must also comply with the permissible exposure limit for wood dust specified in 29 CFR 1910.1000 and meet the field sanitation requirements of 29 CFR 1910.28.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters raised the issue about what standards apply to the construction of roads and trails (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;44, and 5&hyph;63). These commenters said there was confusion about whether the entire part 1926 would be applied to logging operations. Construction activities such as the building of roads and trails are not logging operations, therefore they are covered by applicable construction standards and not the logging standard. As such, the use and maintenance of the equipment to perform the construction of those roads and trails, such as graders, scrapers, front-end loaders, and bulldozers, are covered by the construction standards. In addition, the building of roads and trails to reach logging sites is not a logging operation, but is a construction activity that is carried out preparatory to the logging activity. Therefore, in this final standard OSHA has removed references to road building construction activities. Road building in conjunction with the establishment of a logging activity is no different than road building to gain access to any other operation and is covered in the general construction standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the felling of trees in preparation for the construction activities, such as the building of roads, is considered to be a logging operation. To the extent that any employee is performing a logging operation in preparation for construction activities, the employee is performing general industry work, and the requirements of this standard as well as other applicable sections of part 1910, apply in order to safely fell those trees. For example, if trees are felled to prepare for road construction, the requirements in this final rule and other sections of part 1910 apply. This reasoning also applies to felling of trees in preparation for agricultural activities (e.g., felling trees to prepare land for crops). Felling of those trees is general industry work and the requirements of this standard as well as other applicable sections of part 1910 apply. To this end, OSHA has specifically referenced the applicability of the final logging standard in 29 CFR Part 1928 to felling of trees in preparation of agricultural activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

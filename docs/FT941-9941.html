			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Suchard buys Romanian group Kraft Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss-based foods group which is part of Philip Morris of the US, has purchased 82 per cent of Poiana-Produse Zaharoase, Romania's biggest chocolate producer, for Dollars 4.4m, the company announced in Bucharest yesterday. Under the deal, Suchard will invest Dollars 17m on top of the purchase price in Poiana over the next five years and maintain the present workforce level at 1,220 for two years. The remaining 18 per cent of shares will be offered to employees. Poiana, which operates two factories in the Transylvanian town of Brasov, is Suchard's eighth acquisition in central and eastern Europe and lifts its capital committed to the region to Dollars 200m, Mr Bernhard Huber, vice-president, said. Suchard plans to develop some of Poiana's existing 80 brands and initially concentrate on expanding sales in the large domestic market rather than on exports, Mr Huber said. With a population of 23m, Romania is the region's second-largest market after Poland. The deal is only the second sale to a foreign company by the State Ownership Fund, the main engine of Romania's privatisation drive, since it was set up 15 months ago.</p>

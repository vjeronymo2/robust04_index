			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> STUCKY STRIKES CHORD FOR A 'COMMON LANGUAGE'  </P> <P> Although he has taught music at Cornell University since 1980, Steven Stucky is  no ivory-tower composer. Even if he wanted to be -- which he doesn't -- the Los  Angeles Philharmonic, for which he is composer-in-residence, wouldn't let him.  </P> <P> "One of my roles with the Los Angeles Philharmonic is to be seen a lot," Stucky  said in a recent phone interview from his home near Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y.  "Not in a frivolous PR way, but because to the extent there's a sort of gap or  reservoir of mistrust between the consumers of modern music and the producers  of modern music, one of the ways to get over that is through ordinary human  contact."  </P> <P> Stucky will make that human contact in a talk about his music tonight at 7:30  at the Laguna Art Museum.  </P> <P> "Simply having the chance to meet the artist and talk in easy, layman's terms  about what he's trying to do goes a long way to creating a common language to  approach the music. . . . I've seen it happen over and over again," said the  40-year-old composer, who has received commissions from orchestras in  Philadelphia, Baltimore, St. Louis and, of course, Los Angeles. His Concerto  for Orchestra was a finalist for the 1989 Pulitzer Prize in composition.  </P> <P> "It helps for me as a listener, too. I often find it easier to warm up to a  piece by someone I know than to a piece in which I have no human entry, only  the notes. Connecting the piece with the personality of the composer, knowing  something about him as a human being, gives you a natural way in."  </P> <P> But don't expect Stucky to talk too much about his private life ("My life is  boring," he said) or to talk in lofty technical and theoretical terms.  </P> <P> "I don't think about (music) that way," he said. "I tend to talk about what  makes my pulse race, my hair stand up, what gives me visceral reactions. When  I'm composing, I suppose what I'm trying to do is raise those reactions in  myself in the hope that I will make them in other people."  </P> <P> Composing, however, is a "slow, painstaking, note-by-note" process, Stucky  said.  </P> <P> "I'm constantly revising, tinkering when I'm writing," he said. "It's not fast.  It can be weeks or months; months usually. But it usually produces in the end  what I want without having to go back and try again.  </P> <P> "There comes a moment after a few months, when the piece exists even though  it's not finished. It takes on a personality and becomes easy to write. It has  momentum, a history of its own."  </P> <P> Astonishingly, he orchestrates his work as he writes, bar by bar, sometimes  filling up to 34 staves.  </P> <P> "Ideas are always related to their instrumentation right away," he explained.  "There is no reason to wait to work an idea out until later. The relationship  of the idea and its orchestra coloring is very close, and that's part of what I  have to get down right away.  </P> <P> "The momentum from bar to bar is an illusion which arises later," he added. "It  doesn't exist in the moment of composing, normally."  </P> <P> How does inspiration fit into the picture?  </P> <P> "I think of inspiration as something that comes of long, hard work," he said.  "You create the conditions in which an idea can be born by working hard with  your imagination. At a certain moment, an idea exists which didn't exist  before, but it comes from preparing the ground for it."  </P> <P> Critics have tended to describe Stucky's music in terms of color, and he is  happy with that approach.  </P> <P> "Color -- which is a sloppy metaphor, we don't have a good language for these  things -- color is important to me," he said. "I'm trying to use elements of  music other than traditional ones for carrying the main emotional freight or  dramatic import: Things more important (to me) than traditional elements like  melody and harmony are other aspects, like loud and soft, high and low, light  and dark, which you could call coloristic aspects.  </P> <P> "It's possible to take that argument too far. I'm not sure how much the  traditional categories can be replaced. But I'm interested in redressing the  balance away from the hard-core 19th-Century Germanic ideas of what the  elements of music are: melody, harmony, counterpoint. Other aspects have been  neglected."  </P> <P> Most of Stucky's recent music has been written for orchestra. "I think that's  where I'm most at home," he said. "My way of expressing myself depends on a  fairly large range of color, and the orchestra is the place to get it."  </P> <P> Consequently, he is happy that perennial predictions for the demise of that  institution still haven't come true. "It's not dead for me or for some other  composers," he said. "That situation is less true today than it was 10 to 20  years ago. There are combinations of factors for that. One is the new system of  placing composers in residence with orchestras, which created a mechanism so  that audiences could get the hang of the music. It also ensured that other  composers have an advocate within the ensemble.  </P> <P> "So the number of new pieces programmed is higher than it used to be. Some  composers see a purpose in writing orchestral music. They have hope of seeing  it played.  </P> <P> "But it is an anachronism. Technologically, the orchestra is a 19th-Century  instrument. Most of the instruments have not changed much in at least 100  years, and sometimes longer than that. It's a machine built to play  19th-Century music, but some of us, I hope we're not being too retrogressive,  seem to have things to say that can be said by that same instrument. I hope it  hangs around a little bit longer."  </P> <P>  Steven Stucky, composer-in-residence for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, will  talk about his music at 7:30 p.m. today at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff  Drive, in Laguna Beach.

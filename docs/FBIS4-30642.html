It marks a new era in the development and  growth of the relations of friendship and cooperation between  the Lao and Philippine people, nurtured under the five-point  priciple of peaceful coexistence, and thus contributing to the  relations of friendship and cooperation among the nations in  Southeast Asia and the cause of peace, stability, and progress.    Respected excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, we highly  assess the outcome of our talks held this morning. The  relations of friendship between Laos and the Philippines have  been clearly displayed during the talks, where many fine words  were expressed by His Excellency [H.E.] the Speaker. It has  served to elevate the Lao-Philippine friendship to a new height.  I am very proud of the statement of H.E. the Speaker on our  national development. Your Excellency expressed his impressions  and hailed our leaders for having guided our economy through the  mechanisms of the market economy into the international economy.  He also uttered another impressive statement, saying that  though Laos is ruled by one party, it has managed to become  (?fully) democratic. I would like to inform Your Excellency and  the other Philippine guests here that the Lao Peoples'  Revolutionary Party has no other aim than to bring wealth and  well-being to our multiethnic people, to make our country as  strong, prosperous, and progressive as others, and to (?turn)  this region into a zone of peace, friendship, stability, and  cooperation. Your Excellency expressed many other views on our  country during the talks. He also pledges support for LPDR's  application for permanent membership to the ASEAN  Interparliamentary Organization, to enable the Lao People's  Democratic Republic to be admitted as a permanent member of  ASEAN.

Your Excellency also proposed to further  strengthen our cooperation by setting up our respective  embassies in Vientiane and Manila. He pledged to render  cooperation in economy, public health, medicine, language study,  and other areas to Laos.    All this clearly shows Your Excellency's goods intentions as  well as those of the Philippine people toward Laos, hoping that  our country can be developed to become as progressive and  prosperous as others in this region.    On this auspicious occasion, I would like to express my deep  thanks to Your Excellency, Mr. Speaker, and to your wife and all  the Philippine people.

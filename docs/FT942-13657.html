			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Pensioners may escape tax - At a glance Pensioners who face an unexpected tax demand because the Inland Revenue has only recently found out about their state pension, may soon be able to get out of paying some or all of the tax. Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the board of Inland Revenue, told MPs on Wednesday that the extra-statutory concession allowing tax to be waived in cases of official error is to be extended to such cases. Under the concession, tax can be wholly or partly waived where the Revenue has failed to make timely use of information supplied by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's employer. All the tax can be waived for taxpayers with a gross income of Pounds 15,500 or less. Above this limit, a proportion of the tax is waived on a sliding scale according to income. With gross income of more than Pounds 40,000, none of the tax is waived.</p>

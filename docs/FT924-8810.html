			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Technology: Latest gadgets jump the gun - Technically Speaking IT promises to be the electronics product of the 1990s, if its eager developers are to be believed. For busy managers on the move, the 'personal communicator' - a portable battery-operated device able to send or receive written or spoken messages at any time, from almost anywhere - could be just what they have been waiting for. 'We believe personal communicators will have as much impact on person-to-person communications as the telephone had in the early 1900s,' enthuses Alain Rossmann, president and chief executive of Eo, an ambitious Silicon Valley start-up company which last week unveiled what it claims are the world's first personal communicators. These all-purpose communications tools combine the functions of a cellular telephone, a facsimile machine and a pen computer. The question, however, is not so much whether the market is ready for them, but whether they are ready for the market. Rossmann projects there will be 100m personal communicators in use by the end of the decade. He aims to make Eo a leader in the emerging market. It is not alone in pursuing this dream. Over the next few months, several of the world's largest personal computer and consumer electronics manufacturers as well as other new ventures are expected to jump on the bandwagon. The concept of an integrated wireless personal communicator is exciting. Imagine being able to scribble a note with an electronic notepad and transmit it directly via facsimile or electronic mail while waiting in an airport lounge, or retrieving messages left in an 'electronic mailbox' from a hotel room without connecting a computer to the telephone socket. You also have instant access to remote databases and on-line information systems. But for all the exciting potential, the promise and reality of personal communications technology remain some distance apart. For one thing, Eo's first-generation personal communicators are far from being mass-market products. Priced at Dollars 2,000-Dollars 4,000 (Pounds 1,300-Pounds 2,500) they are targeted at 'mobile professionals' whose work frequently takes them out of the office. In this segment, Eo predicts 1m users by 1994. Prices will come down, Eo promises. Yet even 'early adopters' of the latest technology gadgets may have some misgivings. Critical elements of the technology required to make personal communicators live up to expectations are still wanting. And cellular telephone networks do not yet provide a reliable medium for wireless data communications. Sending data on the move is particularly prone to problems. Eventually, Europe's GSM digital cellular system and the growth of Cellular Digital Packet Data systems in the US should provide a more reliable method of sending data, but these are some years off. Communications 'anytime and anywhere' is Eo's goal, but do not even think of using a personal communicator on an airline flight. Although the manufacturer suggests that busy executives will be able to prepare notes and messages during a flight and then send them when the aeroplane lands, this will depend upon the dispensation of airlines. However, only about 10 to 20 per cent of buyers of the first generation of personal communicators are expected to opt for the add-on cellular telephone link, Eo says. Most users, therefore, will have to find a telephone jack to plug in their personal communicator, making on-the-move communications less convenient. The fundamental weakness of these early versions of the personal communicator lie, however, with the limitations of today's hand-writing recognition programs. Like all 'pen computers', Eo's personal communicators are irritatingly poor at reading the hand-written word, frequently misinterpreting even carefully printed characters. With some practice, users can improve their ability to write clearly on a computer slate, Eo maintains, but it takes some getting used to. Instead, many 'mobile professionals' may for the time being opt for a conventional and cheaper notebook computer, equipped with a modem. If you have to sit down by a telephone to send and receive your messages, then tapping out notes and commands on a keyboard becomes less of a drawback. Like early personal computers, Eo's first generation of personal communicators promise more than they can yet deliver. In its rush to be first to market, the company appears to have jumped the gun.</p>

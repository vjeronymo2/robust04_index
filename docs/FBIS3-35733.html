PDAM candidate Nicolae Andronic said that the Central  Electoral Commission (CEC) members are directly influenced by  FPCDM followers. Talking about the basic problems of the  electorate, Lucinschi declared that the eventual unification of  Moldova and Romania, by a Parliament's decision, would be the  "sure way to war" and would mean the losing of the Dniester and  the Gagauz regions, causing interethnic conflicts in urban  centers, most of whose population is not local. Under such  circumstances, the menace of separatism in the republic's north  could appear. In addition, Moldova could lose the support of  the international community. Lucinschi believes that the return  to power of the current leaders, in case PDAM wins the  elections, will be for the world community a guarantee that  Moldova will follow the course initiated in Chisinau. The  parliament speaker added that Moldova has yet no document to  confirm its independence. The declarations on sovereignty and  independence, adopted in parliament, should be confirmed by a  referendum to show the people's will, said Lucinschi.  Commenting the idea of a referendum on the unification,  organized in both Romanian states, Lucinschi considers that in  this case "we will unite with Yugoslavia" and "the war will not  be limited between Prut and Dniester." The parliament speaker  and another PDAM leader, Dumitru Diacov, asserted that the  absolute majority of the population, both in Moldova and  Romania, are against the unification. Lucinschi said that  during the electoral campaign he does not plan any visit to the  left bank of the Dniester River or meetings with Tiraspol  leaders.</p>

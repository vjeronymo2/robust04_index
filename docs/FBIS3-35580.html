			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report followed by editorial note: "...And </F> the Japanese Weekly Has Other Documents in Store"]    [Text] Tokyo -- Following the publication in the Japanese  magazine SHUKAN BUNSHUN of excerpts from a secret report by the  Russian General Staff and comments on it by a very informed  figure under the pseudonym "leader" (see IZVESTIYA No. 16 from  27 January 1994), the topic of "the Russian version of the North  Korean nuclear program" continues to occupy center stage.    It turns out that calculations made by the Russian military  differ somewhat from reports by the U.S. special services,  particularly over the issue of assessing the level of inaccuracy  involved when Pyongyang tested the North Korean missile  "Nodong-1" last May. The Pentagon and the CIA note that the  effectiveness of the North Korean missile is insignificant in  combat terms, and it can be "several kilometers" wide of its  target. Meanwhile in the notes which have been obtained by the  Japanese press, the Russian special services cite other  indicators -- according to the Russian version, "Nodong-1" was  only 100-200 meters wide of its target, which is clearly  adequate for performing combat tasks using a 1-2 megatonne  warhead and a flight velocity of Mach 9. In addition to this  significant detail, specialists are also studying other curious  nuances regarding this matter while noting that the material  obtained by SHUKAN BUNSHUN in Moscow deserves to be looked at in  great detail.    In this connection it makes sense to note that Akira Kato,  the author of the article that has caused such a storm, does not  work at the weekly and is a "free lance" by profession, untied  to any one publication. He speaks Russian, is well known for  his numerous pieces on Russia, and frequently travels to our  country. I managed to locate the person from SHUKAN BUNSHUN who  edited the General Staff material, sent it off for typesetting,  and checked the authenticity of the facts. This was Mr. Kimata.    According to him, the authenticity of the Russian report,  which comprises 36 pages of closely written text, is beyond  doubt; he also has a tape-recorded interview with the "leader"  and a number of other documents which for the time being are  "off limits." Needless to say, the editorial office refused to  identify the "leader," although it indirectly confirmed that  this person occupies an official position in a top department  and is a military officer. The weekly also has in its  possession other material on this extremely explosive issue  which it is preparing for publication.    In a telephone conversation with your IZVESTIYA  correspondent, the author of the article also refused to  disclose his sources of information in the Russian General  Staff, but he confirmed that his meetings and conversations with  servicemen in Moscow were deadly serious and that a detailed  transcript has been made of all the facts which he gathered in  the Russian capital.    From the Editorial Office. Neither today nor in its previous  edition did IZVESTIYA claim that the report in the Japanese  weekly was 100 percent truthful. In our view, this is not the  most important point. It is clear that a Japanese journalist  working on his own would not have been able to manufacture such  a "bombshell" and that he was helped to do so by Russian  sources. It is still unclear which ones precisely.</p>

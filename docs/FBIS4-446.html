			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, 10 Apr (AFP) -- The Zairean radical  opposition abroad today in Brussels rejected the recent adoption  of a new constitutional act, and accused Monsignor Laurent  Monsengwo, the president of the High Council of the  Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-TP) of "betrayal."    The "Committee of Zairean Opposition of Forces in Favor of  Change" (COZAFAC), whose delegates from France, Germany, the  United States, and Belgium met yesterday in Brussels, observed  in a communique that Monsignor Monsengwo "betrayed the people by  selling out the achievements of the Sovereign National  Conference." The COZAFAC called on the Zairean opposition to  reconstitute themselves around Etienne Tshisekedi, elected prime  minister by the national conference in August 1992 and dismissed  by Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko in January 1993.    The HCR-PT on 31 March adopted a new "constitutional act,"  which is supposed to govern the democratic transitional period  in Zaire toward a Third Republic. On 8 April, Monsignor  Monsengwo announced that an agreement was reached on the  procedure for the appointment of a future prime minister.</p>

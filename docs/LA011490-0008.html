			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I and many of my friends take strong exception to the letter that said  "Anything But Love" is "Anything But Funny."  </P> <P> This show is one of the freshest comedies of the season. The writing is  exceptional and the acting is superb. My friends and I would like to commend  the creators of this unique and refreshing show and would highly recommend it  to anyone who wants to enjoy a good laugh.  </P> <P> Paul R. Mickelson, Los Angeles  </P></p>

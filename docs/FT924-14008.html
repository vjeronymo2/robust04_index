			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / North-west confidence nosedives A WARNING that north-west England faces a serious loss of manufacturing and business capacity without a significant increase in economic activity was issued yesterday by the area's chambers of commerce. The chambers' regular quarterly survey for the July-September period shows a huge slide in confidence as orders fell sharply. While 34 per cent of manufacturers expected an improvement in profits in the next 12 months, 33 per cent forecast deterioration. The difference between the two of 1 percentage point is the trend indicator; it was 30 percentage points in June. Manchester chamber's economics committee called for a short-term stimulus, which it said was unlikely to affect inflation much while demand was so low. It said there would be further serious losses of industrial capacity without significantly higher activity. 'The deteriorating position is reflected in reduced domestic orders, continuing low capacity utilisation and poor cash flow,' the committee said. The survey shows that nearly all improvements in trends in the last 12 months were wiped out. Manufacturing investment has been cut and more than 80 per cent of companies have spare capacity. The study covered 427 manufacturers employing 52,400 people, 289 service-sector companies with 30,600 employees, and 31 businesses not classified by sector employing 5,200 people. Although service-sector businesses show a 12-point positive balance - 39 per cent forecasting improvements versus 27 per cent predicting falls - that contrasts with a 50-point balance for the second quarter. The slide in business confidence is the result of a marked deterioration in domestic orders. Only 26 per cent of manufacturers and 31 per cent of service providers report more orders than in the second quarter, compared with 44 per cent and 33 per cent respectively, which report falls. Export sales faltered, with the second quarter's positive balance of 14 percentage points among manufacturers dropping to 3 points. Employment markets worsened, after five successive quarters of slowdown in job-shedding. There was a significant drop in the balance figure of companies expecting to take on more labour - from 7 percentage points to 1 point. Cash flow difficulties are described as 'serious'. Only 19 per cent of businesses saw an improvement and 33 per cent saw a deterioration. The 10 chambers in the survey cover Greater Manchester and Lancashire.</p>

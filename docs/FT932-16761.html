			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Travel: Angry Brits, Maltese cross - Justin Wintle bounces along the bumpy back roads from medieval forts to dusty race tracks I KNOW I should not be here. I am in an hotel overlooking the stark blueness of Melieha Bay, in the north-eastern corner of Malta. There is no money in my bank account at home. The only reason I am here is by chance invitation. I remove my clothes, put on my bathing trunks and swim for 40 minutes. I do not mess around. I swim lengths - the proper Anglican way to bathe. It must hurt a little. Then I try lying in the sun. Suddenly, for no good reason, one of the party I am with tells me that everyone she has ever known has lost everything at some point in their lives. Later we sit round a table in one of the hotel's many lounges. Square pillars and yellow umbrellas abound. So do the British: the blue rinse brigade and their spouses. Wednesday: I make a supreme effort to relax. Instead of lengths I try circles. Tomorrow I will hire a car and look at the island. Lying on my belly I flick through the Air Malta flight magazine. A waiter who looks like a badly melted Elvis Presley glides up to my sunbed and asks: 'Can I take your ordure now?' Maltese English, presumably acquired from airmen 30 years ago, knocks the living daylights out of me. I request a Bacardi-and-ice and return to the magazine. By coincidence the first article is about Melieha Bay. The writer, Marie Benoit, waxes lyrical about the parish church, dedicated to the Nativity of Our Lady. 'God,' she writes, 'is already famous but it does not stop the sacristan from ringing the church bells at various times of the day.' The waiter brings a gin-and-tonic. As I fall asleep, I am sure that my waiter, collecting my empty glass, says to me: 'I need some fresh hair. I think I'll go for a troll.' Thursday: No, I will not hire a car today. I will hire one tomorrow. It is bright and blazey again, I write a postcard to my publisher, then one to my bank manager. Back to lengths, and far happier for it. Friday: It is entirely up to you whether, on such dual-carriageways as there are, you over-take on the inside or outside. The Maltese seem less interested in travelling than in parading themselves and their cars, a disproportionate number of which are Humbers and Hillmans (old British makes). They decide which part of the road they want to occupy, and then do so. Most accidents are caused by the dazzle of untarnished chrome. The contraption I hire, from a garage in Melieha village, has all the thrust of a handmower. Perhaps, for this reason, its owner declines to ask for my licence, or even whether I have one. Or it might be because he thinks all male adult Britons are fighter pilots. Away from Malta's well-hotelled littoral, the landscape bears a tremendous likeness to a bombing range. The soil is minimal, vegetation non-existent and the field divisions marked by crooked rows of rubble. One remembers that Malta is a much fought-over piece of real estate. The stirling defence of the island in the second world war against the Axis air squadrons was but the most recent in an endless succession of battles. The Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans, Saracens, Normans, Spanish, Italians, French and British have all come and gone. Most famously in 1565 the Knights of St John held out against an awesome Ottoman task force that threatened to convert the Med from a Papal lake into a Moslem lake. Had they succeeded, my little holiday might have been a trifle different. As it is, the latest conquerors - the package tour companies - have hoisted their pennants and invaders are channelled through the immigration desks at Luqa airport. There is no telling which of the bits of stone that unpredictably enliven our journey are archaeologically significant. As best I can, I bounce my party into Valetta, the smack and crack of my friends' heads against the roof, together with their wailed distress, are becoming wearisome. Sure enough, when eventually we arrive before the very gates of the citadel, warfare erupts. My passengers, strongly married to each other, start airing ancient grievances. The sites remain unvisited. My party scatters to the four points of the compass. It takes two hours to round them up and persuade them to sit at the same table in a pizza parlour. Margeritas momentarily quell the mutiny. Then the bill arrives, and all hell breaks loose again. I play my trump card. I have the car keys, so I am the transport manager. Nobody wants to bus back to Melieha Bay, I tell them. Instead, to restore morale, I drive everyone westwards across the island to the spectacular Dingli Cliffs. Sunday. I hive off by myself. Insisting that the garage in Melieha replace my vehicle with a proper means of conveyance, I become well acquainted with the island's signposts. Mdina and Rabat, ancient townships in the centre of Malta, I come to know especially well. I feel I am at some plein-air cocktail party. I keep being button-holed by the same forgetful guests. Little by little, though, I home in on my target: Halfar, pronounced how far? What goes on there on a Sunday afternoon is 'Off Road Autocross'. There is not a tourist in sight. Instead, around the perimeter of the track, there is an unbroken corrall of clapped-out cars full of the young. From time to time a door opens and a bedraggled teenager tumbles out. If she (or he) is pretty enough, another door opens instantly and she (or he) disappears again. In an adjoining field: drive-in bingo. The photographer in me takes over. I think how nice it would be to create a portrait of a young woman against the swirling dusty backdrop of the racing vehicles. Madonna of the Autocross] At length I find a model. Not the prettiest, but the prettiest are otherwise engaged. She limbers up with a couple of backward somersaults on a picnic rug. Then she poses with her children as her wheelchair-bound husband looks the other way. As I steady my lens, her sister sneaks up beside me. Madonna, she cackles in my ear, has only just been released from mental hospital. Monday. My last chance for the heavy stuff. Again I solo out, before my married friends can intercept. I do Valetta. I marvel at the fortifications, and I marvel at the interior of the Grand Master's Palace. Then I scan the waters of the Grand Harbour. When, in 1565, Fort St Elmo fell, Mustapha Pasha fastened the decapitated bodies of four Knight Hospitallers on to wooden crosses and floated them over to Grand Master Jean de Valette. Valette promptly beheaded some Turkish prisoners, stuffed the proceeds into the mouths of his canon and returned the favour. I scan in vain. Half a battered water-melon in an oil slick is a pale substitute for man's inhumanity to man. On my way back I drop in on the parish church at Melieha. An ancient passage running to the vestry is lined with votive offerings: shoes, boots, babies' garments, crutches, braces, photographs, even the X-ray of a brain tumour, all presented in respect of miracles performed, or miracles anticipated. In the vestry itself there is an exhibition of near-sea-disaster paintings from several centuries. All are the same: a ship foundering amid great waves in the foreground, the Blessed Virgin shining brightly in a cameo in a top corner. The crush of superstition, as dense as in any Chinese temple I have entered in Asia, is all around. Take away the faith implicit in these paintings and nothing could be more vulgar. Or, as we would say in Wales, such a performance of a religion is Catholicism.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: US urged to boost textile exports The president of the US textile industry association has called on industry leaders to accept the reality of international trade and focus on export growth, even in developing countries which produce the goods flooding into the US market. Mr Henry Truslow III, president of the American Textile Manufacturers' Institute, told an industry conference in Florida exports cannot counter the damage caused by phasing out of textile and apparel quotas, but 'we have - and will have - some extraordinary opportunities to do business in other countries.' Textiles companies have been among the most protectionist of US sectors. Since the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, the industry has been split over proposals to favour export strategies, made possible by large productivity gains achieved in the past decade. Mr Truslow called on the industry to 'commit to an export strategy, squeeze every penny out of costs, ensure that the industry has access to raw materials at world prices, encourage the (US) government to make foreign markets an ongoing high priority, and promote tax initiatives, such as a value-added tax which benefits exporters.' Sen Ernest Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat and an industry supporter, says the industry now 'has its eye on the hole not the doughnut.' In the last 12 years, the US has lost more than 500,000 textile jobs and has a Dollars 29bn (Pounds 19.5bn) trade deficit in textiles and apparel. Exports have been growing, but slowly - from Dollars 9.4bn in 1992 to Dollars 10.3bn in 1993. They dropped by 0.8 percent in the first two months of 1994, mostly due to recession. The manufacturers' institute has yet to decide whether it will support the Uruguay Round global trade pact.</p>

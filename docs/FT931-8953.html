			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / PIA calls in Coopers man THE Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body for retail financial services, has appointed Sir Brian Jenkins, a partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to conduct an independent review of membership criteria. The appointment follows a letter in December to the PIA's board from Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board saying the PIA would not be approved as a self-regulatory body unless it raised standards of investor protection. The PIA board said it had asked Sir Brian for recommendations on how to assess the 'fitness and properness' of new applicants, and on standards for members to meet and transitional arrangements to meet those standards.</p>

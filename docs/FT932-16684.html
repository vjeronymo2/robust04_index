			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Dispute dents Italian hopes for broad coalition THE prospects of a more broadly based coalition government being formed after Italy's constitutional referendums on April 18 dwindled yesterday after a deepening rift between two of the most important parties expected to participate. Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), attacked attempts by the majority Christian Democrats to cast doubt on the testimony of 'supergrasses' who have accused senior Christian Democrat politicians of collaborating with organised cime. The participation of the PDS, currently in opposition, in a more broadly based coalition after the referendums is seen as vital if Italy is to have the stronger and more stable government able to pass electoral reform and boost confidence in the economy. Last week the leaders of the Christian Democratic party leadership called on magistrates to investigate whether police collaborators were implicating prominent Christian Democrat politicians to discredit the party. The move followed last month's formal warning served by magistrates in Palermo on Mr Giulio Andreotti, a veteran Christian Democrat and seven times prime minister, that he is under investigation for alleged links with the Mafia. Some Christian Democrat politicians fear the leadership's challenge may backfire given the immense public support now enjoyed by magistrates investigating organised crime and corruption. Mr Occhetto said the Christian Democrats' tactics contradicted claims by Mr Mino Martinazzoli, its new leader, that the party, which has been the dominant force in Italian politics since 1945, was being reformed. In Naples, interrogations continued over the weekend into new strands of the corruption investigations. Mr Mario Artali, managing director of the big state-controlled SME foods group, was interrogated for several hours on allegations that the company, to be partly privatised, provided illegal funds to the Socialist party's newspaper. Separately in Naples, Mr Benito Visca, secretary of the provincial PDS branch, was interrogated by magistrates investigating the privatisation of the city's refuse collection services. Mr Visca is one of the most prominent PDS members to be implicated in the city's scandals. Mr Renato Curcio, leader of the left-wing terrorist Red Brigades, which was active in Italy in the 1970s, could soon be offered a limited form of freedom after 17 years in prison.</p>

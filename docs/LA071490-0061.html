			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHERIFF'S DEPT. SUED OVER HANDLING OF  SLAYINGS  </P> <P> The surviving victim and relatives of four people killed by the estranged  husband of one victim filed a civil rights suit in U.S. District Court on  Friday, alleging that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Sheriff  Sherman Block failed to guarantee "equal protection under the law" to  minorities, women and children.  </P> <P> The August, 1989, shootings in East Los Angeles occurred shortly after Maria  Navarro, who was celebrating her birthday with others at her home, called the  sheriff's emergency 911 line to say her estranged husband, Raymond, "was on his  way to the residence to kill her and others present," the suit said.  </P> <P> The sheriff's dispatcher told Navarro to "just call us if he comes over. . . .  We can't have a unit sit there to wait," according to the suit. But within 15  minutes, Raymond Navarro allegedly entered the house and killed his wife, her  two aunts and a family friend. The suit was brought by Bertha Galvan, who was  struck in the head by a bullet, Maria Navarro's three children and other  plaintiffs.  </P></p>

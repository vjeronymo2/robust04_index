He said:    As already reported, four immediate steps of simultaneous  action for a package solution of the nuclear issue were agreed  upon at the DPRK-USA contact in New York on February 25.    The contents of the agreed conclusions are suspension of  "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises, resumption of  working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys between  North and South of Korea, inspection by the International Atomic  Energy Agency to ensure continuity of safeguards and the holding  of the third round of DPRK-USA talks in Geneva on March 21. The  agreement is strictly based on the principle that the DPRK and  the United States must simultaneously do what they are obliged  to.    After the publication of the agreed conclusions we have  completely fulfilled our obligations with regard to the steps of  simultaneous action.    We have accepted inspection of the seven declared sites  enough for the continuity of safeguards within the time agreed  upon with the IAEA, and unilaterally taken a broad-minded and  magnanimous position at the inter-Korean working-level contact,  thus opening a firm prospect for the exchange of presidential  envoys.    But the United States has not fulfilled its obligation  concerning the steps of simultaneous action.    When the United States announced it would suspend the Team  Spirit joint military maneuvers in 1994, it raised unreasonable  preconditions--satisfactory inspection by the IAEA and  realisation of the exchange of presidential envoys between the  North and South of Korea.    Even now when the inspection by the IAEA for the continuity  of safeguards has ended and several rounds of inter-Korean  working-level contact have taken place, the United States  persistently insists on the preconditions, saying that the  inspection by the IAEA is not satisfactory and the exchange of  presidential envoys between the North and South must be realised.    The IAEA itself recognizes that the recent inspection was  carried out on the basis of full discussion between its  inspectors' group and the operators of the DPRK's nuclear  facilities and that the problems raised during the inspection  were smoothly resolved under the agreement of the IAEA.    As for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North  and South, it is on the verge of realisation, far more  progressive than is signified in the agreement of the New York  contact between the DPRK and the United States, though the  agreement provides only for resumption of working-level contact.  Nevertheless, the United States has insisted on unreasonable  preconditions. It is unjustifiable in every respect.    It is patently contrary to the agreed conclusions reached at  the New York contact between the DPRK and the United States that  the United States has raised as a precondition of the talks the  realisation of the exchange of special envoys between the North  and the South, which is not included in the conclusions.    If the United States persistently imposes unreasonable  preconditions on the DPRK, while failing to discharge its  obligation concerning the steps of simultaneous action, we  cannot but refrain from taking an action unilaterally.    It is clarified in the conclusions that it is necessary for  the implementation of the conclusions to carry into practice  every step of simultaneous action.    So, if the U.S. side failed to discharge its obligation, the  conclusions would become invalid automatically.    We already stated at the New York contact that if the United  States failed to fulfill its obligation, we will consider the  DPRK-U.S. talks to have been foiled and take appropriate steps.    The future developments depend on the U.S. attitude.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NELSON MANDELA'S CONTROVERSIAL TIES TO ARAFAT, KADAFI AND CASTRO  </P> <P> In reply to "Hero's Welcome for a Man U.S. Betrayed: Mandela Comes to America"  (by Sanford J. Ungar, Opinion, June 17): I'm again disappointed in how  Americans continue to browbeat themselves for committing perfectly justifiable  acts.  </P> <P> Twenty-eight years ago, when our CIA helped to finger Mandela, the Cold War was  at a high pitch.  </P> <P> Russia and its communist allies were threatening U.S. interests all over the  globe. The threat to South Africa was obviously apparent. A communist takeover  would cut off our raw resources and give Russia a strategic base at the tip of  Africa.  </P> <P> The U.S. did not "betray" Mandela. He was a part of a threat to us at that  time. His present hatred for the U.S., perhaps because of our aid to South  Africa, is readily apparent. Mandela's best friend is Kadafi. He's quoted as  saying, "We consider ourselves comrades in arms" -- referring to Kadafi (Part  A, May 19). Mandela goes on to condemn the U.S. for our retaliatory raid on  Libya in 1986 in reaction to Libyan-sponsored terrorist attacks.  </P> <P> This is the same Libya that furnishes terrorists with Semtex, their favorite  explosive. The same Libya that's rebuilding its poison and nerve gas  facilities. And this is the same Mandela that supports PLO terrorist Arafat  with hugs and verbal assistance.  </P> <P> The Times front page of June 18 points out how fund-raising is the important  part of Mandela's U.S. visit. Perhaps our hard-earned money could be put to  better use.  </P> <P> IRVING E. FRIEDMAN  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Should you opt out? - In the first of three articles / A look at the decision over whether to stay in a company scheme or transfer to a personal plan - Your pension Question: I am a member of my company's pension scheme but have been told I would do better to leave and take out a personal pension from a life company. Is that right? Answer: First, you must consider and compare the benefits provided by the company scheme with that provided by a personal pension. Q. What benefits does each arrangement provide? A. Benefits from a company scheme are set out in the booklet describing it. These can be obtained from the company's pensions department. The benefits from a personal pension are explained in the relevant brochures. Q. What pension would I receive from the company scheme? A. The company scheme provides a pension based on the number of years you have been a member and your salary at or near retirement. Say the scheme provides a pension of 1/60th of salary for each year of membership and you would complete 30 years membership to retirement, your pension would be 30/60ths (one-half) of your salary at retirement. The pension is paid for the rest of your life, with a guaranteed minimum (usually) of five years' payments. Alternatively, you have the option of taking a cash sum (tax-free) together with a lower pension. Under Inland Revenue rules, the maximum pension benefit is two-thirds final salary or a cash sum of 1.5 times final salary and a pension of around half salary. In almost all public sector schemes, retirement benefits consist of an automatic tax-free cash sum and reduced pension - a maximum of a cash sum of 1.5 times salary and a pension of half salary. Q. How does this compare with the pension from a personal pension contract? A. Under a personal pension, the contributions paid (less the expenses deducted by the life company) are invested. The pension is provided by using the accumulated cash sum to buy an annuity. You have the option of taking up to 25 per cent of the accumulated value as a tax-free cash sum and buying an annuity with the rest. You can take the benefits at any time between your 50th and 75th birthday (both dates inclusive). So, your return from a personal pension depends on: 1. The amount accumulated under the contract which, in turn, depends on the amount of your contributions less the charges deducted by the life company. 2. The investment return achieved by the life company until retirement. 3. Annuity rates at the time of retirement. The more you contribute and the lower the charges imposed by the life company, the better the investment performance. The higher the annuity rates, the larger the pension. But at no time is there any guarantee about its value. In contrast, the pension provided by the company scheme is guaranteed as a percentage of your salary at retirement and its value is not related directly to the contributions paid by you into the scheme, nor to the investment performance of the assets held in the scheme; nor to running costs. Q. Which is the better bet? A. It depends. The fact that a personal pension carries no guarantees does not invariably mean you will be worse off. Q. What about increases in pensions to offset the effects of inflation? A. Most company schemes provide guaranteed annual increases. In addition, they usually make discretionary increases on top of these guaranteed increases to offset, at least partially, the effects of inflation. With a personal pension, if you want the payments to increase each year, you must pay for them. Annuities provide a choice of: 1. Level payments with no increases. 2. Fixed guaranteed annual increases. 3. Increases based on the unit price of the underlying fund. 4. Guaranteed increases in line with the RPI. The level pension with no increases provides the highest initial value. The greater the rate of increase in payments, the lower is the starting value. Q. Would my spouse receive a pension when I die? A. With a company scheme, a spouse's pension is provided automatically. It is usually around half the value of your pension and has similar annual increases to your pension. So, the benefits under a company scheme are worth more to a married employee than a single one. With a personal pension, you must buy an annuity with a spouse's benefit. The cost is in the form of a lower initial annuity payment. Q. Suppose I retire early? A. With a personal plan, you will get a lower pension. How much lower depends on how early you retire. The accumulated value will be less because you will have paid fewer contributions and there is less time for the fund to grow, and annuity rates are lower. With a company scheme, you would get a reduction. But many schemes impose less stringent penalties than personal plans, especially if early retirement is through redundancy. Q. What happens if I die before retirement? A. Company schemes provide generous benefits. There is a cash sum, free of all taxes, of up to four times your salary at the time of death, plus a spouse's pension based on your total period of membership had you reached retirement, plus children's benefits. Again, these are worth more to a married employee than to a single. Under a personal pension, your dependents would receive the amount accumulated under the contract at the time of death. Further cash benefits would have to be paid for. Q. What happens if I leave the company ? A. If you have taken out a personal pension, then you simply carry it over to your next job. If, however, you stayed in the company pension scheme, then the position is more complex and will be dealt with in another article. Q. What do I pay? A. Under a company scheme, your contribution is pre-determined as a percentage of your salary, with the company paying the balance of the costs. Many schemes are non-contributory: that is, the employee pays nothing and the whole cost is met by the employer. With a personal pension, you pay what you like. But the employer is under no obligation to contribute - and few do. The employee usually has to pay out of his own pocket, and it needs a significant contribution each year to get an adequate pension. So, if the employer will not contribute and/or the company scheme is non-contributory, an employee should not opt out of a company scheme. But if the company contribution is high, a younger employee could do better with a personal pension. Q. What should younger employees do? A. This depends on their contribution to the company scheme and whether they can join the scheme at a later date. If the employee's contribution is substantial - say, 5 per cent of salary or more - usually they would achieve better returns with a personal pension, at least in the early years. But as time passes, each contribution to a personal pension becomes less valuable because there is less time for contributions to accumulate to retirement. At some point, around mid-40s, the employee would be better off joining the company scheme and stop paying contributions into the personal pension. In this way, the combined pension from the personal and the company scheme is likely to be higher than provided either by the personal pension on its own or by the company scheme on its own. You must, however, be careful that Inland Revenue limits are not breached. Q. Where can I get advice? A. The company pension department can advise you on all aspects of its scheme, and its benefits are summarised in an annual statement. A financial adviser can give a direct comparison between the benefits from a personal pension and those from a company scheme - providing he has the necessary information. But you must make sure that the adviser provides full details of the contracts, including the charges, the life company's investment record, and his own commission/remuneration. Above all, ensure that he gives, clearly, the reasons behind any recommendations.

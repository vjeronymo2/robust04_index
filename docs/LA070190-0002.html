			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC  </P> <P> Reichl's pompous and arrogant statements condemning any location out of the  Westside are evident. For example, Pasadena "doesn't seem to support any real  culinary innovation."  </P> <P> Is Fino in Torrance "worth the trip? Probably not." Fresco in Glendale: " . . .  the effect is to make you feel that you're in some small town (well, actually,  you are)." Sorrento Grille in Laguna Beach: "Orange County, after all, is the  place that only yesterday prided itself on offering footstools and roses to the  ladies . . . and enormous bills to the gentlemen."  </P> <P> Los Angeles is a diversified and large city. Perhaps Reichl should stop  adhering to the Gertrude Stein philosophy ("There is no there there") of  restaurant reviewing and begin acting like a food critic for the second biggest  city in America.  </P> <P> ROGER MORGAN JR.  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

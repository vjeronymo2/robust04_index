			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / KKR to buy Borden food group for Dollars 2bn: Wall Street takeover specialist uses RJR Nabisco shares in deal which may lead to industrial links Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street buy-out firm best known for its Dollars 26bn purchase of RJR Nabisco in 1989, is returning to the takeover trail with the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) acquisition of the struggling US food group Borden. The deal, which will involve Borden shareholders taking RJR stock in exchange for their shares, may also involve a degree of industrial merger between RJR and Borden. Borden's loss of independence had been widely expected. Damaged by a series of ill-judged acquisitions in the late 1980s, the company tried unsuccessfully to sell itself off last year, with KKR and Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, among the rumoured candidates. In the absence of a buyer, the share price then slumped from almost Dollars 20 to last Friday's close of Dollars 11 5/8 . KKR's offer values the shares at Dollars 14 1/4 . Founded in 1857, Borden grew to be the largest dairy company in the US and the world's biggest maker of pasta. It reached crisis at the end of last year with the sacking of its chairman, Mr Anthony D'Amato, and the halving of its dividend. The new management, headed by chairman Mr Frank Tasco, then proposed a disposal programme, including the sale of North America's second biggest snacks business. The plan was criticised by some analysts as inadequate and remains largely incomplete. The KKR deal, which is typically complex in its structure, involves the disposal by KKR of half its remaining 35 per cent stake in RJR to pay for the acquisition of Borden. At the same time, RJR is to issue Dollars 500m of new shares to take a 20 per cent stake in Borden. RJR will also have the option to buy a further 10 per cent of Borden, and will have representation on the Borden board. KKR said the present Borden management team would remain in place. Analysts said there was considerable scope for merger between RJR and Borden, particularly in the snacks market. RJR declined to comment yesterday. However, the deal specifies that if RJR should buy any of Borden's businesses in the future, it may use in payment the Borden stock it stands to acquire through yesterday's transaction. For KKR, the immediate problem is what to do with the loss-making parts of Borden's business, including the dairy division, which makes up a quarter of group sales. An adviser to KKR said no decisions would be made until a definitive agreement was signed in two weeks' time. 'They've barely begun thinking about it,' she said. Analysts commented that the move partly represented a switch by KKR out of RJR, where earnings have improved sharply in recent years, to a more highly geared recovery play. Borden has made heavy losses in the past two years, chiefly because of restructuring charges. Mr Les Pugh of Salomon Brothers said 'it's a very, very smart deal. It's not an industrial merger, but a wonderful piece of financial engineering.' Lex, Page 22</p>

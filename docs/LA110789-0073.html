			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPANDING COUNTY BOARD  </P> <P> I am surprised to see Bill Boyarsky ("Simple Tools in a Complex Era," Oct. 20)  so easily fall into the "bigger is better" syndrome. Yet there it was at the  end of his column, a call to expand the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors, elect a county executive and opt for regional government.  </P> <P> The only thing missing from his description of the county today was lace  doilies.  </P> <P> Voters have already rejected board expansion and an elected executive, and the  Southern California Assn. of Governments has proven itself a papier-mache  monument to regional government; paper because reams of reports are about all  it has accomplished, that and spending lavish amounts of money. In a very real  sense, "regional government" already exists in the close working relationship  the county has with the 86 cities in Los Angeles County. Community needs are  met through the cooperative efforts of local city councils and the county,  which is responsible in such areas as health, mental health and courts.  </P> <P> Boyarsky is quite correct on one point: Volunteers can't pay for a new jail  today. Soaring crime rates and construction costs changed that. Still, the  existing, five-member Board of Supervisors has been modern enough, again with  the voters' help, to respond to severe jail overcrowding with action to add  more than 7,000 new jail beds.  </P> <P> It's the same board, responding to the public's demand, that streamlined county  government and increased efficiency by consolidating an unwieldy 58 county  departments into a functional 38 and, implemented privatization, hardly acts of  intellectual and political gridlock.  </P> <P> The commission system is a proven and successful tool. It was the Institutional  Inspections Commission, for example, whose members brought forward the need for  the new Catalina Sheriff's Station and jail now in operation.  </P> <P> No, bigger isn't better, an elected executive isn't going to improve county  government, only divide it, and a larger Board of Supervisors isn't a panacea;  rather, it's an invitation to the kind of inaction and blame-shifting that  allows infrastructures to crumble -- at the expense of the taxpayer.  </P> <P> There are no doilies in county government, just dedicated staffs working very  hard to meet the people's needs.  </P> <P> DEANE DANA  </P> <P> Supervisor, Fourth District  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 20 (AFP) - Bosnian  Croat "bandits" have blocked a convoy of about 100 trucks loaded  with humanitarian food aid south of Sarajevo for the last two  days, a Bosnian military spokesman said Friday [20 May].  Colonel Ekrem Advic said the convoy, with 200 tonnes of food  supplies, had been heading to the hard-hit Tuzla region in  northeastern Bosnia. He said the assailants holding it up near  Grude, south of Sarajevo, were Mafia-like "criminals" and said  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman "should get rid of them."    The Grude region is a stronghold of Croat extremists who  back  Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban. The spokesman said should the  recent accord for a federation between Croatia and Bosnia be  applied, the assailants "would face execution." He was  referring to an agreement reached this month in Washington  planning for a federation to end conflict between Bosnians and  Croats, erstwhile allies in Bosnia against the Serbs. The  accord in time calls for a joint army.</p>

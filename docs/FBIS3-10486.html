			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Carlos Menem by Jose Olmo y Losada </F> in Buenos Aires; date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Olmo] Are you concerned  about the image of yourself and your government which may exist  in Spain?    [Menem] I do not know what image of myself or my government  may exist in Spain, but I believe that Argentina has become a  center of attraction internationally. It is one of the  countries with the highest growth rates in the world, in third  place after China and Thailand, and, with respect to the Western  world, one of the most developed of the past few years.  Investments are still coming in, and there is a very good level  of wages. The highest wages in the Americas (if we leave out  the United States) are paid in the Argentine Republic. Poverty  has fallen spectacularly, to such an extent that from 30 percent  structural poverty in 1989 we are now at 12 percent. And  marginal poverty, which is hardship, has fallen from 10 percent  in 1989, when I took office, to 2 percent at present. Stability  persists, and inflation, if we measure it from January of last  year to January 1994, does not exceed 6.5 percent. According to  the budget forecasts, inflation will not exceed 4.5 percent this  year. There is peace; there is calm. I do not know what image  people in Spain may have of Argentina and my government, and  whether this is due to the dishonesty of some section of my  country's news media, which may have influenced Spain, but the  impression which we have is that Argentina's image in the world  is excellent.  <H5>  Personal Image </H5>   [Olmo] Do you believe that there is some anti-Menemist lobby  in Spain which obstructs Spanish-Argentine relations?    [Menem] I have no knowledge of this, but it could be so. If  we are speaking of anti-Menemism, we would have to speak of  anti-Argenitinism. This government represents Argentina, is the  government elected by the people, and I can see no reason why  this kind of situation should exist. It may exist, but this  does not harm in the slightest the image of Argentina or its  government -- one of the most progressive in the world.  [passage omitted]    [Olmo] Is there subversion in Argentina? Could another  Chiapas happen here?    [Menem] There is no subversion in Argentina. Some kind of  tinge of subversion has occurred -- the case of Santiago del  Estero -- but measures have been adopted and this is under  investigation. But there is no subversion in the Argentine  Republic; it does not exist, and it is absolutely impossible for  what happened in Chiapas to happen here. The Mexican Government  itself has acknowledged the extreme poverty in which those  communities in Chiapas are living, but, moreover, there is an  ethnic problem and a religious problem there; something that is  not the case in Argentina. There is no possibility of  subversion here. What happened in Santiago del Estero was  caused by some kind of infiltration, and this explains the  remarks of Daniel Ortega -- the Sandinist leader -- in Cuba a  few days ago, in which he justified armed struggle and gave  Chiapas and Santiago del Estero as examples. What happened in  Santiago del Estero was facilitated by the terrible political  administration. The province's leaders were not paying wages, or  those of the highest ranking officials were increased unduly,  leaving those of the other public employees very low. But the  situation has now been completely restored to normal, and if you  look at a scale of the wages earned by Argentine teachers, you  will be able to ascertain that those of Santiago del Estero are  now the highest in the country.    [Olmo] Why is nothing as yet known of the alleged  activists who caused the incidents in Santiago del Estero?    [Menem] This is being investigated, and Daniel Ortega's  statements exempt me from making any comment. If Daniel Ortega  gives Santiago del Estero as an example, it is because there  were people there who were brought in by these elements; death  traffickers, because subversion is death trafficking. What they  cannot achieve within the framework of democracy they are trying  to impose by force. You cannot justify armed struggle like that  for no particular reason. Clearly, there were people of this  kind, infiltrated into the uprising, in Chiapas, too.  <H5>  Conflict with Chile </H5>   [Olmo] Chilean flags have been burned in Argentina and  Argentine flags in Chile. The cause is the territorial dispute  over Laguna del Desierto. Will this tension between the two  countries ever cease?    [Menem] This matter of the Chilean flags burned in Argentina  was a result of some trade union leaders' irrationality and  uncouthness, but in any event those same leaders later expressed  their regret at what happened with an apology to the Chilean  people. We deem this matter closed. We regard the burning of  the Argentine flags as an act of retaliation for what happened  here. The burning of neither flag is justified in any way. We  have resolved 22 out of the 24 border problems which we had with  Chile through our doing -- President Aylwin's and my own. The  border problem of Laguna del Desierto is under international  arbitration, and we are quite confident that the court's ruling  will favor Argentina's aim that matters should remain as they  have stood since the 1902 treaty. It is Argentine territory,  occupied by Argentinians, and recognized as such by Chile until  1958, when it adopted another stance. [passage omitted]</p>

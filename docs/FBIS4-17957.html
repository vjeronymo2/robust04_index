			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marat Salimov: "Shaping of CIS Legal Space. </F> Information-Legal Integration May Become Reality"]    [Text] The results of the conference that ended yesterday,  on "Legal and Information Problems of Creating a Single Economic  Space of the Commonwealth of Independent States," may have a  certain impact on the progress of integration processes in the  CIS. If the governments of the CIS countries go along with the  conference participants' initiative on the creation of a  specialized coordination council, a single information and legal  space may be created on the territory of the former USSR.    International experience shows that at present, cooperation  between states in the sphere of information may provide the  basis for boosting integration processes in the economic area.  It is quite possible that the international conference, "Legal  and Information Problems of Creating a Single Economic Space of  the Commonwealth of Independent States," sponsored by the  Russian State Legal Administration under the president's staff,  has already laid the "cornerstone" in the foundation of an  economic union. The conference participants' good intentions to  make their contribution to the construction of the  Commonwealth's building, however, can hardly be implemented  without government support. This support more likely than not  is in evidence at the level of the Commonwealth's interstate  organs. One indirect evidence is the participation in the  conference of CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korochenya.    The conference participants passed an "Appeal of the  Conference Participants to the Heads of States and Parliaments  of CIS Member Countries." It proposes to develop a single  conception of an interstate exchange of legal information within  the Commonwealth framework. Importantly, in the opinion of the  conference participants, the main components for an effective  exchange of legal information should be suitable coordinating  structures to be formed within the CIS framework, and personnel  skilled in the management of state affairs, highly skilled free  market economy specialists to be trained at an interstate level.    The conference decided to organize work on an interstate  basis to evolve a conception for the forming of a single  information and legal space whose result should be the creation  within the Commonwealth's framework of an interstate system of  legal information that would foster the formation and  development of the Commonwealth's economic space. A decisive  contribution to information integration could be made by a  coordinating council on the provision of legal information  around the CIS whose creation was proposed by the conference  participants. The council is supposed to be made up of  representatives of all CIS member states. The council is  supposed to carry out the legal analysis of normative-legal  documents in effect on the territory of the CIS member countries  and submit the results of this analysis to the state organs of  the Commonwealth countries.</p>

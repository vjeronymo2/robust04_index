			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Miyazawa reshuffles his cabinet to revive confidence: Most senior positions in Japanese government go to faction officials, including several implicated in scandals MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday reshuffled his cabinet ministers in an attempt to restore public confidence in his scandal-tainted administration, which must deal with a series of difficult economic and trade issues in coming months. The reshuffle was heralded by Mr Miyazawa, who has a public approval rating of only 14 per cent, as a sign that 'factionalism has ended' in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, though portfolios were distributed in line with the present strength of the party's five main factions. LDP officials hoped to focus public attention on the first ever appointment of a woman cabinet minister - Ms Mayumi Moriyama at education - and the rise of the youngest ever cabinet minister. At 39, Mr Hajime Funada, who becomes head of the Economic Planning Agency, is 50 days younger than the previous record-holder, Mr Kakuei Tanaka, later prime minister. But most senior positions were given to faction officials who have waited patiently for a turn at the top, including several who have been implicated in political scandals since the mid-1970s. Two of the new ministers are implicated in the still-running Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, 65, is the new finance minister, and will be confronted by awkward decisions on public assistance to the troubled banking system and on the amount of funds available for a further stimulation of the economy. Mr Hayashi, fluent in English, is a former diplomat, and served for a time in Brussels. While Mr Hayashi is said to be an expert on taxation matters, and played an important role in passing legislation letting Japan send military personnel abroad on peacekeeping missions, his most important quality is that he is Mr Miyazawa's right-hand man. The resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the godfather of the LDP, has left the party without a policy 'fixer', and Mr Miyazawa hopes the appointment of a close aide to the Finance Ministry will increase his own influence over economic policy. During his first year in office, Mr Miyazawa has appeared to be captive to the wishes of more powerful faction heads, but wrangling within the powerful Takeshita faction has provided an opportunity for him to appear more assertive. The faction's split was formalised yesterday when Mr Tsutomu Hata, the outgoing finance minister, announced the formation of a new faction. Mr Yoshiro Mori, 55, was appointed minister of international trade and industry, and will be partly responsible for reaching agreement in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. 'I believe in free trade, and I believe that Japan has to do what it can to encourage free trade,' Mr Mori said. However, he will not have the final word on the controversial issue of rice imports, which remain the responsibility of Mr Masami Tanabu, 58, who retained his post as agriculture minister. Mr Tanabu returned yesterday from meetings in Washington and Brussels, where he attempted to justify Japan's ban on rice imports. It is understood that other LDP officials were reluctant to take the agriculture post, as none wants to be remembered as the minister who opened the door to foreign rice. Apart from rice, a test of strength for Mr Miyazawa's new cabinet will come in its response to political reform proposals from a senior LDP committee, which recommended that single-seat constituencies replace the scandal-prone multi-seat system. However, a single-seat system would also undermine the influence of faction heads such as Mr Miyazawa.</p>

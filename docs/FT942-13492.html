			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / 'Rottweiler of Lime Street' reopens attack A former senior Lloyd's market figure who campaigned fiercely in the late 1980s against alleged abuses at Lloyd's of London has gone back on the offensive after the attempted suicide of his daughter, herself a loss-making Lloyd's Name. Mr John Donner last week reiterated his call for an external official inquiry into Lloyd's handling of its exposures to asbestosis in the early 1980s, more than four years after the Lloyd's council  - the insurance market's governing body  - rejected the idea after an internal investigation. Once dubbed the 'rottweiler of Lime Street', Mr Donner, 63, was a thorn in the flesh of the Lloyd's establishment until his effective retirement from the market in 1990. He said this week he had contacted several action groups of loss-making Lloyd's Names, and is prepared to act as an expert witness when their cases come to court over the next few years. He said he had decided to resume his campaign following the attempted suicide of his only daughter, Annabel, earlier this month. Ms Donner, who is seriously ill following the attempt, has lost more than Pounds 500,000 as a Name. Mr Donner and his wife between them have additional Lloyd's losses of about Pounds 3m. Mr Donner has alleged that senior Lloyd's figures failed to tell Names - the individuals whose assets support the market  - all they knew about their exposure to asbestosis and that the accounts of a number of syndicates exposed to such claims for the 1979 year should not have been closed at the end of 1981. He also claimed that senior figures at the market used their knowledge of the market's overall asbestosis liabilities to offload their own exposures on other Names. Four years ago an internal Lloyd's team, headed by Mr Alan Lord, then chief executive, found 'no prima facie evidence of misconduct on the part of particular members of the Lloyd's community'. Mr Donner sold his members' agency to Sturge Holdings for Pounds 5.3m.</p>

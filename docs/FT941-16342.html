			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / BBC to unveil reforms today The BBC will today unveil a package of fundamental changes to pay, conditions and grading in an effort to make the corporation more competitive. The changes flow from Producer Choice, the internal market in BBC services launched last year. Producers now have control over their own budgets and have the right to go outside the corporation to buy services. The Producer Choice system, it is believed, has demonstrated that some BBC business units, or departments, are uncompetitive compared with their private-sector rivals. As a result, a number of managers have been seeking greater flexibility on everything from pay and conditions to the corporation's grading system. The move will be seen as highly controversial by the broadcasting unions because of the clear implication that a fragmentation of corporation-wide terms and conditions of employment is about to be unleashed with the possibility that some staff at least will be offered less attractive terms. Details of the package are not yet known, but it is clear that the present system of collective bargaining could be under threat. The BBC would confirm yesterday only that there had been talks on pay and conditions. It declined to say anything before today, when the process of briefing staff will begin. Apart from some differences in terms in separate business units, it is believed the package will involve an element of performance-related pay. Apart from the effects of Producer Choice, which the BBC claims has already contributed to savings of more than Pounds 100m, the pressure for financial change at the BBC is coming from the effects of nearly flat licence-fee income growth and some rising costs. The years of transition from black-and-white licence fees to colour meant sustained growth in BBC income in real terms. That process is now complete although the Government recently agreed that the licence fee would be linked to retail prices for the last three years of the BBC's existing royal charter, which runs out at the end of 1996. Mr John Birt, director-general, promised to turn the BBC into a model public corporation in Extending Choice, the corporation's vision of its future. Mr Birt said in a recent interview that Producer Choice had revealed that some areas were still overmanned and that further redundancies were necessary, but he declined to say how many. A government white paper on the future of the BBC is expected in the next couple of months as part of the decision-making process on the renegotiation of the corporation's royal charter In November the BBC said it was seeking to make further efficiency gains of 13 per cent over the next three years and that savings would have to be made across the board.</p>

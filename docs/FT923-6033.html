			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Plea to lenders on repossessions FEWER PEOPLE might be made homeless if local authorities were informed when mortgage lenders planned to repossess homes in their area, according to a report published today by the London Research Centre, an independent think tank. A survey of English councils found that nine out of 10 councils rarely or never received advance notification of repossessions. The Council of Mortgage Lenders' code of guidance advises lenders to give advance warning where rehousing by the local authority might be necessary. The survey found that local authorities had limited scope to help owners in arrears, apart from delaying repossession until alternative accommodation could be found. Few councils operate mortgage-rescue schemes: just 22 had schemes although a further 25 were planning them. The survey estimates that, among the 19 authorities able to provide figures, only 136 repossessions were halted by mortgage-rescue schemes in 1991-92. No local authority planned more than 30 rescues for 1992-93. However, four out of five councils provided some sort of specialist advice or debt counselling for mortgage arrears, either directly or by funding agencies such as local Citizens' Advice Bureaux. And with lenders adopting a more flexible attitude to repossessions, the report suggests that local authorities may be able to help people with mortgage arrears to reach arrangements that allow them to remain in their homes.

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Germany hits a rich seam of redundancies: Coal mining and the free market IT MAY be hard to imagine, but there is a coal mining industry which has suffered even greater shocks than that in Britain. Since the Berlin wall came down and market forces flooded eastern Germany, more than 70,000 workers mining the low-grade brown coal, or lignite, have lost their jobs. A catastrophe by western standards, such 'rationalisation' is commonplace in an economy which has shed more than 3m workers in just two years. The trauma continues. Another 20,000 coal jobs are scheduled to go. By the year 2000 there will be just 40,000 miners left processing 100,000 tonnes of lignite a year, compared with the 130,000 who used to provide 70 per cent of eastern Germany's primary energy. Rationalisation of the west German hard-coal industry since 1960 has been conducted at a more gentle pace. Labour reductions comparable with those so speedily imposed in the former GDR and a 50 per cent cut in output, have been phased in over more than 30 years. Many of the displaced workers have been absorbed into a growing economy which has created 3m jobs in a decade. The process is set to continue, with steady annual reductions in the workforce of about 7 per cent. But not for much longer. The Bonn government expects to be told by the European Commission to dismantle its controversial coal subsidies and to expose the western industry to the forces which have recently hit Britain's miners. Bonn won some time a year ago, when the government received grudging permission from Brussels to maintain the so-called Jahrhundertvertrag. Under this scheme electricity users pay a levy of 8 per cent on all bills into a government-administered fund used to compensate generators for the cost of using domestic coal. The scheme, into which Bonn injects an extra DM5bn a year, is due to expire at the end of 1995. The Huttenvertrag, which subsidises the use of domestic coking coal to the tune of around DM3bn a year, is due to run until 1997. European competition and energy officials make no attempt to hide their feelings. As Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, EC energy commissioner, said in Wales last week they are unhappy to see expensive German coal still burning while British coal is thrown away. Under regulations being drafted in Brussels the commission wants subsidies scrapped by 1997 on all hard-coal pits with above-average EC production costs. That would spell the end of all west German mines, which extract coal from exceptionally deep and geologically-difficult pits at an average of three times the world market price. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Bonn economics minister, claimed the plan ran counter to the EC aim of secure energy supplies. Mr Cardoso e Cunha replied that this was not an argument which could defend production which was 'totally uneconomical'. Mr Mollemann and the mining industry also face considerable domestic difficulties. Steel makers, long irritated by the constraints of the Huttenvertrag and now struggling to break even, have begun arbitration proceedings in a bid to reduce coking coal prices. Klockner-Werke, which last year lost DM180m on its steel operations, is trying to reduce its annual bill by DM90m. Meanwhile, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister who is no friend to his junior colleague Mr Mollemann and is under pressure from the Bundesbank to control deficits, is insisting on immediate cuts in federal spending. Subsidies, 38 per cent of Bonn's DM425bn budget this year, cannot be expected to evade the axe for long.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Chancellor warns of tight public expenditure round IMPROVED growth prospects in the US and Germany mean that 'growth should become fully established' in the UK this year, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday. But in his first press conference since the election, he warned that a 'tight public expenditure round' would be necessary this autumn, and the government would have to keep 'a very wary eye on the fiscal position over the medium term'. Mr Lamont said a firm line on public spending would be needed because the recession in the UK had lasted longer than expected, swelling the public sector deficit to a forecast Pounds 28bn in the current financial year. He told fellow finance ministers at yesterday's meeting in Washington of the International Monetary Fund's policy-making interim committee that Britain's underlying fiscal position was strong. The lurch into deficit was 'primarily due to the effects of the automatic stabilisers', particularly on the revenue side. The chancellor said he expected Britain's fiscal position 'to improve very considerably' as the UK economy recovered. He defended his refusal to stimulate the economy 'whether through devaluation, premature cuts in interest rates or fiscal expansion'. It would have been 'wholly irresponsible' to engineer 'a boom which would inevitably have been temporary and unsustainable'. Mr Lamont said he expected the end of pre-election uncertainty and improved world economic conditions would unleash pent-up consumer demand in Britain, helping recovery. He was given some encouragement in his view by relatively upbeat assessments of conditions in the US and Germany from Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury secretary, and Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister. 'We are seeing clear signs of economic recovery now in the United States,' Mr Brady said. In Sunday's meeting of ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, Mr Waigel reported that gross domestic product in western Germany increased by 1 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1991. He forecast that growth in Germany as a whole would be 'a good 2 per cent' this year. However, Mr Brady was concerned that growth prospects were less favourable for the US's industrialised trading partners. 'On an aggregate basis, the major industrial countries are experiencing their third straight year of inadequate growth,' he said. Sub-standard growth not only hurt the inhabitants of the industrialised countries, by cutting income and raising unemployment, but - looking to developments in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union - 'it also seriously jeopardises what is probably a unique opportunity in our lifetimes to build an integrated, prosperous global market economy', Mr Brady said. He stressed that a primary objective of the US and the European members of the G7 was to secure a commitment to faster growth through fiscal stimulus and easier monetary policy in Japan. But these calls were rebuffed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister of Japan, and Mr Yasushi Mieno, the bank of Japan's hardline governor. In trying to achieve the goal of a global market economy, the industrialised countries at this year's spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank have focused on the need for stricter fiscal policies. This is seen as the way of securing lower interest rates and stronger world growth. It emerged yesterday that Mr Lamont had led the questioning of Germany's high fiscal deficits in Sunday's meeting of G7 finance ministers. The ministers spent more than two hours arguing with Japan over the need to incorporate into the communique a thinly veiled call for Japan to increase public spending to increase demand.

			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MARSHALL, MADAGAN BATTLE AT FIRST BASE  </P> <P> For an organization whose primary concern in recent years was first place, the  new topic of conversation for the New York Mets is first base. Now that Keith  Hernandez has taken his Gold Glove and his ailing legs to Cleveland, there is  uncertainty at what was the most secured position on the Mets. In reference to  the most famous of all baseball questions, the answer favored here in the first  week of an accelerated spring training camp is two's on first.  </P> <P> The candidates, reading from left-handed hitter to right, are Dave Magadan and  Mike Marshall. Magadan, a line-drive hitter with limited power, was the heir  apparent when Hernandez was told that he would not be tendered a new contract  in the aftermath of the 1989 season. Marshall, a bigger man whose power surges  occasionally have been short-circuited by lower back problems, was acquired  from the Los Angeles Dodgers in December in the trade that sent the unhappy  Juan Samuel to greener pastures.  </P> <P> At the time of the transaction, there was little indication of the competition  to come. Manager Davey Johnson said that he was undecided about using Marshall  in the infield or in the outfield. He hadn't started a game at first base since  midsummer 1988, and of his 836 starts with the Dodgers, 732 were as an  outfielder.  </P> <P> But in the time since the locks were removed at the St. Lucie County Sports  Complex in Florida and the 1990 Mets streamed through the gates, Johnson  developed a Marshall plan. "I'm not going to have him take any fly balls for a  while," the manager said at the start of another prolonged session. The only  glove Marshall removed from his locker Thursday was a black first baseman's  mitt, with a hint of gold at the tip.  </P> <P> "They told me to work out at first," said Marshall, who stayed on the field  after his scheduled time to take short-hop throws from Coach Bud Harrelson.  "I've been around a little while. It's a cliche but I'll do what's best for the  team. They think it's best that I'm at first."  </P> <P> As recently as two years ago, Marshall had to beg off first base because it was  placing added strain on his back. He moved to rightfield, where he started the  last 88 games in the Dodgers' championship season. Nineteen eighty-eight  happened to be the only season in the last six in which Marshall's name did not  appear on the disasbled list.  </P> <P> "First base is more demanding," he said, "but I'm healthy enough to handle it  now. I'm confident I can play there every day."  </P> <P> There is reason to believe that management is envisioning just such a  possibility. Johnson prefers to platoon only if the two players fit the same  slot in the lineup, but Marshall is an ideal fifth or sixth hitter and Magadan  is better suited to the top of the order. Although the manager conceded that  the job probably will not be won before the team breaks camp, he said, "I'd  like to see first base handled by somebody in the early stage of the season."  </P> <P> Magadan said that Johnson hadn't spoken to him about the situation. "But I'm  sure he knows what he's going to do," Magadan said. "He's not going to base it  on 10 spring training games." What about the manager's contention as recently  as two weeks ago that he didn't have a position for Marshall? "I think he did  that to be diplomatic," Magadan said, "to appease me."  </P> <P> It did not go unnoticed that Frank Cashen had referred to Marshall as a "hidden  treasure" after the completion of the deal. The general manager noted Thusday  that the slugger had averaged .270, 20 homers and approximately 80 runs batted  in for each of his full major-league seasons. "In today's lexicon," Cashen  said, "that's considered a superstar. But he's still a relative unknown."  </P> <P> Marshall agreed with the assessment. "I don't complain, do things like that,"  he said. "But I don't think I ever got my due. I protected (Pedro) Guerrero,  then I batted behind (Kirk) Gibson, then Eddie Murray. And the only thing I  ever got attention for was the games I missed with my back."  </P> <P> Truth is, Marshall is an answer to one of the more interesting trivia questions  in recent years. In 1988, Gibson's MVP season, who led the Dodgers in RBI?  Gibson had 76, six fewer than Marshall.  </P> <P> "I had the luxury of batting fifth in L.A., behind the two best hitters,"  Marshall said. "But if I bat sixth here, either me or Dave, the pitcher may be  a little dizzy by the time he got to me. After Howard (Johnson), Darryl  (Strawberry) and Kevin (McReynolds), you're going to be in situations where you  drive in a lot of runs. This lineup should really test you."  </P> <P> Particularly if Marshall can restore some of the right-handed power that  declined last year with the falloff of McReynolds and the disappearance of Gary  Carter. His back sidelined him for the entire month of June in 1989 and it  curtailed his season in September. For the first time in his career, he failed  to hit as many as 16 homers or drive in at least as 50 runs.  </P> <P> Yet, playing in only 105 games, Marshall hit more homers (11) and drove in  almost as many runs (42) as all the Mets first basemen totaled in 162 games.  That may explain why there was excitement in Al Harazin's voice Thursday when  the club's senior vice president watched Marshall drive balls to distant  sections of the field during batting practice. "I think he's going to have a  big year," Harazin said. "He's looked great, and he's motivated."  </P> <P> After putting away his bat, Marshall reclaimed his glove and went to school at  first base long after most of his teammates had headed for the showers. As long  as he performs adequately in the field and stays healthy, the man may find a  steady job in New York. "I want to watch them both defensively," Johnson said.  "I know what both are capable of offensively, but I have a better read on  Magadan."  </P></p>

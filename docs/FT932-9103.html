			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Timex rejects AEEU plea for negotiation TIMEX, the US-based multi-national company, yesterday rejected a call for peace talks from Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering union, to end the three-month strike at its Dundee circuit-board production plant. On a visit to the picket line outside the plant yesterday, Mr Jordan urged the company to enter into negotiations over the re-employment of 343 workers dismissed on February 17. But Timex said in a statement that his call for direct talks could 'not be taken seriously while his union continues to support mass picketing and mob intimidation outside the plant'. Monday promises to be a crucial day in the strike. It marks the end of the statutory 90 days required by law before an employer can re-hire selectively from the workers it has dismissed without facing heavy financial penalties in the courts for unfair dismissal. The company declined to say whether it would re-employ any or all of the strikers yesterday. It did reveal, however, that it had hired 270 replacement workers over the past three months and that it intended to employ a further 230 over the next four months in view of an upturn in demand for circuit boards. Timex condemned a mass demonstration planned by strikers and their supporters for Monday. He said it would give 'rent-a-mob another opportunity to cause trouble at our factory gates'. More than 2,000 supporters of the Timex strikers are expected to turn out on Monday. The National Union of Mineworkers president, Mr Arthur Scargill, is to address them. Yesterday, Mr Jordan criticised Mr Scargill's intervention in the Timex strike. 'Our union is dealing with a difficult situation and we don't want sideshows,' he said. 'This is not a theatre, these people are in trouble.' The AEEU will be dismayed at the continuing hard line of the company. Throughout the dispute, the union has avoid-ed taking any action that is unlawful and it has gone out of its way to repudiate violence and intimidation. Today, the Scottish TUC is organising a large rally in support of the Timex strikers in Dundee.</p>

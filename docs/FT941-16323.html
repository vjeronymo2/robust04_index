			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Contradictory finding on law firm defections - Legal briefs The increasingly competitive nature of the legal services industry in the US was underlined by a recent California Supreme Court decision allowing law firms to include clauses in partnership agreements designed to prevent partners defecting and setting up in competition. The decision has caused a stir in US commercial legal circles because it contradicts a 1989 ruling by the New York Court of Appeals that such clauses amount to an unlawful restraint of trade. The New York court ruled that any clause in a partnership agreement providing for the witholding of profit share if a partner defects would amount to an unfair restraint on a lawyer's freedom to practise where he chose and could also interfere with clients' rights to instruct the lawyer of their choice. But the California Supreme Court, in its December decision, said that law firms should not be treated differently from other business partnerships which are allowed to enter into such anti-competitive agreements under Californian law. 'A revolution in the practice of law has occurred requiring the economic interests of the law firm to be protected as they are in other business enterprises,' the court said. The case arose after the defection in 1987 of several partners from the Los Angeles firm of Parker Stanbury Babcock Combs and Bergsten to set up the rival firm of Howard Moss Loveder Strickroth &amp; Walker in nearby Santa Ana. The partners claimed they had been denied their share of the profits for unbilled work and work in progress when they left.</p>

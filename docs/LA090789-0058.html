			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The White House Office of Management and Budget was blamed for the inability of  government statisticians to track significant changes in the economy and their  effect on people and businesses, even while spending some $2 billion this year  trying. While the skills of workers are increasingly recognized as key to  economic growth and improving the nation's competitiveness, the government  spends nearly seven times more collecting data on agriculture than education,  said the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. The report cited cuts  in the budgets of most agencies for collecting and analyzing data during the  last eight years and a resistance by OMB officials to allow new surveys sought  by statisticians.  </P></p>

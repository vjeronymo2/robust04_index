			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> GLENDALE SYMPHONY BEGINS 66TH SEASON  </P> <P> A new era in its seven-decade history began for the Glendale Symphony Saturday  night, when Lalo Schifrin, formerly a frequent guest conductor, now full music  director, opened the orchestra's 66th consecutive season.  </P> <P> Only one brief speech marred the main business of the evening in the Dorothy  Chandler Pavilion; that was the introduction to the audience of the conductor  by board president Donald Platz. After that, the music itself dominated.  </P> <P> Schifrin, a musician who wears many hats, seems comfortable in most styles,  though his particular strengths as a conductor may lie in his expertise as a  composer dealing with music of his own century.  </P> <P> The surprise of this performance, then, was in Schifrin's careful but  propulsive -- sometimes almost breathtakingly quick -- drive through  Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. Despite the speed, this was a reading both  stylish and clarified, and never rushed for the sake of rushing.  </P> <P> Even at its best, the Glendale ensemble has seldom demonstrated as much finesse  of phrasing and dynamics as Schifrin seemed to elicit in this performance. In  fact, in the program-opening "Huapango," by Moncayo, some of the rhythmic bite  and instrumental energy characteristic of this group of first-rank players  seemed blunted, over-smooth.  </P> <P> The thrills -- known and reliable -- in Rachmaninoff's C-minor Piano Concerto  did not arrive as frequently as anticipated on this occasion.  </P> <P> Vladimir Viardo, the Soviet pianist who returned to this country in 1988 after  a long hiatus, proved a rhythmically unstable, if technically adequate, soloist  -- speeding up, slowing down and generally stretching the musical arch  seriously out of line throughout. How Schifrin and the orchestra kept their  wits about them is a mystery. DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

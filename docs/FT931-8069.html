			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Records: Whistling a happy tune - Richard Fairman rounds up the musicals IT IS ten years since Leonard Bernstein went into the studio to make a modern recording of his 1950s hit, West Side Story. The success of that project started a trend which is still in full swing today. A stream of other revivals has followed, some going for glitz with all-star casts, others archive-worthy recordings using all the tools of musical scholarship. The question is - what makes a musical deserve immortality? The King and I is one that has never fallen from favour, which is presumably because it has two crucial ingredients. The story still feels up-to-date, as it manages to combine both sexual and racial issues, and the score has a wealth of good songs. Philips's new recording of the show, following on other Rodgers and Hammerstein favourites given the 1980s treatment, offers 75 minutes' worth of music, which makes it a good deal longer than the famous old soundtrack with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner (though not the 1977 Broadway revival album). Completeness, however, is only half the story. Like most of the new recordings of the last decade, this one has never been near a stage. At all those moments when the music should make the listener want to get up and dance, John Mauceri and his orchestra have their noses in the score, making sure textures are nicely balanced, rhythms neat, speeds judicious. There is just not enough showbiz excitement around. Admittedly, it cannot be easy to remake The King and I without the King. (Yul Brynner, star of the show from day one, played the part more than 2000 times.) Ben Kingsley would seem a good choice for the role, but in practice he is tame, lacking the 'controlled ferocity' that Richard Rodgers so admired when he saw Brynner in audition. The supporting cast includes Lea Salonga and Peabo Bryson, the latter sounding quite adrift, as the young lovers who 'kiss in the shadows'. Marilyn Horne makes a guest appearance for Lady Thiang's big solo. Roger Moore and Martin Sheen, no less, turn up in bit parts. The outward impression is of a constellation of celebrities. But, in the end, there is only one star in it. Julie Andrews had never appeared in The King and I before this recording, but if ever an actress and a role seemed destined for each other, it is Miss Andrews and the fair-minded, well-educated British Governess, always ready to 'whistle a happy tune'. The voice is still delightful; every word is made to count. For her, at least, the disc rates high as a comeback album. Brigadoon is mere escapist fantasy. The interplay between the sexes is pure 1940s romance; and if the clash of cultures experienced by two brash young Americans stumbling upon a mythical village in the Scottish highlands was meant to have any political relevance, that has long since faded into the background. What is left is a gentle love-story cloaked in the mist of Scottish legend, set to a sentimental score in the most typical Lerner and Loewe style. This new EMI recording is also a studio production and by rights should also have turned out untheatrically flat. Instead, it is a delight from start to finish. As Tommy and Jeff approach the spot where the village of Brigadoon is about to materialise for its single day of the century, a choir of voices is heard in the distance. A haze comes over the sound and the Brigadoon magic starts to work. Just enough of the dialogue is spoken to allow the listener to follow the story and the result is a recording which captures both the letter and the spirit of the musical. Again, there is more of the score than usual. Neither the original Broadway cast excerpts (recorded on six 78s) nor the film soundtrack in its current CD incarnation goes much beyond the half dozen favourite numbers. This recording includes extra dance material and background music, all woven carefully together. It has a lovely Fiona in Rebecca Luker and a dreamily romantic Charlie from John Mark Ainsley, while Brent Barrett's Tommy, fresh-voiced and eager, is the match of any that has gone before, Gene Kelly included. Only the Scottish accents give pause for thought: not many of these would dare to be heard North of Watford. There is not much social comment to be found in Lady, be good] either. This was the first success of the George and Ira Gershwin partnership, dating from 1924, before the brothers were so ambitious as to take on shows like Let 'em eat cake - topical, satirical musicals, with a message. The term 'musical comedy' might have been invented for Lady, be good], since the book amounts to little more than a peg of a comic sketch, on which a selection of typically stylish Gershwin songs are hung. The original Broadway cast included Fred and Adele Astaire, Ukelele Ike and a popular piano duo. All needed - and were given - solo opportunities. The clutch of songs includes, as well as the title song, the duets 'So am I' and 'Hang on to me' and, most famously, 'Fascinating rhythm'. As stars joined or left the show, other musical numbers came and went. In trying to put together authentic recordings this Gershwin series has been working overtime. Lady, be good], which never existed as a single score, poses more questions than can be answered; but the present CD includes all the major numbers associated with the show either in the original orchestrations or new ones as close in style as possible. The show may not add up to more than a series of party turns - but those are certainly winners. Scrooge began life not as a musical, but as a film. Instead, a theatrical version, using the same book and music by Leslie Bricusse but with extra songs, was playing at Birmingham's Alexandra Theatre. A recording of that production has since appeared and it is vividly headed by Anthony Newley as Scrooge, who manages to tread a subtle line between deep-seated misanthropy and just-pretend grouchiness. The music follows in the traditional line of British musicals - homely stuff, given a helping hand to lodge in the memory by the inclusion of a few well-known carols. Jon Pertwee and Stratford Johns also join in the performance, which has plenty of seasonal energy. Nine is a Broadway hit from 1982 that never reached London on stage. Like so many 1980s musicals, it aspired to break new ground. Ostensibly the plot concerns an Italian film director, who sees himself as 'Christ, Mohammed and Buddha' rolled into one. Early on, however, the show evolves into a montage of past and present, reality and hopes, as the director searches for himself in his latest project (Fellini's 8 1/2 casts long shadows). There is a lot of artistic naval-studying, accompanied by not very memorable music. But this recording was taken immediately after a concert performance at the Royal Festival Hall last year and it catches Jonathan Pryce as the over-sexed Guido, Ann Crumb and Elaine Page, all at white heat. If only the revival recordings could muster half its elan. The King and I. Hollywood Bowl Orchestra/Mauceri. Philips 438 007-2 Brigadoon. London Sinfonietta/McGlinn.

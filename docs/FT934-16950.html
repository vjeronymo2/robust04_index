			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Lang attacks Tory rebels ONE OF the prime minister's closest allies yesterday attacked Tory rebels, urging them to back Mr Major. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said the prime minister had delivered all that was required of him and more. 'I hope those whose esteem for themselves outweighs their loyalty to the party will be told . . . to unite behind the prime minister.' In a speech to be delivered in Glasgow, he went on: 'He has seen us through the bad days. Let us make the most of the better days that lie ahead.' A MORI poll for the BBC's Panorama indicates it is government policies rather than the prime minister's personality which has done most to lose the party support. Examining voters in the south-west who supported the Conservatives in 1992, 41 per cent said they no longer support the party and almost a third said they will not vote Tory next time. Forty-two per cent said removing Mr Major as leader would not make any difference to their voting intentions.</p>

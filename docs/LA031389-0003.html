			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> MORE SOLAR FLARES ERUPT AFTER BIG BLAST  </P> <P> More large solar flares, each with the potential to disrupt radio transmissions  and trigger aurora borealis, have erupted on the sun in the wake of an  unusually large blast, researchers at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico  said. A blast 36 times the size of Earth that occurred last Thursday on the  sun's northeast quadrant was possibly the largest ever recorded, researchers  said. Staff Sgt. Leroy Kirkegard said that the huge eruption of gas from the  surface of the sun was followed by another large explosion the next morning and  three more the following day. He said the flare Thursday measured a 4-brilliant  rating, while the blast Friday measured a 3-brilliant. Flares that are big  enough to disrupt radio transmissions are rated by astronomers from  zero-brilliant to 4-brilliant.  </P></p>

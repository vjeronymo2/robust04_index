			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / EU and Russia close to partnership pact The European Union and Russia are preparing a 'partnership' agreement which should lead to a common free trade zone towards the end of the century, European Commission officials said yesterday. The two controversies which have snagged the negotiations for 18 months, over Russian uranium exports and Moscow's treatment of European banks operating in Russia, have been ironed out, and the agreement now awaits endorsement by European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday. 'We have a written agreement from the Russians,' said an aide to Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner who last week arrived at a formula with Mr Alexander Shokin, Russia's deputy prime minister. France, the EU's largest producer as well as consumer of enriched uranium for its nuclear power plants, has been concerned about being undercut by Russian exports of nuclear fuel. The EU as a whole has insisted that Russia's December 1993 decree restricting activities of foreign banks went against the grain and scope of the partnership agreement. On Monday, EU foreign ministers are expected to agree that a safeguards regime against sudden influxes of Russian uranium should operate until 1997. The safeguards would be triggered only after consultations with the Russian authorities, who have agreed to stabilise export flows. In the banking sector, the 1993 decree will not apply to the five banks - ABN Amro, ING, Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale and Dresdner Bank - already operating in Russia before it came into force, and with small exceptions, newcomers will get the same treatment as Russian banks. The main restriction, to be reviewed after five years, will be that EU banks cannot exceed 12 per cent of the total capitalisation of the Russian banking system. The decision on whether conditions are ripe for setting up a full-scale free trade zone will be taken in 1998, although since February most EU quotas on Russian imports have already been removed.</p>

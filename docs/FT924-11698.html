			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar breaks key resistance THE DOLLAR broke through DM1.53 against the D-Mark for the first time in two months yesterday as dealers become increasingly convinced that there will be another official cut in German interest rates, writes James Blitz. All week, the market has been looking for any indication that German rates are about to ease and that the dollar is on an upward path. Yesterday was no exception. The dollar rose to a high of DM1.5365 in European trading, partly precipitated by comments from Mr Erich Fein, the Depiuty President of the Bavarian central bank, who said that the recent rise of the D-Mark has led to a reduction in inflationary pressures as import prices ease. Central bank officials later denied that Mr Fein had specifically commented on the conditions necessary for a cut in rates. But a comment from Chancellor Helmut Kohl that tax increases would be necessary in 1995 to pay off around DM400bn of East German debt added to speculation that the Bundesbank will relax monetary policy as public spending is tightened. The dollar closed in Europe at DM1.5310, up more than two pfennigs on the day. Many analysts believe that the dollar will soar in the aftermath of the US election. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London, noted that the currency had been bought by major investment institutions yesterday, a view echoed by several other analysts. But the currency's moves between now and the US presidential election in ten days time are trickier to call. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, says that next week's economic indicators could underline the sluggishness of economic growth. He believes that the figure for third quarter GDP in the US, due out on Tuesday, may show quarter-to-quarter growth below one per cent. He also believes that consumer confidence figures will also disappoint investors. The Italian lira was the other currency to dominate events yesterday. The Bank of Italy gave several indications that it may be planning to re-enter the European exchange rate mechanism sooner rather than later. First, the Bank announced that it would offer repurchase tenders in foreign currencies next week, an unusual move which underlines its belief that the lira will not depreciate. Dealers said this was compounded by the Bank's covert intervention in European markets yesterday, supporting the lira, for the first time since it left the ERM. The Bank closed the day by reducing the discount rate by 1 percentage point to 14 per cent as the lira closed at L876.1. to the D-Mark, from a previous close of 877.6.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK Company News: BA is to decide on Qantas stake BRITISH AIRWAYS is to decide during the next few days whether to bid for a large minority stake in Qantas, the Australian state-owned carrier due to be privatised next year. The BA board yesterday discussed a possible bid for part of Qantas but postponed a decision to verify a few outstanding issues, the company said. The UK carrier has until next Wednesday to make up its mind to meet the Australian government's deadline for bids. The Australian authorities want to sell 49 per cent of Qantas to institutions and companies, including foreign investors, and float the remaining 51 per cent to the public. BA has for some time been interested in forging a partnership with a carrier in the Asia-Pacific region as part of its strategy to become a global airline. It has been considering putting together a consortium to bid for 49 per cent of Qantas with BA taking a 25 per cent stake itself. This is the maximum allowed for a foreign company under the Australian government's tender rules. BA, however, is expected to face competition from other foreign bidders including Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand which are both interested in an equity partnership with Qantas. A Qantas bid would come hot on the heels of BA's efforts to link up with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier in which BA is proposing to acquire a 44 per cent stake for Dollars 750m (Pounds 493m). Talks in Washington this week between Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, and Mr Andrew Card, his US counterpart, failed to produce any substantial progress in the long drawn out attempts to negotiate a more liberal aviation agreement between the two countries. The US has sought greater access into London for its airlines in exchange for approving the BA-USAir deal. Mr Card has also said he would make a decision whether to allow BA to acquire a 44 per cent stake in USAir by December 24.</p>

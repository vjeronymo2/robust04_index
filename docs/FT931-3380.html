			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE DERIVATIVES sector once again experienced an uneventful session as dealers waited for the outcome of today's Budget speech from the UK chancellor, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the first trade in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, now in its last week of trading, was struck at 2,924, some 4 points above last Friday's close. Early buying saw it rise to the day's peak of 2,935 at around 10am, after which the contract drifted lower with little follow-through buying. General profit-taking saw it fall back to 2,925 over the lunchtime period. The low of the session at 2,915 was seen just before the opening of Wall Street, after which March crawled forward on bargain hunting and the firmness in New York. It closed at 2,921, a slight discount to the underlying cash market. Dealers said the day's turnover of around 10,000 contracts in March was due to rolling forward into the June contract. It saw volume of 5,556 lots. Traded options were also dull and saw volume of 26,281 by the close of business. Trading in the FT-SE 100 option was very poor indeed, reaching only 3,907 lots, while the Euro FT-SE 100 option had business of 1,037 contracts. Amstrad led the way among stock options, trading 1,788 contracts with the September 35 puts the busiest series, followed by British Gas at 1,507.</p>

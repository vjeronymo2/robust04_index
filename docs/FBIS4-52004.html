			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA May 4 -- Vietsovpetro is on target to  record yet another substantial production increase this year  reporting output 1 per cent above its scheduled plan in the  first quarter. This year, vietsovpetro plans to tap 6.9  million tonnes of crude oil, an increase of 600,000 tonnes over  last year's figure, while setting a target of 50 million tonnes  from now to 2000. To reach that goal, vietsovpetro has invested  hundreds of millions of dollars in the purchase of new drilling  vessels, 155,000 tonne tankers, while renewing derrick equipment.    Preparations are being made to begin the operation in the  second oilfield, nearby Rong (Dragon) within this year. Two  rigs have been set up and six wells have been sunk on this new  field. Bach Ho (white tiger) is the first oilfield to begin  commercial production in the country: vietsovpetro has already  pumped over 14 million tonnes of crude oil from white tiger  oilfield. Vietsovpetro is a joint venture between Vietnam and  the former Soviet Union, and has been operating since 1986.</p>

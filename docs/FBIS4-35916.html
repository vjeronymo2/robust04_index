			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Beirut -- According to the latest counts,  released at noon today, 45 persons were left martyred and 85  others injured by the treacherous, savage Israeli warplanes'  aggression against one of Ba'labakk's suburbs in the Lebanese  al-Biqa' Valley. Hospital sources in Ba'labakk said that the  number of martyrs is likely to increase because of the presence  of serious injuries among the wounded.    In a statement on the brutal raid, Lebanese security sources  said that at least three Israeli helicopters took part in this  raid, using machine guns and rockets, and that other planes were  flying at high altitudes to protect them. Reports say that  Lebanese Army ground defenses confronted the raiding planes and  prevented them from staging any landing. MENA said that a  six-plane squadron was supporting the Israeli helicopters and  dropped heat balloons in a precautionary measure to avoid the  Lebanese army's ground defenses. [passage omitted]</p>

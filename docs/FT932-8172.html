			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Pension break-up sought in divorces ENGLISH LAWS should be reformed so that occupational and personal pension rights can be divided following a divorce, says an industry working party report. The Pensions Management Institute and the Law Society have called for sweeping legal changes to clarify the ownership of pension rights, now largely ignored in divorce cases. The failure to consider pension assets leaves many divorced women in poverty in their old age. The unveiling of the report, which has taken 18 months to complete, comes hard on the heels of the first decision by an English court to give a divorced woman a share of her former husband's pension from his small-company scheme. Although Scottish law provides for the distribution of pension rights on divorce, there are no comparable laws in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. But the courts have increasingly taken the view that a pension is deferred pay, and the industry has sought to clarify how it should be distributed in a divorce. The government has been waiting for the institute's report and the findings of the Department of Social Security's Goode committee before planning legislation. Among the working party's chief recommendations are that the courts should have power to share out pension benefits and give orders to trustees and others running pension schemes. In determining how much pension to allocate to the divorced spouse the normal measure of value should be the so-called statutory cash equivalent, which is currently used as the normal basis of individual transfer values payable when an employee switches from one pension scheme to another. The working party suggested four options for splitting pension rights when partners divorce. First, they could continue undisturbed for the main breadwinner but other assets of equal value could be given to the spouse. Second, pension rights could continue undisturbed but a specified portion of the benefit could be earmarked, and eventually become payable to the former partner, when the breadwinner retired. Third, pension rights could be transferred to another scheme just as rights are transferred when workers change employers. And, fourth, the rights could be split within the scheme to offer a separate package of benefits. Pensions and Divorce. Pensions Management Institute, PMI House 4-10 Artillery Lane, London E1 7LS.

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Time Products records 28% improvement to Pounds 3.9m A FIRST-TIME contribution from its Apollo strap business, savings on the discontinued Hong Kong operations and an exceptional gain on sale of investment properties pushed up interim profits at Time Products, the watch and jewellery distribution group. Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 rose by 28 per cent from Pounds 3.04m to Pounds 3.9m. Trading profit increased sharply to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.33m) on increased sales of Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 19.4). Earnings jumped 33 per cent to 5.33p (4.02p). Mr Leslie Michaels, finance director, said a Pounds 300,000 contribution to trading profit from the Apollo strap business, acquired last October for Pounds 6m, was effectively profit-neutral because of financing costs involved in the purchase. Trading profit was also boosted by the exclusion of losses from Remex, the Hong Kong manufacturing subsidiary, the closure costs of which have already been provided for. Trading losses at Remex in the first-half last year amounted to about Pounds 400,000. Mr Marcus Margulies, chairman, said the results were satisfactory in difficult economic conditions. Although the immediate economic prospects remain uncertain, he said, the company was in a fortunate position with strong brands, a healthy balance sheet and experienced management. Increased sales of luxury watches contributed to the rise in turnover, although sales from the volume watch division were down. The exclusion of about Pounds 6m turnover from Remex was partially replaced by sales of about Pounds 5m from Apollo. A Pounds 612,000 exceptional gain came from disposal of three floors of office space at the Remex Centre in Hong Kong, where the company still holds another eight floors. Finance income fell 24 per cent to Pounds 1.09m on lower interest rates and costs incurred in the acquisition of Apollo. An increased interim dividend of 2.75p (2.65p) is declared.</p>

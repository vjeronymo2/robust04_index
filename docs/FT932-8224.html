			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Tensions ease in exchange rate mechanism DENMARK'S ratification of the Maastricht treaty continued to ease tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) yesterday, allowing several countries to cut interest rates and leading to more investment in currencies and bonds outside the D-Mark bloc. The central banks of Denmark, Portugal and Sweden, all of which had followed tight monetary policy to maintain their exchange rates against the D-Mark, cut their official short-term interest rates yesterday. Inside the ERM, Denmark reduced its discount rate by 1 percentage point to 8.25 per cent, while Portugal took 2 points off its 'mop up' rate, reducing it to 13 per cent. Sweden's central bank reduced its overnight lending rate by  1/4 of a percentage point to 8.75 per cent, its fourth successive cut of a quarter point in the past month. The Danish vote also compounded the outflow of funds from the D-Mark into the dollar and European currencies, as dealers took the view that monetary union was back on track. Sterling and the Italian lira both appreciated against the German currency yesterday, despite the Bundesbank's decision not to reduce its official interest rates at its fortnightly council meeting. The German currency also fell to an historic low against the Japanese yen, hitting Y68.05. The yields on Italian, Swedish and Norwegian government bonds have also fallen recently at the expense of German bonds. Their yields were yesterday about 20 to 30 basis points lower than a week ago.</p>

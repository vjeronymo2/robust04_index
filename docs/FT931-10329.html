			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Viewing in about 9.5m homes expected by 2000: FT Satellite Monitor ABOUT 9.5m homes in the UK will be able to watch satellite television by the year 2000, the latest forecasts from Continental Research show. The number is down on the forecast made by Continental in November 1990, when the market research group thought the total would be 10.3m. The revision has been made because of slower growth last year. Of the 9.5m homes in the latest forecast - 45 per cent of the UK total  - 6.8m receive the new television channels via their own dish or communal aerial system and the remaining 2.7m from cable. The latest FT Satellite Monitor, produced by Continental Research, estimates that gross sales and rental of satellite dishes in January totalled 65,000 compared with 70,000 in January last year. Continental estimates that 17,000 of total retail sales last month were upgrades of equipment, replacements of existing equipment or renewals after a break in subscription. This gives a net increase for the month of 48,000. Continental also found a growth of interest from a low level in December with more than 300,000 households saying they would install satellite television. Interest may have been stimulated by satellite coverage of the present England cricket tour of India. The latest Continental figures coincide with the publication by Broadcasting Audience Research Bureau, which produces official broadcasting ratings, of a paper reviewing the work of the three organisations regularly monitoring the growth of the satellite television market. They are Continental, Barb and GfK, the German-owned market research group. BARB estimates are derived from 3,500 face-to-face interviews in the home each month and cover the entire UK for all forms of reception. Barb figures for February 1 estimate that 3.05m homes can receive satellite television, including all form of cable distribution. The latest figure for satellite dishes is 2.323m, an increase of 26,000 since the beginning of January. GfK, sponsored by the ITV Association, uses a series of 10,000 home random samples at six month intervals. These surveys are supplemented by projections from sales data obtained from retail audits and a sample of purchasing behaviour in 25,000 homes. GfK figures exclude Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which could add 50,000 to 60,000 dishes to the total. The latest GfK figures suggest that by November 21 dish ownership totalled 2.01m. Barb believes the single most important number for estimating the size of the emerging market is the number of satellite dishes for private homes.</p>

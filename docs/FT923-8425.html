			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Pilkington to place Dollars 300m debt securities in US PILKINGTON, the glass group, has arranged a Dollars 300m (Pounds 156m) private placement of long-term debt securities with US investing institutions. The funds will be used to repay other short-term borrowings, such as part of Pilkington's Dollars 227m unsecured multi-option facility, which expires in 1995. The deal, first mooted in the spring, was increased from an original size of Dollars 200m when it met strong demand from investing institutions such as insurance companies. The securities, in five tranches, range in maturity from six to 20 years, with an average life of 12 years. In 1990 Pilkington did a Dollars 200m private placement with maturities ranging from 1995 to 2010. The 10-year portion is paying 1.45 percentage points over US Treasury bonds and the 20-year portion is paying 1.75 percentage points over Treasuries, giving an interest rate of under 9 per cent. Although the debt pays fixed rates of interest, the proceeds have been swapped into floating rate funds taking advantage of the current low short-term interest rates in the US. Pilkington's business has been badly hit by the recession as its main customers are in the construction and automotive industries. Profits have fallen from Pounds 325m pre-tax in the year ended March 31, 1989, to only Pounds 77m in the last financial year, although this was after exceptional charges of Pounds 37m. The group also cut its annual dividend from 10.5p to 6p. At the annual meeting last month, Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said that so far, current year results were down on the previous year. At the year end the group's net debt, including finance leases, was Pounds 760.2m, while shareholders' funds plus minorities totalled Pounds 1.15bn. Mr Stephen Schechter, managing director of Wertheim Schroder, which arranged the private placement, said that the group had been given a top rating by the US National Association of Insurance Commissioners. He said that although Pilkington's debt was not publicly rated, he regarded it as a single-A credit. He said that in spite of Pilkington's current difficulties, US investors believed the company would survive the recession. Other UK companies which have raised money in recent months through similar private placements include Dawson International, the knitwear group, Tate &amp; Lyle, the sweeteners company, Senior Engineering, and Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate.</p>

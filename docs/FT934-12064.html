			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: New issues UK corporate financiers may have few takeovers to handle, but they have rarely been busier. There has been a record Pounds 9.6bn worth of rights issues in the first nine months of 1993. That flow of rights is now ebbing - at least partly because almost any company with a plausible tale to tell has already told it at least once. But flotations are filling the gap. Some Pounds 2.7bn has been raised so far this year - including Pounds 140m by four companies yesterday. Management buy-outs and investment trusts figure strongly among fund-raisers. MBOs which have done well are presumably being pressed by their backers to provide an exit route. Those which have done badly are doubtless encouraged to repay debt before their cash flow implodes. And new investment trusts are a consequence of narrowing discounts and the flood of retail funds into collective investments. Some companies are also raising funds for expansion and several quoted groups are selling off divisions to the market. Both routes imply a reluctance to take on further debt for expansion. They also suggest that companies think the equity market is overpaying. Indeed, stock market valuations are currently almost twice those of trade sales which managers price themselves. That chimes with the caution of those company directors at recent interim results who found the level of equities difficult to comprehend. It may mean nothing - managers were, after all, poor judges of the onset of recession. But it will be interesting to see whether fund managers continue to take assets from companies at current prices.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The advantages of buying British - Expatriates MOST expatriates know that non-residence status, combined with placing their savings overseas, is all they need to keep their investment income beyond the reach of UK tax. So, it might be a surprise to learn that British investments can sometimes be more tax-efficient. Take tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas). Anyone is entitled to accumulate up to Pounds 9,000 in a Tessa over five years, free of any UK tax on the income. Of course, your overseas investment income also is exempt whilst your non-residence continues but, by building up a Tessa, you can curtail the tax liability you would face if you return to live in the UK. And the yield is likely to be as good, or better, than anything available elsewhere. Personal equity plans can be even more beneficial, since you can invest Pounds 9,000 every year. A fundamental difference between Tessas and Peps is that, normally, the latter are available only if you are resident and ordinarily resident in the UK (although an exception is made for crown servants who can invest regardless of their status). But many people who regard themselves as expatriates are, in fact, UK resident (sometimes, without realising it). Often, this can arise from making visits to the UK at a time when living accommodation is available there. This does not apply to anyone who has employment or business which (apart from any incidental UK duties) is carried on wholly overseas. But it does apply to air crew, directors of UK companies, sailors, and others who perform substantial (that is, not incidental) duties in the UK and have accommodation available there. The most numerous group of 'resident expatriates' is wives who do not themselves have full-time employment overseas. All these people can, if resident and ordinarily resident in the UK, invest in Peps and there can be considerable advantages in doing so. Consider, for example, a family consisting of resident wife and non-resident husband who propose to return to the UK for residence in 10 years' time. By taking up her full entitlement of Peps every year, the wife could build up a portfolio of Pounds 90,000, plus growth, even before the move takes place and could continue to enjoy tax-free income and capital gains from it indefinitely thereafter. By contrast, all the family's other currently-exempt income and gains become taxable in full immediately the change of residence occurs. Care is necessary, though. Anyone taking up a Pep must declare that they are resident and ordinarily resident in the UK. They cannot do that and deny the effect of that status on any other income and gains to which they are entitled. Consider again those wives without full-time overseas employment. Long-standing Inland Revenue practice - now enshrined in extra-statutory concession A78 - means that many whose husbands are employed overseas for three years or more (or would be, but for some unexpected termination) can be regarded as not ordinarily resident in the UK throughout. They do not have to accept this concessional treatment, but failure to do so could result in UK tax liability on their overseas income (and, as UK residents, they already face such a liability on their capital gains). The problem usually can be overcome by holding most of the overseas investments in the sole name of the non-resident husband, with the wife retaining only those from which the income and gains are covered fully by her available personal allowances. For the aircrew, company directors and the others referred-to earlier, however, Peps are by no means the most advantageous of UK investments available. Because of their status, their salaries - although typically exempt from UK tax because of the 'foreign earnings' deduction (visits to the UK do not exceed 62 consecutive days or one sixth of the overall period with more generous limits for seafarers), will be regarded as 'net relevant earnings'. Those who are not already members of UK approved pension schemes can, therefore, pay UK personal pension contributions of between 17.5 per cent and 35 per cent per annum according to age - although subject, since 1989/90, to an indexed ceiling on pensionable earnings. Somewhat startlingly, such contributions attract a 25 per cent subsidy from the taxman; for each Pounds 1,000 of gross premium, you have to pay only Pounds 750, the balance being met by the Treasury. That, you might think, is the nearest the Inland Revenue will ever get to making you an offer you cannot refuse. Donald Elkin is a director of Wilfred T. Fry Ltd of Worthing, West Sussex.</p>

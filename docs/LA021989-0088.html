			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEMBLOR MESSAGE MOVES FROM DOORWAY TO UNDER A DESK  </P> <P> Conventional wisdom says that during an earthquake, you run to the nearest  doorway and stay there until the shaking stops.  </P> <P> An increasing number of earthquake preparedness experts are suggesting,  however, that people take shelter under a desk or table in an approach called  "Duck, Cover and Hold."  </P> <P> This approach is crucial in high-rise buildings where many interior walls may  buckle during an earthquake because they are not attached to structural beams,  said Michael Durkin, a USC architecture professor who has completed several  studies on the subject.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Something That Offers Protection'  </P> <P> "If you are going to get under something," Durkin said, "you need to get under  something that offers protection."  </P> <P> Doorways can also be hazardous in homes because the shaking can slam doors into  people or objects can fly across the room and injure them, several experts  said.  </P> <P> "Where you take cover depends on the design of the structure," said Paul  Flores, director of the Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project.  "We were concerned that giving the straight recommendation to get under a  doorway may not be the best thing. . . . Getting under a heavy piece of  furniture in a couple of seconds is the best recommendation you can give  people."  </P> <P> Recently, "Duck, Cover and Hold" was promoted at an earthquake preparedness  conference in South Gate, attended by about 300 school officials from Southeast  Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Here's how the approach works: When an earthquake begins, duck beneath a desk  or table, crouch in a fetal position, cover your head by locking the elbows  tight to your ears and hold onto a leg of the desk or table with both hands.  </P> <P> Crouching underneath will enable you to shield most or all of the body with the  desk. The arms protect the head and face from flying objects. Holding on is  important because a temblor may move even heavy furniture.  </P> <P> "Duck, Cover and Hold" is a modification of the "drop and cover" bomb drills  that schoolchildren practiced in the 1960s. In 1984, the California Legislature  mandated earthquake preparedness in all public schools. Drop drills made a  comeback. In part because of Durkin's research, the new approach has moved  beyond the school grounds in the last few years.  </P> <P> Since about 1982, Durkin has studied how people were injured during earthquakes  in Mexico, Chile and California. Dramatic testimony about the reliability of  furniture as shields emerged from the 1983 earthquake in Mexico City where  desks were the only thing that kept floors of buildings from collapsing on each  other like stacks of pancakes.  </P> <P> Although U.S. construction standards are superior to those of Mexico, Durkin  said there is no proof that people are better off standing in doorways during  earthquakes. In some cases, he said, standing in doorways has resulted in  injuries.  </P> <P> "People who stand in the front door of a building that is unreinforced are  subject to getting hit by things falling off the front walls," Durkin said. "I  don't think there are a lot of strong doorway advocates around."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Others Join Movement  </P> <P> In addition to the Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project, others  joining the "Duck, Cover and Hold" movement include the Bay Area Regional  Earthquake Preparedness Project in Northern California, the Downey-based  Earthquake Preparedness Society and the Los Angeles Fire Department.  </P> <P> But one group that still promotes doorways is the American Red Cross. Pat  Snyder, the group's national chairwoman of disaster services, said "the jury is  still out" on whether desks are better than doorways.  </P> <P> "I'm hesitant to change the message (about doorways) based on Durkin's  studies," Snyder said. "If it were a larger study, I think I would have more  confidence in it."  </P> <P> The Red Cross and other agencies are trying to avoid complicated directions for  what to do during a tremor, she said. "I hate giving people too many choices.  It's too confusing," she said. "People won't remember anything. . . . I feel we  should all be singing from the same sheet of music."  </P> <P> However, Snyder said her personal first choice would be to take cover under a  desk or counter. "It's the falling things that are going to get you," she said.  </P> <P> Flores recommended that if there is no piece of heavy furniture available,  people should take refuge in a hallway free from the threat of flying glass or  crouch next to a wall.  </P> <P> When outdoors, people should assume a face-down fetal position on the ground  and cover their heads with their arms, he said.  </P> <P> Snyder said Durkin's research is mostly responsible for more people boarding  the "Duck, Cover and Hold" bandwagon, but Henry Johnson of the Los Angeles Fire  Department said there is also engineering research to support the new approach.  </P> <P> The doorway recommendation is based on "old knowledge about old buildings,"  said Johnson, a fire and safety specialist with the department. "This change is  a natural response to our new information on earthquakes and what they do to  buildings."  </P> <P> In addition to safety advantages, some quake preparedness experts believe that  there are psychological benefits to "Duck, Cover and Hold." Being trained to  duck and hold on rather than stumble to a doorway makes people feel less like  victims of a temblor, said Jan Smith, emergency services coordinator for  Ventura County.  </P> <P> "I cannot say that trying to brace myself in a moving door frame is going to  allow me the psychological comfort that I would have holding on to a desk and  having some control over my body," said Smith, who designed an earthquake  preparedness program for Ventura County's 22 school districts.  </P> <P> "I now look at a doorway and say, 'It's not a structural problem. It's a  psychological problem.' "  </P> <P> Durkin's studies also found that in cases other than a building collapse, most  earthquake injuries occur when people trip or are hit by falling objects as  they run outside or to a doorway. He suggested that people take a few seconds  to assess the situation and decide where to go rather than taking panicky  actions that can result in injury.  </P> <P> Several specialists warned against telling people that they absolutely have to  be either under a doorway or a desk. In fact, Durkin said a major finding of  his studies is that "people have different kinds of risks, depending on the  kinds of physical settings they live and work in."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: CROWD GETS BRUNCH AND TIME OF DAY  </P> <P> And you thought a diamond-studded Piaget was a status watch. Well, the Guilds  of Childrens Hospital of Orange County have news for you.  </P> <P> The timepiece to sport on your wrist at their patron brunch Sunday was a "CHOCO  the bear" watch. No diamond face. No fancy-schmancy band. Just an image of a  grinning brown bear and a plain brown strap.  </P> <P> "I love mine," said Carol Palermo, general chairwoman of CHOC's upcoming  "Island Dreams" fashion show. "The watches are a fund-raising idea of our Jack  and Jill Guild."  </P> <P> CHOCO the bear, the huggable and adorable mascot of Childrens Hospital of  Orange County, was among the 350 guests who swept into the Center Club for the  champagne-laced tribute to fashion show patrons.  </P> <P> But while most guests dined grandly on pyramids of fresh fruit and scrambled  eggs heaped into pastry baskets, CHOCO typically went without. She (Dori  Spydell) was just too busy hobnobbing.  </P> <P> "I love doing this," she said after extending her paw to special guests Nora  and Charles Hester. "It makes me happy."  </P> <P> Not nearly as happy as CHOCO makes hospitalized children, or on this occasion,  the Hesters.  </P> <P> "We're thrilled to be here for the guilds," said Charlie, beaming over his  visit with the gadabout bear.  </P> <P> The Hesters -- for years boosters of CHOC -- will be its honored guests at a  fund-raising dinner April 13. The event will crown the guilds' three-part  benefit, "Island Dreams," which will also launch the hospital's 25th  anniversary celebration.  </P> <P> Deep background: In 1986, the guilds' annual fashion show had become so popular  that it was changed from a once-a-year affair to a back-to-back fund-raiser, an  identical show staged 2 days in a row. "Last year, we had 1,500 guests each  day," Palermo said.  </P> <P> This year, the double fashion extravaganza, by Saks Fifth Avenue, will be  staged at the Anaheim Marriott on April 12 and 13, but with something added:  the same show plus the Hester tribute on the night of the 13th.  </P> <P> Will a tribute become an annual affair? "We're going to wait and see," said  Jackie Powell, tribute-dinner chairwoman (and fashion show chairwoman in 1985).  "We just felt we were ready to see what would happen with an evening show."  </P> <P> The nighttime event will enable working women to attend, Powell explained. "And  it's also for couples. But a woman doesn't need an escort to attend."  </P> <P> Powell said that many women have indicated they will "double book" -- attend  one daytime show and the tribute to the Hesters.  </P> <P> Palermo said it was Charlie Hester who "fluffed up my pillows and propped me  up" when the guilds' board decided to implement the patron brunch a few years  ago.  </P> <P> "I was patron chairman and he donated $5,000 and let us use his membership at  the Center Club," Palermo said. "The event has been a winner ever since. From  this year's patron drive, for example, we have already made $140,000 for CHOC."  The money is earmarked for the hospital's Ambulatory Care Center, an outpatient  facility designed to meet acute care and continuing treatment needs.  </P> <P> Patron event chairwomen were Susan Carter and Fran Paulson.  </P> <P> Principal sponsors of Island Dreams are the Fieldstone Co., the William Garwins  and SensorMedics Corp. Major sponsors are Allergan Inc., the James Andreolis  and TRW/Information Services Division in Orange. Diamond Circle patrons are Leo  and Ruth Cook, Eddie Hopper Chevrolet, the Charles Hester Family Foundation,  Koll Company and the Marvin Weisses.  </P></p>

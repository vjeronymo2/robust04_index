			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Perot refuses to quit US political stage: The Texas billionaire is determined to influence events ahead of presidential elections ROSS PEROT may no longer be running for president but the Texas billionaire still seems to think he can influence the course of US politics this year. Over the weekend several dozen of the state co-ordinators of his non-candidacy gathered in Dallas to discuss the next steps with Mr Perot. Some attempts were apparently made to persuade him to reconsider and, having failed, yesterday's deliberations focused on some unscripted ideas Mr Perot had tossed off in two bizarre television interviews on Friday night. These came only a day after the formal ending of his undeclared candidacy. In them he called on his 'volunteers' to form 'an army of patriots' to put pressure on Democratic and Republican candidates running for president and Congress. 'This is a much bigger, bolder step,' he said. 'What we're laying out tonight is a plan to have the House, Senate and the White House march in step, fix the economy and put America back to work.' Sounding more like a candidate himself, he said he would not withdraw his name from the 24 state presidential ballots on which he is already registered, nor discourage the ending of incomplete petition drives. Simultaneously he insisted repeatedly that he was no longer running. He again promised to publish soon an economic policy plan, the absence of which was considered one of several fatal flaws when he still had his eyes set on the White House. This plan, according to his few surviving political aides, would include Dollars 500bn (Pounds 261.7bn) in budget savings over five years, achievable through a 10 per cent reduction in the federal bureaucracy, the elimination of many subsidies, higher income and social security taxes on the wealthy, and increases in petrol taxes. The weekend meeting in Dallas was called before he spoke on television on Friday night. Some attending said Mr Perot had promised financial assistance to the continuing effort, but others reported that his commitment was vague. Most of his remarks were broadcast on the Larry King Live programme on Cable News Network, the vehicle he had used to launch his efforts earlier in the year. Mr Perot seemed positively liberated to be talking to his friendly host, free from the presence of hostile journalists and the professional political advisers he had imported and then mostly ignored. Two of them - Mr Ed Rollins and Mr Hamilton Jordan - have begun to paint a picture of an extraordinarily disorganised and amateur effort, in which all decisions were taken or ducked by Mr Perot alone. Mr Perot, they said, only seemed comfortable on talk shows and in rallies surrounded by his faithful. They warned him that this was an illusion and that other fringe candidates - for instance, the Rev Pat Robertson four years ago - also drew large crowds at the outset. But Mr Perot resisted all attempts to have his image and arguments professionally burnished. Mr King, the most prominent of the talk show hosts, seemed almost distressed that Mr Perot had withdrawn and on several occasions virtually begged him to reconsider. It may or may not be relevant that Mr Perot's frequent appearances have done wonders for the show's ratings. Several callers, however, expressed their disappointment and sense of betrayal that he had backed out, though others were wide-eyed with enthusiasm at the prospect of a new and different effort. One of them was the entertainer Cher, who said she would stay involved 'as long as I know you won't quit'. The campaigns of President George Bush and Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee who has surged ahead in the polls, were still wooing Perot supporters furiously over the weekend. Even Mr Dan Quayle, the vice-president who a month ago was calling Mr Perot 'a temperamental tycoon with contempt for the constitution', had only kind words to say. Both are operating on the assumption that, no matter what he says to his faithful flock, Mr Perot cannot come back. There is no recent record of this happening in the space of an election year. Senator Gary Hart tried to do so four years ago after dropping out, and Mr Paul Tsongas allowed his name to remain on Democratic primary ballots this year after he suspended his campaign, but to no avail. However, in focusing on economic issues, especially the budget deficit and the national debt, Mr Perot has at least lent his name, though typically not the responsibility for his actions, to a cause which has other powerful advocates. Senators Warren Rudman and John Danforth, both Republicans, and Mr Tsongas on the Democratic side are continuing to exert pressure on Mr Bush and Mr Clinton to be more specific about their deficit reduction ideas. Both candidates may face a decisive televised debate devoted to this issue, at least if Mr Danforth has his way. But Mr Perot's commitment to this cause must remain suspect for the simple reason that he refused to let it be published while he was still an official, if undeclared, candidate. He had promised early in May that it would be ready in 60 days, but when he quit in the third week of July its contents were still unknown. It seems as though he had worked out it would be so unpopular as to damage fatally his chances, which were already dwindling. Mr Jordan admitted it would have created 'a firestorm' when made public, probably consuming in the process Mr Perot. He pre-empted that probability by withdrawing, which lessens the realistic chances of his 'army of patriots' being more than a marginal force in the remaining three and a half months of the campaign.

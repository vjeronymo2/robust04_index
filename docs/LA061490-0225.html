			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MARCOS SOBS AT TESTIMONY HER CHILDREN GOT PLUNDER;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: THE WIDOW OF DECEASED DICTATOR IS TAKEN TO NURSE'S STATION FOR A  CHECKUP. SHE COLLAPSED IN NEW YORK COURT LAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Imelda Marcos broke down in tears today at her racketeering trial during  testimony that showed how money allegedly plundered from the Philippines went  to her children.  </P> <P> Wearing dark glasses, she was escorted from the courtroom and proceeded to the  nurse's station for a checkup.  </P> <P> Last week, her trial in U.S. District Court was delayed after she pitched  forward in the courtroom and coughed up blood.  </P> <P> Her emotional outburst came as prosecutors presented charts showing the flow of  $28.6 million from a Bankers Trust account into the account of Fe Roa Giminez,  secretary to the Marcoses in Manila's Malacanang Palace.  </P> <P> Marcos allegedly conspired to hide millions of dollars plundered from the  Philippines during the rule of her late husband, Ferdinand.  </P> <P> She is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice  for allegedly plotting with her husband to divert money stolen from the  Philippines treasury into real estate investments around the world, including  several properties in Manhattan.  </P> <P> As the charts were being explained to show how some of the funds allegedly went  to her husband, who died in September, and some of their children, Marcos  appeared upset.  </P> <P> Benjamin Cassiday III, her Honolulu attorney, jumped up and called for a  conference, during which she began weeping.  </P> <P> Keenan recessed the trial for lunch early, and Marcos was led out in dark  glasses.  </P> <P> Asked later if she was all right, Robert Fagan, the deputy U.S. marshal in  charge of courtroom security, said, "Everything's fine."  </P> <P> Following her collapse last week, Marcos was rushed on a stretcher to New York  Hospital, where she remained for four days.  </P> <P> Her doctors reported the attack had been triggered by erosive gastritis, an  inflammation of the stomach caused by excessive acid.  </P></p>

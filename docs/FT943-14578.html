			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Ground shakes under homeowners: An insurance policy crisis is forcing US authorities to act A swelling insurance crisis in California, following the Northridge earthquake earlier this year, is forcing US authorities to reconsider how they should deal with natural calamities. Tomorrow Mr John Garamendi, California's insurance commissioner, will host a meeting to try to find a way around the decision by big US insurance companies to stop selling new policies to Californian homeowners. Over the past two months, Farmers, a subsidiary of the UK's BAT Industries, and Allstate, another big US insurer, have stopped selling new homeowners insurance in the state, though they are renewing existing policies. State Farm stopped adding to its Californian risks a year ago, after its losses of Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) on Hurricane Andrew made the company rethink its exposure to natural disasters. It was also the biggest loser in Northridge, with a liability of Dollars 1.3bn. The insurance crisis has taken six months to develop. At first, insured losses from the ground-shaker in southern California were put at no more than Dollars 2.5bn, although that would still have made it the US's third most expensive insurable event, after hurricanes Andrew, which cost Dollars 15.5bn and Hugo (Dollars 4.2bn). Estimates have since soared: to at least Dollars 5.5bn, according to an industry group, and possibly to Dollars 7bn or more, according to unofficial estimates. One insurance company, 20th Century, nearly folded under the losses and was ordered by state regulators to cut its exposure to future losses as part of a recapitalisation plan in April. That put pressure on others to take up the slack, leading to a domino effect in which, one by one, all big insurers have stopped writing new policies. Allstate was the last to move, a fortnight ago. 'We could not afford to be the only game in town,' said Mr Jerry Choate, president of the company's property and casualty business. Mr Garamendi has taken steps to ensure Californians are not left uninsured. He extended the 'Fair' plan - adopted to cover the uninsurable risks of wildfires which tore through southern California last autumn - to cover earthquake exposure as well. This scheme offers cover to anyone who cannot get it elsewhere. He has also called on state governor Pete Wilson to stop insurers withdrawing from California, something Florida was forced to do last year after Hurricane Andrew saw insurers halt sales of new cover to property owners in the state. Florida has since put a limit of 5 per cent a year on the proportion of policy holders that an insurer can shed each year. In front of Mr Garamendi tomorrow will be the insurance industry's own plan. This would involve putting earthquake risks into a separate 'pool', to be financed jointly by the insurers. Under one version, only new earthquake risks would go into this pot, leaving individual insurers with their existing exposure; an alternative would lead to all earthquake risk being pooled. Californian homeowners (only one in four of whom choose to buy earthquake cover, which must under state law be offered to all policyholders) pay around Dollars 350m a year in earthquake premiums. That could rise to Dollars 650m as a result of Northridge, says Mr Robert Pike, general counsel of Allstate: he bases the figure on the rise in premiums Mr Garamendi has instituted in the Fair plan to cover earthquake risk. The problem for the commissioner is that the industry's proposal could leave state taxpayers picking up the tab from a big disaster. If another earthquake struck before the insurance pool had built up its reserves, the pool would borrow against future premiums. That could raise up to five times its reserves at the time, estimates Mr Pike at Allstate. Losses above that would be met by a Dollars 1bn levy on insurance companies. That might be enough for a Northridge-style earthquake. But what about the proverbial 'Big One' that every Californian fears? The same problem exists for Florida's catastrophe fund, which has the power to borrow only Dollars 2bn. Two years ago, Mr Garamendi was forced to cancel a state earthquake compensation fund which would have paid up to Dollars 15,000 to each homeowner when it became clear that the state taxpayer could be left footing the bill from a large disaster. The Californian administration only last week completed another traumatic annual budget round, in the process borrowing Dollars 4bn from international banks, and does not want an open-ended earthquake liability. Until Andrew, insurers had not contemplated a multi-billion dollar disaster. Now they talk of the Dollars 50bn incident which could wipe out a large part of the capital of the US property and casualty insurance industry. The final answer, say insurers and state authorities, rests with lawmakers in Washington. The Natural Disaster Protection Act, or earlier versions of it, has sat before Congress for some time. Like the proposed California scheme, it would cap the insurance industry's exposure. But there is little sign federal taxpayers will be any keener than state ones to pick up the rest of the tab.</p>

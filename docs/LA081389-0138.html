			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER AIMS TO MAKE TRIAL A FORUM ON GOD, ABORTION  </P> <P> Cyrus Zal, a defense attorney in the trial of five anti-abortion protesters,  proudly recalls a time earlier this year when a judge, so exasperated by Zal's  courtroom antics, stormed off the bench.  </P> <P> The judge, Zal remembers, called him one of the most obnoxious and offensive  attorneys he had ever faced. Eventually, the judge was forced to declare a  mistrial.  </P> <P> Zal is at it again.  </P> <P> This time the scene is a sixth-floor room in the Los Angeles County Courthouse,  where religious convictions and the law clash head on, and where theatrics keep  bailiffs hopping.  </P> <P> Zal, general counsel for the Operation Rescue anti-abortion group, has fought  with the judge and with the prosecution over how prominently he can display his  ever-present Bible, how loudly he can mumble his trial-time prayers, how  extensively he can question jurors about their respect for God's law over Man's  law.  </P> <P> He has challenged the judge to throw him in jail, to hold him in contempt, to  make him sit down. On that last score, two marshals made Zal comply.  </P> <P> "This is a mock trial, and in a mock trial you are going to get convicted  unless you do something drastic," Zal said later in explaining his tactics. "I  trust in the Lord, whatever he wants me to do. I feel the Holy Spirit guiding  me in the courtroom."  </P> <P> Opponents say Zal is acting in a deliberately antagonistic manner to provoke  Municipal Judge Richard A. Paez into making errors, to gain jurors' sympathies  and to portray the defendants as disadvantaged victims of a biased judiciary.  The tactics will backfire, say the critics.  </P> <P> "I think they are trying to set themselves up as martyrs being oppressed by the  system, but I don't think most people . . . go for it," said ACLU attorney  Carol Sobel, who is up against Zal in another civil contempt trial against  Operation Rescue.  </P> <P> "I believe he thinks drama carries the day. . . . But I think those kind of  antics just don't go over well."  </P> <P> Zal, of Folsom, is one of a handful of defense attorneys involved in the trial  of Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry and four others. They are charged  with misdemeanor trespass, conspiracy and related counts, stemming from an  illegal blockade at a Los Angeles women's clinic March 25.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jury Selection Continues  </P> <P> After four days of often-tense questioning, a 12-member jury was selected  Friday afternoon; four alternates must be chosen before opening arguments can  be heard.  </P> <P> Zal, Terry and the others have made it clear that they wish to use the trial as  a platform for debating and condemning abortion. Paez has been firm: "Abortion  is not on trial here," he has admonished the defendants and the jurors,  repeatedly.  </P> <P> But the issue of abortion enters time and again.  </P> <P> The defense team has asked prospective jurors their opinions on abortion,  whether they know what abortion is, whether they belong to any pro-choice  organizations.  </P> <P> A woman from China was asked if any of her relatives had to submit to "forced  abortions" in that country. A man was asked if he had been present at the  births of his children. Those are the questions that are allowed; other, more  graphic questions are not.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regular Objections  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty. Lara Bloomquist has listened intently throughout the  defense's interrogation, registering regular objections to what she sees as  inappropriate comments.  </P> <P> "I think the defense has made it pretty clear they intend to have clashes with  the judge and they have done it consistently," Bloomquist said. "They openly  defy the judge."  </P> <P> It is during Zal's interrogation that most of the sparks fly. On Monday, Zal  was ending his arguments before Paez with a "God bless you"; by mid-week his  tone and demeanor had changed, and he was accusing Paez of attempting to  "stifle" the defense. Paez says he is merely trying to keep the defense from  intimidating jurors and introducing irrelevant issues.  </P> <P> On Thursday, when a prospective juror responded that he believed abortion to be  justified in certain circumstances, Zal posed a question: When, he asked, is it  OK for the woman to "go to an abortionist and have him decapitate that baby?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warning Issued  </P> <P> With that comment, which Paez later called inflammatory, the judge ordered the  courtroom cleared of all prospective jurors. He sternly put Zal on notice: "Ask  another question like that," Paez said, "and your voir dire (interrogation) is  terminated."  </P> <P> Zal insisted he would continue to ask such questions; Paez ruled Zal's  questioning of jurors was over. Terry and co-defendant Jeff White leaped to  their feet demanding mistrials based on "judicial prejudice." Zal refused to  sit down. Paez ordered Zal to sit. He continued to refuse. Paez ordered two  bailiffs to place Zal in a chair; one grabbed his arm and they pushed him into  the chair.  </P> <P> White stuffed a crumpled piece of legal note pad paper into his mouth as the  prospective jurors filed back in.  </P> <P> Paez and Zal make interesting foils. Both are slim, 41-year-old men of similar  appearances, with black mustaches. Both attended UC Berkeley -- Zal did his  undergraduate work there, Paez graduated from its law school. The similarities  appear to end there.  </P> <P> Zal was born in Tehran, moved with his family to the United States when he was  3 and "found the Lord Jesus" four years ago after years as a "heathen." The  bulk of his legal cases is work for Operation Rescue. He is an active member of  an Anglican congregation, the Church of the Holy Trinity in Sacramento, where  his brother-in-law is the minister.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Graduate of BYU  </P> <P> Paez is a Mormon, born and raised in Utah and a graduate of Brigham Young  University. He also worked for several years for the California Legal  Assistance, the Western Center on Law and Poverty and the Los Angeles Legal Aid  Foundation. He was appointed to the Municipal bench in 1981 and was elected  presiding judge last year.  </P> <P> Despite several heated exchanges, Paez, for the most part, has kept his cool.  He does at times seem exasperated by the defense team.  </P> <P> When defendant Michael McMonagle asked that the time for the daily lunch break  be shortened so that the defendants would have more time to argue their case,  Paez refused. "It's obvious to me that I'm going to need the lunch break," he  said.  </P> <P> The other defendants are Andrew Eppink and Donald Bennette.  </P> <P> Sharing the limelight with Zal is the 30-year-old Terry. From the first day of  the pretrial proceedings, when several dozen placard-waving demonstrators  gathered outside the court, then crowded inside the courtroom and held hands in  prayer, Terry has been in his element.  </P> <P> He greets court clerks by their first names, shakes hands with followers,  pauses long enough to do a live interview for radio on a portable phone carried  by an aide.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eager to Tell Story  </P> <P> Calling the opening day of the trial one of the most exciting days in his life,  Terry said he eagerly awaited telling his story to the jury.  </P> <P> But the audience he is playing to clearly extends far beyond the County  Courthouse.  </P> <P> "Do you think that sound bite will entertain a few people tonight?" he asks a  reporter during a pause in the proceedings, after he had uttered one of his  so-quotable quotes.  </P> <P> Later, he pleads with another reporter not to use a negative off-the-cuff  comment about President Bush. Though a horde of television and print reporters  crowded to cover the first two days of pretrial hearings, by week's end the  coverage had dwindled to occasional visits by local print reporters. Also in  steady attendance: a columnist for People Magazine.  </P></p>

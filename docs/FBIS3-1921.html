			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- The third plenary  session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of  the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) issued a communique here  today, calling for unremitting efforts to combat and root out  corruption.    The anticorruption campaign must be firmly and more  effectively carried out, so as to maintain social stability and  guarantee the progress of reforms, opening up and economic  growth, said the communique, issued at the end of the six-day  session.    "The anticorruption drive is long, arduous and urgent and it  is necessary to carry out a protracted struggle against  corruption and to score successes in different periods," the  communique pointed out.    While affirming the achievements already made in the  anticorruption campaign, the communique noted that negative and  corrupt phenomena still persist and in some cases are quite  serious. No efforts should be spared in the crackdown on  corruption, it urged.    The communique said that the decision by the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council on launching the anticorruption  struggle is correct and has guaranteed the smooth progress of  the fight against corruption.    Marked results have been achieved in the anticorruption  campaign since the convening of the second plenary session of  the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) last  August, with the dwindling of some corruptive phenomena, the  communique said.    During the session, 103 members of CCDI carefully studied an  important speech made by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the  CPC Central Committee, on renewed efforts against corruption.    The speech, which called for the investigation and severe  punishment of serious cases, is of great significance in guiding  the anticorruption drive in the new situation and is a clear  indication of the determination of the CPC to wipe out  corruption, the communique said.    At the session, which was presided over by CCDI Secretary  Wei  Jianxing, five new requirements were set for leading officials  to maintain clarity and honesty in performing their duties.    The communique also called on leading cadres to take a lead  in fighting corruption.</p>

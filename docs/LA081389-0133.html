			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> ANTI-DRUG CRUSADER EULOGIZED AT MASS  </P> <P> Slain anti-drug crusader Maria Hernandez was eulogized at a Mass attended by  300 mourners in New York, including Mayor Edward I. Koch. There was heavy  security to prevent further violence against her family. Hernandez, 34, a  mother of three who with her husband had fought to force drug dealers out of  her Brooklyn neighborhood, was shot to death last week, possibly in retaliation  for her anti-drug efforts. During a 70-minute Mass in Spanish and English at  St. John the Baptist Catholic Church, the Rev. Charles Plock praised the  woman's efforts to transform her neighborhood into a place where there would be  "no mourning, no tears, no fear. She labored and she struggled and she fought.  She organized people to make her community reflect this new heaven and this new  Earth," Plock said. "Maria gave her life because she was not afraid to speak  the truth."  </P></p>

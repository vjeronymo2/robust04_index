			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TOLLIVER, MCKNIGHT OUT FOR AT LEAST SIX WEEKS  </P> <P> One second separated Billy Joe Tolliver, the Chargers' rookie quarterback, from  a smashing preseason.  </P> <P> Now, Tolliver will be hanging around the sidelines for about six weeks.  </P> <P> After driving the Chargers 56 yards in the final two minutes of Friday's 21-20  victory over Phoenix, Tolliver ran left on third and goal from the Cardinal  five. He picked up a yard and a broken collarbone.  </P> <P> One second remained, and Jim McMahon trotted on and threw a touchdown pass to  Quinn Early. The extra point won the game.  </P> <P> "Quite a finish," McMahon said. "Those guys moved the ball down to the five,  and all I had to do was hit the guy. (Tolliver) has got a lot of nerve. He is  going to be a heck of a quarterback in this league."  </P> <P> Tolliver progressed nicely during the exhibition season, as shown by his poise  during the two-minute offense Friday.  </P> <P> "I think he's shown poise all camp," Charger Coach Dan Henning said. "I have no  problems in that area whatsoever. I expected a lot of him, but he's better than  I expected."  </P> <P> The Chargers also lost veteran center/guard Dennis McKnight to a thigh injury.  He was operated on Saturday and will miss at least six weeks, possibly more.  </P> <P> Henning said he hasn't discussed the possibility of shopping for another  quarterback and wouldn't rule out starting the regular season with just two.  </P> <P> McKnight's injury may have saved the job of 14-year veteran Don Macek, whose  lock on the center position is being threatened by rookie Courtney Hall. Hall  played what Henning described as a "steady, workman-like,  more-veteran-than-rookie type of performance" on Friday.  </P> <P> The loss of McKnight also adds to Henning's concern about the Chargers' long  snapping. Tight end Andy Parker, out nearly four weeks with a knee injury, did  some while with the Raiders, and Henning said there is a possibility he may be  healthy for Sunday's opener.  </P> <P> Next week's cuts may offer another option. Randy Kirk, former San Diego State  player who did long snapping for the Chargers last season, is second on the  Cardinals' depth chart at outside linebacker.  </P> <P> Burt Grossman has been in town just a little more than a week, and he has  already figured out a few things.  </P> <P> 1. San Diego is nicer than Philadelphia.  </P> <P> 2. He isn't in top form yet but expects to be by mid-season.  </P> <P> 3. He isn't as outrageous as McMahon but expects to be by midseason.  </P> <P> Remember, this is the guy whose house pets include a boa constrictor and  "Bernie," the pit bull. Bernie was named after Bernhard Goetz. He used to think  he and McMahon were very similar. No more. He has figured out you have to work  to be that eccentric.  </P> <P> "You meet him, and you figure out he's in a class by himself," Grossman says.  "I'm not at that point yet. Maybe at midseason I'll have that form."  </P> <P> Considering that Pitt defensive schemes are still log-jamming in his mind with  all the new Charger stuff he's being taught, Grossman turned in an ample  performance against Phoenix with two tackles, an assist and a half sack.  </P> <P> He also victim of an illegal crack-back block, which contributed to a bruised  knee, 15 penalty yards and a worried coach. It happened the play after his  sack.  </P> <P> Say anything to the guilty party, Burt?  </P> <P> "Naw," he said. "I chased him down on a screen four plays later and speared him  in the back."  </P> <P> He's optimistic about the Chargers' potential defensively.  </P> <P> "Last night, I think we ended up giving up 265 yards total offense, which is a  low number for any team," he said. "For Pop Warner, it's a low number. So  obviously that's a tell-tale sign we must be doing something right."  </P> <P> Running back Gary Anderson is expected to make a statement today regarding his  plans for this season. Anderson, the Chargers' 1988 MVP, has reached a  stalemate in contract negotiations and is said to be considering options other  than playing for the Chargers.  </P> <P> The Chargers aren't expected to announce further cuts until Monday, when the  team is required to trim its roster to 47.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> CRUDE RISES, BUT PUMP PRICES DIP  </P> <P> Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's call for an Arab uprising against the United  States frayed oil market nerves Friday and boosted crude prices. Gasoline  prices at the pump, meanwhile, appeared to drop slightly Friday.  </P> <P> In the oil market, traders remained cautious and appeared unwilling to take  risky positions ahead of an uncertain weekend. As a result, energy prices  closed off their highs for the day.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate for September delivery, the U.S. benchmark crude, rose  56 cents to close at $26.23 a barrel after trading as high as $26.60. Unleaded  gasoline rose 3.03 cents to 79.45 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> "It doesn't look like Hussein is backing down at all, but we are in a trading  range here," said Tom Bentz, director of trading at United Energy Inc.  </P> <P> Hussein called for Arabs to rally together against foreign intervention and  urged Egyptians to bar foreign ships from passing through the Suez Canal, a  vital link between the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. He also lashed  out at Arab leaders who opened their lands to U.S. troops.  </P> <P> Traders said players bid up the market at the opening and in the first hour in  anticipation of developments out of the Arab summit in Cairo and in reaction to  Hussein's speech.  </P> <P> Bentz added that strong buying in oil products, particularly gasoline, helped  lift crude prices. He said gasoline looked strong because, given consumer fears  of gasoline lines, it seemed a surer thing than crude.  </P> <P> Distant-month contracts of gasoline and heating oil were up the daily limit of  2 cents a gallon, while comparable crude contracts were up only moderately.  Volume was described as light.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the American Automobile Assn., in its daily survey of gasoline  stations, said the average price for self-serve, unleaded fuel dipped  nationwide by 0.3 cent to $1.25 per gallon -- the first decline since Iraq's  Aug. 2 invasion.  </P> <P> AAA also said there are "adequate gasoline supplies to meet all current travel  needs as well as those over the upcoming Labor Day holiday unless conditions  significantly worsen in the Middle East."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Arco Products Co. President George Babikian released his  promised white paper contending that oil companies are being unfairly accused  of gouging consumers.  </P> <P> Gasoline price hikes were coming anyway, Babikian said Friday, because of  higher crude oil prices on the spot market -- up from $15.50 a barrel in  mid-June to $20 by the end of July, before the Mideast crisis. He said that  contrary to popular belief, oil price changes in the spot market affect  gasoline prices within days, not weeks. About 47% of the oil used by U.S.  refiners is subject to such "nearly instantaneous" change, he said.  </P> <P> Then when spot prices go up, said Babikian, even refiners who do not buy on the  spot market feel compelled to raise their prices too, to avoid customer runs on  their low-priced gas and the risk of depleting their own gasoline supplies.  </P> <P> "Many of the price increases made were defensive," Babikian said.  </P> <P> Crude oil price hikes came again quickly after Aug. 2 from the "shock of the  invasion," according to the Arco position paper, as well as low gasoline  inventories. Particularly on the West Coast, noted Babikian, virtually every  oil company was doing refinery maintenance work during the 2nd quarter.  </P> <P> Even so, wholesale and retail prices haven't increased as much as prices on the  spot market, Babikian noted. He counseled consumers to avoid panic,  particularly topping off their auto gas tanks, since U.S. reserves are now high  and, unlike the earlier gas crisis, government price controls have not been  imposed. Babikian blamed price-control mechanisms for soaring prices at the  pump during the last oil crisis.  </P></p>

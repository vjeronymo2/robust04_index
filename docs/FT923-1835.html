			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Awash with misery: Floods in Pakistan have exacted a heavy toll in human suffering and economic damage The scale of the flooding which has struck Pakistan in the past week is most easily visible from the air. Where there was rich agricultural land in the central province of Punjab, only trees can be seen, their trunks under water. On high ground are remaining patches of crops. Peasants gathered on roof-tops appear to be stranded on tiny islands in an ocean. It seems miraculous that weak buildings made out of mud, straw and wood are holding up. River boats carrying troops speed across the water in search of victims caught on high ground or roof-tops, along with their meagre belongings and livestock. The cost of the disaster, caused by torrential rain which swelled the Indus, Chenab, Jehlum and Ravi rivers, is still being calculated, but rehabilitation will be lengthy and expensive. Initial estimates of up to 2,000 deaths have been lowered to about 1,000. Hundreds of thousands have been affected, and the damage is enormous. An official in the central city of Multan said: 'This is the worst crisis I've seen in years. Who knows how long and how much money it will take to repair the damage?' Across from the sher shah bund, a protective mud boundary created to protect the historic Islamic city, the destruction is obvious as far as the eye can see. Field after field of crop land is submerged under water which came through a 20-metre wide breach in the boundary. Relief workers had to dynamite that portion to let the water flood farmland rather than let the pressure build up where it could break through the boundary and enter the city. Victims either lost their mud homes or ran out of food and tried to swim to land. Some were forced to climb tree-tops out of fear of being drowned, and had to stay there for a day before being rescued. A large crowd of people has gathered to wait for friends and family members who may be stranded in the flooded area. Less than a mile away, relief workers are trying to strengthen the train tracks by lining rocks and sand-bags alongside the rails. The cost of the disaster will put pressure on Pakistan's economy. The province of Punjab estimates its losses at Rs16bn (Dollars 640m), and the other three provinces - North West Frontier, the territory of Azad Kashmir and Sindh - are still calculating. Agriculture has taken the worst beating. Pakistan had expected to produce up to 14m bales of cotton this year, up from last year's 13m. But the latest estimates are that production will fall to 11.5m. Cotton is by far Pakistan's most important product, with exports of cotton and its products accounting for 58 per cent of the country's Dollars 6.8bn of exports last year. A drop in exports could threaten Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's drive to introduce free market reforms, replacing the former socialist bureaucracy. The programme depends on boosting exports to maintain both foreign exchange reserves and economic growth. Severe damage to the cotton crop is expected in the southern province of Sindh. Up to 60 per cent of the 1.5m acres of land sown to cotton in Sindh is expected to be destroyed by a combination of torrential rains last month and the present floods. In the province of Punjab, up to 1m acres out of 7m sown to cotton are estimated to be destroyed. Pakistan has not so far launched an international appeal for assistance though it has accepted voluntary donations - Japan has offered Dollars 800,000, Britain Dollars 200,000 and the United Nations Dollars 100,000. However, some officials believe that as the costs of rehabilitation mount, the government will need to ask for outside help. Mr Sharif, who has been touring affected areas by helicopter, has announced Rs1bn of relief for Moslem victims and Rs250m for non-Moslems. Interest on agricultural loans of up to 20,000 rupees (Dollars 800) from state-owned banks has been written off, and borrowers have been given an additional year to pay back their loans. The government's handling of the crisis has been criticised by opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. In Pakistan's volatile democracy, some politicians in Mr Sharif's ruling coalition are worried that the disaster could provide ammunition to the opposition. But there are few signs so far of public unrest. However, the government will be left with some difficult problems. In the short term, there is not only rehabilitation and reconstruction, but also the possibility of outbreaks of epidemics from stagnant water. In the longer term it will come under pressure to improve flood management techniques. Officials say deforestation has intensified environmental problems. The official estimate is that just over 5 per cent of Pakistan is forested. But officials concede that the figure is a legal description of areas set aside for forests and does not reflect the destruction of trees to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population. Pakistan and India would benefit from joint efforts to increase forestation in their northern areas, to combat environmental problems. But given the tension in their relations, there are few signs that such an effort could be launched.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Jumping bail MR ASIL Nadir's escape to Northern Cyprus will not only anger thousands of Polly Peck shareholders. It will also further undermine confidence in the capacity of the UK criminal justice system to bring serious fraud cases to successful conclusions. Confidence has already been damaged by fiascos such as the Blue Arrow and Guinness trials. While the precise anatomy of failure varies in all three situations, common elements have been the complexity of the charge sheets and the inordinate delay in bringing cases to trial. In Mr Nadir's case, there has been a delay of two and a half years since he was charged. One can only speculate whether an earlier trial would have deterred Mr Nadir from jumping bail. But it does seem certain that, so long as it takes several years to bring serious fraud cases to trial, little can be done to prevent defendants from escaping unless society is willing to ride roughshod over their human rights. Mr Nadir's bail of Pounds 3.5m was already the largest imposed in the UK. Putting him - and others in a similar position - behind bars for six months while awaiting trial might be acceptable. Locking them up for three years would not be, especially since they could eventually be found not guilty. Mr Nadir's escape was facilitated by the willingness of Northern Cyprus, a state which Britain and almost all other countries refuse to recognise, to provide him with a safe haven. There is therefore little chance of bringing Mr Nadir back to face justice, although the government of Northern Cyprus should not think that welcoming him with open arms is a cost-free decision. It is precisely such behaviour which will prevent it receiving the recognition it craves. The lesson for future fraud cases is clear. The Serious Fraud Office must streamline charge sheets and bring cases to court much more quickly. Only then will the prosecuting authorities be able to justify denying future Nadirs bail.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIVING NORMANDY  </P> <P> I read Dirlam's story on Normandy and, realizing the article was meant to  promote travel to Normandy and was not a history lesson, it was a nice job.  However, not only the 1st Infantry Division landed on "Bloody Omaha Beach," but  so did the 115th and 116th regiments of the 29th Infantry Division. They  suffered even heavier losses than the 1st Division. I did not serve with the  29th in 1944, but in 1962. I am writing because the above is rarely told in  articles about D-day.  </P> <P> BRUCE H. ROUSH Jr.  </P> <P> Jarrettsville, Md.  </P></p>

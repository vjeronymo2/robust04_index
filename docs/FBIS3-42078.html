To date, any businessman with a  general enterprise license could offer arms and military  technology for sale.    Bretislav Gregr, director of the License Administration at  the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said that the tightening of  the conditions was caused by instances that unnecessarily  damaged the reputation of the republic. He gave an example of a  citizen who had nothing to do with arms dealing advertising the  sale of handguns and submachine guns in a foreign journal. Some  people even offered tanks and airplanes abroad. "We have begun  to receive notes through diplomatic channels asking how it is  possible that these individuals can offer arms without any  restrictions," Gregr said.</p>

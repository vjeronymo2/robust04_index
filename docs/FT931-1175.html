			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Redland shares fall on ACT worries FEARS that UK tax charges will rise sharply over the next two years sent Redland's share price tumbling 4 per cent yesterday despite the announcement by the British building materials group of a 19 per cent pre-tax profits rise last year. The share price of the world's biggest roof tile manufacturer fell 21p to 467p over concern that the company will generate insufficient UK profits this year and next to offset against advance corporation tax (ACT) payments. A rise of a third in German earnings from Pounds 85.8m to Pounds 114.5m helped group pre-tax profits increase to Pounds 221.5m compared with Pounds 186m in 1991. Earnings per share however fell by 21 per cent from 30p to 23.7p following a rise of more than a fifth in the tax charge from Pounds 51.1m to Pounds 62.4m and a 62 per cent increase in minorities to Pounds 48.4m mostly payable to Braas, Redland's 51 per cent owned German subsidiary. Redland proposes to maintain the final dividend at 16.75p, making a total of 25p, the same as in 1991. The rise in the tax charge is expected to inhibit the company's ability to raise earnings or dividends, which are likely to remain at current levels for the next two years. The tax charge last year would have been Pounds 20m higher but for Redland's ability to offset ACT against the UK earnings of Steetley, a rival building materials company acquired last March in a contested bid worth Pounds 613m. Without the Steetley acquisition, pre-tax profits would only have risen by an estimated Pounds 4m. Interest payments, up from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 26.4m, following the purchase, were nine times covered by operating profits, in spite of a rise in gearing to 42 per cent. Mr Robert Napier, managing director, said that Steetley had contributed Pounds 50m to operating profit. UK profits rose 11 per cent to Pounds 37.9m. North American profits increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 27.3m while profits from continental countries other than Germany increased by 89 per cent to Pounds 53.9m. Mr Napier said: 'Prospects in the UK, at last, look more encouraging. Germany continues to trade strongly, the United States is recovering and sterling's devaluation is benefiting our overseas profits.' Lex, Page 20</p>

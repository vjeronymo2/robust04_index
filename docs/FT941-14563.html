			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Indian tax probe sends shares into fall Indian share prices fell yesterday after income tax inspectors announced the extension of a long-running probe into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of the 1992 securities market scandal. The Bombay Stock Exchange index fell 125.11 points to 3,825.91 amid reports of panic selling of blocks of shares which investors feared might become subject to the investigation. Stockbrokers said that the market had in any case been ripe for a fall after a 54 per cent rise since early November prompted by large-scale foreign buying. The income tax inspectors' investigation began in 1992 after Mr Mehta was arrested for his alleged involvement in the Rs42bn (Pounds 900m) scandal which rocked the Bombay securities market. Mr Mehta and others were accused of trading illegally in the inter-bank securities market in order to siphon funds into the stock market. Last October, trading was disrupted when it emerged the tax authorities had frozen dealings in blocks of stock which they said were being held by others on Mr Mehta's behalf. The authorities then specified blocks of shares in nine leading companies held by 134 individuals and companies. Yesterday they added shares of a further 20 companies held by 608 individuals and companies.</p>

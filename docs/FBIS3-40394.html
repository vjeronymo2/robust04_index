			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Guichardaz: "Voice/Data Networks: </F> French-German Alliance"]    [Text] When they announced the creation of a new joint  subsidiary designed to provide advanced telecommunication  services to businesses worldwide, France Telecom and Deutsche  Telekom further strengthened their ties. The draft agreement  signed by Marcel Roulet and Helmut Ricke, the two groups'  presidents, provides that both companies will own equal shares  of the new entity, the name, legal form and capital of which  still remain to be determined. In principle, it should be  operational by 1995; by then, it should achieve sales of about  10 billion francs [Fr] with 4,000 employees.    Its sphere of activity will extend from data network  services  (X.25, frame relay, etc.) to VSATs [very-small-aperture  terminals], including international leased lines, international  virtual private (voice-data) networks, and value-added services.  From this point of view, the two partners will endow the joint  venture, Telecom with the activities of Transpac and its  European subsidiaries and with some parts of FCR [France Cables  et Radio]; and Deutsche Telekom with Datex-P, the German X.25  data network operator, and with other unidentified entities.    As for Eunetcom, the two operators' jointly-owned subsidiary  dedicated to outsourcing for large multinational networks, "it  is destined to be integrated into the new joint company under  forms that remain to be defined," Marcel Roulet indicated,  making a point of adding: "The new company will be in a position  to offer services covering a single need of its clients, who  will not necessarily be large multinational companies, whereas  Eunetcom and its rivals, Unisource or Syncordia, aimed to take  responsibility for all the telecommunication needs of very large  clients."    For reasons of compatibility with Community law, consumer  services--.e.g the centralization of international switched  telephone traffic, and mobile communication services--are  excluded from the alliance for the time being. Also excluded is  Eucom, another joint structure working essentially in data  interchange for the transportation and tourism sectors.    Nothing else is certain. "The announcement of this framework  agreement has more to do with political management than with  true business management where announcements deal with firmly  established facts," Jean-Pierre Chamoux estimated, adding: "Per  se, this agreement is good because it will enable the two  operators to gain experience in the international sector while  sharing risks. But, in the short term, they have nothing to  oppose to third parties. Therefore, what is involved today is a  pact rather than a true business project." As a result, many  questions are being raised. The first one is that of the  position of community authorities, whose green light is  required. Preliminary contacts are said to have taken place  between the two presidents and Jacques Delors, the European  Commission president. "But the matter will be officially  referred to Brussels only when our plans begin to materialize,"  Helmut Ricke stated.    Another pending question is that of the future of Transpac  and its role in the new setup. "Transpac will be the French  correspondent of the joint subsidiary, and its mission will be  to harmonize operating policies with Datex-P," Marcel Roulet  explained. But Transpac, which has a wide business experience,  has invested a lot on the international market, contrary to  Datex-P, a mere division of Deutsche Telekom which never  ventured outside Germany. Besides, the French-German axis needs  to be strengthened: first in Europe, where the two allies might  pull along in their wake the Belgian operator Belgacom (the  choice of Brussels as headquarters for the future company can be  interpreted as a covert advance in this respect) and the Italian  company Stet [Telephone Finance Corporation], which already  worked with France Telecom in Argentina and wishes to expand on  the international market; above all, in the United States,  "where we must absolutely have a partner in order to offer a  good range of services to our clients. Negotiations are in  progress, in particular with AT&amp;T," Helmut Ricke  acknowledged.    As for BT [British Telecom], the large European rival of the  two national operators, the CEO [chief executive officer] of  which, Ian Vallance, already denounced their alliance as  anticompetitive to the extent that telephone services and  infrastructures remain under a monopoly both in France and in  Germany, will it go so far as to file a complaint with the  Brussels Commission? At any rate, it is likely to try and obtain  that the Commission increase its pressure on France and Germany  to make them decontrol their infrastructures.  <H5>  Services for Large Accounts </H5>   Once united, the two partners' activities should yield a  single line of products and services representing a "seamless"  network offer, with genuine one-stop shopping--at least in  France and Germany; at best in Europe--and centralized billing.    But uniting means changing, even relinquishing part of what  already exists. First, cultural and organizational discrepancies  between technical and management teams must be erased, as well  as incompatibilities between interfaces, equipment, and  management systems, and tariff differences, etc., so as to  achieve a uniform offer.    Each type of service that has to be merged will bring its  share of constraints. But the time and cost required for this  integration should be reasonable considering the structural  similarity of the products involved. Merging the Transpac and  Datex-P packet-switching services should be easy. Through its  German subsidiary, Info-AG, Transpac has acquired a solid  experience.    In both cases, X.25 is the protocol used, the 64-bit segment  is the billing unit. The frame-relay openings and protocols  attempted on both sides remain marginal.    There remains to establish a direct interconnection system  less expensive than the one used on the Transpac Europe network.  Transpac already offers a single contract and single billing for  international services at 1,000 francs [Fr] per month per  contract, and Fr200 per month per gate per subscriber, with  calls billed at Fr0.32 per kilobyte (Fr0.057 for local calls).  In principle, the French-German X.25 connection should get more  favorable tariff conditions already in 1995.    For the planned merger of international leased lines (LSI),  conditions will be less favorable. Although France Telecom and  Deutsche Telekom significantly lowered the prices of their  national and international lines, the difference with operators  such as C&amp;W or BT remains noticeable, especially in the case  of  the German company. The latter privileged its 64-kbps [kilobits  per second] virtual line service on an ISDN [integrated services  digital network] B-channel at the expense of traditional leased  lines which are twice as expensive.    France Telecom announced that it will offer a similar  service  in 1994, under the label Transgroupe, to build virtual  voice-data networks. By 1995, these two ISDN services may be  interconnected! Transgroupe might replace Colisee International  on the French-German axis, just as it is expected to replace it  on Colisee Numeris.    Although conditional, the two national operators' intention  to build an "Intelligent Network" on a joint platform confirms  this trend.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Grosvenor Dev Capital improves Grosvenor Development Capital reported net assets per share up 13 per cent to 146.7p at the end of May 1992, against 130.1p six months earlier. However interim pre-tax profits slumped to Pounds 3,000, compared with Pounds 141,000 a year earlier. This reflected lower interest rates, coupled with a fall in interest on the reduced level of liquidity and higher contracted advisers fees - both due to an increased level of investment over the past 18 months. After tax of Pounds 1,000 (Pounds 61,000) diluted earnings per share fell from 2.57p to 2.02p, but the directors expect to at least maintain the year's dividend at 0.95p.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Continental Airlines names new chief Continental Airlines, the fifth biggest US carrier, yesterday said it had promoted Mr Gordon Bethune, previously chief operating officer, to the post of president and chief executive. He replaces Mr Robert Ferguson, who abruptly resigned as vice-chairman and chief executive last week, writes Richard Tomkins in New York. Mr Bethune, who started in the industry as a mechanic, takes over the job at a time when Continental is struggling to improve the performance of its low-cost Continental Lite operations. His predecessor had been a strong backer of the Lite services, which account for more than half the airline's daily flights.</p>

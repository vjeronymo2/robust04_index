			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY CITES BASEBALL PLAYERS' SMOKELESS TOBACCO USE  </P> <P> More than half of all professional baseball players participating in a  large-scale study use or have used chewing tobacco and snuff, and more than  half of those who do use it regularly have abnormalities in their mouths that  could eventually lead to cancer, UC San Francisco researchers said here Monday.  </P> <P> The researchers surveyed and examined 1,109 major and minor league players from  seven big league organizations -- including the California Angels, the San  Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics -- last March during their spring  training season.  </P> <P> Of the players examined, epidemiologist Virginia L. Ernster told a meeting of  the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science, 39% had used smokeless  tobacco within the previous week and 4% within the previous month. Another 13%  were former users.  </P> <P> The smokeless tobacco of choice for 75% of those who used it was snuff, which  has been closely linked to oral cancer.  </P> <P> The only good news in the study, Ernster said, was that few of the players  smoked, and none of the lesions had yet turned cancerous.  </P> <P> Overall, "this terrific group of role models for young men" are setting a  disappointing example and endangering their own health at the same time, she  concluded.  </P> <P> Chewing tobacco is made up of loose leaves or a plug of tobacco that is  inserted in the jaw and chewed regularly, with the released juices being spit  out. Snuff is powdered or finely ground tobacco that is held between the teeth  and gums and whose use is imperceptible until it is time to spit. Their use is  widely considered to be a growing problem in the United States among youths who  mistakenly believe that it is safer than smoking.  </P> <P> A 1986 study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that 25% of all  males aged 12 to 25 had used smokeless tobacco at some time, contrasted with  only 9% of males over the age of 35. An estimated 8.2% of males aged 17-19 and  5.9% of those aged 20 to 25 use smokeless tobacco regularly, contrasted with  only 2% over age 40.  </P> <P> "It used to be that only old men used smokeless tobacco," Ernster said.  "Something has turned the demographics upside down."  </P> <P> One contributor to the increased use among young people, she added, is the  example set by celebrities, such as baseball players.  </P> <P> Less than 1% of women use smokeless tobacco, mostly American Indians and native  Alaskans.  </P> <P> Smokeless tobacco, particularly snuff, has been associated with a variety of  lesions in the mouth, including leukoplakia (white and red patches), gum  irritation and recession and staining of the teeth. Long-term use has been  firmly linked to development of oral cancer.  </P> <P> In addition, researchers suspect that smokeless tobacco may alter blood  pressure, heart rate and total cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of heart  disease. The key ingredient that is linked to these problems, as is the case in  smoking, is nicotine.  </P> <P> The study was conducted in Arizona, where the seven major league teams in the  spring training "Cactus League" and their 35 affiliated minor league teams  practice. About 81% of the subjects were between the ages of 20 and 29 and 68%  were Anglo.  </P> <P> In their study, Ernster and her associates administered a four-page  questionnaire to each of the participants about their smoking, chewing and  alcohol use; checked their overall health, and gave them each a comprehensive  examination of the mouth.  </P> <P> They found that 87% of the players had never smoked and that only 4% now  smoked. About 46% of the Anglo players were now using smokeless tobacco, more  than twice the percentage among minority groups, reflecting use patterns that  exist in the population as a whole. They also found that those who used  smokeless tobacco most frequently were also the individuals who drank the  heaviest, averaging more than two drinks a day.  </P> <P> Among the players who used smokeless tobacco regularly, 46% had lesions in  their mouths, contrasted with 1.8% of those who never used smokeless tobacco.  Most of the lesions cause pain or a burning sensation when they come in contact  with food or other products, according to Sol Silverman Jr., professor of oral  medicine at UC San Francisco.  </P> <P> Such lesions can turn cancerous among individuals who have used smokeless  tobacco for decades, Silverman said. Biopsies of 91 of the lesions, however,  showed that all were benign.  </P> <P> In a few cases where biopsies were delayed for several days, Ernster noted, the  lesions had disappeared because the players had been frightened out of using  snuff. Their disappearance suggested that most of the lesions were not yet  serious, she said.  </P> <P> The UC San Francisco team will examine the same players and any newcomers at  spring training this year and in 1990. They hope to continue following some of  the players after that to obtain long-term information about the health risks.  </P></p>

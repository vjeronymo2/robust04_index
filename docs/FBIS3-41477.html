What guides us?    1. How do you see Ukraine from the heights of your position  at the start of the new year of 1994?    2. Very little time is left for you to work as part of the  current government before the new elections in 1994. What  concrete steps do you intend to take so as to halt the further  fall of Ukraine into the abyss of economic crisis?    1. Ukraine is experiencing extraordinarily difficult times.  A  precipitous destruction and pollution of the natural environment  is occurring simultaneously with the economic disarray. The  threat to the health of people and the genetic stock of the  nation has become real. The quantity of birth defects among  infants is increasing every year, and a natural decline in the  population--or, more precisely speaking, its extinction--has  been occurring since 1991.    The crisis state of the environment in Ukraine is  conditioned  mainly by the ecologically unsafe functioning of the senseless  economic system that we inherited from the times of  totalitarianism. Twice as much iron ore was extracted in Ukraine  as in the United States at the end of the 1980s, as well as  somewhat less coal than in Great Britain, France and the FRG  taken together; as much steel as the FRG and France taken  together was smelted every year. We have all always taken pride  in that, and few gave any thought to the harm being done to  nature.    But here are even ``better'' data. The imperfect  technologies  for the production and processing of raw minerals that are used  in Ukraine lead to losses of up to 70 percent for oil, 50  percent for salts, 40 percent for coal, and 2--5--with some even  10--13 times--more than is required by contemporary technologies  for metals. Close to 1.5 billion tonnes a year of natural  substances are involved in the process of social production  across Ukraine as a whole. More than half are them returned to  the natural environment in the form of wastes that poison the  surroundings.    But even that is not all.    We are continuing to augment power capacity, in particular  nuclear, forgetting both the lessons of Chornobyl and the fact  that the share of this sector is reaching 30 percent of the  total emissions of harmful substances today. At the very same  time, the overconsumption of energy at the enterprises of  ferrous metallurgy alone in Ukraine, owing to their technical  backwardness, is equivalent to the quantity of electric power  generated by all the AESs [nuclear electric-power plants] of the  former USSR. The energy-intensiveness of our output as a whole  is six to eight times greater than the analogous measures for  the leading Western countries.    The list of this economic self-cannibalism could be  continued  a great deal longer. Notwithstanding this state of affairs,  understanding of the fact that the non-ecological development of  the national economy, with sweeping and profound negative  effects on the environment, could surpass the consequences of  any aggression is still lacking in our society. Backward  ecological thinking is unfortunately being demonstrated at all  levels of the power structures.    A review that was conducted recently has shown that the  specially created extra-budgetary environmental-protection funds  of the Soviets of People's Deputies, which are responsible under  prevailing legislation for the state of the environment within  the bounds of their territories, are not being used primarily  for their intended purposes. A whole series of cities in the  Donetsk-Dnieper region, where only 20--30 percent of the fund is  being used for environmental-protection measures, could be a  negative example of this. The rest goes for ``patching holes''  in the local budgets. All of this is occurring in a region where  the extent of contamination of the environment is the greatest  in Ukraine.    Our republic budget, however, is the most instructive  example  of the lack of a statewide approach to the resolution of  ecological problems. Just 0.2 percent of the gross national  product (GNP) was envisaged for all environmental-protection  measures in 1993. And that is in the face of the fact that  economic losses are reaching far beyond 10 percent of the GNP as  a consequence of the worsening state of the natural environment.  By way of comparison, most of the ecologically clean countries  of the West spend 2--4 percent of their GNPs on measures to  protect the environment. The Minpryrody [Ministry of  Environmental Protection] monitors just 10 percent of that  symbolic amount, with the rest of the budget appropriations,  without regard for ecological priorities, being monitored under  the old sector principle by Minekonomiki [Ministry of Economics]  and Minfin [Ministry of Finance].    The state of affairs is no better in the system to monitor  the upholding of environment-protection legislation. The  Minpryrody of Ukraine only recently obtained the right to  subject violators to administrative liability. As for ecological  crimes--which are being committed everywhere--some bodies of the  procuracy have taken a crazy stance. Instead of fighting against  these crimes, they have made the object of their vigilant  attention... Minpryrody itself. It is, of course, far easier to  ``point out shortcomings'' than it is to bring people to  criminal liability, as recently happened, for example, with the  bringing of toxic substances into the city of Rivne. But perhaps  now is not the time to just ``point out,'' we need, as we are  fond of saying, to ``pull the plow'' together so as to survive.    The terrible ecological situation in which Ukraine finds  itself today has thus been conditioned by the inability of the  post-communist system to act effectively. So we will never  ourselves get out of this abyss without radical economic and  ecological reform.    2. The principal efforts over the time that remains will be  directed toward completing the work on ecological reform that we  started last year. That is, the creation of the legal,  organizational and financial conditions for the pursuit of an  effective ecological policy in Ukraine. The essence of the  problems lies in the necessity of resolving them as soon as  possible, in the creation of mechanisms that would stimulate the  ecologization of production and energy conservation. We are  planning, for that purpose, to institute fees for the  utilization of natural resources, introduce tax concessions for  resource-conserving and ecologically clean technologies, and  employ economic sanctions for the utilization of natural  resources above and beyond standards for or their contamination.    All of these measures, which have to be the basic guidelines  for a new state policy in the realm of protecting the  environment and utilizing natural resources, will lead to the  fact that it will become unprofitable for an enterprise to  pollute the environment and consume resources excessively. More  than twenty legal-standards documents have already been adopted  in order to realize the socio-economic reform.    Also to be completed, aside from that, in the first half of  1994 are:    --the development of a National Program for the protection  of  the natural environment;    --the development of a mechanism to compensate for  ecological  losses as a consequence of the functioning of trunk oil and gas  pipelines, electrical-transmission lines and the transport of  freights across the territory of Ukraine;    --the institution of a system of ecological certification  and  licensing;    --the development of regional ecological programs for the  Dnieper, Donbass and Polissya, along with other documents.    The completion of that work would make it possible to launch  the realization of a policy resulting in the gradual  reproduction of a clean natural environment, a halt to the  extinction of the Ukrainian people and economic prosperity as  early as 1994.    But that is a task for the next government.</p>

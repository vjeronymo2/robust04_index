			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Poland's new government A WELL-GOVERNED and prosperous Poland is essential to stability in the centre of Europe. The formation at the weekend of a new Polish government headed by Ms Hanna Suchocka is, therefore, to be warmly welcomed. Warsaw should now be able to resume negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, deal with foreign investors and resume the task of creating modern, democratic institutions. Much depends on the degree to which the new prime minister can forge a coherent administration out of seven parties. Much depends as well on the kind of support offered by the president. Mr Lech Walesa deserves much of the blame for the political turmoil of the past two years. He deliberately undermined the cohesion of the first non-communist government, led by Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki. Once elected as president, by a far from enthusiastic electorate, he proceeded to quarrel with most of his erstwhile political friends and intrigued endlessly to enhance his power. The struggle became acute after last October's general elections, which were held on the basis of a flawed electoral law. The result was a fragmented parliament and resurrection of the communists as the second largest party. Mr Walesa opposed the new government led by Mr Jan Olszewski, forging what his Polish critics complain is a de facto alliance with former members of the communist nomenklatura in the armed forces and secret police. Two years of in-fighting between the president and parliament have undermined popular support for parliamentary democracy. But they have also further encouraged able Poles to eschew politics and public service and devote themselves to making money instead. Entrepreneurial energy The latter is not a wholly adverse development. Poland's strength is its entrepreneurial energy. Economic reforms during the first few months of democracy, particularly the freeing of foreign trade, the abolition of many subsidies and zloty convertibility, were sufficient to spark off rapid de facto privatisation of the economy. Like Italy, post-communist Poland has shown that its people are able to keep the economy going, even without an effective government. Zloty devaluation has stimulated export growth, which is also helping to pull the economy out of a steep recession. Meanwhile, cuts in government spending have kept inflation within limits acceptable to the International Monetary Fund. With a new government, negotiations with the IMF on an aid and credit package worth about Dollars 2.5bn can resume. Steady government Things could, in short, have been worse. But Poland needs a period of steady government to restore the confidence of foreign investors, restart the stalled mass privatisation programme, modernise the tax and banking systems, and create an effective and affordable social security network. Poland also needs a government able to deal with the sensitive question of the involvement of many public figures in the previous communist regime. Until this is done, the suspicion will remain that some are using their old links either to blackmail those now in power, enrich themselves, or both. A witch hunt must be avoided. Many who worked for the former regime were neither scoundrels nor incompetent. Active and passive opposition to the old regime was more widespread in Poland than elsewhere. But those who served the old regime, especially in areas like internal security and the military should be identified. Those who are hostile to democracy cannot expect to occupy the most sensitive positions. Poland's first post-communist governments ruled on the basis of a compromise that outlasted the collapse of communism. This delayed the vetting process that was needed. But coping with the past must not divert attention from the main priority: building a stable, prosperous and democratic future. With that overriding goal in mind, President Walesa and parliament should work together to support the new government. That government is after all formed of parties that have their origin in the Solidarity movement, which under Mr Walesa's leadership restored democracy to Poland and thus paved the way in eastern Europe.</p>

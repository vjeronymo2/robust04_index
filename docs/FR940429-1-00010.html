			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Persons interested in being placed on the mailing list for future NPRM's should request from the above office a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11&hyph;2A, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Distribution System, which describes the application procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On December 26, 1989, the FAA published a petition for rulemaking received from the Air Transport Association (ATA) that requested the FAA to amend &sect;91.75(a) of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to permit a pilot to deviate from an ATC clearance when responding to a TCAS RA (54 FR 52951). [Effective August 18, 1990, Part 91 of the FAR was revised (54 FR 34284; August 18, 1989) to renumber all of its sections. Section 91.75(a) was renumbered as &sect;91.123(a).] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the FAR's do not provide for any deviation from an ATC clearance or instruction except in an emergency situation. However, during the initial trial and implementation of TCAS II, the FAA notified pilots that no enforcement action would be initiated if the pilot deviated from ATC clearances when responding to TCAS RA's. This notification was provided in a letter signed by the former FAA administrator James B. Busey. The letter was published as appendix C to the TCAS Transition Program (TTP) Project Management Plan, dated August 1, 1990. The FAA also provided procedural guidance, including ATC communication requirements, in Advisory Circular 120&hyph;55, ``Air Carrier Operational Approval and Use of TCAS II'' dated October 23, 1991, and later amended as AC 120&hyph;55A dated August 27, 1993. The policy and guidance proved successful during the testing and implementation of TCAS II. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA petition states that TCAS is an advisory system and not an emergency system. The ATA felt that pilots should be able to comply with a TCAS RA without exercising emergency authority. The ATA petition mirrors current FAA policy and guidance for use of TCAS II. The petition drew no negative comments and one positive comment, from the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA), in support of the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 91.123 of the FAR states, in pertinent part, that each pilot in command who, in an emergency, deviates from an ATC clearance or instruction shall notify ATC of that deviation as soon as possible. This provision could be interpreted to mean that deviations for non-emergency related reasons are not authorized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCAS II is now installed on approximately 6000 aircraft worldwide. Over the past 3 years, more than 15 million flight hours of operational experience have been accumulated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> TCAS Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> TCAS equipment in an airplane interrogates the ATC transponders of other aircraft nearby. By computer analysis of the replies, TCAS equipment determines which transponder-equipped aircraft are potential collision hazards and provides appropriate advisory information to the flight crew. If a TCAS-equipped airplane interrogates an aircraft that is equipped with a Mode A transponder, range and azimuth information will be provided to the TCAS-equipped aircraft. If the interrogated aircraft is equipped with an altitude encoding transponder (Mode C or Mode S), then relative altitude information will be provided in addition to range and azimuth. TCAS equipment cannot detect the presence of an aircraft that is not equipped with a transponder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCAS equipment performs proximity tests on each detected target. If the path of a target is projected to pass within certain horizontal and vertical distance criteria, then that target is declared an intruder. An intruder that is determined to pose an even greater risk of collision is declared a threat. When a threat is declared, TCAS equipment will determine the appropriate direction that the TCAS-equipped aircraft must move (climb or descent) and the vertical rate that must be maintained to achieve separation from the threat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two classes of advisories provided by TCAS equipment. The first class, traffic advisories (TA's), provides supplemental information to the pilot that aids in visual detection of other aircraft. TA's include the range, bearing, and, if the intruder has altitude-reporting equipment, the altitude of the intruding aircraft relative to the TCAS-equipped aircraft. TA's without altitude may also be provided from non-altitude reporting transponder-equipped intruders. The second class of advisories, resolution advisories (RA's), indicates the vertical direction and rate that must be achieved to prevent insufficient separation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCAS I equipment provides TA's that only assist the pilot in visually detecting an intruder aircraft. TCAS II equipment provides TA's and RA's only in the vertical plane. TCAS III, which is still under development, will provide TA's and RA's in both the vertical and horizontal planes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Related Agency Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On January 10, 1989, the FAA published a final rule (54 FR 940), the ``TCAS rule,'' which required airplanes having more than 30 passenger seats and operated under parts 121, 125, or 129 to be equipped with TCAS II by December 30, 1991. The TCAS rule also required airplanes having 10 to 30 passenger seats and operated under parts 129 or 135 to be equipped with TCAS I by February 9, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

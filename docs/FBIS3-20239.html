			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National </F> Alliance, by unidentified correspondent -- live]    [Excerpts] [Fini] I think that who has won seems to be  evident. Now, there is so much confusion. I for one have not  really understood, with this downpour of results, exactly what  the parties' positions are. The only thing that is certain is  that we have won. [passage omitted] I still have to make sense  of what the real facts are, but I am extremely happy.    [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Your party seems to have  got 12.6 percent of the vote. What do you think of that?    [Fini] I would say that that is very good. It's practically  13 percent. It's very good. Excellent.    [Correspondent] Regarding the whole of the Freedom Alliance,  the good government alliance, which gets between 319 and 338  seats in the Chamber of Deputies, an absolute majority, will  there now be problems with your potential ally, someone you have  never considered an ally, Umberto Bossi?    [Fini] Now, once the euphoria of the results has passed, we  will have to calmly assess the whole thing. I think I can say  that the Italians have made a clear choice as to who is to  govern them.

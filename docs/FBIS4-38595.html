			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports: "Crimea"] </F>   [Text] A Ukrainian Navy press center statement that has  been made public has voiced concern over the situation in  Sevastopol. The statement says that a reinforced tank battalion  and an antiaircraft battalion will soon be withdrawn from the  strength and composition of the Black Sea Fleet forward defense  combined unit and sent to Sevastopol to become part of the Black  Sea Fleet marine brigade. Being formed at the present time are  command structures for these subunits, some of whose officers  have already moved to Sevastopol for permanent residence.    It is characteristic, the statement says, that the Black Sea  Fleet command should make a decision to pull the attack forces  into Sevastopol with no prior notification to corresponding  echelons or the necessary coordination. At the same time, the  Black Sea Fleet command does not tire of stating its intention  to stabilize the situation, and urges political figures "to do  everything possible to resolve the questions under debate in a  politically amicable way." The Ukrainian Navy press center  statement voices bewilderment and alarm over the fact that "it  has long been a practice with the Black Sea Fleet, which is  subordinated to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia as before,  to carry out a redeployment of forces, to have large groups of  ships put out to sea."    The Ukrainian Navy press center is authorized to make a  resolute protest against the unilateral actions by the Black Sea  Fleet command which hinder stabilization of the situation in  Sevastopol and the Crimean region and stand in the way of  developing normal friendly relations between Ukraine and Russia.  The Navy command renews its readiness to solve the existing  problems in a civilized way and counts on the prudence of the  Black Sea Fleet command, and of all on whom peace and quiet on  Crimean soil depend in some way or another.</p>

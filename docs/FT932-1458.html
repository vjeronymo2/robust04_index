			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (2): The metamorphosis of Manchester - Britain's bid for the Games is about much more than sport MANCHESTER'S bid for the 2000 Olympic Games symbolises important changes which have been taking place in Britain in the past 15 years. The bid - by Manchester on behalf of north-west England and Britain as a whole - is confirmation that Britain's regions are increasingly able to stand on their own feet. Britain remains a highly centralised country, with main roads and rail lines leading to London, where political power is at its most concentrated. But the dependence of the regions on London has been changing, particularly since the recession of 1980-82. Indeed, over the past three to four years, while the south-east has borne the brunt of the most recent economic downturn, the impact in Britain's regions has been less serious. Unemployment has risen less rapidly; average house prices in Greater Manchester have held steady and the prices of some types have risen. In the south-east by contrast, prices have fallen sharply. There appear to be three main reasons for these trends. First, London priced itself out of regional markets, for many financial and professional services in the 1980s, encouraging growth in these sectors in the regions, especially in Manchester and Leeds. This, in turn, has created tens of thousands of professional and white-collar jobs, and helped to turn Manchester into an important financial and professional centre in its own right. The second reason is infrastructure. The completion of the M62 between Liverpool and Hull has meant that not all main roads now lead south. An intra-regional trading economy has developed along the length of the M62 - directed through the Humber, which now matches the Thames in total cargoes. The Humber faces good northern European regional markets across the North Sea. The other infrastructure element is Manchester Airport, which - since its designation as an international gateway and Britain's official northern hub in the mid-1980s - has trebled in size to become the 18th largest in the world and plans to leapfrog five places up the world league table by 2005. The third force driving change has been economic and physical reconstruction. City centre dereliction has been tackled by creating new uses for old buildings, such as museums. A disused Manchester railway station has been turned into an exhibition hall and arena, and ship canal docklands have been transformed into a mixed residential-commercial quarter, Salford Quays. In Liverpool, the north west's other great city, the Albert Dock, a huge brick Victorian dockside warehouse built in the age of sail, now houses the northern branch of the Tate Gallery. Mr Anthony Goldstone, chairman of the North West Tourist Board, says: 'All this has started to change the image of smoking mill chimneys, dereliction and pollution. More than 5,000 mill chimneys have been knocked down. Tourists spend Pounds 1bn a year in the region.' At the same time, small and medium-sized business development - the seed corn of economic revival - has been fostered by the UK's most comprehensive regional network of enterprise agencies. Manchester's venture capital and corporate finance communities are strong, with power to syndicate their own deals, without the need to go to London. All these factors have enabled Manchester to mount a credible bid for the Olympic Games, even though many in southern England still believe only London is capable of winning such a prize. The bid is being driven by four people: Mr Bob Scott, whose vision it was; Mr Craig Reedie, chairman of the British Olympic Association and an unwavering supporter; Mr Howard Bernstein, deputy chief executive of Manchester city council, who fulfils the functions of finance director and general manager; and Mr John Glester, chief executive of Central Manchester Development Corporation, the government regeneration agency for the centre of the city. This makes him Whitehall's proxy in the team. Supporting them are the politicians. They start with Mr Graham Stringer, the pragmatic and widely-respected Labour leader of Manchester city council, and they finish with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, who has been active publicly and privately lobbying IOC members. The prime minister wants Manchester to succeed, and has made the most decisive contribution so far by guaranteeing funding, and by committing more than Pounds 75m of public money to clearing sites and building facilities. Amec, the construction group, is already building a velodrome and Bovis an arena. Manchester has as a result secured approval from the IOC's 12-member technical delegation, enabling the city to concentrate on selling itself, as a gateway to a Britain which can be easily reached via a transportation infrastructure already largely in place. As a further bonus, London is easily accessible to visitors. When Atlanta won the 1996 Games, it followed the securing of similar technical approval. Its final campaign was able to sell Dixie and the romantic US south. Manchester made a bid for the 1996 Games and lost - but it learned from the experience. If it wins this time, it will be because it won its heats at home, not only knocking London out of the running but persuading the government that staging the Games made serious economic sense and deserved some up-front spending. This is not just because of the Pounds 4bn of added value which the Games would be likely to generate, with more than 11,000 jobs created, but because holding the events in the north west would speed the regeneration of a difficult part of east Manchester blighted by a former coal mine, a gasworks and canalside dereliction which is a legacy of the industrial revolution. Long term, these problems would have had to be tackled anyway, as would Manchester's growing problem over student accommodation, which subsequent use of the Olympic athlete's village will partly solve. The Olympic bid has, therefore, provided a focus. Winning the Games will give Manchester a chance of emerging as one of Europe's most important cities in the 21st century. Manchester is already capital of the north. Economically, the north-west alone is bigger than Greece or Portugal. Mr Stringer thinks Europe will have room for only about a dozen big regional centres in the next few decades and Greater Manchester, a conurbation of 2.5m people in a north of England populated by 14m, is already well on the way to becoming one of them. Mr Stringer says it should be compared with Lyons, Barcleona, Milan, Stuttgart or Munich to appreciate its European potential. The Games would therefore help change the structure of Britain and the balance of economic power between north and south. They are concerned with much more than 17 days of sport in seven years' time.</p>

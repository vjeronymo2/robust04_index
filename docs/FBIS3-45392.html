			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 13 (CNS)--China will quicken its  pace in the restructuring of the social security system with the  focus on improvement of a pension system for urban workers and  of the social security system. Insurance premiums will be borne  by individuals and entitles while a new practice of paying  premiums will be employed. This was revealed at a meeting held  by the China People's Insurance Company today.    The social security system reform mainly covers the setting  up of an individual pension account for urban workers with the  pension premium being calculated in proportion to one's wage and  shared by the employee and the employer who hired the worker.  The paid premium is registered in the worker's individual  account and the amount the worker has to pay in the period to  come will increase gradually to a level that the employer should  share.    The public expenses and medical care system for the workers  is also under reform with the aim of creating a medical  insurance system covering individual medical accounts and social  insurance funding for serious illness. The money used for the  present medical system with its expense jointly shared by  enterprises and the governmental department will be divided into  two parts, one part for the establishment of a social insurance  fund for medical expenses for serious illness suffered by  workers while the other part is for the setting up of an  individual medical account for general spending on medical care.    The scope for unemployment insurance will expand to  gradually  create a better unemployment insurance system to cover workers  of state-owned, collective and privately-owned enterprises and  those employed by the Chinese partner in foreign-funded  enterprises.    Under the current social security system, beneficiaries are  restricted to workers of government organs and state-owned  enterprises as well as a handful of residents suffering great  difficulties, making up a mere 30 percent of the total labour  force. The money needed for the system will be mainly funded by  the state and raised by enterprises themselves. Owing to its  national situation, China cannot afford high welfare spending  and instead should practice fund-raising by individuals in a bid  to ease the burden on the state and enterprises. In rural areas  peasants must maintain the practice of supporting their family  elders at the present stage.</p>

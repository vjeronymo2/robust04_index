			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- Taiwan may be forced to  adopt the "Japanese formula" instead of the "Korean formula" in  opening its rice market to foreign imports, an official  representing Taiwan at tariff reduction negotiations in Geneva  last week said upon his return to Taiwan on Tuesday [24 May].    Chen Wu-hsiung, director of the Economics and Planning  Department under the Council of Agriculture, said in order to  join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, Taiwan  will have to make some concessions in its trade regime,  including liberalizing the rice market.    GATT regulations stipulate that Japan should allow rice  imports of 4 percent of the nation's total rice consumption in  its first year as a GATT member, and increase imports by 0.8  percent annually to reach 8 percent by 2000.    South Korea, which GATT considers a developing country, must  open 1 percent of its rice market to foreign imports in the  first year with gradual increases ranging from 0.25 percent to 2  percent annually in the following years and to open up 4 percent  of its market to foreign rice within 10 years.    Most GATT contracting parties agreed in Geneva that Taiwan  should not be allowed to follow the Korean formula because  Taiwan is a developed country, Chen said.    Chen also said Taiwan will be hard hit by GATT regulations  concerning fruit imports. Chen reckoned that Taiwan peaches,  citrus fruits, mangoes, pineapples and pears will face increased  competition from abroad.    Chen argued that it was unjustifiable that most GATT member  countries are against Taiwan's desired tariffication plan  because Taiwan is not a GATT member while at the same time  demanding that Taiwan abide by the Uruguay Round trade accords  to eliminate government subsidies to farmers.</p>

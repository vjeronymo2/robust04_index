			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / American products jostle for market share Within hours of President Clinton's decision to end the Vietnam trade embargo the first American company had arrived yesterday to grab a slice of the action. By the end of the day, Pepsico, the US soft drinks maker, not only had bottles of Pepsi-Cola rolling off a production line in Ho Chi Minh City, but was preparing to advertise its product on television this weekend with a commercial starring Miss Vietnam. Pepsi, which had signed an agreement with a local bottler last year in anticipation of the embargo ending, seemed to have stolen a march on its rival, Coca-Cola. But Coke said it would not be far behind. 'Local production will begin as soon as concentrate and other necessary materials can be brought into the country.' Another famous US brand, American Express, will also soon appear. This week the US charge card company tookthe first step towards creating a network of hotels, retailers and others who will accept the card as it signed up the state-owned Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam to act as its paying agent in the country. Meanwhile United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, said it would begin scheduled air services between Los Angeles and Ho Chi Minh City as soon as it had received government approvals. Northwest Airlines said it was seeking to start services between Detroit and Ho Chi Minh City. In fact, American brands are already ubiquitous in Vietnam. Products from Coca-Cola to IBM get round import restrictions if they have been bottled or assembled somewhere other than the US. US companies have been permitted to set up offices in Vietnam and sign contracts with Vietnamese parties since December 1992, when President Bush partially eased the embargo. That has allowed US companies to make extensive preparations for trade. General Electric, for example, set up an office in Vietnam last year. It said it saw about Dollars 2bn of opportunities in the next decade for GE equipment such as medical equipment, locomotives and power plant. Otis, the elevator company owned by United Technologies, which ceased operations in Vietnam in 1975, said more than 200 of its lifts were still in the Ho Chi Minh city area and it began negotiating joint venture deals to return to the country last year. Hanoi is reserving its warmest welcome for US companies selling the new technology it badly needs. American business consultants in Hanoi say Boeing is expectedto bid soon for a contract to supply Vietnam Airlines with new medium- and long-range jets. A delegation from General Electric was in Vietnam last week discussing a big power plant and other projects. Other sectors of particular interest to the government are computers and telecommunications, as well as the oil and gas industry from which Hanoi hopes to increase its revenues, partly with the helpof American technology.</p>

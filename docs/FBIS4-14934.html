			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 14, 28 Mar - 3 </F> Apr 94]    [Text] By now, Ukraine's Minister for communication Oleh  Prozhyvalskyy has made several amendments to the tenor of his  Ministry's license issued to Utel (Ukraine's Communications).    Their gist may be reduced to Utel's loss of its exclusive  right to operate transnational telephone links in Ukraine, which  the joint venture enjoyed since 1992.    The Minister is also said have specified that licenses to  other operators may be issued on condition they promise to  invest a portion of their incomes in development of Ukraine's  telecommunications.    Formally, the Utel case was initiated by the Ukrainian  Anti-Monopoly Committee.    The latter is said to be currently drafting its judgement on  the problem, which has thus arisen. The Justice Ministry is  scrutinizing Utel's statute documents with a view of making the  necessary amendments.    A Cabinet decision on the Utel jv [joint venture] is  believed  to follow within a week.    The Utel jv was set up in 1992. The Ukrainian party, which  is represented by 13 out of Ukraine's 25 regional communication  agencies and the Ukrtekh and Kievelektrosvyaz associations, owns  51 per cent of its capital. The remainder is divided among the  US AT&amp;T, Germany's Deutsche Telecome (19.5 per cent each  party)  and the Netherlands' PTT Telecom (10 per cent of the jv's  authorized capital).    As experts believe, Utel-2, which is supposed to unite the  other 12 regional communication agencies, which are not among  Utel's co-founder's can materialize if only some major Western  company takes part in the project. France's Alcatel and  Canada's Teleglobe are currently mentioned as having displayed a  certain degree of interest to Ukraine's telecommunication market.    Since Utel's strategy relies primarily on land-based lines,  rather than satellite communication links, UKRINFORM asked  Andrey Zhalko-Titarenko, deputy director-general of the  Ukrainian National Space Agency, to comment on changes in  Ukraine's telecommunication market.    Says Mr. Zhalko-Titarenko: "Elimination of the US AT&amp;T's  monopoly on Ukraine's communication market by way of the  Netherlands' AT&amp;T's participation in Utel is a major step  toward  a market economy in Ukraine".    The gist of arguments, which Utel's opponents resort to, is  AT&amp;T's allegedly unreasonably high proceeds due to the  so-called  disbalanced traffic on account of the number of incoming calls  exceeding that of made from Ukraine, since world telephone  tariffs cannot be paid by the bulk of Ukraine's citizens. As  satellite communication proponents have to admit, though,  satellite communication tariffs can hardly be expected any  lower, at least in the initial project implementation stage.</p>

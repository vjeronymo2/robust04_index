After Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin  exhorted the vast number of commanders and fighters, especially  high-ranking officers, of the armed forces in telling them they  must strive to study modern technology, especially high and new  technology, the offices of all PLA headquarters, military  colleges, and field units alike have all launched programs for  studying high technology.    According to statistics, the armed forces sponsored more  than  2,000 collective high-tech training classes last year, and the  tactical exercises carried out were unusual compared to those of  many previous years in terms of their high degree of difficulty.

			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> TAKASUGI PREPARES FOR COSTLY CAMPAIGN;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: TWO YEARS AGO, OXNARD'S MAYOR RAISED MORE THAN $160,000 AND OUTSPENT  HIS CLOSEST RIVAL BY $90,000. HE MAY FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATH THIS YEAR.  </P> <P> When Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi was recently asked how much money he intends to  raise in his bid for an unprecedented fifth term in office, he said: "Whatever  it takes to win."  </P> <P> That statement sent a disquieting message to his challengers, who remember how  Takasugi surpassed the city's spending record two years ago by raising more  than $160,000 for his campaign.  </P> <P> During that race, the mayor outspent his closest rival by $90,000. In fact, his  campaign expenditures were more than double those of each candidate in that  year's Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> "I'm still reeling from it," said Councilman Manuel Lopez, who spent $55,000 --  including $10,000 from his own pocket -- in an unsuccessful bid to unseat  Takasugi.  </P> <P> Although Takasugi hopes he will not have to spend as much this year, he faces  five candidates who "are going to take shots at me from every direction."  </P> <P> "To counter those points, I'm going to have to use some means, and that  requires some money," he said.  </P> <P> His challengers agree that money will play an important role in this year's  election. They also acknowledged that it will be hard to beat Takasugi, whose  experience includes two years on the Planning Commission and four years as a  councilman before becoming mayor in 1982.  </P> <P> "Money is important because you have to have some means to communicate to the  voters and there is no substitute for the media," said Scott Bollinger, a  self-employed investor.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Dorothy Maron, who is considered Takasugi's most serious  challenger, agreed. "Money does play a big part in the race and it should not  be underestimated," she said.  </P> <P> In 1988, Takasugi spent more than $61,000 on literature, including 2,800 lawn  signs, 10,000 personalized letters and about 80,000 mailers. Nearly $10,000 was  spent on postage, $4,420 on newspaper advertising and about $3,300 for  broadcast advertising. Another $14,000 went to John Davies, his Santa  Barbara-based campaign consultant.  </P> <P> A large portion of the remaining $70,000 or so went to pay for overhead costs  of running the campaign, such as telephone and electric bills. A smaller  portion went toward the cost of producing several surveys and fund-raisers.  </P> <P> The race put Takasugi $19,404 in debt, according to a campaign statement.  </P> <P> Maron said that during the final days of the 1988 campaign, Oxnard residents  were "constantly seeing Takasugi's picture and his name, and no matter what  anybody says, that is power."  </P> <P> Another 1988 mayoral candidate, Paul K. Dolan, who now is managing Bollinger's  campaign, said Takasugi "bombarded everyone with image rather than substance."  </P> <P> Then-Councilman Michael Plisky, who spent almost $70,000 on his campaign  against Takasugi, lost by almost 5,000 votes. Takasugi surpassed Lopez by about  9,000 votes and trounced Dolan by almost 14,000 votes.  </P> <P> According to campaign statements, the lion's share of Takasugi's money came  from construction firms, real estate brokers and developers.  </P> <P> Almost all the donations of more than $1,000 came from developers like the  Darrik Marten Co. of Ventura, the Martin V. Smith Co. of Oxnard, the Sammis Co.  of Irvine and the William Lyon Co. of Newport Beach.  </P> <P> While Takasugi received a small portion of his money in the form of donations  under $100, most of it came from donations in the $200-to-$500 range.  </P> <P> Dolan and Bollinger questioned Takasugi's integrity for taking such large  contributions from developers. They suggested that developers have given to  Takasugi's race in exchange for preferential treatment when they need approval  of development proposals.  </P> <P> "Money has become the central issue in getting candidates elected, as opposed  to issues," Dolan said.  </P> <P> Davies called such allegations ridiculous and said that almost every candidate  in the 1988 election received donations from developers. He said developers  traditionally make large donations in Oxnard because they have a genuine  concern for the community.  </P> <P> A major portion of Takasugi's money was generated at two $100-a-plate  fund-raising dinners at the Tower Club in Oxnard. "The Tower Club was a great  fund-raiser," Davies said.  </P> <P> Atop the 22-story Union Bank Building, the Tower Club has recently been the  site of fund-raising parties for gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein and  Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> The club's membership includes Takasugi; Police Chief Robert Owens; Dist. Atty.  Michael D. Bradbury; Martin V. Smith, president of the development company of  the same name; and John Gilbert, president of the TOLD Real Estate Corp., one  of the county's largest development firms.  </P> <P> In comparison, Takasugi spent about $43,000 on his 1986 mayoral campaign. He  said he decided to raise extra funds for his 1988 campaign because Plisky  announced early in the race that he would raise at least $75,000.  </P> <P> "We said if that is the case, we need to raise some money too," Takasugi said.  </P> <P> Several months ago, before she announced her intention to challenge Takasugi,  Maron proposed that council members informally agree to place limits on how  much they spend on their campaigns.  </P> <P> However, City Atty. Gary L. Gillig, who researched the issue for the council,  said that laws limiting spending are unconstitutional because they violate the  First Amendment.  </P> <P> Maron suggested limiting spending to 50 cents per voter, or about $23,000 per  campaign. The suggestion prompted adamant opposition from Takasugi, who said  such limits would infringe on his constitutional rights.  </P> <P> "I will not give up my constitutional right to what I can do to keep my seat in  office," he said at the time.  </P> <P> In an interview last week, Takasugi suggested that Maron made the proposal  because she wanted to place some restraints on his campaign, an allegation  Maron denies.  </P> <P> Bollinger acknowledges that there is little hope of outspending Takasugi this  year. "He's done it in the past and I don't see a reason why he can't do it  now," Bollinger said.  </P> <P> However, he and Maron both believe they can beat the mayor in November by  campaigning strongly on the city's financial problems and the pace of current  development.  </P> <P> In fact, Bollinger has already begun his attack on Takasugi in an advertisement  he has put in three newspapers. The ad includes a photo of Bollinger and a  headline that reads "Bollinger 'Tackles' Takasugi in Run for Oxnard Mayor."  </P> <P> Dolan said Bollinger will offer himself as the "alternative candidate" and  hopes to ride into office on a wave of anti-incumbency feeling.  </P> <P> Maron, who said she spent about $11,500 on her last reelection bid, said she  also hopes to promote a "controlled-growth" development policy and focus her  campaign on solving the city's recent financial problems.  </P> <P> "He's been there for eight years and has talked about growth being good," she  said. "But how come we still have money problems?"  </P> <P> Takasugi's camp is not taking this year's challenge lightly.  </P> <P> Within the next two weeks, Davies said Takasugi will have 15 to 20 full-time  volunteers soliciting donations and planning campaign strategy. Davies said he  will advise the mayor to promote his strongest asset: his experience in City  Hall.  </P> <P> "No one has better experience," Davies said.  </P></p>

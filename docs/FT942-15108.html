			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Sport: Japanese shrine in garden of England - Derek Lawrenson visits two luxurious and very expensive new courses / Golf Masao Nagahara is believed to have made Pounds 800m from just one financial transaction, and so finding the loose change to build what amounts to his own private golf course, in Kent, was not a problem. Even at this time of the year the tees and the greens are so perfect you feel almost sinful walking on them in spikes. Like many Japanese businessmen, Nagahara's sport is golf, and in particular golf as it is played in the US and Britain and especially the latter. 'It is the home of golf,' he said, with a reverence that caused his eyes to glisten. Nagahara's course, in which he has invested Pounds 40m, is, oddly enough given its location, called The London golf club. Membership debentures are available at Pounds 22,700. Annual subscriptions cost Pounds 1,250. So far the club has 230 members and a notional target figure of 980. 'If we can get another 250 this year we shall cover our operational costs,' Nagahara said. He will not lose sleep if he does not. 'I achieved what I set out to achieve before we had one member,' he said. Two things that stand out about golf in Japan are the cost of playing, which makes it the ultimate rich man's status symbol, and the attention to detail. The bunkers are not just raked, there are special greenkeepers who go around with small brushes to finish the job. Nagahara is transplanting this philosophy to the UK. He called it 'a blending of the two cultures.' Another Japanese-financed venture, the Oxfordshire golf club, sums up the approach. The initial investment was Pounds 25m. The course was designed by the distinguished American architect, Rees Jones, his first work in Britain. Again, the tees and greens are immaculate. Debenture memberships for The Oxfordshire cost Pounds 26,000. The club has 300 members and wants 650. The Oxfordshire is owned by the Nitto Kogyo Corporation, whose president, Hitoshi Matsura, plays off 14. Matsura also owns Turnberry, where his company has spent Pounds 22m upgrading the course so that it ranks with any in the world. In its formative years Matsura's company made agricultural machinery but now owns 30 golf courses in Japan, and seven in the US. He is wary of media interest. Certainly it is easy to be critical of his approach. Are the Oxfordshire, and the London golf club for that matter, really golf clubs when so few will walk their fairways and populate their opulent clubhouses this year? Nor will there be any green-fee-paying customers, unless they have been invited by members. The fact that some people take up debenture memberships simply because they foresee a substantial profit merely adds to the ire of those who view these places as elitist. One member of the London GC explained that he joined because: 'The debentures were Pounds 16,000 when I bought one and already the price is up to Pounds 22,700.' 'We could really do with a few more members to create the atmosphere of a golf club,' the London tournament professional, Peter Mitchell said. 'The only time it is at all busy is at the weekends.' Alex McMillan, general manager of The Oxfordshire, worked for Nitto Kogyo in Japan. He said: 'What we are trying to establish here has nothing to do with elitism or some out of this world facility, but something that can be appreciated by all who play it. 'The object was to bring together the Japanese golfer and the British businessman and an ideal way of enhancing that is by providing a golfing atmosphere. In Japan, the golf course is a great business asset and it is a place where a lot of business is done, and that philosophy is something we are trying to cultivate here.' In any case, what one man sees as an ego trip, another considers a valuable contribution to the evolution of golf in Britain. These courses have set new standards in terms of conditioning, for one thing. It used to be argued that a European tour event could not be held in England before May because there was no growth on the greens. You could hold one at either the London GC or The Oxfordshire on Christmas Day and the putting surfaces would equal those at Augusta. 'I have been practising at the London golf club all winter and I know they will be better than the greens we will be putting on during the height of the summer,' Mitchell said. Nagahara was in heaven recently. His goal was not just to build a golf course in Britain but also to have it designed by his favourite golfer, Jack Nicklaus. The members were informed that Nicklaus would be coming in by helicopter to look at his new creation, play nine holes with two of his sons, and talk them through what he had set out to achieve. Imagine that scenario at most golf clubs in Britain. It would have been the talk of the clubhouse for months on end, and stories of his visit would have entered club lore. At the London golf club, 50 people showed up. In Japan it takes six hours to play a round because so many people are crammed on to the courses. Such is the Japanese enthusiasm for the game. In Britain few people play the courses the Japanese own because few people can afford it. They are like exhibits of fine art, and like such things, depending on your viewpoint, you can either look and admire, or you can shake your head and wonder why anyone would be daft enough to pay such prices.</p>

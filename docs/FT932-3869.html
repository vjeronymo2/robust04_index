			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Record quarter for Canadian securities firms CANADA'S securities firms ran up record profits in the first three months of this year, with a strong performance in almost every part of their business. The Investment Dealers Association reported that 132 firms posted net first-quarter earnings of CDollars 168m (USDollars 131m), up by 87 per cent from a year earlier. Revenues grew by 34 per cent to CDollars 4.9bn. First-quarter 1993 profits equalled about two-thirds of the total for 1992. A further encouraging sign for the industry is that employment, at almost 20,400, has returned to its highest level since 1989. According to the IDA, the strong growth has stemmed from both retail and institutional business, and from debt and equity markets. Financial advisory services, underwriting and securities trading have boomed in recent months. Mutual funds have been an especially fast-growing part of Canadian financial markets. Mutual fund sales made up a fifth of the securities industry's first-quarter commission revenues, compared with only 4 per cent five years ago. Underwriting fees jumped by 66 per cent. The profits of individual firms are not disclosed. However, several of Canada's big six banks recently singled out their investment banking subsidiaries as major contributors to their earnings for the quarter to April 30. RBC Dominion Securities, the country's biggest brokerage firm, which is 76 per cent-owned by Royal Bank of Canada, posted a quarterly profit of almost CDollars 30m.</p>

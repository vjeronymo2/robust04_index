			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/400: "Chairman 'Arafat and Vice </F> President Marin Sign Documents on EU Aid to Occupied  Territories"]    [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and European Commission  Vice President Manuel Marin signed two documents in Tunis on 13  May on EU aid to the Occupied Territories. They provide for the  European Community to make available 10 MECU [million ECU's] for  the establishment of the Palestinian police force and 1.8 MECU  for the election process.    Chairman 'Arafat and Vice President Marin signed a document  providing 10 MECU on aid to the police force. The grant will be  split equally into finance for recurrent expenditure on the  force (operational expenses, fuel and maintenance, salaries  etc.) and the provision of equipment for the force, mostly  vehicles. It will not be used for the provision of lethal  equipment.    The 10 MECU will contribute towards expenditure for the  priority period covering the first 5 1/2 months of the  deployment of the force. In view of the urgency of the rapid  and effective establishment of the force, the Community is using  accelerated procedures to ensure rapid availability of the  finance.    Chairman 'Arafat and Vice President Marin signed a second  document providing 1.8 MECU aid for the electoral process in the  Occupied Territories. Under this document the European  Community will assist the Palestine Commission for Local  Government and Elections (PCLGE) to enable the preparation and  execution of democratic Palestinian elections and the building  of new local government institutions. This will cover such  activities as the preparation of the electoral law, training of  officials, preparation of manuals, definition of boundaries, as  well as the registration of voters and the physical arrangements  for the elections themselves.    The EC contribution will cover the major part of the costs  involved in the electoral process. The EC has also agreed to  assist the Palestinians in the organisation of a donors'  conference to ensure the funding of the final elements of the  election preparations.</p>

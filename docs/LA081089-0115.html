			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Three of nine top Contra military officers, including the rebel chief of staff,  were granted U.S. political asylum, immigration official Perry Rivkind said in  Miami. The officers won State Department approval for asylum two days after  five Central American presidents agreed on a plan to demobilize the  anti-Sandinista forces. Israel Galeano, the rebel chief of staff known as  Comandante Franklin, led the list of officers filing asylum claims. Francisco  (Johnny) Delgadillo, a Contra political adviser also granted asylum, conceded  that the action could be misinterpreted by rebel troops holed up in camps on  the Honduran border.  </P></p>

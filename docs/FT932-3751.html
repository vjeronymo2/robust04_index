			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Letter: True owners wear bowler hats Sir, I refer to Barry Riley's article, 'When brass is greener' (June 5). In the main the investing institutions are not owned by proprietors but in their turn are run by managers. Perhaps we can encourage full transparency and accountability in those organisations. Then the true owners of capital may permit their appointed managers to wear bowler hats. D K Wilmot, 8 Mountview, Northwood, Middlesex HA6 3NZ</p>

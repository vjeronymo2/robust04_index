			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Bombay makes tentative recovery from scandal - Government economic measures could help Indian share prices to rise further Indian bourses, enjoying their first rally for three months, are awaiting measures from the PV Narasimha Rao administration which, they hope, will stimulate the economy and boost equity values that have languished since a securities scandal broke early in May. New Delhi plans to make the rupee fully convertible, lower interest rates if prices continue to drop, relax controls on the pharmaceutical industry, and announce contracts with international oil companies for oil exploration and production. Most of these decisions are expected to be in place before Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, reviews India's programmes with the International Monetary Fund in Washington in three weeks' time. The 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), India's largest with two-thirds of national trading, is looking back at a slump which took it as low as 2,529 in early August, down 1,938 points, or 43 per cent, from a peak of 4,467 in mid-April, prompted by the seizure of assets of Mr Harshad Mehta and other brokers implicated in the Rs35bn (Dollars 1.25bn) securities scandal. After hitting a six-month low on August 6, share prices have rebounded since then, partly in response to government decontrol of chemical fertiliser prices and as bear operators covered their positions. Gujarat State Fertilisers have gained Rs60 to Rs340 and Zuari Agro Chem are Rs90 better at Rs390. Turnover, which had contracted from Rs3bn a day seen in April to less than Rs400m four months later, recovered to Rs1.72bn by last weekend as institutions and mutual funds bought at lower levels. The market appears to have found its level, for now. Share values moved in a narrow range last week and the 30-share index, at 3,031 last Friday, was around the same level as a week earlier. Yesterday the index closed at 3,040.57, down 29.92. Mr MR Mayya, executive director of the BSE, says the market is healthier now. Selling pressure has eased and the authorities have removed all restrictions on sales. But individual investors have yet to return in force, deterred by the forthcoming rush of rights issues, following the scrapping of capital issues control last month. Some Rs50bn worth of rights issues are scheduled over the next two months. Analysts say, however, that strong fundamentals and the government measures should lift share prices further over the next three weeks. Furthermore, the monsoon rains have been evenly spread throughout the country, improving crop prospects. The question is whether police and income tax authority raids on brokers and finance companies associated with the securities scandal will hamper the market's recovery. A parliamentary committee was set up two weeks ago to inquire into the scandal and the police and income tax authorities may have to co-ordinate with it in the future.</p>

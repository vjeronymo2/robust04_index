			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Letter: Why companies should retain right to publish unaudited data Sir, I am concerned at attempts by the auditing profession to restrict companies' ability to issue public statements on their financial position, including interim results and preliminary announcements of full year results, without having that information signed off by an external auditor. It is important that companies retain the freedom to publish unaudited data. Interim figures and full year preliminary announcements are not audited currently in the UK or in the more tightly controlled US environment. Waiting for all routine audit confirmations to be completed would unduly delay announcements and increase the risk of insider dealing. It would also add to already expensive audit costs. A prudent company will ensure that full year announcements are agreed informally by the external auditors and that either internal or external audit checks are performed on interim announcements. The survey you refer to ('Move for broader auditing of results', February 20) shows preliminary announcements agree with audited figures and demonstrates this process works. It is not surprising that share prices do not move when audited figures are released since the same unaudited figures are already in the public domain. The system works well. Why change it to the obvious detriment of shareholders? P K Wood, group financial controller, director of treasury, Reuters, 85 Fleet Street, London EC4P 4AJ</p>

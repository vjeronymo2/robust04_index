The most powerful candidate as his successor is  believed to be 60-year-old Tadashi Tsuda, former administrative  vice minister of Home Affairs and current chairman of the  Association for Promoting Internationalization of Local  Governments, several government sources said on 29 January.    Ishihara took his post when former Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita came to power in November 1987. Since then, he has  been in office over six years and two months, making his term  the longest one compared with those of successive chief cabinet  secretaries. He once showed his intention to resign when the  coalition cabinet was established. However, persuaded by Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Ishikawa has decided to resign  hopefully after the political reform bills are enacted.    Strong candidate Tsuda joined the Ministry of Home Affairs  in  1955 and served as the administrative vice minister from June  1989 to July 1990.</p>

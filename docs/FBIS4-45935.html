			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Unkindled Agni"] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister's denial in Parliament that the  Agni missile programme was being shelved under American pressure  will only partially remove public misgivings on this score.  Indeed, Mr Narasimha Rao's remark that "there is no pressure  from the United States (and) hence there is no question of  yielding to it" is unlikely to satisfy everyone, considering  that the Americans have made no secret of their deep displeasure  with India's experiments with rocket technology and have been  trying their best, including compelling Russia to renege on the  cryogenic deal, to force India to abandon its various projects.  The U.S. pressure has been there even before the time of the  first launch of the Agni in 1989 when India claimed success in  joining an exclusive club of the Big Five and Israel by  mastering the intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM)  technology. What has led to the renewed speculation about  American intentions is obviously the fact that the reports about  the capping of the Agni programme have followed close on the  heels of the Strobe Talbott visit during which the Americans  tried to persuade India to join a regional nuclear disarmament  conference which carries the threat of imposing restrictions on  various technological experiments. It would have been better,  therefore, for the government to be more explicit about the Agni  project during the Rajya Sabha debate.    The observation of the minister of state for defence, Mr M.  Mallikarjun, that the flight of the Agni "was only a technology  demonstration" and that it was "yet to be decided whether it  should be converted into a missile programme" was no more than a  reiteration of what is known. In the present context, the  government might have clarified whether it would persist with  the experiments. This is all the more necessary because the  third test-firing of the Agni last February was also described  as the final launch which had reportedly met all the  requirements of the objectives set for the mission. As Dr Abdul  Kalam, director-general of the Defence Research and Development  Organisation, said, "so far as technology is concerned, we have  demonstrated our capability" and it was now "for the government  to take a political decision for its induction in the armed  forces." According to some reports, the government is  considering three options: to develop Agni as a weapon of war or  to continue perfecting the IRBM technology but not using  warheads as evidence of India's peaceful intentions, or to drop  the programme altogether. Given the conditions in India's  immediate neighbourhood, there is no question of opting for the  third alternative, but whatever the government's decision, it  must be seen to have been taken purely on merit and not under  any compulsion.</p>

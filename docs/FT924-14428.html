			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Grassroots give Lamont a rough ride CONSERVATIVES set a stormy backdrop for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday with often rebellious speeches on Britain's economic policy - and the perfunctory standing ovation Mr Lamont received afterwards suggested the anger had not waned. Delegates clapped Mr Lamont for about a minute as he sat down - short by Tory party conference standards. Passions reached higher peaks during sections on Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism and the tempestuous debate that proceeded it among Conservative representatives. 'It is clear,' Mr Lamont said mid-way through his speech, 'that we must not go back into the ERM unless and until . . . ' Then a Tory was cheered as he interrupted to shout 'ever' before Mr Lamont continued, ' . . . it is right for Britain.' Mr Lamont was perhaps looking for trouble in the wrong place when he added: 'I know that saying this does not make me very popular in Brussels.' Mr Andrew Tinney, from the south-east area Conservatives, won applause from Lady Thatcher, but not her successor, when he insisted: 'You cannot fix exchange rates between divergent economies'. He demanded that sterling should not re-enter a fixed exchange rate system 'in my lifetime' and insisted that it was necessary that the government cut expenditure and interest rates had to be lowered 'substantially'. Mrs Patricia Morris, of Oldham, was cheered when she said sustained growth and ownership had been 'hallmarks' of Conservative policy during the 1980s, 'until we began to flirt with membership of the ERM . . . Thank God for the divorce.' She continued: 'Unless things change pretty radically in a way wholly appropriate to British interests, there must be no going back.' Teasing Mr Lamont menacingly by accepting that there were no quick fixes, Mrs Morris told Mr Lamont not to say 'everything would be okay by a week on Thursday' and urged him not to 'spot those green shoots with the best eyes in the hall'. She won a standing ovation when she urged a return to the 'real agenda' for recovery. Councillor Dee Dee Dobell, from Yeovil, said: 'I'm disappointed because we appear to have lost our way in the fog. We appear to have no captain or navigator and the purser isn't sure how he is going to finance the trip home.' She accused the German Bundesbank of a 'calculated ploy' aimed at damaging Britain by cutting its interest rate by only a quarter of 1 point last month. Calling for an immediate 5-percentage-point cut in interest rates, Mrs Dobell said small businesses were the heart and soul of the party. To cheers, she told Mr Lamont: 'They give their time, they give their money and they give their full support to our cause - and you are kicking them in the teeth.' But the conference displayed apparent schizophrenia by applauding - and booing - loudly when Mrs Monica Drinkwater, of the Cheltenham Conservative party, told the audience: 'There are enough Opposition and media commentators rocking the boat - we do not expect the elders of our own party to join in. 'This is a time for national and party loyalty.' Lady Thatcher, whose outburst over the ERM and Maastricht had provided a thunderous prelude to the debate, sat silently on the platform. Mr Vernon Davies, from Essex, praised the leadership of Mr John Major for 'steadying the country after the collapse of the ERM'. He, too, called for cuts in interest rates, 'by 2 or even 3 per cent.' Mr Stephen Hillier, from Cambridge, said many commentators were 'baying like Draculas' for the blood of the chancellor. 'But we have heard very little from them of the daily devaluation of our currency which, even since 1979, has caused the value of our money to halve  -the rabid effects of inflation.' Mr Philip Allott, from Harrogate, called for Mr Lamont either to rejoin the ERM or cut interest rates. 'No confidence will be created until the government clarifies what our new economic policy is. Arguably, some could believe that the chancellor is rudderless,' he said.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Levi Strauss profits surge 48% LEVI Strauss, the privately-held and largest brand-name clothing manufacturer, saw a 48 per cent increase in second-quarter profits, to Dollars 113.1m after tax, which compared with Dollars 76.6m a year earlier, and came on sales of Dollars 1.3bn, up 14 per cent. Levi's jeans and jean-related products continued to drive the earnings growth. 'Basic denim continues to be the strongest performer,' said the company. Its sales in the US rose by 22 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars 813.8m, while turnover outside the US increased by a more modest 2 per cent, to Dollars 498.1m. Both Europe and the Asia/Pacific regions fared well, the company commented, but Canada and Brazil reported declining dollar and unit sales in the second quarter.</p>

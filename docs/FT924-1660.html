			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / US-led forces reach Somalia's starving: Julian Ozanne watches as soldiers accompany food convoys deep into the interior of the country US AND French soldiers yesterday rolled into Baidoa, a lawless central Somali town at the centre of the starvation zone, and immediately started escorting food convoys and relief workers battling hunger and disease. It was the first big thrust by the US-led multinational force into the hunger-ridden interior since last week's landing in the capital Mogadishu. An 80 vehicle column of all-terrain vehicles, trucks, armoured personnel carriers and earth diggers carrying 520 US marines and 142 French paratroopers arrived in the town at dawn after a slow 18-hour drive along a rugged bush highway from Mogadishu. The convoy waited for sunrise before entering the town where up to 90 people are dying daily from starvation and wild shootings. An American flag fluttered from the gun mount of an armoured personnel carrier (APC) near the front of the column as fighter jets swooped across the town. Cobra and Huey helicopter gunships flew overhead looking for signs of resistance. So-called 'technicals' - rugged armoured Somali battle wagons - and gunmen melted from the streets and rubble-strewn alleys. Curious Somalis emerged from their ramshackle houses of sticks and corrugated iron and lined the dusty streets waving, smiling and cheering the foreign troops they hope will deliver them from violent anarchy and looting which have destroyed their lives and their country. The marines, dressed in desert camouflage, flak jackets and heavy helmets, waved back and displayed miniature blue and white starred Somali flags intertwined with the Stars and Stripes. The convoy wound its way around the town to the disused airbase, jostling in the potholed narrow streets with camels, cows and donkey-carts carrying water drums and sacks of looted wheat in bags marked 'USA' in red, white and blue. Several cars belonging to journalists, which tried to slip into the convoy, were rammed by the heavy armoured jeeps trying to stay in formation. Some French foreign legionnaires, wanted somewhere for unknown offences, covered their faces with handkerchiefs from the television cameras. At the airfield, seized by an advance marine team late on Tuesday night, 90 gunmen stood in formation on the apron, surrendered their weapons and handed the airport over to the force. Marines secured the guns in an abandoned warehouse and began gathering up Soviet-made missiles, rockets and thousands of rounds of 30mm anti-aircraft shells lying in the overgrown fields along the tarmac. Within 45 minutes seven CH53 transport helicopters, carrying a rifle company of 170 marines, landed on the runway. The marines took up defensive positions in the arid scrub land, and within an hour had set up a camouflaged communications operation and were allowing aid planes carrying food to land. Later in the afternoon French and US soldiers escorted a small convoy of food through the town to an orphanage. The soldiers handed out high-protein biscuits to 400 orphans. Aid supremos, like Mr Bill Garvelink of the US office of Disaster Assistant, flew into the town throughout the day to urgently prepare aid master plans to reach an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 Somalis in the region. Assessment missions of nutritionists and doctors were preparing to make their first trip out of the town for months into the surrounding villages where they fear they will find a hidden tragedy. Deserted villages and thousands of graves surrounding the town bear out a recent US report which said 71 per cent of children under five years old in the area are already dead. Aid workers in Baidoa, who have been victims of an aggressive protection racket, looting and violence, were ecstatic. 'A tremendous sandbag has been lifted off our shoulders,' said Ms Josie Clevenger, project co-ordinator of International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based charity. 'There is the sense of relief that at last the violence is over and that now, together with the military, we can do our job of saving lives.' The US marines came face to face with the starving people and squalid conditions of Somalia's devastated interior. 'I didn't think is was going to be so bad, so dirty, so poor here,' said Captain Bob Castelli, bent over some maps on the bonnet of a Humvee. 'You can tell people are hurting bad here and they are much more hungry than in Mogadishu. It's good that we got here to get the relief supplies moving and get some order in the town.' Children in rags followed marines around the town on their first foot patrol and treated them throughout the day like pied pipers. trying to sell the soldiers cigarettes and mangoes. The patrol passed teenagers and former gunmen clustered in groups on street corners who have hidden their weapons but still wear their trademark T-shirts printed with gangland-style phrases like 'I am the Boss' and 'Here comes the Mafia.' American troops, briefed to win the hearts and minds of the people, struck up conversations with Somali teenagers, most of whom were only interested in asking questions about the sophisticated weaponry of the US army and the 'first world technicals' - the Humvees which are armed with mounted anti-tank cannons. Somalis generally welcomed the foreign soldiers. A hasty banner, thrown across one wall and spelling slightly awry, said: 'We are happy for the intervention.' But many also warned about foreign forces trying to disarm gunmen and stamp out the trade in qat - a narcotic stimulant grown in Kenya but widely used throughout Somalia. 'If the US soldiers are here to help with relief and restore order we are very happy,' said Mr Mohamed Arto, a local trader. 'But if they try to take away our guns and stop the qat coming into the country they will end up in serious trouble. This is our country and our culture. They can do anything but attack that.' In a meeting with aid workers US and French officers said they would not try to disarm battling clan-based factions outside of secured military zones unless they threatened either the forces or relief efforts. But they warned that any 'technical' driving around the streets would be considered as hostile. US military officials said the next step of 'Operation Restore Hope' would be to take control of the unruly southern port city of Kismayo in an amphibious landing within the next five days.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIETING FOR DOLLARS;  </P> <P> JENNY CRAIG PROGRAM PROVES A HEAVYWEIGHT  </P> <P> Don Weiner is no stranger to dieting. "I would start a diet every Monday  morning, which would last until Monday afternoon," said Weiner, a director for  a San Diego sports photography agency.  </P> <P> Then one day a photographer snapped Weiner's picture. Weiner didn't like what  he saw. After researching several options, he signed up at a Jenny Craig Weight  Loss Centre.  </P> <P> Why Jenny Craig? "A friend spoke highly of them; I was attracted by their ads,  and I liked them financially," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 6th-Fastest-Growing  </P> <P> That recipe has the Carlsbad-based Jenny Craig cooking. Since it opened 14  facilities in Los Angeles in 1985, the company has emerged as a heavyweight in  the weight-loss industry. It is also the sixth-fastest-growing privately held  company in America, according to Inc. magazine.  </P> <P> The magazine estimated Jenny Craig's 1987 revenues at nearly $45 million, with  each center averaging annualized sales of about $1 million.  </P> <P> In 1988, the company's sales jumped to $87 million, and they could reach $120  million in 1989, according to Sid Craig, the company's co-founder, chairman and  husband of Jenny Craig. Unlike Bartles and James, of wine cooler fame, she is a  real person.  </P> <P> Profits ran between 11% and 15% of revenues in 1987, according to Inc.  </P> <P> The company has 120 locations, including 8 in San Diego and 40 in Los Angeles.  But this is just the beginning, according to the firm: Jenny Craig has plans to  blanket the nation with 1,000 centers by 1993, half franchised and half  company-owned. At full strength, it hopes to have 1,200 units generating $1.2  billion in sales a year.  </P> <P> The weight-loss market is huge. A 1986 consumer survey conducted by the Calorie  Control Council, an industry trade association, found 65 million Americans  actively dieting. Every year, about 50% of all women and 25% of all men try to  shed unsightly pounds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Apparently a Trend'  </P> <P> The most popular method is substituting low-calorie foods -- a  $40-billion-a-year industry -- for high-calorie ones. Americans spend another  $5 billion on diet books and fad diets. And, said Russell Lemiuex, spokesman  for the Calorie Control Council in Atlanta, every year about 11% of all adult  women and 3% of adult men attend weight-loss classes.  </P> <P> "That is apparently a trend," said Sharon Denny, nutrition information  coordinator for the American Dietetic Assn. in Chicago.  </P> <P> And the trend is big business. For example, Idaho-based Diet Centers, founded  in 1970, now has 2,300 centers open and grossed more than $200 million last  year. Nutri/System, founded in 1971 and headquartered outside Philadelphia, has  1,067 locations and grossed a record $232 million in corporate revenues in  fiscal 1988. And Weight Watchers, perhaps the pioneer in the field, estimates  it has served more than 37 million people in 24 countries since 1963. More than  a million people attend Weight Watchers meetings annually.  </P> <P> Sid and Jenny Craig launched Jenny Craig Weight Loss Centres in 1982, after  selling Body Contour, a Los Angeles-based chain of weight-loss and exercise  centers. Although the deal made them multimillionaires, they didn't walk away  with as much profit as they had hoped. Plus, neither felt old enough to retire.  </P> <P> A two-year, non-compete clause meant they could not open another Body  Contour-like program in the United States. So they decided to concentrate on a  nutritional approach to weight loss and open shop in Australia.  </P> <P> They spent one year and $1 million to develop a line of private-label foods. On  May 9, 1983, they opened nine centers in Melbourne.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Instantly Successful  </P> <P> The centers were not instant successes. First, the Craigs discovered that the  Australian palette differs from the American. Then the Australian equivalent of  the U. S. Food and Drug Administration demanded that the Craigs dump 100,000  boxes of vitamins into the ocean because they contained a substance that was  prescription-only in Australia.  </P> <P> But the Craigs' thorniest problem was the fact that, until they arrived,  Australia had no weight-loss centers at all.  </P> <P> A sustained marketing blitz solved that problem and, within two years, the  Craigs opened 100 centers in Australia, 10 in New Zealand and several in  London. They were grossing $40 million a year. It was time to return home,  which they did with a vengeance in 1985, spending $4 million in advertising to  make their name known.  </P> <P> Under the program, customers pay $185 for as much weekly private and group  counseling as it takes to reach an ideal weight. For $99, they get another year  of counseling to help keep the pounds off. An optional set of motivational  tapes costs $75.  </P> <P> And then there is the food. Until half the weight is lost, customers must eat  only Jenny Craig meals, supplemented by fruits and vegetables bought in the  supermarket. Each of the first two weeks' worth of menus costs $70 to $75.  Thereafter, the week's grocery bill falls to $50 to $60. Beginning at the  halfway mark, dieters are slowly weaned from the Jenny Craig cuisine.  </P> <P> "I think it is very expensive," said Evelyn Tribole, a registered dietitian  based in Newport Beach, author of the book "Eating on the Run" and a  spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Price a Factor  </P> <P> "We are about half the price of others," Sid Craig countered, although the firm  plans to raise its prices this month.  </P> <P> According to a Jenny Craig spokeswoman, to lose 30 pounds with Nutri/System,  the firm's most direct competitor, costs $300 to $500 in service charges and  $50 a week for food.  </P> <P> Weight Watchers costs $30 to sign up and $8 per meeting. Diet Center programs  cost $400 to $500. Neither provides private-label food.  </P> <P> "When I went in, I had made up my mind that, if Jenny Craig's price wasn't  ridiculous, I would do it," said Frank Sonntag, a newspaper circulation  director in Oceanside. "It wasn't cheap, but it was a good investment." Sonntag  said he has lost 27 pounds in two months.  </P> <P> The Jenny Craig menus provide about 1,000 calories a day for women and 1,200  for men.  </P> <P> "One thousand calories is pretty low," said Densie Webb, editor of  Environmental Nutrition newsletter of New York, which compared diet centers in  1987. "Customers should be watched by professionals, especially if they are  used to 3,000 calories a day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Widely Used Figure  </P> <P> "You can get into nutrient deficiencies under 1,200 calories," acknowledged  Robyn Moss, Jenny Craig's director of nutritional programs and a registered  dietitian. "But to lose weight, 1,000 calories is the most widely used  distribution."  </P> <P> Moss said the Jenny Craig plan provides well-balanced meals, meets federally  established nutritional standards and uses vitamin supplements. Moreover, she  said, in her experience doctors invariably approve 1,000-calorie-a-day diets  for weight loss. (The Diet Centers and Nutri/System programs also target 1,000  calories a day.)  </P> <P> Lisa Harris, editor of Current Diet Review and a nutritionist for the San  Bernardino Unified School District, has reviewed the Jenny Craig meal plans.  "The program is nutritionally balanced and, since fruits and vegetables are not  tightly controlled, 950 to 1,000 calories is not dangerous," she said.  </P> <P> Harris assumes that, if people are hungry, they cheat a little. So does Moss.  </P> <P> Despite the size of the market and the potential long-term harm that can come  from a poorly devised weight-loss program, the weight-loss industry is  virtually unregulated. The FDA has established labeling guidelines for food and  will intercede when medicinal claims are made. Otherwise, said the American  Dietetic Assn.'s Tribole, "it is a free-for-all. Anybody can hang up a shingle  and say they are a nutritionist."  </P> <P> Consequently, the most important marketing strategies are word of mouth and  testimonials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Through Referrals  </P> <P> Although Sid Craig has actor Elliott Gould, "Sun Up San Diego's" Jerry Bishop  and KJQY's Claudine St. Clair pitching for him, "about 50% of our customers  come through referrals," he said.  </P> <P> For example, Phyllis of Vista, who asked that her last name not be used, lost  57 pounds in the Jenny Craig program. Today, four of her relatives are  involved. And her daughter works as a counselor for the firm.  </P> <P> Dietitians agree that a successful weight-loss program must change the  customer's long-term eating habits. The trick to losing weight -- eating less,  exercising more -- is simple. Keeping the weight off is more difficult. Weight  that constantly yo-yos can be more dangerous to a person's health than being a  little overweight.  </P> <P> After only two years in America, Jenny Craig has not conducted any long-term  studies to see how many of its customers have kept their weight down. Nor has  Nutri/System. Diet Centers says that, one year after its customers finish the  program, 54% are still at their ideal weight and 79% are within 10 pounds.  </P></p>

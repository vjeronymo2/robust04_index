			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara -- Shortly before two meetings that would be  crucial on the question of Iraq -- a tripartite meeting between  Turkish, Iranian and Syrian foreign ministers and a Turco-Iraqi  meeting possibly at FM [Foreign Ministry] undersecretary level  -- Iraqi Turkmans said any discussion on the issue should also  take them into consideration.    Iraqi National Turkman Party leader Muzafer Arslan, who held  a press conference Tuesday, said an "autonomous region for the  Kurds of northern Iraq" was not acceptable. "If such a right is  given to Kurds, it should also be given to Turkmans," he said.  Responding to press allegations that "the establishment of an  internationally guaranteed Kurdish autonomous region was under  consideration," Arslan signalled his opposition, saying: "We do  not support any solution that is for the Kurds alone. If  autonomy is to be given to Kurds, it should also be given to  Turkmans. If a federation is to be established for Kurds, why  not for the Turkmans? The autonomous system has been practised  in Iran before -- it did not work. Why should it be tried  again?"    Emphasizing that his party's goal was "to ensure that the  Turkmans should benefit from the same rights as the Kurds,"  Arslan said he would stress this once more to Turkish Foreign  Ministry officials before the tripartite summit.    "All interested parties, from Turkey to Iraq's neighbors and  to Western powers, including the United States, support the  territorial integrity of Iraq," Arslan said.    Asked about the upcoming Turco-Iraqi meeting, which is  expected to take place shortly as the "highest level meeting  between the foreign ministries of the two countries," Arslan  said:    "Turkey is a sovereign state and can choose to hold a  meeting  with any country it likes. But what is important is that the  rights of the Turkmans should be discussed. The Foreign  Ministry officials, with whom we are in constant touch, say they  are doing just that. But we have heard no declaration to that  effect."    Arslan suggested that observers, under the U.N. supervision  and with the contribution of Turkey, should be placed in the  Turkman zones.    "We are subjected to the inhuman treatment of the Iraqi  government," Arslan said. "Iraqi soldiers enter Turkman homes.  Eight Turkmans were recently executed in Karkuk three weeks ago."  <H5>  Embargo Should Be Lifted </H5>   Arslan said the embargo should be lifted as Turkmans were  the  ones who most suffered as a result of it.    "It is clear that the embargo has not been particularly  successful in weakening the Saddam regime," he noted. "We have  continuously pushed for the lifting of the embargo, but it is  not up to us. So all we say is the humanitarian needs of the  people should be met."    Despite various allegations that the aid sent to northern  Iraq did not benefit the Iraqi Turkmans, Arslan maintained that  this was not the case.    "There is a Turkman in the aid delivery teams. The aid is  not enough, but it reaches us," he said.    Ankara has allocated 13.5 million dollars worth of  humanitarian aid to northern Iraq.</p>

			<p>940428 FT  28 APR 94 / Tory support 'at 15 year low' There was a fresh blow for the Conservatives last night when a Mori opinion poll put Tory support at its lowest level for at least 15 years, writes David Owen. The poll, published in today's Times, gave Labour - with 47 per cent - a 21 percentage-point lead over the Conservatives on 26. Support for both parties was two percentage points lower than a month ago. The Liberal Democrats were up 3 percentage points on 23 per cent.</p>

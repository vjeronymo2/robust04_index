			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Elderly should not have to worry about financial decisions Sir, It is suggested (Personal View: 'Better deal for personal pensions', November 16) that in order to have dignity and independence in their old age, the elderly ought not to be required to buy annuities with their tax sheltered pension scheme moneys but to have continuing control over their capital. Surely recent experience of encouraging greater freedom for employees, on the advice of independent financial advisers, to frame their own future pensions as they choose should be warning enough. We should be moving in the opposite direction. When we are elderly we do not wish to continue to take part in the financial decisions on which our welfare depends; in fact, we and our spouses are frequently not competent to do so. Far better would be a collectivist approach whereby all pension money or entitlements, at least up to some substantial pension level, could easily be put into one pot on retirement - 70 at the latest. Already, more and more of our pension money comes in bits and pieces, which can be very confusing. So a simple indexed monthly payment from a single source would be an enormous improvement. This would indeed be a valuable service, particularly to the very elderly and the very many who are ailing. We do not retain our dignity by dithering over financial niceties or legal complexities. Only a financial adviser could believe that. David Layton, Income Data Services, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS</p>

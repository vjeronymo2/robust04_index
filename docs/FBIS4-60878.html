			<p>BFN     [Text] Leader of the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation and member of Russian Parliament Gennadiy Zyuganov  says he is opposed to the idea of a national political strike  put forward by Viktor Anpilov, the leader of the Working Russia  Movement.    In an interview with Interfax during a pro-communist rally  at  Vorobyev Hills in Moscow on Sunday, he pointed to widespread  stoppages throughout the country.    Instead, he said, the question is one of massive political  protest against government policies, but on a decision from a  broad coalition of national-patriotic forces rather than any one  party.    For his part, Anpilov in a speech to the earlier May Day  rally in Kaluzhskaya Square had called to start preparations for  a general political strike under the slogans of Down with the  Government of Traitors! All power to the Workers!    Zyuganov did not elaborate on the shape of "massive  political  protest". However, he said it could take any form provided the  decision making was collective and the action held at the right  time.    He also wants this to be agreed with agrarians not to worsen  the already adverse situation in the farming sector.    On the city administration's behavior during the event,  Zyuganov described it as normal recommending the authorities not  to train special police units on the eve of holidays but give  them a rest and help workers arrange their demonstrations  instead.    In his view, the next demonstration due on Victory Day on  May  9 would involve more people than last year when tens of  thousands of protesters took part.</p>

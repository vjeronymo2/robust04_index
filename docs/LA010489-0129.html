			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS RISE SHARPLY BUT DEMAND IS LOW AS TRADERS AWAIT REPORT  </P> <P> The stock market rallied sharply today, rebounding from the decline it suffered  in the first session of 1989.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 23.93 on Tuesday, climbed 33.04  points to 2,177.68.  </P> <P> The dollar rose in foreign exchange trading, reversing its decline Tuesday.  </P> <P> Analysts said traders bid the dollar up amid the uncertainty raised by news  that U.S. planes shot down two Libyan fighter jets over the Mediterranean Sea.  </P> <P> But demand for stocks was limited, brokers said, by caution in advance of  Friday's report from the government on the employment situation for December.  </P> <P> If the data show strong growth in payroll employment, many Wall Street analysts  believe the Federal Reserve would be more likely to tighten credit further in  its campaign to keep inflation from flaring up again.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 1 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 1,182 up, 328 down and 445 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 149.70 million shares, against 128.50 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index rose 2.08 to 157.06.  </P> <P> Bond prices rose slightly this morning, supported by strength in the dollar.  </P> <P> The Treasury's 30-year bond rose about 1/8 point or $1.25 per $1,000 in face  amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, eased to  9.07% from 9.08% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Credit market strategists attributed the reaction to a rising dollar. The  dollar historically has been a safe-haven currency during times of political  tension.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  were largely unchanged, intermediate maturities rose about 3/32 of a point and  long-term issues were up about 1/8 point, the Telerate Inc. financial  information service reported.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> Prices strengthened slightly in the corporate market. Moody's investment grade  corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with  maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.15 to 293.79.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.49% as the discount fell 2 basis  points to 8.21%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.85% as the discount rose 1  basis point to 8.37%. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 9.08% as the  discount stayed at 8.41%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 9.37%, down from 9.62% late Tuesday.  </P></p>

Takemura made the  remark on a TV Asahi debate program, referring to Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's comments on the issue in Washington in  connection with possible sanctions against Pyongyang for  refusing to accept international inspections of its nuclear  facilities.    In a press conference in Washington on Saturday, after a  breakfast meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Hosokawa  expressed reservations in ordering a halt to the remittances,  saying "I have not obtained a precise figure to show how much  has been remitted from Japan."    "The government has to decide on its actions by taking into  consideration the issue of human rights (of Korean residents),"  Hosokawa said.    Takemura said, "the actual situation of remittances of  Korean  residents in Japan is not clear and thus (we) do not know what  kind of steps are there (to halt them)."    "Hosokawa would have expressed the difficulty (in doing so)  because (the matter) involves human right problems and money  moves around the world," the chief government spokesman said.    Talks between North Korea and the International Atomic  Energy  Agency (IAEA), the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog, have been  deadlocked because of Pyongyang's resistance to IAEA inspections  of facilities suspected of developing nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- More than 50,000 members  of dissident organisations and students held rallies and  demonstrations demanding a probe into the truth behind the  suppression of the Kwangju resistance and the punishment of  those responsible for it in different parts of South Korea on  May 17, one day before the 14th anniversary of the May 18  Kwangju resistance, according to radio reports from Seoul.    The resistance was triggered off by the hysteric suppressive  offensive launched by the U.S. imperialists and the "Yusin"  remnants, their stooges, after expanding the scope of the  "emergency martial law" to the whole area of South Korea in May  1980.    In Seoul, the National Alliance for Democracy and  Reunification held a people's rally in the Chongmyo Park and  strongly demanded the clarification of the truth behind the  Kwangju incident which is still kept behind a curtain and the  punishment of those responsible for the suppression of the  resistance. The rally was attended by over 2,000 people.    Many students of universities gathered in Yonsei University  and held a rally before staging a demonstration, marching toward  the houses of Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the principal criminals  in the Kwangju massacre.    Upwards of 10,000 students of 44 universities and colleges  turned out in the struggle in Seoul and other parts of South  Korea.    Kwangju was wrapped in a memorial atmosphere. An evening  memorial service for those who fell in the Kwangju resistance  was held in Kwangju on the eve of the 14th anniversary of the  May 18 resistance.    An estimated 10,000 citizens and students of Kwangju  gathered  in the plaza in front of the South Cholla "provincial  government" and recalled the days of the resistance, singing the  song of May.    A citizens' rally was held in Pusan for the clarification of  the truth behind the repression of the Kwangju resistance with  200 or more students and citizens in attendance.</p>

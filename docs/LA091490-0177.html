			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH ASKS LATIN DEBT FORGIVENESS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: AIDES SAY THE PRESIDENT WILL NEXT SEEK A FREE-TRADE PACT WITH MEXICO  TO SPUR OIL PRODUCTION.  </P> <P> President Bush today sent Congress legislation to forgive part of Latin  America's debt and aides said he will follow it by seeking authority for a  free-trade pact with Mexico.  </P> <P> With the Persian Gulf situation focusing attention on world oil supplies, a  free-trade pact with Mexico could help spur production in that country.  </P> <P> Mexico has the world's eighth-largest reserves of oil.  </P> <P> The United States already has such an agreement with Canada, under which all  tariffs and other trade barriers will be lifted by the end of the century.  </P> <P> Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush would  like to have congressional agreement to begin free-trade talks with Mexico  ready when he goes to Mexico City in November.  </P> <P> In a signing ceremony at the White House, Bush said the current attention on  the Middle East does not lessen his Administration's commitment to Latin  America.  </P> <P> Bush has called for an eventual free-trade zone extending from the Arctic  Circle to Cape Horn. He said the legislation sent to Capitol Hill today is an  important step toward that goal.  </P> <P> The legislation submitted today would forgive about $7 billion in loans owed to  the government by Latin American and Caribbean countries.  </P> <P> Latin nations owe U.S. banks an additional $48.3 billion.  </P> <P> The bill also seeks to make it easier for U.S. companies to invest in Latin  America. Bush called the package "trade, not aid."  </P> <P> Administration sources said the free trade measure could be sent to Congress as  early as next week.  </P></p>

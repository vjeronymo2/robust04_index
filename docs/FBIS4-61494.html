			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- "We are undoubtedly disturbed by  what is happening in the region and along its borders", stated  Boris Yeltsin on the eve of his conversation with Emomali  Rakhmonov, chairman of the Tajikistan supreme soviet, which is  being held now in the Kremlin.    The Russian president believes that the Tajik leader's  arrival in Moscow is "a good move." "We need to consult about  your affairs and ours and about the problems in which we are  interested," he stressed. "We cannot remain quiet when there are  constant clashes on the border and our people are being killed",  the president continued.    Boris Yeltsin noted that Russia is also disturbed by the  political situation in Tajikistan which he described as a  "friendly country." "We would like to know what sort of help you  need", he added, addressing Rakhmonov.</p>

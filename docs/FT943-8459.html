			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Observer: Quavering Observer's passing reference to The Hecklers - a band of musical terrorists whose mission is to rid Britain of the 'sonic sewage of modern music' - has struck a chord. Several readers have written to ask how they may join the club. Keith Burstein's your man. He's a composer who first saw action when he joined in the booing at the end of Sir Harrison Birtwistle's opera Gawain earlier this year. However, when the editor of a high-brow musical publication described Burstein's criticism as 'bollocks', Burstein decided he had to raise his own campaign by a couple of octaves. Last week, he held a debate ahead of a promenade concert featuring Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's Fifth Symphony. A gratifying number of publishers of avant garde cacophony was present to talk about whether modernism will survive the 20th century. Anyone interested in further events can ring Burstein on 081-675 2252 - but please don't heckle.</p>

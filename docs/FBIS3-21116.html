			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Toshiba Corp. (Fumio Sato, president) announced on  19 November that it has developed a small superconductor magnet  without using liquid helium, by commercializing a refrigerating  machine that can cool to the temperature of liquid helium  (absolute temperature of 4.2K=-269C). Since  conventional refrigeration machines have not been able to go  below 10K, niobium titanium superconductor magnets could  not be used, but since with this new refrigeration machine  cooling to 4.2K is possible and the container is  approximately one-third the size of conventional ones, it is  possible to generate a strong magnetic field of six tesla in a  large diameter room temperature space, which has an internal  diameter of 18 cm. Toshiba believes that there will be a great  expansion in the fields using superconductor magnets.    The superconductor magnet system that was developed  incorporates a small refrigeration machine that is an  improvement on the Gifford-McMahon (GM) type refrigeration  machines that are most commonly in use at present. Since  conventional refrigeration machines could not cool below  10K, niobium 3-tin, etc. had to be used, but by finding  regenerative materials with large specific heats below 10K,  Toshiba was able to attain cooling in the 4K range.    In addition, an oxide superconductor which has low thermal  conductivity and in which current flows well in a strong  magnetic field is used for the power lead that brings current to  the superconductor coil, and this is connected to the reduction  in cooling temperature.    With this it is possible to use the main current niobium  titanium superconductor magnet, for which liquid helium cooling  had been necessary, with a direct cooling refrigeration machine,  and a strong magnetic field can be generated with a small unit.    The container that accommodates the magnetic field is 65 cm  wide, 50 cm deep and 49 cm high, a small size about that of a 25  inch television set, and all that must be done when it is used  is to turn on a switch.    Toshiba says that almost all superconductor magnets, such as  those for industry and research, can use this refrigeration  machine, and it will release users from the complexity of using  liquid helium cooling.</p>

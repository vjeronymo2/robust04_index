			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Finance director quits Arjo The announcement of the departure of Mr Tony Isaac, finance director of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper company, sounded warning bells in the City yesterday causing the company's shares to lose 10p to 265p. City analysts feared that a boardroom split of the sort that emerged a year ago between Mr Isaac and the predominantly French board of directors over dividend policy had precipitated the move. The announcement comes just days before the release of Arjo's interim results next Thursday. While there were some indications that Mr Isaac had not enjoyed an amicable relationship with Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive, the company denied any differences of opinion over the results. 'There is nothing to fear in the figures. I can say there are no nasty surprises at all,' said Mr Cob Stenham, chairman. Mr Isaac's departure for the position of finance director at BOC group, leaves Mr Stenham as the only British executive director on the nine-member board. In addition, Mr Isaac was well respected in the City and his departure will dent the company's credibility with investment analysts. His departure is the latest in a spate of executive resignations following that of Mr Gordon Bond, director in charge of the printing and writing divisions, last December. Mr Stenham said the company had a reasonable balance of non-executive directors, but would be looking with interest for a successor to Mr Isaac.</p>

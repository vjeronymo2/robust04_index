			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur claimed credit on Tuesday [12 April] for an  overwhelming "Yes" vote by Air France's 40,000 workers to a  management rescue plan for the loss-making state airline.    Balladur said the "success of the referendum," announced on  Monday, was an illustration "of his government's chosen method,"  a communique from the Prime Minister's Office said.    Reforms could only succeed with majority support, the  communique said, adding that "only dialogue and consultation  will permit progress on the road of a society that is both  fairer and more dynamic."    The "Balladur method" of government, seen as a succession of  climbdowns, has come under increasing criticism from within his  own Rally for the Republic (RPR). Most of the critics are  supporters of RPR leader Jacques Chirac against Balladur for the  May 1995 presidential elections.    The government came under fire for dropping an earlier  restructuring plan for Air France last October after a violent  strike and for caving into student protestors last month by  withdrawing a scheme to pay young people less than the minimum  wage.    According to official returns, 81.2 percent voted for the  new  Air France package, which calls for 5,000 job cuts and a wage  freeze, intended to cut back on estimated 1993 losses of 7.5  billion francs (1.25 billion dollars).    Acceptance of Air France chairman Christian Blanc's rescue  plan was a condition for a massive capital injection of 20  billion francs (3.3 billion dollars) by the government, but the  European Commission must also approve the recapitalisation plan.    Tuesday's communique said that Balladur's privatisation  programme was financing the capital injection, adding "the  privatisations are allowing us to provide support for the public  sector."    The communique said the prime minister was anxious to win  European Union approval for the injection "very quickly."  Balladur was due to meet European Aeronautical Affairs  Commissioner Abel Matutes later on Tuesday.</p>

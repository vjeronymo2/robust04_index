			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 31 MARCH (SNARK)--A group of armed  policemen headed by the general David Zaikidze, top official of  Tbilisi police headquarters, rushed into the Georgian parliament  building this morning. This happened after the deputies  approved Shota Kviraya as the Internal Minister. A part of  attackers penetrated the conference hall. Fists were put in  action, as well as insults heard, addressed to deputies who did  not follow the opinion of police head appearing against Kviraya.    After the incident was calmed down, the parliament  unanimously qualified this action as an attempted coup and  created a special commission to investigate the incident.    As told SNARK the deputy head of Tbilisi police, Mikhail  Saladze, who took part in the "assault" of parliament, the  attackers "were governed in their actions by interests of  struggle with criminals and strengthening of legal order in  Tbilisi". "This was the only way to make us be heard", told  Saladze.    The 38-year-old major general Shota Kviraya was nominated by  the head of Georgia as Internal Minister nearly eight months  ago. However, due to the emergency state in the republic, the  parliament only today could approve this nomination of the  former state-security officer.</p>

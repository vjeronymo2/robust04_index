			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The PBS documentary "When We Were Young: Growing Up on the Silver Screen" might  have been interesting and informative had it not been for the stupid and  ridiculous narration. It was so insulting to the intelligence that I could  stand only about 45 minutes of it. Anyone who lived through the era would know  all about the material Maureen Stapleton was given to read. Compare that to the  Richard Burton programs or the series on Hollywood that James Mason did. These  were programs with substance that were filled with fascinating and little-known  material.  </P> <P> Art Merrill, San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ARMSTRONG WINS FIFTH, REDS GET A 5-0 VICTORY OVER METS  </P> <P> Jack Armstrong joined some elite company Thursday night at New York with  another outstanding performance for the Cincinnati Reds.  </P> <P> Armstrong, a right-hander who was the Reds' No. 1 draft choice in 1987, pitched  7 2/3 innings and earned his fifth victory as the Reds beat the Mets, 5-0, for  their eighth victory in 10 road games.  </P> <P> Armstrong (5-0), Mets' left-hander Frank Viola and Oakland right-hander Dave  Stewart are the only five-game winners in the major leagues.  </P> <P> "I pitched pretty good I guess," said Armstrong, who allowed four hits, struck  out three and walked one. "I didn't overpower anyone."  </P> <P> He didn't have to against the error-prone Mets, who have lost five of their  last six and committed 27 errors in 22 games.  </P> <P> Howard Johnson made three errors, tying his club record for shortstops set on  July 18, 1985.  </P> <P> Joe Oliver keyed the Reds' offense with his first two home runs.  </P> <P> Former Met Randy Myers pitched 2 1/3 innings for his fifth save.  </P> <P> Houston 10, Philadelphia 3 -- Bill Gullickson pitched a strong game at  Philadelphia as the Astros beat the Phillies.  </P> <P> Gullickson (2-1), who was signed as a free agent last December after he went  21-14 in two seasons with the Yomiuri Giants in Japan, pitched 7 1/3 innings  and surrendered six hits to the Phillies, who had 20 hits Wednesday night in a  14-4 victory over the Astros.  </P> <P> Gullickson struck out four, walked three and never trailed after Ken Caminiti  hit a two-run single off Terry Mulholland (1-1) in the first inning.  </P> <P> Caminiti had three runs batted in.  </P> <P> Len Dykstra had four hits and Carmelo Martinez hit his third homer for the  Phillies.  </P> <P> Atlanta 4, Montreal 1 -- The Braves scored three runs in the ninth at Montreal  and extended their winning streak to five games.  </P> <P> Left-hander Tom Glavine pitched seven innings, giving up only a bunt single to  Otis Nixon.  </P> <P> Charlie Kerfeld (2-1) pitched a scoreless eighth to earn the victory. Joe  Boever pitched the ninth for his second save.  </P> <P> Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd had his best game since joining the Expos as a free agent  last winter, giving up six hits and striking out five in six innings.  </P></p>

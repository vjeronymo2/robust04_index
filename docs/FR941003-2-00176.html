The Applicant (formerly, the GNMA Trust) is a Massachusetts business trust and an open-end, diversified investment management company registered under the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On December 17, 1985, Applicant filed a notification of registration under Section 8(a) of the 1940 Act and a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act registering an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest. The registration statement became effective on July 22, 1986, and the initial public offering commenced July 25, 1986. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On August 13, 1993, Applicant's board of trustees unanimously approved the terms of an agreement and plan of reorganization (``Plan''). The Plan was approved by Applicant's shareholders on December 10, 1993. Applicant relied upon Rule 17a&hyph;8 under the 1940 Act in determining to merge its assets into an existing series of a registered investment management company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On December 16, 1993, Applicant made a final distribution of dividend income to its security holders in the amount of $0.1825 per share, for a total distribution of $342,672. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. On December 17, 1993, pursuant to the Plan, Applicant transferred all of its assets to Colonial U.S. Fund for Growth (``Colonial Growth'') in a non-taxable transaction. Colonial Growth is a series of Colonial Trust VI, a registered management investment company. In exchange for the transfer of assets, Colonial Growth assumed Applicant's liabilities and issued  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to Applicant's shareholders 3,552,164 of Colonial Growth Class A shares at a rate of 1.88 shares for each former share of the Applicant. The exchange resulted in the complete liquidation, distribution and cancellation of 1,885,910.722 shares of Applicant then outstanding, valued at $42,692,625.55 based on the closing net asset value for Applicant and the Colonial Growth as of December 17, 1993 of $22.64 and $12.02, respectively. The aggregate net assets of Colonial Growth immediately after the exchange were $227,715,458. The Plan did not affect the net asset value of the shares held by Applicant's shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicant's investment adviser paid all expenses incurred in connection with the Plan. These expenses totaled approximately $79,063, and consisted of legal, auditing, printing, mailing and proxy solicitation expenses. No brokerage commissions were paid with respect to the Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Applicant has retained no assets and has no security holders. Applicant does not have any debts or other liabilities which remain outstanding and is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicant has not, within the last 18 months, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are security holders of Applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. Applicant will, after receipt of the relief requested, file certificates of dissolution or similar documents in accordance with state law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Outline for Fast-Track Growth"] </F>   [Text] Los Angeles -- China is working on a 15-year  economic blueprint to spruce up its basic industries.    This was announced by Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State  Planning Commission, here on Tuesday [12 April].    He was addressing 500 American business leaders attending  the  China-U.S. Trade and Investment Conference, organized by the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec).    The plan envisions an average 9 percent annual growth rate  for the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the 1990s. And  GDP growth will continue to be on the fast track through the  first decade of the next century.    According to the plan, China will build 1,000 kilometres of  new railways and 3,500 to 4,000 kilometres of highways each year  in the future.    Also, about 14 million new lines for digital phones will be  needed each year to expand phone service.    Ye said China will augment its handling capacity in ports by  300 million to 400 million tons over the next 15 years. The  ports will mainly handle oil and other cargo.    A number of large open-pit coal mines will be built to  increase the country's annual coal production output by 30  million to 35 million tons each year.    And the nation's steel output is expected to surpass 100  million tons by 2000. To achieve that goal, China has to  renovate its existing 10 major steel works, while setting up  some new manufacturing bases.    Ye said China is gradually opening its onshore oilfields to  foreign explorers and developers. The offshore oilfields have  already been opened.    Analysts said that China is picking up momentum in  developing  its onshore oil in the country's vast West to offset the  dwindling output of the old fields in the Northeast and East.    By 2010, the country's oil-refining capacity is expected to  be almost double the 1993 level of 160 million tons.    Ye revealed that China will also give priority to developing  the machinery, automotive, petrochemical and construction  industries.    In the machinery sector, Ye said priority will be given to  developing basic components, power generation equipment,  electronic communication systems, computers and aircraft for  major and spur flights.    "The market for automobiles will be huge," Ye added, noting  that the government's strategy is to enable ordinary families to  own cars in the coming years.</p>

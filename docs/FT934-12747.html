			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (5): Political traffic jam may forge coalition - A flood of elections will soon engulf the country THE prospect of no fewer than 19 separate elections in Germany next year is enough to strike horror into the heart of the hardiest party campaigner. Worse than that, the outcome of the final vote in the 'election marathon', the poll for the federal parliament itself, hangs on no more than a couple of percentage points cast for the fringe parties. The situation could scarcely be less predictable. And the country is suffering from weariness with the political process. The major parties are already manoeuvring for advantage, and the legislative machine in the national parliament is rapidly running out of steam. By the second half of 1994, when Germany is supposed to take over the rotating presidency of the European Community, the country is going to be totally involved in its own internal politics. Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to talk about fundamental questions of Germany's international competitiveness, its need for major structural reforms, its place in Europe, and its international responsibilities. But the recession, taxation, unification costs, and unemployment mean that the agenda will be overwhelmingly domestic and near-term. Moreover, nobody is ready to reach conclusions on those major structural questions when a change of government could be coming next autumn. So much for the downside. For the political analyst, however, next year's plethora of polls will provide a fascinating insight into the shifting allegiances of a united Germany, and some crucial indicators for the future political direction of the country. One thing is clear: there has been a steady drift from all the traditional political parties, in favour of non-voting (the largest group), the Greens, an assortment of far right-wing parties such as the Republicans, the Democratic Socialist Party (PDS) - the former Communists in eastern Germany  -and local interest groups. In the latest opinion polls, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and its sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU), have slipped from a combined vote of 43.8 per cent at the last election in December 1990, to popular support of less than 30 per cent. If there were elections tomorrow, the pollsters say, they might recover somewhat to around 36 per cent. Their weakest support is in east Germany, key to the election victory last time, where the CDU is running at barely 21 per cent support. Mr Kohl's choice of the previously-unknown Mr Steffen Heitmann, the Justice Minister of Saxony, to be his candidate for the state presidency, seems to have alienated more easterners than it has won. The opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) is doing little better, in spite of the sharp recession in the German economy, high unemployment, and general dissatisfaction with the government. Current support stands at around 35 per cent, and in an election the party would win around 38 per cent, the pollsters say. What is most peculiar is that the opposition is not doing better. The big question is whether either CDU or SPD can recover enough support over the coming year to put together a 'natural' coalition on the left or the right - or whether they will be condemned to form a 'grand coalition' together, because of the splintering of the vote to the protest parties. The Greens, now allied with Bundnis-90, the loose left-wing alliance of democratic parties thrown up in the wake of the east German revolution, are clearly doing best of the protest parties. In the most recent state elections in Hamburg, they almost doubled their vote from 7 to 13.5 per cent, and are negotiating to form a coalition in the state parliament with the SPD. Such a red-green coalition also appears a distinct possibility in the national elections next year, for the Greens are currently supported by at least 10 per cent of voters nationally. The SPD leadership is torn. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the young and competent, but thus-far uninspiring new leader of the party, knows that the issues which will decide the 1994 campaign are parochial, and largely economic: jobs, housing, social benefits, as well as law and order, and immigration. On most of those issues, an alliance with the Greens might be an electoral disadvantage. Only on popular environmental issues - no longer at the top of the recession-hit political agenda - would an electoral pact obviously help the Social Democrats. The Free Democrats (FDP), the junior partner in the ruling coalition, and the king-makers in German politics ever since the federal republic began, are as affected by the anti-establishment mood as anyone. In Hamburg, they failed even to gain the 5 per cent necessary to get into the city parliament. In the national polls, they are bumping along with less than 10 per cent support. If neither they nor the CDU/CSU can improve significantly, the current conservative-liberal coalition is doomed. The most likely outcome is a grand coalition of CDU/CSU and SPD, just as happened in 1969. Mr Kohl and Mr Scharping are similar politicians, albeit of different generations. They are men of consensus, prepared to negotiate - and both come from the same neck of the woods, in the Rhineland-Palatinate. Indeed, Mr Kohl is said to have a sneaking respect for the way his rival, through sheer hard campaigning at the grassroots, managed to displace the Chancellor's own CDU from power in the state in 1991. Mr Scharping is desperately trying to turn his party into one seen as 'capable of government', rather than the squabbling collection of teachers and evangelists that it all too often appears to be in opposition. He is seeking to move into the centre ground of German politics, vacated as Mr Kohl moves to the right to head off the Republicans. Neither wants to talk about a grand coalition. Both deny they want one. But both know they may be condemned to live with one. The key lies with the protest parties. If the Republicans and the PDS, to name the two most likely contenders, both just fail to make the 5 per cent cut-off point needed to get into the Bundestag, then it might well be possible to put together a red-green coalition, or a conservative-liberal coalition, with less than 50 per cent of the votes. But if either or both of them do win seats in the Bundestag, then a grand coalition becomes almost inevitable. The Republicans are no longer picking up significant new support in the polls. They failed to make 5 per cent in Hamburg, by a whisker - mainly because their bitter right-wing rival, the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), was also running. They have been tarred with the brush of skinhead violence against foreigners, which clearly loses them support, not the contrary. The PDS is unlikely to win 5 per cent nationally on the basis of its localised eastern support, but it could win three direct mandates to parliament - an alternative route to the Bundestag. Then the party as a whole can claim seats. Even before the October poll, the main parties will face a gruelling test in the European elections in June. German voters have traditionally used the European poll as a useful chance to let off steam, and vote for the protest groups. So the chances of big votes for the far-right and the Greens are much better. Mr Kohl knows that a big pro-Republican vote in June will have a terrible effect on Germany's image abroad, even if voters return to the fold for the state and national elections. Any or all of the state elections could start a tide running for or against a particular party. Of the seven in prospect, the SPD rules in two, the CDU in four, and the CSU, as always, in Bavaria. The chances are that all will see a backlash against the party in power. Mr Kohl is relying on his own solid stature, as the one familiar, reassuring father figure, to bring the faithful back to his party, especially at a time of economic recession. Judging by the steady haemorrhage of support he is seeing at the moment, it will be an uphill struggle.</p>

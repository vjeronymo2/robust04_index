Sixty members of the Special Air Service (SAS) force, who  are  experts in mountain warfare and know the local languages,  entered Bosnia secretly 11 days ago. British Prime Minister John  Major gave permission for the operation after consulting United  Nations officials, said the SUNDAY EXPRESS, as carried by  REUTERS.    The newspaper also said that initial reports by the  commandoes had supported U.N. Protection Force Commander for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, British General Michael Rose in his request  for several thousand more peace-keeping troops.    Gen. Rose used to be a member of the SAS. He led an SAS  regiment in the action to break the seige of the Iranian Embassy  in London in 1980 and took part in a secret operation in the  Falkland Islands during the war between Great Britain and  Argentina in 1982.</p>

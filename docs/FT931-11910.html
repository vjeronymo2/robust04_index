			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Realignment may renew pressure on franc EUROPEAN finance officials expressed hope yesterday that calm would return to the exchange rate mechanism after the punt was devalued by 10 per cent against the other currencies in the system. However, some foreign exchange dealers warned last night that the realignment, agreed by officials of the European Community's Monetary Committee on Saturday, could trigger another round of speculative selling of the Danish krone and French franc. The view of dealers about the Irish currency's realignment - the largest single devaluation in the history of the ERM - was not shared by monetary officials. 'We have had one big realignment of the system that has taken five months,' said one EC monetary official in Brussels, suggesting that the core currencies in the system - including the French franc and Danish krone - would not come under any more attacks from speculators. Officials in some EC countries were nonetheless concerned that the Bundesbank had not reduced its short-term interest rates - currently about 8.6 per cent - to levels which would reduce the premium received by investors who sell European currencies for D-Marks. Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, said yesterday that a reduction in Irish interest rates - which have been at record levels to defend the punt in the past five months - might still depend on a cut in interest rates by the Bundesbank. The Portuguese finance ministry also called for greater co-ordination on the setting of European interest rates, in what may have been a carefully coded criticism of Bundesbank policy. 'The recent turbulence in the markets and the response in terms of exchange rate policy . . . show clearly the need to strengthen co-ordination of monetary and exchange rate policy between member states,' the ministry said. The devaluation came at the end of a ferocious battle by the Irish authorities to preserve their current ERM parities against the D-Mark bloc of currencies. The move is expected to ease rates in the Dublin interbank money market, where the overnight lending rate has occasionally touched 100 per cent in recent months. However, the broader consequences of the devaluation for the ERM were unclear last night. EC officials in Brussels claimed the devaluation had been necessary because of factors unrelated to the crisis inside the ERM. They argued that, because a third of Ireland's trade was with Britain, the currency needed to be devalued to restore the competitiveness lost by the decline of sterling in recent months. Foreign exchange analysts were concerned that the devaluation was not warranted by Ireland's fundamental economic position. 'Once again, a devaluation signals the death knell for the ERM,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew in London. 'The devaluation of the Irish punt only took place because the Bundesbank did not promise action at its council meeting later this week.' Miss Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi International in London, said there was a big risk of downward pressure against the French franc. She described the devaluation as 'another chip against the ERM edifice'. Some economists said any further UK base rate cuts would weaken sterling against the punt, triggering more speculation against the Irish currency.</p>

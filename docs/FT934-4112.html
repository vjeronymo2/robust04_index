			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Logica leads battle project A consortium of 17 European companies led by Logica, the British computing services group, is developing a battlefield control system which could give the UK and Europe a technological edge over the US in electronic warfare. It may also have applications in civil systems, including the emergency services and air traffic control. The Grace consortium includes Matra Cap of France, Datamat of Italy, Indra Sistemas of Spain and the Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory. The contract, worth about Pounds 17m, is being funded under the European Collaboration for the Long term in Defence (Euclid) programme. The defence ministries of the participating seven countries have put up Pounds 2m each and the companies are investing Pounds 3m. Dr Derek Barnes of the UK Defence Research Agency, which is chairing the Grace management group, said the project could provide a boost for European industry. The aim is to develop 'intelligent' computer software capable of handling, processing and displaying large volumes of information of the kind generated during a land or naval battle. Dr Barnes said the project would ask fundamental questions, including whether artificial intelligence was advanced enough to allow machines to make strategic decisions. He added: 'The project could provide the basis for a standard command and control workstation for European defence purposes. The technology would also have applications in air traffic control, ambulance despatch and oilfield management.</p>

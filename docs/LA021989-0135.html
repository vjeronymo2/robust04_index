			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIKED ST. JOHN, TOO  </P> <P> We read with interest the Jan. 29 article by Frank Riley about St. John in the  U.S. Virgin Islands. We enjoyed a wonderful vacation on that island recently.  An excellent system of open-air taxis operates there as a sort of informal bus  service. Car rental is very expensive ($340 to rent a small Jeep for one week,  including insurance and tax) and there is virtually nowhere to park in the tiny  town of Cruz Bay (at which one arrives from St. Thomas).  </P> <P> It is possible to stay in Cruz Bay or at Cinnamon Campground and enjoy St. John  without renting a car, or just renting a car for one or two days. You can even  visit the petroglyphs on Reef Bay Trail by taking advantage of the National  Park Service weekly guided hike that provides transportation for hikers from  Cruz Bay to the trail and back. Reservations are required. Visitors should take  a strong sunscreen and insect repellent, as these items are essential and cost  a fortune there.  </P> <P> SUSAN SHIELDS  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

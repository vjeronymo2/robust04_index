			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Balladur's bulldog refuses to be muzzled: Mr Charles Pasqua, France's pugnacious interior minister Even the most ardent French conservative could scarcely deny that Mr Edouard Balladur's cabinet is, well, somewhat staid. Yet there is an exception: Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, who, whatever else he has been accused of, could never be called boring. The pugnacious Mr Pasqua, 67, with his bulldog features and booming voice, is rarely far from the headlines in France. Yet this week 'Charlie' - as he is widely known - has attracted the attention of the international media over his clampdown on Algerian militancy which has involved more than 110 detentions, thousands of vehicle checks and the banning of five Islamist publications, culminating yesterday with the Socialist opposition lodging a formal complaint against him with the prime minister. To the French, who still remember his first stint as interior minister during Mr Jacques Chirac's premiership from 1986 to 1988, this week's events simply represent a continuation of his characteristically draconian stance on immigration and terrorism. In other countries, they act as an eerie reminder of the heavy policing in France under General de Gaulle during the 1960s. Mr Pasqua is almost certainly flattered by such allusions. He loves to brag about being 'the son, brother and nephew of policemen' and 'Charlie's boys' have returned the compliment by regarding the interior minister as one of their own. Moreover, Gen de Gaulle was the man who brought him into politics in the 1960s and has remained his idol ever since. 'Pasqua might toy with Balladur and Chirac but he's only ever recognised one political master and that's De Gaulle,' said a senior conservative. 'Besides, one of his strengths is that he couldn't care less what anyone thinks of him.' Mr Pasqua, after all, has had a much tougher trajectory than his cabinet colleagues, most of whom conform to the Gallic political cliche of comfortable careers as civil servants after graduating from the elite Grandes Ecoles. He was born near Marseilles, leaving him with a rasping Marseillaise accent with which he terrorises his posher fellow parliamentarians. He became a Resistance courier during his teens, working for a network led by his latterday foe, Mr Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist president. He spent the 1950s and 1960s travelling up and down France as a sales director for Ricard, the drinks company, but also helped to found the infamous Service d'Action Civique, a militia that helped Gen de Gaulle's secret service fight against North African terrorists. He entered parliament in 1966 and has since relished his role as the Gaullist tough guy railing against everything from European union to Germany's inclusion in this summer's D-Day commemorative march along the Champs-Elysees. Mr Pasqua, who once said 'politics is like journalism, you've got to be a thug to get things done', frequently falls foul of other ministers, notably Ms Simone Weil, the influential health minister. 'But Balladur knew exactly what he was doing when he appointed him,' said one political analyst. 'He needed someone to do his dirty work. Charlie was just the guy for the job.' Charlie is also an invaluable weapon for the Gaullists in curbing the popularity of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme right-wing National Front. He has recently become a little too popular for the taste of Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac, both of whom have their eyes on the conservative presidential candidacy for next year's elections, although even Mr Pasqua's most ardent supporters suspect he is likelier to be a 'king-maker' than a serious contender. Yet he is still making the most of the publicity generated by this week's clampdown. Charlie was in fine form on French radio earlier this week when he dismissed criticism of his tough tactics with: 'You can't catch any fish if you don't go fishing.'</p>

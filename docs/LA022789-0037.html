Dorotheum of Vienna and French auctioneer  Jacques Tajan are collaborating on a next-Monday-through-March-7 sale of 19th-  and 20th-Century Austrian art objects, including paintings, drawings and  etchings by masters Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoschka. The  furniture set, which is estimated to sell for at least $10,000, was owned by  Beethoven until his death in 1827 and was part of his estate. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CAVAZOS CALLS FOR CURING U.S. 'EDUCATION DEFICIT'  </P> <P> U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos said Friday during a visit to Los  Angeles that the nation will not solve its budget and trade deficits until it  addresses its "education deficit."  </P> <P> But Cavazos told an audience of about 600 at UCLA that he does "not sense a  national commitment to improve education" and said public interest in the  problem must be raised.  </P> <P> "We will not develop solutions to the budget deficit and the trade deficit  until we solve the education deficit," Cavazos said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Horrendous Dropout Rates'  </P> <P> He cited falling test scores and "horrendous dropout rates" as reasons why 27  million, or 13%, of all Americans are illiterate and another 40 million are  "functionally illiterate."  </P> <P> As a consequence, America ranks near the bottom in math and other science  scores when compared with its industrial trading partners, Cavazos said.  </P> <P> "We should not underestimate the gravity of the problems we face," he said. "It  is not written in the stars that the United States of America will always be a  world leader or even that we will survive as a free nation."  </P> <P> Cavazos, who delivered the keynote address at a celebration marking UCLA's  $370-million, six-year fund-raising drive, said it behooves the public sector  to increase its contributions to public universities.  </P> <P> "In supporting higher education at the state level, they recognize that in an  increasingly competitive world market, education will either be the greatest  asset of American business or its greatest liability," he said.  </P> <P> Already businesses are training or educating about two-thirds as many people as  are institutions of high learning, Cavazos said.  </P> <P> The nation's 26% high school dropout rate, including 45% of all Hispanics and  28% of blacks, has resulted in a "tremendous loss of human potential," Cavazos  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1st Latino in Cabinet  </P> <P> The first Latino to hold a White House Cabinet post, Cavazos called on  universities to recruit more minority students.  </P> <P> He said there is a special need for minority teachers, noting that 30% of the  students in the nation are minorities but only 13% of teachers are minorities.  </P> <P> Cavazos, former president of Texas Tech University, was awarded the UCLA Medal,  the university's highest honor, for his achievements in education.  </P></p>

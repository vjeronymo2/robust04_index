			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> STRICT CAR EMISSION RULES OKD  </P> <P> State regulators, moving to establish the world's most stringent tailpipe  emission rules, today approved a sweeping plan that includes a requirement for  mass-production of electric cars by 1998.  </P> <P> "We recognize that these are very dramatic requirements we are imposing," said  Jananne Sharpless, chairwoman of the state's Air Resources Board.  </P> <P> "It's going to take a lot of work, but we think it's feasible."  </P> <P> The program, designed to clean up some of nation's dirtiest air, will require  auto makers to start selling progressively cleaner cars beginning in 1994. By  the year 2003, all of the estimated 2 million cars sold in the state would have  to be producing 70% less pollutants than 1993 models.  </P> <P> The plan includes the requirement that 2% of all new cars sold in California in  1998 emit no smog -- in effect a mandate to produce an electric car.  </P></p>

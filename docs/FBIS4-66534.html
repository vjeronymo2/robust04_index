			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "Stabilizing Ties With China"] </F>   [Text] It is a measure of stability of the Sino-Indian  relations that there was no undue despair over the limited  progress by their experts, at their meeting last week to sort  out differences over the expansion of confidence building  measures [CBMs] along the border. On the contrary, the headlines  on the conclusion of their two days' discussions were based on a  positive but general comment of the Foreign Office  spokesman--that both sides had adopted a "constructive and  forward-looking approach." He need not have taken shelter behind  these cliches. The slow advance in the negotiations on sensitive  matters, connected with the advanced stage of the CBMs, is  unlikely to cause a misunderstanding. On the contrary, there is  the danger of avoidable suspicion if official remarks are seen  as glossing over specifics.    The experts, a mixed group of diplomats and military  personnel, met as a follow-up of the agreement, reached during  the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to China in  September last year, through which the two sides formalised  their resolve to maintain peace and tranquillity along the Line  of Control. The agreement, it was stated then, had established a  framework, but details were to be settled in keeping with the  principle of "mutual and equal security." The "depth, timing and  nature" of the reduction of forces--to cite one measure--were to  be settled through mutual discussions. Going by official  statements (and also what was left unstated) at the time of Mr.  Rao's visit, the experts were to sort out differences on the  alignment of the LAC [Line of Actual Control], reducing the  military forces along it and the modalities for re-deployment,  so as to end the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation (in some  cases). The last task would also involve relocation of border  posts.    This is not an easy job, complicated as much by the  background of confrontation as by the terrain where equality in  the depth of withdrawal could confer unequal advantages on the  two sides. The negotiations, therefore, were bound to be hard  and tough and even the next round may not be final. This should  not cause dismay, much less alarm. On the contrary, it is a  matter of satisfaction that persisting differences are contained  within the framework for negotiations and do not disturb either  the peace in the border region or the CBMs, already in place.  The two sides may not have yet pulled out troops in conformity  with a mutually agreed plan but were known to have effected  withdrawal on the basis of their respective, independent  assessments.    The steps already taken or intended to be taken (subject to  the mutual agreement) are no flash-in-pan affair but are  anchored in the political understanding borne out of contacts at  various levels, from the top downward. It had been an  incremental process that promoted amity not only on  border-related issues but in most of the bilateral field. The  border has been tension-free now for years and even those  Western correspondents, who specialised in predicting conflict  and hostilities in the late Eighties on the strength of the  flimsiest of pointers, have not predicted a clash. The contacts  between the commanders and other related steps involved the  military forces in the institutionalised arrangement to maintain  peace in the border areas. It worked well and was gradually  expanded. What is now being attempted is a further expansion,  based on a firmer basis.    The progress and the positive results achieved in this case  encouraged New Delhi to suggest an identical arrangement to  Pakistan to stabilise the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.  This was the subject-matter of one of the six proposals,  conveyed to Islamabad last month for a smooth working  arrangement. The most comprehensive document, it was virtually  in the form of a draft agreement, based as it was on the  parallel with the Sino-Indian border. The LAC in Jammu and  Kashmir, as a matter of fact, is already demarcated, with the  two sides committed to respecting it under the Shimla Agreement.  The fact that there are no ambiguities about it should have been  an advantage but, in the context of distrust and acrimony, the  deadlock persists.    The involvement of the military establishments in the  Sino-Indian contacts is comparatively a recent development. The  interaction began in the late Eighties but picked up in the  aftermath of the positive process set in motion in December 1988  by the China visit of the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi. It  got a new impetus in 1992 by the Beijing trip of the Defence  Minister of the day, Mr. Sharad Pawar. Mr. Pawar's move, itself,  followed contacts at other levels--the 1990 visit to China of a  team of the National Defence College and a return trip here by a  delegation of the Chinese National Defence University. Recently,  the military exchanges got a new spurt--with a visit by the  Chinese Vice Chief of the Army Staff here after a gap of some 30  years and calls for the Chinese naval ships at Bombay after four  decades.    This is a matter of satisfaction, but not of euphoria. There  are certain features of China's policies which cannot but cause  worry here. China, as is known, had been of crucial help to  Pakistan by providing it nuclear know-how. But for it,  Islamabad, perhaps, would not have achieved the present level of  development of its nuclear capability. Recently Chinese supplies  of M-11 missiles to Pakistan not only caused nervousness here  but also attracted the notice of the United States--it was  regarded a violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime  (MTCR), to which Beijing is a party. China, of course, does not  see anything unusual in it--this and other supplies are  described as commercial deals, and as the Chinese Ambassador in  New Delhi, Mr. Ruisheng Cheng, said the other day, India could  be a buyer of the military hardware if it desired.    China's nuclear capability--and its leaps forward--could not  but be a source of discomfort to India. The installation of  nuclear weapons in Tibet merely demonstrated the meaning of the  Chinese programme for India. It could not be directed at major  powers in the West. The other nations which should be worried  are Japan and the ASEAN [Association of South East Asian  Nations] countries. But, surprisingly, both China, a nuclear  power, and, Japan a non-nuclear power are signatories to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] and often lecture India  on the virtues of acceding to the treaty. Logically, Japan  should have a better appreciation of India's concerns but,  perhaps because of pressures from Washington and others in the  industrialised world, it echoes their exhortations to New Delhi.  The ASEAN members have big economic stakes in China in the wake  of its gigantic reform and liberalisation processes. This tends  to submerge the concerns over Beijing's nuclear policies and  related matters. But, in their heart of hearts, there is a  desire to balance a forward-looking China with some other  power--India could be one--now that the United States has  curtailed its presence in the region.    The bilateral relations between countries are seldom a  black-or-white affair, but a mix of the positive and the  negative, the comforting and the worrisome. The Sino-Indian ties  are no exception, and if there are incongruities in the  different elements of the total relationship, it should be taken  as a normal feature.    The mutually conflicting strands manifest themselves in  varied forms. Take the case of India and its stand on the NPT.  When pressured by the Western nations to accede to the treaty or  accept its regional variant, India pleads its inability to do so  because of its security concerns. New Delhi wants them to take  into account the China factor. And they turn round and say: "But  haven't you normalised your relations with China? Have you not  agreed to maintain peace and tranquillity along the border?"    Not long ago, Pakistan-China relationship was India's major  worry. Because of their shared antipathy to India, the two  countries found several convergence points in their  neighbourhood policies. Pakistan achieved a major success by  securing China's public support on the Kashmir and other  problems with India. Beijing did not mince words in backing the  demand for a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir. Also, other  neighbours like Nepal made full use of the China card against  India. No such voices emanate from Beijing now. China supports  the idea of a solution of Kashmir and other issues through  direct, bilateral discussions between India and Pakistan. It  sees no other role for itself--certainly not as a mediator.  During her recent visit to Beijing, the Pakistan Prime Minister,  Ms. Benazir Bhutto, failed to secure China's support on these  matters. But otherwise Sino-Pakistan warmth remains undiminished.    And what about the United States and China? With all the  talk  against the human rights record of China, the United States has  not hesitated in forging close trade ties with it. It is a new,  pragmatic pattern--and Sino-Indian ties fit into it with several  pluses--but with some minuses.</p>

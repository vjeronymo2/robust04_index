			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Once upon a town . . . THINK OF a town near a capital city which has relics of Neolithic and Iron Age cave settlements, an Archbishop's Palace with a great hall dating from the 14th century, and as fine a set of Victorian churches as you will find anywhere. This little town grew quietly, but its neighbouring capital city spread and spread until the town was engulfed by the city and umbilically linked by an iron road to that city's centre. The iron road went in both directions so that people could flood into the capital but they could also flood into what had been the little town. Soon it was hard to tell the difference between the two places the little town began to look more and more like the capital city with towers of commerce and routes of concrete. Poor Croydon, for that was the name of the little old town, lost almost all traces of its past and settled for the strange role of office limbo, occupied from nine to five by visiting worker bees. All this happened in the 1960s when East Croydon Station turned into a giant magnet and drew towards it offices and towers and concrete roads and car parks like strings of giant iron filings. By any standards the addition of over five million square feet of offices to any town is a shock, but Croydon coped because, unlike the doomed Canary Wharf, it had proper and efficient transport links with the capital and was, whatever you may think of it, a place. The trouble was that when this little old town decided to grow, it chose the wrong fairy godmothers in the shape of architects. There is not one new building of the 1960s of any serious architectural merit in Croydon. All the old commercial favourites are there. R. Seifert and Partners built their strange 23-storey octagon. Biscoe and Stanton tried to make concrete look like folded paper in their building for General Accident - strangely well named . . . Some 11 acres of Croydon were covered in five years from 1965 by the dreadful Whitgift Centre designed by the architects Fitzroy Robinson and Partners. Today it all looks desperately sad and should be demolished. Instead of grasping the nettle of demolition, the city fathers of Croydon have decided to go for some fashionable architectural cosmetics. The fact is that Croydon is worried. It is landed, as are many commercial centres, with out of date concrete office blocks which daily function less and less well and embody a kind of an office culture that is increasingly out of date. But it is highly questionable whether a place like Croydon needs the sort of random fantasies that have been proposed by the Arts Council backed Architecture Foundation in the exhibition tent that will stand outside Croydon's Fairfield Halls for the next three months. There are some 15 proposals from 15 architectural firms in the exhibition, Croydon the Future. The centrepiece is a scale model of Croydon which can be enjoyed with the help of interactive touch screen computer technology. But the a real problem is that Croydon is not Paris, and this series of Grands Projets can only ever be the icing on a very dull cake. Indeed some of the architects, daunted by the terrible reality of the centre of Croydon, have literally put some icing on the existing buildings. The entertaining firm of Birds Portchmouth and Russum use the tops of Croydon's multi-storey car parks as the bases for new inflatable structures to house 'civic and cultural events.' Its a strangely 1960s idea, but one that is practical enough to happen. Richard Rogers offers Croydon a skeletal tower that provides the residents a permanent low energy light show. Future Systems have designed an elegant bridge that leaps over some of the dreariest parts of the town centre. The best scheme is one by Richard Horden, which wraps up a four lane highway, and puts a sheltered pedestrian zone in the centre large enough to house arts and eating activities. How wise are the councillors of Croydon to hitch their wagon once again to an architectural star. They got it commercially right but architecturally wrong in the 1960s; will the emphasis on design rather than function this time do the trick to make Croydon an agreeable place? I suspect that the answer is no. Good makeup cannot hide bad bone structure. What no one has proposed is that the centre of any city needs people to live there. When will developers realise that what England badly needs is good private housing, at least as good as the average Manhattan apartment. Tower homes in city centres can be fine if they are well designed, well serviced and supported by sports and leisure facilities. The architectural profession should take the lead because more and more people are going to live and work at home. How exciting it could be if somewhere like Croydon had taken a serious look at the way we are going to live in cities in the future instead of tacking on to a decrepit and defunct vision of the 1960s the stylish and often hopeless nostrums of the 1990s. Poor old Croydon, there is not much hope here . . .</p>

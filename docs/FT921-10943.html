			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Letter: Manuals that frustrate In 'Technically Speaking' (January 28), Paul Abrahams was, of course, expressing the frustration of users of countless manuals for both British and imported goods. Now, instead of just time being wasted, it is money as well when using a 0898 number at 48p per minute, or, say, Pounds 9.60 for 20 minutes, the average length of a call dealing with a problem. We frequently come across the problem of incorrect software instructions which need translating into foreign languages. We instruct our translators to sit at the computer and go through the manuals, checking that the directions give the results they should. Only then are the directions translated. In this way, the client using his computer can be certain that he is not the victim of xenophobes, and, at the same time, is given the opportunity to make the necessary amendments to original documents so that they become com-prehensible. This procedure saves time, money and frustration for both users and suppliers. C Sonabend, chairman, Transtelex, Marzell House, 116-128 North End Road, London</p>

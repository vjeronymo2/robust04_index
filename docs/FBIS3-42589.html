The conference discussed in detail the  results of the sector's operations in 1993 and the problems  gold-mining enterprises are encountering. Today we are  publishing materials from this conference.    "The sector has fulfilled the 1993 plan"--with these  words Viktor Gritsayev, deputy chairman of the Russian  Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones,  began his report, a rendition of which is published below.    Quoting a number of figures on various aspects of gold  production, he noted that in the current difficult conditions  many regions have increased production of the precious metal.  Among them are first and foremost Krasnoyarsk and Khabarovsk  Krays, Irkutsk and Amur Oblasts, and the Evenk Republic.    At the same time, there are many problems interfering with  the operations of gold-mining enterprises and gold-prospecting  cooperatives. The sector has shifted to transactions at world  prices. This improved the economic situation of enterprises in  the first half of the year somewhat. However, in the second half  of 1993 inflation caused a sharp rise in prices for fuel, food,  and material and technical resources, and put gold-mining  enterprises in a difficult situation. This was exacerbated by  the introduction of a score of taxes and levies, totalling 30-40  percent of the value of gold produced. Investment in  reconstruction of existing and construction of new enterprises  was curtailed sharply, and material and technical supply  worsened, especially in the Far North regions.    The fact that the existing structure of associations has  been  destroyed and settlements were left without financial support  had a serious impact on the work of gold prospectors. Most of  the skilled cadres are leaving the Far North regions.    It was pointed out in the report that the decision to  transfer gold-mining industry enterprises to the jurisdiction of  the Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious  Stones was made by the government in May of this year, but the  sector is still being managed by a number of ministries and  agencies. For instance, the raw materials base is under the  jurisdiction of the Russian Federation State Committee for  Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources and local  administrations; property relations and structural  transformations are the prerogative of the Russian Federation  State Committee on the Administration of State Property; credits  are the sphere of the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry  of Finance. Price formation and receipt of the final products  are the competence of the Russian Federation Committee on  Precious Metals and Precious Stones together with the Ministry  of Finance and the Russian Federation Committee on Price Policy.    The first six months of work in the new conditions showed  that despite all the difficulties, the gold-mining enterprises  have not reduced production of the precious metal and a certain  foundation has been laid for normal work in 1994.    Noting the positive points, the speaker nevertheless dwelled  on the shortcomings in special detail.    Construction of enterprises on the new Sukhoy Log mineral  deposit is proceeding at a very slow pace.    With respect to the level of technologies used, the  gold-mining industry has been and remains among the best in the  world so far, the speaker said. Without purchasing a single  license, we possess a modern system of resource-saving. Our new  enterprises over the past 10 years have been designed and built  on the basis of tested scientific development. Unfortunately,  because centralized financing has dried up, science services in  the sectors have deteriorated dramatically. Especially with  respect to finding solutions to major scientific and technical  problems. Work has been practically suspended on improving the  existing and creating new, more efficient domestic equipment.    Even the largest enterprises cannot support new research on  their own. We will be able to handle it only if we combine our  resources.    The president and the government of Russia, the speaker  said,  have made a decision to set up a nonbudget fund to finance  scientific-technical and R&amp;D work in the sector. This  decision  was in effect in 1993, and we asked the government to extend it  to 1994. I want everybody present to understand that all of us  need it, said Viktor Gritsayev.    He expressed particular concern over the curtailment of  geological prospecting work. In 1993, the report said, the  Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of  Mineral Resources allocated us 9 billion rubles [R] for this  purpose instead of the R130 billion it was supposed to allocate  on the basis of the volume of commercial product produced in the  sector. The figures are incommensurate.    What awaits the sector in the future? In 1990, said the  speaker, the Main Administration for Diamonds and Gold, with the  participation of a broad range of scientific organizations and  representatives of the territories, developed a concept for the  development of the gold-mining industry to the year 2010. For  well-known reasons its implementation has been curtailed since  1992. Today, in order to implement this program, we need to  invest at least R140 billion annually. Quite clearly,  enterprises do not have such money, and the budget cannot issue  such credit. Therefore, the task for the sector is to attract  domestic and foreign investors. The Russian Federation Committee  on Precious Metals and Precious Stones is developing a  gold-mining program for 1994-1995 and up to the year 2000 in the  new environment.    In conclusion, the speaker said that at a conference  organized by the Central Council of the Trade Union of the  Russian Federation Mining and Metallurgical Industry Workers on  28 November, the question of establishing in the sector honorary  titles and awards for many years of unblemished work and  considerable contribution to the development of the gold-mining  industry was brought up with some urgency.    The Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and  Precious Stones and the Russian Ministry of Labor have been  instructed to prepare appropriate proposals on this subject.  Meanwhile, today, said Viktor Gritsayev, on behalf of the  collegium I would like to thank all those who worked  conscientiously in 1993 and wish them success in the year to  come.</p>

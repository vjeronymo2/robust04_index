			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Verdi the beginner - The Edinburgh Festival ALL STUDENTS of opera should have been at the middle week of this year's Edinburgh festival. As a rule composers do their best to bury their first attempts at opera, but posterity has developed a fascination for digging them up again. After Tuesday's efforts by the 18-year-old Schubert and the 33-year-old Janacek, and Wednesday's double-bill of stage works by the young Scottish composer James MacMillan, Thursday brought the turn of Verdi and his first opera, Oberto. The composer would probably be surprised that we should want to hear the piece. He knew that he had gone on to far better things. As the concert performance began in the Usher Hall, it was interesting to think back to 1839. The audience that had come to see this first opera by an unknown composer was used to Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini. What can they have made of Oberto? From the first notes the music is rugged and full-blooded; there is a frankness about it, a determination not to dress up simple ideas with unnecessary frills, that must have caught their attention. In short, Verdi was a new voice. Today Oberto is important for what it promises, not what it achieves. The plot is a feeble affair, which winds up stock characters with intense emotion (father bent on vengeance, daughter spurned by lover, forgiving rival) and then sets them tilting one against another. Verdi fills their lungs with music, but cannot breathe life into them. The singers of the day had been brought up on Bellini and Donizetti just as much as the audiences, so we can assume that their voices would have been flexible, adept at achieving expression through phrasing and ornament, almost certainly not very large. Maria Guleghina, who took the leading role of Leonora, is a stunning singer, but not of that kind. Getting the words to speak and shaping the vocal line at the appropriate scale do not come easily to a soprano whose glory is soaring out in blazing splendour on high. When she sang, 'My voice will resound among these lofty towers', one believed her. I look forward to her Aida and Tosca. Dennis O'Neill, Leonora's former lover, a real bounder, matched her in volume and exceeded her in Italianate passion, at the expense of an edgy vibrato. The role of the old, enfeebled father went to the young and by no means feeble Alastair Miles, whose well-focussed voice has grown beyond Handel and may yet mature into a real Verdi bass. Jane Henschel made the most of the low notes in Cuniza's music (Guleghina does not have a chest register with which to answer back). As a team, they delivered the goods. In place of Edward Downes, David Robertson conducted the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in a performance of some energy and force, the qualities Oberto does possess in abundance. By the end, the opera had made an impact well beyond what the books of theory tell us Verdi the beginner should be able to muster. Students of opera, please note.

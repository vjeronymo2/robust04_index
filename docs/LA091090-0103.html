			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE LOOKING FOR TEEN-AGE JOGGER'S RAPIST;  </P> <P> CRIME: A 15-YEAR-OLD WAS ATTACKED OFF THE BIKE TRAIL NEAR HER EAST YORBA LINDA  HOME. RESIDENTS TELL SHOCK.  </P> <P> Police are looking for a man who raped a 15-year-old jogger Saturday afternoon  off the bike trail behind her apartment complex in a east Yorba Linda  neighborhood.  </P> <P> The girl, whose name was not released because of her age and the nature of the  crime, was jogging on the trail about 4:20 p.m. when a man emerged from the  bushes, grabbed her and dragged her back to the underbrush, Brea Police Sgt.  Doug Dickerson said. She screamed but her apartment complex was several hundred  yards away, Dickerson said, and apparently no one heard her.  </P> <P> The girl, who attends an area high school, walked back to her residence near La  Palma Avenue and Camino de Bryant after the attack and was taken to St. Jude  Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton where she was treated and  released, Dickerson said.  </P> <P> Residents in the relatively new housing development next to the apartment  complex were shaken and surprised to hear of the attack Sunday.  </P> <P> "We all feel safe here because it's all nice, new homes," said Arlene Dragon, a  2 1/2-year resident of the neighborhood. "There aren't any stores around, and  there just aren't people hanging around out here."  </P> <P> Dragon said that the bike trail is elevated and paved but that there are trees  and bushes about 15 feet down the banks.  </P> <P> "This is the first I've ever heard of this happening," another resident said.  "This is a real safe area. It's Yorba Linda -- things like this don't happen  here."  </P> <P> Bob Gardiner, a 3 1/2-year resident of the area, said, "I know that there are  transients who stay in Featherly Park and I know of some incidents, but never a  rape or an attack like that." Featherly Regional Park is an overnight camping  ground that fronts the housing tract on the east side.  </P> <P> "Yes, it does have a profound effect on us," Gardiner said. "And there are  people out there all the time. Gosh, that's a shame."  </P> <P> Dickerson said that there had been some attacks in the area and in the park in  the past but that they were not similar and that he did not believe them to be  connected.  </P> <P> Police are looking for a man who looks Latino, about 5-foot-10, 140 pounds,  with short, black hair. He was wearing a white T-shirt, white shorts, white  tennis shoes and a maroon baseball cap when the attack occurred, Dickerson  said.  </P></p>

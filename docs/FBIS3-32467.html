			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- The Popular Party [PP] yesterday held  its national convention, and put forward the presidential  candidacy of former Parana Governor Alvaro Dias. At the  convention, which was held at the Senate plenary hall, the PP  leadership sought to overcome the internal disagreements  provoked within the party by the inclusion of three PP deputies  and of Brasilia Governor Joaquim Roriz in the report filed by  the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee].    Dias, who is the PP president, said: "We are not going to  prejudge anyone." He noted that although the PP would not  condone corruption, it could not take any action before those  involved in the scandal are tried. Deputy Roberto Magalhaes,  the Budget CPI rapporteur, has recommended that the mandates of  Deputies Flavio Derzi (PP-Mato Grosso do Sul), Paulo Portugal  (PP-Rio de Janeiro), and Anibal Teixeira (PP-Minas Gerais) be  canceled. Dias announced that these deputies will be expelled  from the PP only if the Chamber of Deputies cancels their  mandates.    After having been given a joyous welcome, Roriz delivered an  emotionally charged speech. He defended the party's unity,  claimed to be a victim of political harassment, and vowed not  "to embarrass" his colleagues. "After enduring 90 hours of  torture at that CPI, I will now seek a not guilty verdict in  court by proving with sound evidence that the charges pressed  against me are false," Roriz said.    Commenting on Dias' nomination, Roriz said that, as "a party  man," he would accept the nomination. Dias' candidacy was  proposed by the presidents of regional branches in a communique  approved by the convention. Dias stated that his nomination  would not prevent the PP from entering into alliances. "We are  open to talks with other parties," Dias added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Regions" rubric: </F> "Former Oblast Party Secretary Elected Komi President.  Industrial Lobby Proved To Be Stronger than Agricultural One"]    [Text] The presidential elections in the Republic of Komi,  which were held 8 May, were won by Yuriy Spiridonov, speaker of  the local Supreme Soviet. According to a preliminary tally,  Yuriy Spiridonov won 51 percent of the vote. His main rival,  Vyacheslav Khudyayev, chairman of the republic's Council of  Ministers, garnered 33 percent, the press service of the Komi  Supreme Soviet reported.    Political figures in Komi pointed out that Vyacheslav  Khudyayev's election drive against Yuriy Spiridonov, former  first secretary of the CPSU oblast committee, was actively  supported by Veniamin Osipov, former oblast party second  secretary. It is so "wide a choice between the first and second  secretaries" that prompted the local branch of Democratic Russia  to distance itself completely from the election campaign, saying  that it will back only "a new, democratic leader when he  emerges." Komi communists, who have initially also made a point  of distancing themselves from the elections, at the eleventh  hour announced their support for Vyacheslav Khudyayev. Local  observers attribute this change to the fact that Mr. Khudyayev  "represents the interests of a significant part of the old party  and management elite, and also the directors of the state-owned  farms." Among local democrats, talk is under way that  Vyacheslav Khudyayev, "who has effectively exercised supreme  authority in the republic recently, has so energetically lobbied  for the interests of Komi state-owned farm directors that he  gave local agricultural chiefs 80 percent out of the centralized  loans worth 20 billion rubles received recently virtually for  free."    Meanwhile, the republic's industrialists, particularly the  director of Komineft, the enterprise considered "Komi's main  source of money," threw their weight behind Yuriy Spiridonov  during the election campaign.    Leonid Zilberg, leader of the local Republican Party, said  in  a conversation with your SEGODNYA correspondent that he welcomes  Yuriy Spiridonov's election to the post of president, "because  he at least does not hamper very much the emergence of new  entrepreneurial structures and attracts foreign investors to the  republic thanks to his connections." The leader of the  Republicans thinks that "it is precisely thanks to Spiridonov's  efforts that today Komi has the highest investment level in  comparison with other regions of the Russian Federation."    Leonid Zilberg believes, however, that "not only economic,  but also ethnic leanings of the contenders had a role to play  during the election campaign, because Yuriy Spiridonov is a  Russian and Vyacheslav Khudyayev is a Komi." In the opinion of  the Republican Party chief, "in the end, Spiridonov won the  elections because Russians make up the majority of population in  the Republic of Komi."    Other party leaders are certain, however, that purely ethnic  considerations should not be seen as a "priority" factor for  both contenders for the presidency, "because each of them  expresses the interests of entirely specific elite groups all  the same." It is expected that upon Yuriy Spiridonov's  assumption of power his loyal allies -- Anatoliy Karakchiyev,  administration chief of the city of Syktyvkar, and Vladimir  Torlopov, deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, who are  both ethnic Komi -- will have the key roles to play in his  future cabinet.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Shamir hints at settlement talks IN A rare public admission that Jewish settlements in the occupied territories are a central issue in Middle East peace efforts, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, has said they would be a subject for negotiation, Hugh Carnegy writes from Jerusalem. His remarks on Tuesday night were a departure from his usual dismissals of protests about the settlements, which are undergoing significant expansion. The settlements issue is likely to be a topic when Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, Soviet foreign minister, meets Mr Shamir in Jerusalem tomorrow and when Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, returns for talks next week.</p>

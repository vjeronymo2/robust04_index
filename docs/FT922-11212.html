			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Third world stresses aid need DEVELOPING countries yesterday urged the industrialised countries not to forget them in the developed world's discussions of aid for eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. Ministers of the Group of 24 (G24) developing countries, meeting in Washington yesterday before the spring gatherings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, welcomed the plan spelt out by their counterparts in the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial countries to provide Dollars 24bn of aid for Russia. 'The transfer of resources to these countries should be additional to - not at the expense of - the developing countries,' said Mr Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, finance minister of Nigeria and chairman of the G24 committee. He said industrial countries so far had committed themselves to keeping up their aid to the developing world. 'But it is our duty to continue to remind them of this responsibility and this need because our problems continue to deteriorate,' he added. The G24 communique also called on the IMF to intensify its surveillance of the economic and trade policies of the main industrial countries. The ministers said they noted 'with the greatest concern' the fiscal and current account deficits of the industrialised countries.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SENTENCES TERMINALLY ILL WOMAN TO PRISON FOR 2 MURDERS  </P> <P> A woman who has sickle-cell anemia and says she will die within five years was  sentenced Tuesday to 17 years to life in prison for killing her former lover  and his new girlfriend.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Judith Ashmann imposed the maximum penalty for  second-degree murder on Charisse Lewis, 33.  </P> <P> Lewis originally was charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of her  ex-boyfriend, Jewel Purde, 34, with whom she had lived for two years, and  Shirley Marie Johnson, 35, both of Panorama City. If found guilty of those  charges, Lewis could have received the death penalty.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Baron agreed to allow the defendant to plead  guilty to the lesser charge. He said that considering Lewis' expected life  span, she received what amounted to a death sentence. "She will die before she  gets out of prison," he said.  </P> <P> The earliest Lewis could be paroled would be in about 14 years, Baron said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Treated at Age 9  </P> <P> According to court documents, Lewis first received treatment for sickle-cell  anemia, a usually fatal degenerative disease, when she was 9. She told  authorities she had suffered two serious heart attacks caused by the disease  and would die within five years.  </P> <P> Lewis was arrested last October when she sought treatment for the disease in  Chicago, where she had fled after the July 17 killings. Lewis had moved her  belongings out of the Panorama City apartment she and Purde shared July 15,  authorities said.  </P> <P> She became angered when she saw Purde and Johnson returning from a trip to the  grocery store and killed them, police said. Both were shot in the back.  </P> <P> Baron said the weapon used in the killings, a .38-caliber revolver, is believed  to have belonged to Purde. The gun was never recovered, he said.  </P> <P> Public Defender Dennis G. Cohen, who defended Lewis, asked the judge for  leniency because he said Lewis feared Purde. He said Purde had threatened Lewis  with a gun shortly before the slayings.  </P> <P> But Baron called the slayings "cold-blooded murders."  </P></p>

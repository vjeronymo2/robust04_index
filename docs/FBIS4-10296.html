			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Attorney General Carlos Gustavo </F> Arrieta by Caracol news director Dario Arizmendi in Santa Fe de  Bogota on 8 April; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast--live]    [Excerpts] [Arizmendi] We greet Attorney General Carlos  Gustavo Arrieta. Good day.    [Arrieta] Good morning, Dario. How are you?    [Arizmendi] In the last few hours you reiterated the thesis  you maintained in Congress during discussion of the new Penal  Procedure Code, in the sense the approved provisions were going  to create confusion, ambiguity, and would lend themselves to  criticism from national and international public opinion. Have  your statements been corroborated in practice?    [Arrieta] You know the Attorney General's Office has  maintained a position in this regard for a long time. We  believe if this country wants to develop a serious and coherent  criminal policy on the drug struggle, it must have solid and  strong regulations that permit it to advance in this matter. I  think this does not exist.    The Attorney General's Office has stated on several  occasions  the Penal Code is weak and does not establish appropriate  sentences for drug trafficking crimes, and the Penal Procedure  Code is a confused and profuse regulation. It does not  establish clear procedures, and if it is handled  inappropriately, it could lead to impunity.    [Arizmendi] What would have to be done to strengthen this  Penal Code and establish appropriate sentences to avoid what is  happening?    [Arrieta] I believe the country must definitely undertake an  integral project to reform the Penal Code and the Penal  Procedure Code. I am not aiming at a large project to modify  all the provisions, but coherent legislation should be issued  regarding drug trafficking.    Something very worrisome is taking place. As violence  increased during the last six or seven years, occasional  legislative reactions have sprung up, and new and different  provisions have been issued. A judge or attorney must now apply  60 or 70 different provisions concerning drug trafficking in  order to understand the norm or applicable situation in a  particular case; this creates confusion and does not produce the  necessary clarity in dealing with this matter.    Naturally, the country's problem is not related to  regulations only, but it has many additional aspects. One of  the first steps that would have to be taken is a definite  integration, coherently and systematically, with existing  legislation so as to tighten sentences and clarify procedures.    [Arizmendi] A unanimous decision by the various  organizations  would be required, namely, from the Justice Ministry, the  Prosecutor General's Office, and the Attorney General's Office;  this agreement does not exist.    [Arrieta] I think this requires an effort by all concerned  organizations, not only the government, judiciary, or Attorney  General's Office but also Congress, which is ultimately  responsible for issuing the codes. I believe the gravity of the  circumstances and the questioning of Colombia justify an  unvarying and strong reaction from all Colombians to show that  this country is not a narcodemocracy. We must demonstrate this  is a country that is indeed ready to fight drug trafficking.  [passage omitted]    [Arizmendi] Colombia at this moment is in the eye of the  U.S.  media and many U.S. congressmen. The country is well aware of  the letter exchanges between the Prosecutor General's Office and  the U.S. attorney general, the response of the Colombian  ambassador to Washington to THE WASHINGTON POST's article by  Senator Kerry. In sum, does this confusion and confrontation  originate in the verbal recklessness of the prosecutor or  existing regulations?    [Arrieta] I think there are many factors that come into play  here. I think we are facing a problem that has evolved for no  reason. From basic discussions on legalization issues we have  gone to such expressions as narcodemocracy or the questioning of  Colombian justice. I think this is the right time to end this.    I do not know what the cause is and cannot offer a specific  solution. The cause may be a combination of the factors you  mentioned. The absolute truth is I, as attorney general and a  Colombian citizen, cannot allow this to continue. We have  reached such harsh terms as the ones we have seen in recent days  without any justification. The [word indistinct] has snowballed  into such dimensions I believe we must put a definitive end to  this, because this is affecting not only the functioning of  Colombian institutions but relations with the United States.  This may have more serious effects we cannot foresee at this  moment.    Our responsibility is to end this problem. We must not act  separately, but we must act in a coordinated manner.    [Arizmendi] How can we end this problem, and how can we act  in a coordinated manner? Who is the one out of line?    [Arrieta] I told you earlier I will issue a communique today  on that issue. In it, we will adopt a position on this matter.  We will provide a complete picture of what has happened, but at  this moment I believe it is fundamental for us to make an effort  so that the situation will not continue to intensify and does  not affect all Colombians. [passage omitted]    [Arizmendi] Let's address the case against General Jesus  Armando Arias Cabrales [army commander who ordered troops to  take back the Justice Palace from rebel control in 1985], whose  discharge was requested in 1990. You affirmed that decision  three years ago. Is there a difference of opinion between the  executive branch and the Attorney General's Office on this issue?    [Arrieta] In this particular case the Attorney General's  Office has no other option but to request application of a  decision the Attorney General's Office had previously taken. We  conducted a detailed evaluation of the situation and arrived at  the conclusion there were no legal means of modifying the  decision. Eventually it came to where there was no legal way to  avoid carrying out the order the Attorney General's Office had  issued in 1990.    [Arizmendi] What does it mean to an Army general to be  discharged as repeatedly ordered by the Attorney General's  Office?    [Arrieta] It is a heavy blow. In this specific case it  involves removal from his current post, something which will  create rather difficult and complex problems for him and the  institution.    [Arizmendi] Does this mean Gen. Cabrales is the only one  responsible for what the government troops did during the events  at the Justice Palace?    [Arrieta] Allow me to explain. When I first assumed my  post, I took on the challenge of studying the decision by the  previous Attorney General's Office. I had several doubts about  the investigation. I felt they did not dig deep enough in  certain areas. I felt if they had gone a little further we  might have seen slightly different results in certain matters;  this does not mean Cabrales is not responsible for anything at  all. It means the investigation did not go far enough regarding  whether certain decisions were really made and, in particular,  who took the specific decisions regarding the operations that  took place in the bathroom between the third and fourth floor of  the palace, which is where the events to which the Attorney  General's Office objected occurred.    In a disciplinary action such as this, we can no longer  claim  these doubts. The terms for filing such claims were prescribed  in 1990. We have tried to clarify certain facts, but we have  been unable to make it work as swiftly as we would have  preferred. Given we were unable to make it work and in light of  the specific laws that order the fulfillment of rulings issued  at the Attorney General's Office, we decided to apply the  Attorney General's Office ruling as originally issued. [passage  omitted]    [Arizmendi] Mr. Attorney General, turning to another topic,  and going back somewhat to what we were talking about at the  beginning of our conversation, you said on television last night  that at this time you do not think the conditions or  circumstances exist for new surrenders of Cali Cartel drug  traffickers. On what basis did you make this statement?    [Arrieta] I think what we discussed a short while ago  sufficiently supports this. I do not think the conditions exist  at this specific time. The environment is not the appropriate  one. There is a great distrust and prejudice; there is great  concern about the whole topic. I think the most important thing  is to calm the waters again, to have the authorities sit down  and agree on policy and then proceed with the surrender to  justice program.    In these days, at this particular moment, I think the  atmosphere is too heated to make a surrender to justice process  feasible. I am not setting a time limit; this might be solved  in eight, 10, 15 days or in one or two months. What I have  always said is that the surrender to justice policy is important  for the country. It is useful. I think that as Colombians we  should try to move forward with it, with clear and firm rules,  but as circumstances stand at this time, with the level of  debates taking place both nationally and internationally, I  think there should be at least a halt, a temporary halt, which  might last a few days or somewhat longer, according to [words  indistinct].    [Arizmendi] In other words, we might say the attorney  general  is proposing the process of surrender to justice by the drug  traffickers be frozen until there is an agreement, juridical or  political, to make the sentences against these drug traffickers  harsher or more rigorous?    [Arrieta] I cannot propose that it be frozen, among other  things, simply because the legal provisions exist and they  establish the possibilities of surrender; therefore, if tomorrow  an individual presents himself before a prosecutor or judge of  the country, there is no other alternative but to receive him.  What I think is that regarding a broad case, such as that of  the Cali Cartel, which has political and juridical [word  indistinct] and which requires full coordination among all the  authorities, I do not think it would be appropriate to advance  with this process until we reach agreement on all the parameters  under which we should act. As soon as that occurs, something  which might be done very rapidly, then we could-- if this is  what is desired--continue with that process. At this time, at a  time of debate, when the atmosphere is heated, and when  positions are not entirely clear, I think, however, it would not  be appropriate, because the country would simply not understand  it, precisely because of the prevailing climate of distrust and  confusion.    [Arizmendi] You said the legal provisions exist, evidently  in  the Penal Code and the Penal Procedures Code. You also said in  the past the surrender to justice policy has ended, replaced by  the codes. If the sentences are evidently so minimal,  ridiculous, and short as certain U.S. authorities assert, one  might then think this is exactly the best time for the Cali  Cartel drug traffickers to surrender massively before the codes  are reformed and made harsher.    [Arrieta] Of course, of course. That is the position they  [not further identified] might want. I think our position, as a  state, is precisely to try to design all the mechanisms so there  will be a surrender process, but one that will not create any  feeling of impunity under any viewpoint. Of course, what you  mentioned is part of the dilemma that always arises. On the one  hand, there are a number of people who want to take advantage of  the law for their own benefit; this is inevitable and is the  reason why lawyers, procedures, and legal provisions exist. On  the other hand, there is the state, which has the responsibility  to fulfill its social function and to ensure those legal  provisions are applied the best way possible. What I am  suggesting is that there be a review of the overall reform of  the legal provisions so that we can have a Penal Code,  procedural provisions, and a surrender to justice policy which  are clear and which do not produce any kind of impunity.  [passage omitted]    [Arizmendi] Why is the prosecutor general the only one  taking all the flak when all he is really doing is interpreting  and applying code provisions. In Congress you courageously  warned the country about what was coming, and unfortunately time  has shown you were right. But the prosecutor general was not  the one who drew up the codes. It was Congress, and in Congress  Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez even changed the meaning of  certain bills, and he defended what was finally approved in  Congress. Now the prosecutor general is the one being  criticized when the government was also involved in what was  finally approved. The government signed the law.    [Arrieta] I think one has to put this issue back into  perspective. If one looks at what has been taking place in the  past two or three months, there have not really been new  (?actions) in the application of the Penal and Penal Procedures  Codes. There has been debate, and it has been growing, but only  based on topics that are not directly linked to the Penal  Procedures Code, such as the issue of legalization and the issue  of whether the struggle against drug trafficking has worked.  All of this has led us to a debate that involves not only  thinking about aspects of policy but also aspects of norms.    I agree with you in part that a portion of the problem is  not  only caused by isolated actions but also by the very existence  of legal provisions which are not clear and are inappropriate;  therefore, what we propose is that we halt a debate that is not  taking us anywhere. With the increase in crime, what we  Colombians must do is form a barrier, a united front, with  everyone confronting the problem. Facing the problem entails a  review of legal provisions to resolve all those vacuums, all  those weaknesses that might exist in the codes. It entails  acting in a coordinated way, because it is a problem of national  interest, which not only involves one institution but all  Colombians.    [Arizmendi] Lastly, Mr. Attorney General, and thank you for  your willingness to speak with Caracol network so extensively  about such relevant topics, I would like to know whether the  Attorney General's Office knows the names of the infiltrator in  the Prosecutor General's Office, who the State Department says  belongs to the Cali Cartel, and four high-ranking government  officials, who the State Department said last night also work  for the Cali Cartel?    [Arrieta] I want to make a comment regarding the question.  In the State Department report, it is said the Colombian  Government is studying the fourth-ranking person in the office  of what they call the Attorney General [preceding two words in  English]. The Americans make a distinction between the office  of the Attorney General [preceding two words in English], which  is the Attorney General's Office [Procuraduria General de la  Nacion], and the office of the Prosecutor General [preceding two  words in English], which is the Prosecutor General's Office  [Fiscal General de la Nacion]. When they said the  fourth-ranking person in the office of the Attorney General  [preceding two words in English] was being investigated, they  were referring to what they called the fourth- ranking person in  the Attorney General's Office. It is a case that for us has  been extremely mortifying and painful. It is the case of Dr.  (Guillermo Villa). They were not referring to a person in the  Prosecutor General's Office but to a person in the Attorney  General's Office. It is a case that is well known and has been  sufficiently debated by public opinion. I think it is important  that this be clarified, because shadows of doubt should not be  cast over other people. Regarding the other four people who  might be investigated, I do not have information about them.    [Arizmendi] In the case of Dr. (Guillermo Villa Alzate), who  you just mentioned, what is happening?    [Arrieta] I think the process is about to conclude. The  final phases of the evidence period are being carried out, and,  as far as the Attorney General's Office is concerned, I hope  that in the course of the next few weeks, at the latest in one  or two months, a definitive decision is going to be made.</p>

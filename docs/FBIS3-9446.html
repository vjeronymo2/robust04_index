			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a reception today hosted for Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes, Defense Minister Safet Zhulali described  Albania's democratic developments and the reformation of the  army according to the most advanced standards of its integration  into democratic society, stressing that Albania was the first to  request NATO membership and aspires to it. Albania is  cooperating with NATO and fully supports it, offering air and  port facilities. Albania also supported its ultimatum and  signed the Partnership for Peace agreement, participating as a  serious and active partner.    Zhulali stressed the need for signing a bilateral agreement,  which was welcomed by the Belgian foreign minister. In this  framework, Zhulali said that the Albanian Army can be further  supported by NATO member countries and Belgium in the field of  education, training and preparation, material assistance, etc.    After assessing the economic and political progress in  Albania, Belgian Foreign Minister Claes assured Zhulali that all  West European institutions are ready to support the democratic  process in Albania. Conveying greetings for Albania's  participation in the Partnership for Peace agreement and  cooperation with the Western European Union, Claes expressed a  readiness for bilateral relations, stressing the possibility of  direct contacts between the defense ministers.    Focusing on regional problems, both welcomed the progress  achieved in the peace process, confirming that there cannot be a  solution to the problems in the former Yugoslavia without  resolving the Kosova problem.    We are interested in developing bilateral relations in all  fields with reciprocal interest, Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi  said to Claes at the beginning of the meeting. Albania wants to  be integrated into Europe, not as a burden but by progressing  forward with your assistance. That is why we are open to  Belgian investments, especially in infrastructure and  communication. At the same time, Belgium can support Albania  economically and politically, even in the framework of the  European Union [EU] by assisting with an associate agreement.    Belgium is willing to cooperate on a multilateral basis,  Claes said. I think that lifting the double taxation and  protection of investments will be a good step in this direction.  I would simultaneously insist to Mr. Delors to undertake  concrete initiatives to sign an associate agreement with the  European Union. Claes expressed his support for other  initiatives in the fields of education and science.    In his meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes,  National Bank Governor Dylber Vrioni expressed a desire to  cooperate in the financial field as well and negotiate the debt  that Albania owes to Belgium.    Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes also held a meeting  with  members of the parliamentary Foreign Policy Commission. They  mainly discussed Balkan issues and the opportunities for  cooperation between our two parliaments.    Before his departure Claes and Serreqi gave a news  conference  in which both personalities assessed the bilateral talks and  their results. The two officials also answered correspondents'  questions, which focused on Belgian and Albanian attitudes  toward a solution to the Kosova question in the framework of the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / EU 'must retain its welfare structures' BRUSSELS has come out against the downgrading of Europe's welfare structures as a way of boosting competitiveness, in a policy document which is expected to top the agenda at the December 10 European Union summit. The conclusions come in the latest draft of the White Paper on competitiveness, growth and employment, due to be submitted to EU finance ministers on Monday, and a Green Paper on the future of EU social policy, expected to be approved at the Commission's weekly meeting. The papers argue that new jobs must come from a stable macroeconomic framework and 'trading up' into better quality goods and services in higher added value areas, rather than through downgrading social protection and welfare provisions. 'Competition in terms of price through cost-cutting, in particular with low-wage or cost-structure countries and in certain sectors, is hardly possible without destruction of the European social structure,' a confidential draft of the White Paper stresses. The same theme informs the more consultative document on social policy, which suggests changes in the balance of taxes and incentives so that 'acceptable and affordable' employment and health and safety standards can be maintained. 'Social progress cannot be put on the back burner while we look for solutions to our economic problems,' the Green Paper says. The White Paper recommends decreasing the cost of taking on workers through an annual reduction in taxes and social security charges on labour of between 1 and 2 per cent of EU gross domestic product. This would be compensated via taxes from the greater numbers who would be in work, it argues. Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner whose department prepared the Green Paper and most of the crucial jobs section of the White Paper - masterminded by Commission president Jacques Delors - disputed the increasingly prevalent view that European welfare levels were the main impediment to international competitiveness. 'I'm saying categorically that there is no empirical proof of that. What there is is a problem of funding' of social protection, Mr Flynn said. Other senior Commission officials said there was now an 'overwhelming consensus' in Brussels that there were two separate problems to be dealt with to achieve the White Paper's ambition to halve unemployment to 5 per cent by 2000. Ways needed to be found of tackling the problem of unemployment among the low-skilled, possibly by adding income support to earned wages, one official said. But, he added, the real challenge was to 'leap forward, not backwards,' into advanced technology and high added value production.</p>

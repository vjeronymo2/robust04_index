			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BATTERED EGGS TAKE ON A NEW NUTRITIONAL IMAGE;  </P> <P> USDA DATA SHOWS A 22% LOWER CHOLESTEROL COUNT THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED  </P> <P> In May, the U.S. Department of Agriculture updated nutrient composition data  for raw whole eggs and came up with significant reductions in the cholesterol  count, thus shedding new light as well as confusion over the use of eggs by  cholesterol-obsessed Americans.  </P> <P> According to the updated data, the value of cholesterol in eggs is 22% lower,  dropping from 275 milligrams in 1976 to 213 milligrams in 1989.  </P> <P> The new data showing a decrease in cholesterol content is considered a blessing  for image-battered eggs, which, up to now, have been berated because of their  high cholesterol content.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Now, Four Eggs a Week Are OK  </P> <P> The new data won the American Heart Assn. stamp of approval on use of as many  as four eggs per week by healthy American adults, one more egg per week than  previously recommended.  </P> <P> "In view of new information from the USDA indicating lower cholesterol content  in egg yolks, the AHA's nutrition committee has indicated that current AHA  Dietary Guidelines may be satisfied using four egg yolks per week by healthy  American adults," the AHA says in a policy paper.  </P> <P> The key words, however, are healthy Americans. Those who have severe  restrictions on cholesterol should follow their doctor's advice on the use of  eggs.  </P> <P> The new American Heart Assn. recommendation increasing servings of eggs from  three to four per week "does not represent a change in the AHA's dietary  guidelines," says a heart association policy statement. "The Nutrition  Committee still recommends a maximum of 300 milligrams of dietary cholesterol  per day. But new analyses of egg yolks show the average cholesterol content of  one large egg yolk to be 213 milligrams rather than the previously accepted 274  milligrams. This allows up to four, rather than three, egg yolks from all  sources within currently suggested meal plans."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Invisible' Egg Yolks  </P> <P> Consumers are cautioned to compensate for "invisible" egg yolks consumed in  baked and other prepared foods. "The committee re-emphasized that individuals  must still strive for a balanced diet, including a variety of foods," the  statement reads.  </P> <P> According to the American Dietetic Assn., a professional organization of  registered dietitians, the lower cholesterol count will make it that much  easier for those who refrained from eating eggs altogether to take another look  at "nature's perfect food in a package," and for those who restricted intake to  two or three per week, in accordance with the heart association's  recommendations.  </P> <P> "Dietitians look upon eggs as a valuable, highly nutrient-dense food,  particularly for growing children and teen-agers. For the elderly, eggs are an  excellent source of inexpensive protein," said Rita Storey, spokeswoman for the  American Dietetic Assn.  </P> <P> "This doesn't mean that it's OK to go hog-wild with eggs," cautioned Storey.  "Excess intake beyond the recommended amount should be avoided." Consumers  should also be wary of egg content in processed foods. "At restaurants, instead  of a three- or four-egg omelet, request one made with only one or two eggs,"  advised Storey.  </P> <P> The new value for cholesterol was a result of a two-part, nationwide sampling  and nutrient analysis designed by the USDA's Human Nutrition Research Center  and funded by the Egg Nutrition Center.  </P> <P> "The lower cholesterol values can allow more choice for individuals who wish to  include eggs in a cholesterol lowering diet," according to Cathy McCharen of  the Egg Nutrition Center. "We continue to recommend using one egg and two  whites for serving scrambled, omelets, or other egg dishes. Now you can enjoy  eggs four times a week, instead of three," she said.  </P> <P> The USDA sampling analysis went like this: Using large eggs from 130 suppliers,  accounting for more than 60% of the nation's egg production, the 1989 analysis  produced a new value for cholesterol, 213 milligrams per large, which is 22%  lower than the value published in 1976.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Decrease in Fat Content  </P> <P> According to the USDA update, there was a small decrease in fat content of  eggs, which was reflected in all three fatty acid classes -- saturated,  monounsaturated and polyunsaturated.  </P> <P> Likewise, values of seven minerals listed in "Agricultural Handbook No. 8-1  Composition of Foods" (calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium, niacin and  ascorbic acid) decreased as well, with iron decreasing the most, meaning that  along with decrease in cholesterol came a decrease in mineral nutrients as  well. Of the eight vitamins available in measurable quantities, four had higher  values and four had lower values.  </P> <P> However, according to Storey, the reduction in minerals does not significantly  affect the total intake of nutrients in the diet. By adding one or two more  eggs to the diet each week, one automatically increases lost minerals, said  Storey. The USDA report also states that changes in nutrient intake can be  expected to result from changes in the nutrient content of foods.  </P> <P> For instance, in the 1985 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals, the  four-day intake of cholesterol by women age 19 to 50 years was 280 milligrams  per day. The new cholesterol value for eggs would lower this estimate by about  9%, assuming that the kind and amount of food eaten remain constant.  </P> <P> In 1985, 42% of women's cholesterol intake was provided by eggs, including both  eggs eaten separately and those eaten as part of mixtures, such as custard. The  new value would reduce this estimate to 36%.  </P> <P> Here is a recipe using eggs and egg whites for making scrambled eggs that can  be dressed up with herbs and spices for variety.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SCRAMBLED EGGS WITHOUT ADDED FAT  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 2 egg whites  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chicken broth  </P> <P> Beat egg and egg whites. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring chicken  broth to boil. Reduce heat to medium and add egg mixture. Cook, scrambling  until firm as desired and liquid is absorbed. Makes 1 serving.  </P> <P> Note: Any desired herbs, such as chopped, fresh tarragon, mint, basil, or mixed  herbs may be added to beaten egg mixture before cooking for variety.  </P></p>

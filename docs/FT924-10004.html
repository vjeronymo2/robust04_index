			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell group plans lobby HUNDREDS of Maxwell pensioners are planning to lobby parliament on Wednesday on the eve of the anniversary of the publisher's death. Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, said: 'Instead of just another charitable short-term panacea, pensioners want the government to provide a long-term solution.' About 20,000 people were affected by the missing Maxwell millions, and some have been told their pensions will be cut by two thirds. The pensioners warn that the government's emergency loan will run out in a few months.</p>

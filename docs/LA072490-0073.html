			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY OKS EARLY STAGE OF LONG-RANGE DOWNTOWN PLAN  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council on Monday adopted a preliminary, long-range plan  that proponents say will produce a vibrant urban center by limiting  construction of downtown office buildings, protecting bayfront views and  stimulating the growth of several downtown residential neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The plan is the result of more than two years of work by the Centre City  Planning Committee, chaired by developer Ernest W. Hahn. The plan includes  several major land-use policy changes that "will dramatically influence the  future of downtown San Diego," according to a lengthy staff report by the city  planning department.  </P> <P> The preliminary plan approved Monday is "the largest planning step ever taken  by a major U.S. city" in an attempt to direct downtown growth and control  vehicle traffic, Hahn said after the meeting. "It's a major step."  </P> <P> Hahn did, however, advise council members that parts of the plan might need to  be reworked. "It's impossible to think that we have a plan that's perfect,"  Hahn said. "None of them ever are."  </P> <P> The preliminary plan, which will be followed in a year by a final plan, calls  for:  </P> <P> * A strip of land along the harbor front, from Lindbergh Field to Barrio Logan,  for recreational, visitor and marine district uses.  </P> <P> * Mixed-use pockets, with a focus on residential neighborhoods, that would ring  the existing core of tall, downtown office buildings. The pockets would be  built on tracts that were zoned largely for commercial and office projects.  </P> <P> * A transportation plan that would expand light-rail and bus systems as well as  incorporate a "parking management program" designed to keep traffic flowing as  the city grows.  </P> <P> * A "Broadway Spine" that would cluster the city's largest and most intense  land uses along a stretch of Broadway between Harbor Drive and an eastern point  that might incorporate a proposed city office complex. The plan is designed to  bolster Broadway's role as the "ceremonial street," linking one end of downtown  with the other.  </P> <P> The plan centers on "San Diego's unique opportunity to have its downtown  focused on a large section of the San Diego Bay," according to the planning  report. The preliminary plan is also designed to protect existing "view  corridors" that give downtown office workers and downtown residents views of  Point Loma to the west and Mexico to the south.  </P> <P> The general plan drew support from a wide range of downtown civic and business  groups. However, those groups -- and some council members, said Monday that  specific parts of the overall plan might need to be reworked.  </P></p>

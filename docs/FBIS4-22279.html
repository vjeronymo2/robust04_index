			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin: "Export Quotas Are No Longer a </F> Secret"]    [Text] The campaign for allotment of export quotas  for 1994, as in former times, took place without publicity.  Nevertheless, from confidential sources the KOMMERSANT editors  obtained information on the volumes and structure of the  allocated quotas. There were also a few sensations. Yesterday  telegrams arrived at the Mintopenergo [Ministry of Fuel and  Energy] and the Minekonomika [Ministry of Economics] from  Bashkiriya and Komi, stating that these republics reject in  favor of their producer enterprises the regional quotas set for  them on the export of oil and petroleum products (Bashkiriya for  the first quarter of 1994, and Komi--for the entire year). Up  until now, no one has ever rejected quotas.  <H8>  Quotas: Yesterday and Today </H8>   The riddle of export quotas which, as we know, are hammered  out by hook or by crook, consists of the fact that in the end  they are never exhausted.    In 1993, the quotas on oil were utilized by 95.6 percent, on  petroleum products--by 73 percent, on lumber--by 56 percent, on  copper--by 70 percent, on nickel--by 97 percent, and on  aluminum--by 90 percent.    The reasons are different in each case. However, the result  is the same. Last year's results are explained not by the fact  that the quotas allocated were too high, but by the fact that  there was a change in the price relations on the Russian and  world markets. Domestic prices increased, outstripping the  relatively smooth reduction in the currency exchange rate of the  ruble. However, world prices on such goods vitally important to  Russia as oil and aluminum declined, and for other raw materials  goods they stagnated. The price gap, which determines the  effectiveness of export, was narrowed. Russian exporters had  already recovered from the gold fever.    The reduction in the volume of quotas for 1994 as compared  with last year is a reaction to the reduction in effectiveness  of export and pressure by the EC [European Community], which has  16 "anti-dumping cases" pending against Russian exporters (on  aluminum, a number of other metals, and fertilizers). The  tightening of state control over export, however, is a poor  substitute for support of exporters.  <H8>  Quotas, Desired and Not Overly So </H8>   The basic raw material flows of Russian export are, as  before, controlled by administrative ties:  Quotas--licenses--special exporters. However, individual  segments in this system have been weakened. The regions  traditionally do not not suit special exporters as an instrument  of centralized control over the effectiveness of export. The  innovation of 1994 consists of the fact that, first of all, the  already effective currency control, strictly speaking, makes  this administrative institution unnecessary. Secondly, the  demarche of Bashkiriya and Komi clearly shows that within the  family of export quotas, regional quotas are the most  unprofitable.    Export credited toward state quotas is exempted from customs  duties. As practical experience shows, the receipt of customs  privileges by enterprises producing export products, especially  if currency is used for the production needs, is much more  realistic than the resolution of this same problem by the  region. Thus, it is quite justified to assume that the regions  will ever more actively strive toward achieving changes in the  regulation of export.  <H8>  Quotas From the Right, Tariffs From the Left </H8>   Despite the unfavorable price conditions for exporters on  the  domestic and world markets, last year's positive foreign trade  balance ($16 billion) was obtained primarily due to an increase  in the absolute volumes of export of basic raw material goods.    In 1993, Russia exported 79.7 million tonnes of crude oil  beyond the boundaries of the former USSR. This is 20.4 percent  more than in 1992. The volume of currency revenues comprised  $8.2 million and $8.5 million respectively. In other words, in a  year it declined by 4 percent.    The export of petroleum products in 1993 totalled 34.5  million tonnes, or $3.4 billion. In 1992 it was 25.3 million  tonnes, or $4.2 billion. The physical volume increased by 36  percent, while the cost volume declined by 17.4 percent.    The export of gas in 1993 was 96 billion cubic meters, or  $7.2 billion worth. In 1992 it was 88 billion cubic meters, or  $7.5 billion. The physical volume increased by 9 percent, while  the cost volume declined by 3.4 percent.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Reduction in volumes of quotas for basic types of Russian raw material expor-|  |t for 1994 (as compared with 1993)                                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Product                               |Percent reduction                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Oil                                   |27                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nickel                                |38                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Timber                                |49                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Petroleum products                    |53                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Aluminum                              |53.2                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Copper                                |62.7                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Level for 1993 - 100|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      In 1994 the volumes of quotas on key goods, despite  tradition, may be fully utilized according to their designation.  For now, in any case, this tendency is clearly apparent. The  grounds for this have appeared: World prices on oil and aluminum  have begun to move upward, and the drop in the exchange rate of  the ruble has notably accelerated. In January-February, 38  percent more petroleum products (in physical volume) were  exported than last year. The increase is partly explained in a  purely technical manner--by the carryover of deliveries from  last year. Nevertheless, the general picture is paradoxical: The  quotas are being reduced, while export is growing. The  explanation is simple. The volumes of quotas which have been  coordinated for the present day are clearly not final.  Corrections will be introduced due to the most varied  factors--sectorial lobbying, anti-dumping limitations on the  part of the Western countries, and sharp changes in market  conditions on the domestic as well as on the world markets.  However, the irrevocable fact remains that the stake, as before,  is being placed on raw material export.    For its effectiveness, especially under unfavorable price  components, the level of customs rates is critically important.  A new tariff has been introduced as of 1 November of last year.  Its rates are significantly lower, but nevertheless raw material  export is subject to duty payments. It would be logical to  remove export customs duties altogether. Yet for now each  exporter solves this problem to his own fear and risk. The most  popular is the export of raw material "on a customer-supplied  basis." It was specifically this type of oil deals with  Lithuania that cost "LUKoil" its status as a special exporter.  There are also more trivial variants associated with this same  Lithuania: According to the data of the GTK [state customs  control], 70 percent of the crude oil delivered to Kaliningrad  Oblast is "lost" en route.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Effectiveness of export of basic raw material goods                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Commodity positions      |World prices ($/tonne)   |Domestic prices (thousan-|  |                         |                         |d rubles/tonne)          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Crude oil                |90-100                   |80-107                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fuel oil                 |45-65                    |37-90                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Diesel fuel              |152-161                  |160-257                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Aluminum                 |1300                     |1370-1900                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H8>  Who Will Upgrade Russian Export? </H8>   The strategic resolution of the problems of Russian export  is  inseparable from the change of its structure. For the time  being, state support for upgrading export is expressed only in  the absence of export duties on finished products and in  instituting the Russian Eximbank [Export-Import Bank] which,  however, will be able to begin ruble crediting of producers of  industrial export products no sooner than this summer. Moreover,  the structural changes must begin with increasing the degree of  processing of initial raw material. In this sense, the theme of  changing the structure of Russian export is directly tied with  quota setting. We are speaking primarily of the status of  foreign investors who, having invested funds into mining  sectors, may realistically, starting with more intensive  processing of raw material, build bridges also to the specific  processing sectors.    For now, however, the vulnerability of foreign investors is  not declining, but on the contrary, increasing. The procedure  which was ratified by the government for defining specific  production of SP [joint ventures] makes it possible for them to  export their own products without obtaining quotas and licenses.  However, it does not exempt them from having to register with  the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] as special  exporters, and this is rather complicated. The MVES guards the  interests of Russian exporters, protecting them from foreign  competitors. Thus, foreign investors are in solidarity with the  Russian regions in their desire to eliminate special exporters  "as a class." On the other hand, the hopes placed by foreign  investors on the Russian Agency for International Cooperation  and Development (RAMSIR) as the official lobbyist for their  interests are most likely unfounded. In the course of the latest  reshuffling within the government, RAMSIR was official handed  over to the management of the MVES. However, the new patron  clearly has no burning desire to deal seriously with foreign  investors. As a result, the agency in fact is in a stage of  division between the MVES and the Ministry of Economics. This,  clearly, does not benefit either foreign investors, or,  ultimately, the cause of improving the structure of Russian  export.

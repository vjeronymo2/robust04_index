			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Information Bureau of the Muslim </F> Brotherhood in Jordan; date not given]    [Text] O ye that believe, betray not the trust of Allah and  the Messenger, nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to  you. [Koranic verse]    The self-rule agreement signed by the domineering leadership  of the PLO and the Zionist enemy is the latest regrettable and  disgraceful chapter in a series of concessions to the Zionist  enemy that are selling out the rights of the Arab and Islamic  nations in general and the Palestinian people in particular  --concessions which include the dearest spot on earth, which is  second only to holy Mecca and Medina and which represents a dear  element in our true Islam.    The large official Arab and Islamic presence at the signing  ceremony bore witness to the recognition of the Zionist enemy  and its usurpation of our sacred territory, including the first  of the two Qiblahs [direction to which a Muslim direct his  prayers] and Islam's third holiest mosque. This signing came in  preparation for the establishment of the Greater Israel project  and the realization of the dreams of world Zionism and its  colonialist supporters, which are panting after the wealth of  the Islamic east.    The signing of the self-rule agreement is a clear violation  of the nation's rights and constant principles, a challenge to  the will of the Palestinian people, a betrayal of their blessed  intifadah, and a treacherous act against the Palestinian  people's steadfast jihad and righteous martyrs.    The Muslim Brotherhood declares its denunciation of this  agreement, as well as its innocence of its provisions, and that  it knows it will be forgiven by Almighty God because it warned  and announced to all the Islamic and Arab peoples that it  rejects this agreement and the likes of it, that it will use  every legitimate and available means to regain rights, and that  its stresses the following principles of the Muslim Brotherhood:    1. Palestine, as well as all Arab and Islamic lands, are for  the nation and the future generations, and no one has the right  to relinquish any part of them under any pretext.    2. We condemn and reject all forms of current and previous  negotiations, as well as all agreements with the enemy occupier,  as a betrayal of God, His messenger, and the faithful, and as a  breach of God's orders and the teachings of His messenger, peace  be upon him, that forbid the relinquishment of any inch of  Islamic land, let alone Palestine's blessed land.    3. Proceeding from our Islamic principles and our commitment  to our religion and our homeland, we declare our hatred and  rejection of that agreement and the likes of it, which are part  of a plan to liquidate the Palestine question and the Arab and  Islamic causes in the interest of the enemies of Islam, the Arab  nation, and the homeland.    4. We declare our denunciation of the current Arab and  Islamic participation in opening the doors of the Arab and  Islamic world to normalization of relations with the Jewish  enemy and to holding meetings with Jewish delegations as part of  a series of concessions and relinquishments of the nation's  rights.    5. We reject all forms of surrender to the American program,  which some Arab leaders are trying to peddle to peoples under  the pretext of pressures and threats. We also demand that the  Arab leaders implement their slogans calling for entrenching  Arab dignity and strength and enabling the nation to be lofty  and proud.    6. We urge the masses of our Arab nation in general and the  Palestinian people in particular to support the militant forces  on the land of Palestine, which reject surrender to the enemy  and which are seeking a total liberation of the Palestinian soil  from the filth of the Jews--forces which include the Islamic  Resistance Movement, Hamas.    7. We reaffirm that the only way to liberate Palestine and  all the Arab and Islamic territories and to restore the nation's  dignity and strength is to launch a holy jihad, which is a duty  as long as an inch of Islamic land is occupied. Leaders are  responsible for preparing the future generations for that  militant duty and for achieving true unity. Any deviation from  this path will serve the projects of the enemies of God, His  messenger, and the faithful. But honor belongs to God and His  apostle, and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not.  [Koranic verse] God will certainly aid those who aid his cause;  for verily God is full of strength, exalted in might. [Koranic  verse].</p>

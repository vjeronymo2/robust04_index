			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (8): Some signs of nervousness - Property Market IT IS a strange bird, this Viennese property market. Until the early 1980s, there was no genuine commercial development to speak of, as some of the world's most restrictive rental laws made it virtually impossible to build for profit. In 1981, a new law permitted developers for the first time to set their commercial rents and terms of contracts freely, at least in buildings completed after 1967. The vast stock of older buildings in Vienna, where most offices are still located, remained under strict rent control laws. It took a few more years, and more legal changes, for the first profit-oriented development projects to spring up, mostly on the city periphery. The majority of the big office buildings completed by the late 1980s had been built by banks, insurance companies or public institutions for their own use. But with the help of sustained economic growth in the late 1980s, the opening of eastern Europe and the plans for a world fair to be held jointly with Budapest in 1995, commercial development took off in 1990, and prices went through the roof. The World Trade Centre at Vienna Airport, one of the first modern office buildings built for profit, filled up quickly, as did several premises combining hotels, shops and offices. But, as more office space is coming to the market, developers are showing signs of nervousness. Rentals for top locations and high-quality offices are still rising fast, but filling new buildings at the city outskirts is no longer that easy. Last year, 20 new projects added 74,000 sq metres of new office space. The increase is estimated at 180,000 sq metres for this year and 175,000 sq metres for next year. A further 600,000 sq metres is in the planning stages. Yields at many completed projects are well below the 5 per cent set as a minimum by international investors. The most prominent failure is the Haas Haus, near St Stephen's Cathedral, perhaps the city's most impressive location. The innovative building has been an architectural triumph for its designer Hans Hollein, but it is a commercial flop for the Austrian banks which own most of the property. Sales in the exclusive stores on the lower levels fell short of expectations, as did rentals of the high-priced offices. Developers say there is enough potential demand to fill all these premises. The problem is how to convince hundreds of small companies and professionals with offices in residential buildings in the city centre to move to new high-tech offices at the periphery. 'Once people realise that their old offices lack facilities such as doormen, centralised cleaning services, air conditioning and modern wiring, there should be strong demand,' says Mr Martin Engelberg, local project manager of the Concorde Business Park, a multi-purpose development near the airport. 'But people have overestimated the mobility of tenants.' Moreover, Austrian developers are still beginners when it comes to marketing, he adds. For commercial reasons, the Austrian government is planning to set a good example. Government ministries and offices, occupying some of the choice buildings in the centre, are set to move to new accommodation in the suburbs. Even the finance ministry has now decided to abandon one of the city's most beautiful baroque palaces, and the administration of Lower Austria, the province surrounding Vienna, will move to the new state capital at St Polten. These transfers will release some coveted real estate in Vienna, which the government can sell or rent out at top prices. Even as some of the new office centres are sailing into troubled water, sails are not being struck. Office rents continue to rise, and are reaching levels seen in other European cities. After climbing 10 per cent in 1990, rents at high-quality locations jumped another 30 per cent last year to an average of Sch180 a sq metre. Rents at the best properties in Vienna's fashionable city centre advanced to Sch350 a sq metre last year from about Sch260 a year before. Analysts do not see an end to that trend. 'Top office rentals in Munich and Dusseldorf are a bit higher, those in Brussels and Hamburg a bit lower than in Vienna,' says Mr Manfred Weidmann, real estate analyst at Creditanstalt. 'Given its role in the world economy, international real estate experts no longer consider Vienna to be cheap. Comparisons with cities like London, Paris or Frankfurt are not appropriate.' Optimism in the real estate market was dampened a year ago when the Vienna electorate, in a surprise move, voted against plans for a world fair. In the months leading to the referendum, hopes that the Expo project would lead to a sustained real estate boom had boosted prices for commercial and residential property, especially in the area near the designated site at the banks of the Danube. But even before the world fair plans collapsed, analysts were predicting the bubble would burst. A major challenge for the Vienna property market is the development of the original Expo site, set in a sparsely populated district across the Danube. Shortly after the referendum, the leaders of the investment consortium opted to go ahead with construction of a major office and residential development. Nomura, the Japanese brokerage house, several Austrian banks and development companies owned by the city of Vienna set up the Vienna Development Company for the Danube Area (WED) to develop the Sch15bn Donau-City, which they say is Europe's third largest urban development project. But the final designs and the financing for the project, which should offer 365,000 sq metres of offices, apartments and recreational activities, are still evolving. WED wants to start preliminary construction this summer and complete the first units in 1997. It is intended that Donau-City should create a second commercial and residential centre outside the city's historical core. The property is located next to the international centre, which houses the headquarters of several UN agencies, and a large recreational area on the Danube. In line with Vienna's ecological image, WED wants to create ample green space between the buildings, but whether the project should include high-rise towers in an otherwise low-rise city is a question still being debated. Adjacent to Donau-City and the UN centre, the federal government is preparing for another major construction site to house the new UN chemical weapons agency. Vienna is bidding against the Hague and Geneva for its headquarters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 18 Jun (DPA) -- While cities in eight  Ecuadoran provinces remained under seige by Indian groups today,  albeit with less violence than in previous days, the government  announced that on Monday there will be "high-level negotiations  with an open agenda."    The barricades erected on Monday by demonstrators linked to  the powerful Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador  (Conaie) continue to paralyze central Ecuador, blocking all  roads and highways and causing an increasing shortage of food  and fuel.    Prices have skyrocketed in practically all Ecuadoran cities  over the last 48 hours following a government announcement that  it would not open the roads by force.    Monday's negotiation will reportedly be headed by the  Ecuadoran president himself, liberal politician Sixto  Duran-Ballen, in accordance with demands made by the Conaie  leadership, which said the strike will not be lifted until the  agrarian law, in effect since 13 June, is repealed.    The law was approved 10 days earlier by the  opposition-controlled Ecuadoran Congress.    Conaie opposes the law because it guarantees ownership of  land that is "fulfilling a social mission," thereby limiting the  agrarian reform process that has been applied for the past three  decades, a period during which, according to official figures,  Ecuadoran agricultural production has dropped dramatically.  Other Indian organizations support the agrarian law.    The government, through Agriculture Minister Mariano  Gonzalez, has already said that the "law is good and will be  kept." Following the announcement of negotiations on Monday,  however, the possibility of sending a reform bill to Congress  has not been ruled out.    The government has instructed the Army and the police force  not to reopen roads as a means of avoiding confrontations, a  decision criticized by farmers and other sectors as a sign of  the "lack of government authority" and as "goodwill gestures  that are absolutely useless."    Conaie Spokeswoman Nina Pacari already announced that the  roadblocks will not be removed until the Indians' demands are  completely met, a position that will give them greater  negotiating power before the government due to the increasingly  difficult situation faced by the cities under siege.</p>

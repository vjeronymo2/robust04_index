			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: KIO more cautious, says former executive THE KUWAIT Investment Office (KIO) is now managing only Dollars 25bn to Dollars 30bn of assets - about half the total of two years ago. According to a former senior executive, the London-based body, which sold most of its 10.5 per cent stake in Midland Bank just as a takeover battle was brewing, intends to pursue a cautious investment strategy under Mr Ali Albader, its new president. The strategy will be more in keeping with the activities of a typical pension fund. The former executive did not indicate whether the assets no longer managed by the KIO had been spent on the war against Iraq and the subsequent rebuilding effort, or transferred to other Kuwaiti investment institutions. However, he referred to comments in November by Mr Abdullah al-Gabandi, managing director of the Kuwait Investment Authority, the KIO's parent, predicting Kuwait would have paid off its Dollars 22bn debt for Operation Desert Storm by the end of 1991. Mr al-Gabandi indicated the money had been raised mainly from the disposal of liquid assets, including government bonds and bank deposits. He said the organisation, which handles a large part of Kuwait's extensive foreign assets, sold the Midland shares because it wanted to avoid any controversy which may have arisen from it taking sides in a battle between Lloyds Bank and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation. This type of caution could mean the KIO will be reluctant to take more than a 3 per cent stake - the level at which an interest must be disclosed - in any quoted UK company. It would preclude moves such as its purchase of 21.7 per cent of BP when the UK government's sale of its remaining stake was hit by the October 1987 stock market crash. BP bought back enough shares to cut the KIO stake to 9.9 per cent, in line with a government divestment order.</p>

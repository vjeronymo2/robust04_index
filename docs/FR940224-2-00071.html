			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Against this background, and following public comment on the Board's October 1992 proposal to open the Fedwire funds transfer service two hours earlier in the morning, the Board directed a staff task force (Fedwire Study Group, see Appendix A of this notice) to discuss the issues involving longer Fedwire hours with representatives of commercial banks and other interested members of the public and to analyze the associated public policy concerns. These discussions helped clarify the issues relating to the expansion of Fedwire hours and the difficulties in devising new techniques to reduce settlement risks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consideration of the appropriate operating hours for the Fedwire funds and securities transfer services must, in the first instance, take account of the Federal Reserve's responsibilities as a central bank to support final interbank settlement. The Federal Reserve Banks provide final interbank payment and settlement services to the banking system through the transfer of banks' balances (reserves and clearing balances) on deposit with Reserve Banks. These balances_also called central bank money_are free of default risk and are an integral part of monetary arrangements for the U.S. dollar. ``Instantaneous'' intraday final payment in risk-free, central bank money is delivered operationally to banks through the Fedwire funds and securities transfer services. The benefits of such instantaneous intraday final payment in central bank money are, in turn, available to the public through the payment services provided by banks to their customers. To achieve this level of finality, Fedwire and similar sophisticated central bank payment services rely on a processing technique known as real-time gross settlement. In fact, most G&hyph;10 central banks currently provide, or are in the process of introducing, real-time gross settlement payment services, along the lines of the Fedwire funds transfer service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (See Appendix B of this notice for a discussion of the structure of large-value interbank payment arrangements.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The central banks of the European Union have recommended that every central bank in the European Union install a real-time gross settlement system. See Report to the Committee of Governors of the central banks of the member states of the European Economic Community by the Working Group on EC Payment Systems, ``Minimum Common Features for Domestic Payment Systems'' (November 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following two public policy objectives can be stated for the Fedwire funds and securities transfer services. These public policy objectives are useful as a guide to analysis of expanded operating hours and were used by the Fedwire Study Group to set the stage for discussions held with the public. Fedwire should:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provide a means that can be used to enhance the safety and efficiency of U.S. dollar settlement arrangements, including arrangements that rely on interbank settlement of netted positions, particularly during periods of financial stress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Respond to the needs of both existing and emerging financial markets, including overseas markets, which depend on the U.S. dollar and are increasingly reliant on state-of-the-art technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Members of the Fedwire Study Group met with representatives of various commercial banks, broker-dealers, and clearing organizations, and with a group of corporate treasurers to discuss current problems in payment and settlement arrangements. The Fedwire Study Group encountered a diversity of views within the financial industry, and even within individual organizations, regarding approaches to managing settlement risk and the use of Fedwire to obtain real-time gross settlement in central bank money outside of current operating hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

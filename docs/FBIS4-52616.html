			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Thursday [12 May] it is "still too early" for the Group of  Seven (G-7) member industrialized countries to grant full  membership to Russia. Hata told reporters Japan favors the  present formula of "G-7 plus one" postsummit dialogue with  Russia.    His comment was in response to reports from Moscow that  President Boris Yeltsin wants to make Russia an eighth member of  the group, which consists of Britain, Canada, France, Germany,  Italy, Japan and the United States.    Hata said Russia is still a recipient of economic and  financial aid but its political influence is undeniably strong  as in the case of the military conflict in the former Yugoslavia.    A high-ranking Foreign Ministry official, speaking on  condition of anonymity, noted that many members of the G-7  countries, at a recent meeting of G-7 government  representatives, were against Russia's participation in the  dialogue as a regular member.    A senior Finance Ministry official also said, "It is  difficult for both donors and a recipient nation like Russia to  sit at the same table."</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Plan for ninth container terminal opposed THE Hong Kong government has announced plans to build the colony's ninth container terminal, which it hopes will be completed by 1995, writes Simon Holberton. The decision, although expected, has raised complaints from local residents, environmentalists and politicians over the effect it will have on the quality of life for those living nearby. Hong Kong houses the world's second largest container port. Rapid industrialisation in southern China has boosted container throughput, which grew last year by 20 per cent, exceeding 6m TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) for the first time. An eighth container terminal is currently under construction and is due to open in August 1993. This and the ninth terminal will each have a capacity of 1.6m TEUs. The site chosen for the terminal, on Tsing Yi island, faces existing container port facilities across the Rambler Channel. Two Hong Kong companies - Hutchison and Wharf - dominate the port. Mrs Anson Chan, secretary for economic services, said yesterday she favoured greater competition among providers of port services. She would not comment on reports that the Taiwanese group Evergreen and Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong-based trading group, were separately considering bids to operate the ninth terminal.</p>

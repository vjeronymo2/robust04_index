			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: European telecoms The thinking behind a possible merger of the main Swedish, Dutch and Swiss telecoms operators has merit. All three are middle-sized operators, whose highly profitable international activities are vulnerable to growing competition. The three have already clubbed together to create Unisource, which provides one-stop services to multinationals. But as the old telecoms cartel cracks, they need a strategy to address the much bigger market for carrying ordinary international calls. The danger is that larger carriers could poach their traffic. The corresponding hope is that by joining forces the groups will not merely be able to hold their own but win traffic from rivals' networks. But engineering any merger would be complex. One precondition would presumably be the privatisation of the Swedish and Swiss operators. So far only the Netherlands' KPN is privatised. Without a market reference price, it would be hard to hammer out financial terms that were seen to be fair. Privatisation would also be the best guarantee for KPN shareholders that a merged entity would be run to enhance shareholder value rather than to advance political objectives. It is possible that a full merger would be impossible for political reasons and that the companies may instead opt to exchange equity stakes in each other. But a web of cross shareholdings would be a worse option for investors as it would restrict the operators' room for manoeuvre. If political considerations prevent a clean-cut merger, the companies should stick to their more modest aim of merging their international arms.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets: Optimism as motors look on the mend - Wall Street AFTER 18 months of bleeding red ink, and years of being pilloried as industrial dinosaurs, the car makers of Detroit won a little respect on Wall Street this week. General Motors and Ford Motor reported first quarter results better than analysts' forecast and a return to profits. The earnings - Dollars 179m in the case of GM and Dollars 337.9m for Ford - were admittedly small relative to the companies' sizeand relied heavy on profits from their non-automotive operations. But they did show a sharp reduction in the losses of their North American operations. Motor stocks have been moving upward for some time in anticipation of recovery, although GM suffered a relapse a week ago when it announced a Dollars 2.3bn stock offering. This week's figures gave them another shove and set off a modest rally in the broader market. The mood cooled on Thursday when Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit's Big Three, reported a Dollars 231m loss before accounting changes. But that was due largely to the cost of introducing new models this year which could transform its performance for the better. Overall, motor industry figures reinforced the impression given to the market by a season of broadly better-than-expected corporate results: the economy is slowly but surely on the mend, and profits might spring back later this year more strongly than expected. It is this sentiment which took the Dow Jones industrial average to an all-time high of 3366.50 on April 16 and has sustained it since. It has also underpinned a movement by investors from growth stocks - companies which tend to grow faster than the economy - into cyclicals, which tend to track the economy. Yet some caution is in order. First, the latest batch of economic statistics shows an economy which is growing only slowly - 2 per cent in the first quarter. Consumer confidence is on the rise, but figures yesterday, from the National Association of Purchasing Managers, which tracks economic expansion, were weaker than the market was expecting. The car companies warned about the fragility of the recovery through earnings reports and the same tone was struck by the large steel companies, such as USX and Bethlehem Steel, when they reported continued losses in their steel divisions. In short, while most analysts expect a slow, sustained economic recovery for the rest of the year, it is just conceivable that the upturn could peter out, as last year's spring burst did. The stock market also has features which are making some analysts edgy. The DJIA, which is comprised of blue chip stocks, has been outperforming the broader market for some time, which is often a sign of a correction ahead. Technical analysts point to weakness since February in the ratio of stocks with rising share prices to those with falling ones. The stock market rally which began last December was powered initially by falling interest rates, encouraging investors to take funds out of fixed income accounts and seek higher returns in shares. Over the past month or two the bull has been sustained more by expectations of rising earnings, and share prices are now discounting fancy leaps in profit. Three factors could limit the market's scope for substantial advances, or prompt a significant, downward correction. One is if the economy fails to provide the backdrop for the expected good earnings news. The second is interest rates. Concern about the Federal Government's borrowing needs, as well as the threat of inflation implicit in economic recovery, has kept the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond above 8 per cent for the past few weeks. The Wall Street consensus is that bond yields will fall. But if bond yields remain high, they will encourage fund managers to switch out of equities. The third is politics. Ross Perot, the Texan who may run as a presidential candidate, is gaining on President Bush in the opinion polls. There is a long way to go to November's election, but growing uncertainty about the outcome is starting to make the market a trifle nervous.  -------------------------------------- Monday       3304.56  -    19.90 Tuesday      3307.92  +     3.36 Wednesday    3333.18  +    25.26 Thursday     3359.12  +    25.94 Friday       3336.09  -    23.03  --------------------------------------</p>

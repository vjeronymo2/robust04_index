			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Eurofer concerned at steel from E Europe EUROFER, the European group of steel producers, yesterday told the European Commission it was worried about rising steel imports from eastern Europe, particularly Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovak steel shipments rose 126 per cent in the first third of this year, against the same period of 1991, a Eurofer official claimed. Eurofer yesterday discussed with Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, the lack of a new Gatt steel code which has prompted two US complaints of dumping against EC exporters. The Commission says it will try to use the conciliation mechanism of the EC's new association agreement with Czechoslovakia before launching any investigation. Earlier this month, Czechoslovakia conceded that the removal of all EC quotas and virtually all tariffs on March 1 had led to a surge in its steel exports, and promised to try to re-target these away from Germany, Italy and Greece, which had taken most of the impact. Czechoslovak diplomats in Brussels say they have been trying to persuade companies to use tariff cuts to increase their profit margin, rather than sell at lower prices and increase market share. The Czech steel issue is one of many tensions likely to arise in the wake of the EC's new trade pacts also covering Poland and Hungary. The Commission yesterday published a report on its anti-dumping activities in 1991, showing investigations opened during the year fell to 20 from a record 43 opened in 1990. But the rate of new investigations has picked up this year. The EC executive maintains that, in launching these investigations, it responds mainly to what it sees as unfair trading practices abroad, rather than protectionist pressures at home. Thus, 11 of the 33 investigations concluded last year were dropped, 19 ended in duties, and in three, foreign companies agreed to raise prices. One of the year's biggest cases ended in Japanese exporters of DRAM and EPROM computer chips being hit with a 94 per cent duty and undertaking to obey a reference price. At the time, the Commission was criticised for putting chip-users in the EC at a disadvantage. EC External Relations Commissioner Frans Andriessen urged Seoul yesterday to stamp out discriminatory taxes on imported liquor, Reuter reports from Brussels.  'We are unhappy about the matter and would like to see this corrected,' his spokesman said. Mr Andriessen had raised the issue with South Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Kak-Kyu Choi, but received no guarantees the system would be changed.</p>

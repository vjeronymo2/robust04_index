			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SERVICES SATURDAY FOR VICTIMS OF SHOOT-OUT IN SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> Funeral services are scheduled Saturday for a former Orange County woman and  her 10-year-old daughter who were slain in Saudi Arabia in an incident  unrelated to the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Kent Hinkson, who worked as a computer programmer for the Saudi government, is  expected to arrive in Los Angeles on Thursday with his five children and the  bodies of his wife, Kimberly, and daughter, Courtney, said his mother, Norma  Hinkson of Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Services will be conducted in Westminster at the Garden Grove chapel of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 10332 Bolsa Ave. Viewing is  scheduled at 9 a.m., followed by services at 10 a.m..  </P> <P> Norma Hinkson said that her son, who moved his family seven years ago from  Orange County to the Saudi capital of Riyadh, is not sure of his plans once he  returns to the United States. Before the slaying, Kent Hinkson and his  32-year-old wife had been planning to leave the Middle East and buy a home in  Provo, Utah, for their family.  </P> <P> "He will probably settle either here in Orange County, so we can help take care  of the children, or else in Utah," Norma Hinkson said. "But he doesn't know for  sure at all."  </P> <P> The slaying of Hinkson's wife was unrelated to the events surrounding the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> The Aug. 14 shootings occurred while Hinkson, his wife and four of their six  children were driving back from a grocery shopping trip, Norma Hinkson said.  </P> <P> As they stopped at an intersection, a suspected Saudi drug smuggler being  pursued by police commandeered the car and killed 10-year-old Courtney with a  gunshot to her neck. Saudi police chased the car for 45 minutes, firing  repeatedly at the vehicle until it stalled.  </P> <P> Kimberly Hinkson, who was four months pregnant with twins, was fatally wounded  in the head by police gunfire. The gunman was captured unharmed.  </P></p>

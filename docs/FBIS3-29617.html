			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Bank of Japan (BOJ)  governor Yasushi Mieno on Tuesday [22 February] voiced concern  over the recent surge in the yen's value against the dollar.    The Japanese currency's strength against the dollar is  "excessive," mieno told a private forum. The monetary  authorities will "take appropriate steps in a timely manner" to  stabilize exchange rates, he added.    He said the recent yen rise is feared to worsen corporate  sentiment.    The yen gathered upward momentum against the dollar  following  the breakdown earlier this month of Japan-U.S. trade talks  designed to establish a framework to help reduce Japan's huge  trade surplus.    Mieno said the Japanese economy is still stagnant but he  noted that corporate sentiment is showing some slight signs of  recovery. He said the current short-term interest rates are low  enough to support corporate restructuring efforts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Facing the Moment" newscast] </F>   [Text] Monday, Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria said he  was surprised by UN Human Rights Rapporteur Pedro Nikkem's  report. The Nikkem report was presented at the UN Human Rights  Commission, which is currently meeting in Geneva, Switzerland,  to analyze the situation in different countries.    The Nikkem report criticizes the lack of respect for human  rights in El Salvador, and notes that compliance with the peace  accord has decreased in recent months.    According to Oscar Santamaria, the report was prepared  abroad  and does not correspond to the country's reality. He also  rejected claims of a decrease in compliance with the peace  process. The official expressed regret Pedro Nikkem had not  visited El Salvador to conclude his report, and he said the UN  rapporteur's role is to support the government in human rights  affairs.    In his report, Pedro Nikkem criticizes the Salvadoran  Government's lack of cooperation. He said immigration obstacles  had been created to prevent his visit, which was scheduled for  the end of last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It is reported that the United States has ordered  Sar Kheng, the cheap lackey puppet of the communist Vietnamese,  to go urgently to America. What is the purpose of the U.S.  order?    It is widely known that Sar Kheng is the arch traitor of the  nation, the cheap lackey of the communist Vietnamese, and the  most cruel and fascist agent of the communist Vietnamese. He is  also part of the most corrupt and stinking clique. Sar Kheng is  also a member of the communist party, a puppet of the communist  Vietnamese, the head of the security forces, and a murderer who  suppressed, arrested, and killed scores of Cambodian people for  15 years from 1979 to the present time. His crimes are  extremely serious.    As the communist Vietnamese's lackey, puppet, and  instrument,  he destroyed the Cambodian nation and people to turn Cambodia  into a second Kampuchea Kraom, thereby eliminating the Cambodian  race. How many Cambodian people have already been killed by the  communist Vietnamese puppets Sar Kheng, Chea Sim, and Hun Sen  and the communist Vietnamese? To what extent have those  puppets allowed the communist Vietnamese to swallow Cambodia's  terrestrial and maritime territory and islands? How many  million ethnic Vietnamese have they allowed to flow into  Cambodia? How far have they turned our Cambodian society upside  down? How bad have the four or five million Vietnamese  oppressed the Cambodian society and people? And how  destructive have they plundered Cambodia's land, lakes, small  and big rivers, fish, and forests?    The entire Cambodian nation and people reject and condemn  the  communist Vietnamese lackeys because of their actions, which  betray the nation, sell out the nation, and destroy the nation  and people. Now they have fallen into the abyss of death. They  are agonizing; their days are numbered.    How far can the communist Vietnamese puppets survive with  U.S. aid and arms supply? How can the puppets be saved when  the U.S. ringleader and its alliance have not been able to  rescue their own son [Ranariddh's party]? How can they save the  rotten one-eyed (?puppet) of the communist Vietnamese when they  are so rotten and stinking and have been opposed and condemned  by the people? The communist Vietnamese have striven to cure  the rotten puppets for 14 or 15 years, but in vain. They still  remain decomposed and remain at death's door.    The only effective treatment is to achieve national  reconciliation, national unity, and genuine peace.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Sinclair Goldsmith rights and merger SINCLAIR Goldsmith, a quoted property surveyor, is to merge with Conrad Ritblat in the latest of a series of mergers by chartered surveying practices. The deal values Conrad Ritblat, which is headed by Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, at about Pounds 11.3m. Its shareholders will receive 32.3m shares of Sinclair Goldsmith, which were suspended in February at a price of 35p. Sinclair Goldsmith also announced a 1-for-4 rights issue to raise Pounds 2.66m. Up to a third of the cash will be used for working capital; the remainder will fund its expansion into areas such as the Midlands and the north of England. Sinclair Goldsmith said its decision to merge stemmed from a search for ways 'to improve the company's profitability and strengthen its position in the market.' It incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 525,000 for the year to May 31 1992 and a pre-tax loss of Pounds 265,000 for the six months to November 30. Conrad Ritblat made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.2m for the year to April 30 1992 and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 374,000 for the six months to October 31. British Land accounts for about a quarter of Conrad Ritblat's turnover. After the merger and rights issue, about 49.4 per cent of the shares will be held by directors of Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith, the name for the combined group. Mr John Ritblat will own 10.8 per cent of group. Dealings in the shares are expected to resume on May 25. An extraordinary meeting to approve the merger will be held on May 24.</p>

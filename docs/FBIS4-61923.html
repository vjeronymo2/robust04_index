			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Igor Petrov: "Fishing Quota Will Be Established </F> in Baltic"]    [Text] After two years of painstaking preparatory work a  package of agreements relating to cooperation in the fishing  sphere has been signed between the Russian and Estonian  governments.    One of these agreements is designed to promote the  normalization of fishing in the Baltic while another concerns  the reciprocal use and safeguarding of fish stocks in inland  border lakes.    The agreement, signed for a period of five years with an  automatic extension, in contrast to many similar documents also  contains a mechanism for monitoring the documents' punctilious  fulfillment. In the opinion of Vladimir Korelskiy, chairman of  the committee for fishing, the next step will be to establish  scientifically substantiated fishing quotas in the Baltic and to  elaborate measures to safeguard a fish rated as a delicacy --  the smelt -- in the Chudskoye, Teploye, and Pskovskoye Lakes.    What draws the attention is the fact that the agreements on  the solution of practical isues affecting the two countries'  interests were signed before Russia and Estonia had unanimously  decided to establish offifcial borders between the states.    Obviously fishermen understand better than politicians that  while the case drags one the fish, which recognize no state  borders, could be swimming off other shores.</p>

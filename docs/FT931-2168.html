			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Election arouses little excitement among voters MR Francois Albert, a retired building worker, has voted Socialist all his life and sees no reason to stop now. 'I'm not saying this government has been perfect, but at least they've done their best,' he said yesterday after casting his vote in the first round of the French parliamentary elections at the town hall of the 4th arrondissement in Paris. 'The polls say the right will win this time. Maybe they will. What will happen to pensioners like me then?' Mr Albert, like the rest of the French electorate, will probably find out next Sunday after the second and final round of voting in the elections. The atmosphere in Paris yesterday was as downbeat as the rest of the campaign. French law imposes rigorous restrictions on electoral publicity. Candidates may not spend more than FFr500,000 (Pounds 63,000) on their campaigns and there are other tight curbs in force for the six months before the vote. The tourists milling around Paris yesterday in the spring sunshine could have been forgiven for not realising an election was in progress. There were none of the blockbuster advertising campaigns that mark US elections, nor the eager canvassers who badger voters outside many other European polling stations. The only signs of the French vote were a few fly posters, odd splashes of graffiti and the billboards of smiling candidates pasted up outside town halls. Moreover, the tone of the campaign, the 10th parliamentary polls in the Fifth Republic, has been subdued even by French standards. The apparently inevitable conservative landslide, coupled with President Francois Mitterrand's determination to stay on at the Elysee Palace until the 1995 presidential poll, has sapped the electorate's enthusiasm. 'All the parties are as bad as each other,' said Mr Alexandre Mercier, a young shop assistant, voting in the 4th arrondissement. 'The left is useless. The right is useless too. I've voted for the ecologists, not because I believe in them but because I can't stand the rest.' Even conservative voters were unenthusiastic. 'I've voted conservative because the sooner the left goes the better,' said an elderly woman. 'But nothing will really change in France until that man Mitterrand goes too.' Some are so disillusioned they are not bothering to vote at all. Mr Francis Bertaux and Mr Patrick Miller, two designers in the Marais area of Paris, abstained yesterday and plan to skip the second round of voting next Sunday in favour of spending the evening at the Matisse exhibition in the Georges Pompidou Centre. 'We don't believe in any of the parties,' said Mr Miller. 'Everyone will be at glued to their televisions at home next Sunday, watching the final results. It'll be our only chance to see the Matisse show without the usual crowds.'</p>

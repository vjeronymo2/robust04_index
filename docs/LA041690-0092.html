			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> Parts of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton in North Orange County are scheduled to  get their latest aerial application of malathion tonight beginning at 9 in the  state's ongoing campaign against the Mediterranean fruit fly.  </P> <P> It is the second-to-last scheduled treatment for the 26-square-mile spray area,  which covers parts of both Orange and Los Angeles counties, under a state plan  to phase out malathion use by early May and replace it with the release of  millions of sterile Medflies.  </P> <P> The Brea area's last treatment is scheduled for April 30.  </P> <P> But a series of recent Medfly finds around the Southland -- including one last  week in a bountiful agriculture region of Riverside County -- has prompted  state officials to create new spray zones and broaden the current schedule for  existing malathion regions.  </P> <P> Orange County's second spray region, touching parts of nine cities around  Garden Grove and Westminster, is scheduled for its next malathion application  this Thursday and its final treatment on May 3.  </P> <P> Residents are advised to stay indoors during the applications and cover fish  ponds and cars. Those with questions can call the county's Medfly hot line at  (714) 447-7118.  </P></p>

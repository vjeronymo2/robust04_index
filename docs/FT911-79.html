			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / New truck sales down by 46% NEW TRUCK sales plunged in April by 46 per cent, compared with the same month last year, to only 2,647, as the recession deepened further in leading sectors of the UK commercial vehicles market. The truck industry is suffering the steepest two-year slide into recession in the post-war period, with most UK truck makers operating at a loss. Truck registrations (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) in the first four months - at 11,562 - were 39.7 per cent lower than a year ago, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Sales have dropped by 54.9 per cent in the past two years from the 25,638 achieved in the first four months of 1989. The collapse in sales has been led by the heavy truck sector (above 15 tonnes), where sales in the first four months this year - at 5,452 - were 43.4 per cent lower than a year ago and 61.6 per cent lower than in the corresponding period of 1989. Overall, new commercial vehicle registrations in April fell by 27.6 per cent to 19,406, compared with the same month last year, while sales in the first four months were 31.6 per cent lower than a year ago, at 79,457. Sales of imported vehicles have been hardest hit in the recession, and their share in the first four months fell to 35.6 per cent from 39.5 per cent a year ago. In the truck market Leyland DAF, UK subsidiary of DAF of the Netherlands, established a narrow lead in the first four months ahead of Iveco Ford. Leyland DAF increased its share of the overall truck market (above 3.5 tonnes) to 24.5 per cent from 24 per cent a year ago, while Iveco Ford's share dropped to 24.2 per cent from 24.9 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago.</p>

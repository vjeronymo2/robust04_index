			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah </F> by Dr. Rif'at Sayyid Ahmad in Beirut; date not given]    [Text] [Ahmad] Hizballah's name has been associated with  martyrdom. How would you describe Hizballah's experiment in the  past decade through its resistance operations in the south and  its association with the notion of martyrdom?    [Nasrallah] From the start, Hizballah was established as a  jihad movement, and it operated on this basis. Certainly the  conditions prevailing at the time of its establishment were very  hard and tough. The Israeli occupation forces were occupying  much of the Lebanese territories and were allied with some of  the right- wing parties. Multinational troops were present in  Beirut. The Palestinian forces, which had been confronting the  Israeli enemy, were defeated. Later, the PLO left Lebanon and  many slogans were abandoned. The only choice left at the time  was confrontation; confrontation of the hegemony, domination,  occupation, arrogance, and Israel's legendary aura and of the  state of frustration, despair, defeat, and capitulation that  prevailed in Lebanon. A strong shock had to be administered to  awaken the Lebanese people from their slumber and point to the  major elements of power inherent in them. We were in need of a  new method to restore confidence to the people and at the same  time convince them that the enemy can be defeated. There were  several accumulated complexes; superiority, weakness, and  humiliation complexes and the feeling that the other party is  stronger and undefeatable. In those days, I remember the  arguments between the young strugglers and those who called  themselves realists, who thought that our movement was  unrealistic and illogical; in other words, a movement of crazy  people!! Today, all of them say that the only realists and  logical people at the time were us. The most prominent aspect  of Hizballah movement is the jihad aspect. After three years,  the movement managed to prove its credibility. So it is not a  coincidence to see the current massive popular rallying around  us. During those three years, we managed by means of martyrdom  operations to force the Israeli troops to withdraw from al-Biqa'  and Beirut and to keep them confined to the currently occupied  border zone. The Israelis withdrew unconditionally and without  any security arrangements. This is because the casualties they  sustained generated popular pressure inside the Zionist entity  that led to the withdrawal of the Israelis, after the withdrawal  of the U.S. and British troops, who knew that they simply could  not stay longer without suffering casualties. Thus, we believe  that our jihad experiment has been successful. We also managed  to identify many sources of strength in our people. We managed  to stimulate our people. Proof of this is that the resistance  enjoys popular, official, and partisan support throughout the  country. Undoubtedly, the resistance operations and martyrs in  Lebanon have had a major influence in stimulating the  Palestinians in the occupied territories, and the leaders of the  Palestinian intifadah admit this. These operations proved that  the Israeli is weaker than we believe and is not what we imagine  him to be. The Koran testifies to their cowardice. They are  too weak to get involved in face-to-face confrontations. We  believe that this jihad movement, which is still continuing,  could develop further and could be generalized, and this is what  we are looking forward to. We want to see this resistance in all  the cordon states around the Zionist enemy.    [Ahmad] With the liberation of all the Lebanese soil, will  the suicidal performance of the Islamic movement in the south be  affected or will it continue in various forms until Palestine  and Jerusalem are liberated?    [Nasrallah] In fact this question has been the focus of  interest in many circles. One thing is clear in all cases.  When the Israeli enemy withdraws from the Lebanese territories,  the resistance will stop at that level. As for the rest of the  question and the types of action, this is premature; the matter  will be subject to developments and the situations that might  arise. As far as principles are concerned, we believe that  Palestine is an occupied land, that Israel is a usurper entity,  and that the Palestinians are primarily responsible for  liberating this land. They are entitled to support from all Arab  and Muslim nations until all the land is liberated. As for how  and through which methods, this will be determined in time.    [Ahmad] This takes us to negotiations, the so-called  settlement, and the fantasies of the Middle East market. We  want to hear your views in this matter in general.    [Nasrallah] Hizballah has declared its clear and determined  stand since the invitation to the Madrid conference. We refused  to take part. In other words, we reject negotiations with the  Israeli enemy. We believe that the American and Israeli enemies  want to seize this opportunity to force their plans on the  entire region. We are going through a stage that lacks  international and regional balance, after Desert Storm and the  frustration and despair it created. Therefore, they are trying  to force the formula or the settlement that suit their  interests. The American and Israeli enemies are serious about a  peaceful settlement according to their own terms at this  particular time, where conditions are favorable. They know very  well that the future involves many risks and they have to cope  with that future. But can these negotiations achieve results or  not?    As far as the Palestinian track is concerned, the situation  is clear. I believe that it is possible to agree on signing the  details of the Declaration of Principles, because 'Arafat is  prepared to sign anything. When he took that course, he did not  do so in order to go back to armed struggle later. He took it  to finish it to the end whatever the price. The concessions he  made are unimaginable. Even those who mistrusted 'Arafat to the  maximum did not expect that many concessions. Through their  intifadah, the Palestinian people expressed their rejection of  the Palestinian- Israeli Declaration of Principles.    As for the Jordanian track, matters are almost settled; they  are waiting for the other tracks. The major obstacle lies in  the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. The Israelis want to reach some  solution with Syria or Lebanon. But President al-Asad's  personality and his determination to hold on to the established  principles he declared-- when the Israelis cannot make real  concessions--lead me to believe that it is not possible to  achieve any result on that track. This is at the official  level. But our own vision is that negotiations-- regardless of  their results--will not be able to force on the region the  formula, the shape, or the substance Israel and America are  pursuing. We are strongly convinced of that and are very  optimistic about the future. We believe that the people of the  region will not tolerate coexistence with this imposed formula.    At any rate, the Egyptian people have become an example that  conciliation with Zionists concerns the regimes; there will  never be a conciliation as far as the people are concerned.  This is the actual reality after all these years since the Camp  David Accord was signed. The Egyptian people have not accepted  normalization or coexistence with the Zionist enemy. This is  what makes us optimistic. We say that any result reached will  be limited to the regimes, which will not be able to protect  that result or force it on the people.    [Ahmad] What is your opinion about some Islamist religious  leaders who have recognized, advocated, and legalized the idea  of recognizing the Zionist entity? There are some Islamic  edicts in this regard which appeared in some of our Islamic  countries (no names mentioned). What is your opinion about this  matter (the recognition)?    [Nasrallah] Historically speaking, there are scholars who  are known as the court scholars. The scholars under the various  governments that ruled the Islamic countries in the past were  divided into three categories: One group adopted the people's  cause, rejecting the ruler's oppression, tyranny, and injustice.  The second group supported the ruler, and were called the court  scholars. This group was also called by Imam Khomeyni the  sultan's preachers. The third group was impartial and regarded  what happened as of no concern to it. It is also known that the  court scholars issued Muslim religious edicts contrary to  Islamic principles which require that any such edict be rooted  in the Koran, the Prophet's tradition, or evidence adopted in  Islamic jurisprudence. History books relate such actions. Such  scholars cannot deceive anyone. They may at one point mislead  the simple people. But they are eventually exposed. We  currently witness such scholars, and we will continue to see  such types of scholars who are alien to the Islamic awakening.    [Ahmad] Let us move on to the Lebanese issue. I have  recently noticed some changes in Lebanese society. I want to  ask: Do you see in this the start of Lebanon's revitalization  or the start of new problems and fresh internal conflicts?    [Nasrallah] A series of events have recently taken place,  some of them devoid of wisdom. Lebanon is almost at the  threshold of the unknown. For example, the present government  has adopted several security, media, and political measures.  These measures have interacted. Some conditions have been  exploited to push through plans that had been prepared before.  This is a serious action. The Lebanese understand this easily.  This government has been working since its establishment to  change the nature of things in Lebanon. This government cannot  claim to have established domestic peace. Domestic peace was  accomplished before, thanks to the direct Syrian effort and the  agreement of the Lebanese people to support and embrace the  process of domestic peace. The present government was  established against the background of domestic peace and a bad  economic situation. Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri had  something to do with the bad economic situation through what is  called the dollar game, the banks, and so forth. This  government came to change the conditions in a way not so  familiar to the Lebanese. The prime minister tried in various  ways to dominate all the media--the press, radios, and  television stations--by buying some of them and exerting  pressure on the rest. The government adopted measures on other  levels, such as banning trade union demonstrations. There was  also an attempt to control the banks. We, as a movement for  resisting the occupation, believe that any security measure to  control the groups cooperating with Israel and its tools is  perfectly sound. But we are against the exploitation of security  measures to push through plans pertaining to the media, trade  union freedoms, and public freedoms in general in order to  transform Lebanon into an emirate or shaykhdom.    [Ahmad] This takes us to the parliamentary experience and  your assessment of it. Some Islamic movements in other  countries reject the idea of the parliamentary experience for  several reasons, including reasons that have to do with  jurisprudence. What is your assessment of this experience in  terms of jurisprudence, as well as actually and politically in  Lebanon, particularly after Hizballah's entry into the  parliament and its becoming the biggest partisan power in the  parliament?    [Nasrallah] Islamic movements all over the Islamic world  must  agree in their goals and principles. But they do not  necessarily agree in their approach. Every country has its  unique situation and conditions. For example, the Islamic  movement in Iran--which led to the revolution and the overthrow  of the shah's regime--did not adopt the military approach. It  adopted the popular approach, using strikes, demonstrations, and  clashes of a popular nature in the street, away from the  military and security approach. The situation was different in  Lebanon's case. Under occupation, it is not possible to stage  demonstrations that inflict harm on the people more than they  harm the occupiers. Therefore, conditions are unique to each  country. It follows that Islamists should not be rigid in their  methods, tactics, and approaches. We have to select the  legitimate approaches instead of insisting on one rigid approach.    We now come to the parliamentary experience. When we entered  the parliamentary battle, we had a set of objectives and goals.  We said that participation in the parliament would not change  the system. This was unprecedented frankness with the Lebanese  people. Among the goals of participation in the parliament was  that of solidifying our jihad and political existence. The West  and arrogant powers tried to picture Islamists in Lebanon as  security organizations, armed gangsters, and terrorist groups  that have no intellectual, cultural, or organizational presence.  They sometimes said that these Islamists were a bunch of  Iranians who came to Lebanon. We sought elections as a means of  demonstrating our volume, presence, and scope. Many were  surprised to find that Hizballah enjoyed all that popularity.    On the other hand, we wanted to have a voice in the  parliament to call for resistance. Our priorities in Lebanon  are different from other Islamic movements elsewhere. Some  Islamic movements give priority to overthrowing the regime and  establishing an Islamic state. Accordingly, they move in that  direction. We believe that our top and dominant priority is to  fight Israel, expel the Israeli occupier, and arouse the nation  to establish a major popular, Islamic resistance that restores  Jerusalem and rids the nation of that cancerous growth. Hence,  we are primarily concerned with enhancing efforts in the  direction of that priority at all the political and legal  levels. This requires being within an institution that is  capable of providing some kind of support to the resistance  movement. Therefore, we endeavored to support the resistance  after entering the parliament. In that context, we developed  other objectives, like defending the victims of injustice from  within the parliament and providing better conditions for our  people through submitting bills and discussing government plans  and budget.    From the viewpoint of Islamic jurisprudence, our  participation in the parliament was given deep thought by a  group of jurisconsults. It was not only a political decision.  A distinction may be drawn between participation in the  parliament and participation in an executive authority. The  parliament is a legislative, not an executive power. It allows  some sort of political influence on the course of things in  Lebanon.    In the parliament, I can say my mind, oppose, and discuss. I  can oppose the laws I do not like. I exercise my freedom, and I  do not have to accept just anything presented to me. In the  parliament, we discuss and oppose. At the end of the day, we  may not support this program or that, and then we will not be  partners to the consequences. In the parliament, I can say, for  example, that I reject the demolition of these houses, and then  I spare myself the blame. I also can confront these things in  the parliament. No one can impose on me anything I do not  believe in; I express my opinion in full freedom.    On the other hand, when I become part of the government,  that  is, part of the executive power, I cannot do that because the  minister, at the end of the day, is committed to the policies of  the government. The deputy is not committed to the policies of  the parliament. This means that when the Islamists enter the  parliament, they are religiously not blamed for any negative  consequences.    Yes, things may sometimes and in certain cases reach a point  where participation in the parliament may strengthen or cover up  a serious situation or one that strategically conflicts with the  objectives and inclinations of the Islamic trend. In this case,  the deputies may resign and totally exempt themselves from the  responsibility. But this always needs a study from the  religious point of view.    [Ahmad] Do you see Hizballah playing a role in future  Lebanese and Arab affairs? What shape and size will this take?    [Nasrallah] Generally, we are optimistic about the future of  the Islamic movement in Lebanon and the region. I even tell the  Western ambassadors who visit us that the Islamic movement and  the Islamic awakening in our Islamic world are no longer an  option, but a fate they must recognize. Hizballah is part of  this bigger Islamic movement, affecting it and being affected by  it. There is something like a unified destiny and a unified  future. On the Lebanese level, we are not worried. On the  contrary, the movement is growing and developing every day, and  the line adopted by Hizballah--a jihad and political line--is  logical and convincing. you will certainly find people in  Lebanon who disagree with us or reject our thought and  inclinations, but even these people respect our jihad and  sacrifices. This is taken for granted. When Hizballah  Secretary General 'Abbas al-Musawi was martyred--and he was the  first secretary general or leader of a party or movement to be  martyred by the Israelis in Lebanon--all Lebanon was shrouded in  sadness. We are a resistance movement whose leaders, not only  ordinary fighters, are killed and martyred by the sinful Israeli  aggression. Contrary to the image that foreign media are  portraying, we in Lebanon talk about resistance and liberation  of the land, practice resistance sincerely, and are concerned  about civil peace. Many people thought that when the government  in Lebanon tried to strengthen civil peace in the country, it  would clash with Hizballah. They thought Hizballah would reject  the moves to cancel armed appearance or abolish some military  barracks, or that it would not accept certain measures. But  they were mistaken.    In past years, some press analysts used to say a major  battle between the Lebanese state and Hizballah would break out  once the first asked the latter to do this or that. These  analysts were surprised to find that we operate with a different  mentality. We believe that civil peace in Lebanon is in the  interest of our people. It is not the authority that matters;  it is the people. We oppose the authority, but we care about  our society and our people because we know that going back to  the civil war in Lebanon would serve Israel's, not the  resistance's, interests; the interests of the enemies of  Lebanon, not the people of Lebanon. We are open to all sects,  trends, and movements present in Lebanon with which we may  differ in religion, creed, or political ideology. I may even  claim that we as an Islamic movement are more open to our  surroundings and to the currents, parties, and personalities  operating around us than any other movement. Day after day, our  roots go deeper in the Lebanese ground. I can even add that one  can find Hizballah's movement in the minds of children. It is no  longer a movement that belongs to one generation, but several  generations. Thus, the movement cannot be uprooted by striking  at its key symbols, figures, or one of its generations. To  uproot this movement is to strike at several generations, and I  do not believe anybody could do so to uproot a movement of such  magnitude. Hizballah is no longer a transitory or unusual  movement. It is a genuine part of this society; one that goes  into the people's homes, neighborhoods, cities, and hearts. It  is a deep- rooted movement that goes deeper and grows more day  after day. Thus, as far as Lebanon is concerned I do not believe  we have a problem. I personally am optimistic about the future  of the Islamic movement, and that of Hizballah precisely, in  Lebanon. Hizballah's role, and I am not trying to brag about  myself here because Hizballah's decision is a collective  decision and Hizballah is not led by a single individual, is a  thorough and realistic one that takes into consideration all  circumstances and developments and can face the challenges.    As far as the region is concerned, of course Hizballah has  reached the point of providing a special moral influence.  Through the contacts we make abroad we realize that to the  Muslims in the world Hizballah has represented the nation's  symbol of confrontation against Israel in the past 10 years.  Unlike their regimes, the Muslim peoples are siding with this  confrontation. The party that has reflected the ambitions,  aspirations, and convictions of these peoples in the past 10  years is Hizballah. Now we have partners, and we are happy  about this partnership. The Islamic movement in Palestine has  surfaced and become a major and important symbol in the heart of  the nation. The fact is that when we see an Islamic movement,  whether in Palestine or elsewhere, that has adopted the jihad  course and made considerable progress in it we do not feel sad,  even if we were to become in the second or third place. On the  contrary; we actually would see this as a fulfillment of the  goals we set out to achieve. This is because we are not  partisans. We have an organization and formations, but we do  not operate with a partisan mentality. We believe that our  movement is not serving the goals of a party but of a whole  nation. Thus, we extend the hand of help and solidarity to any  faction in this nation, even if we differed or if it were not  Islamic. We will cooperate with any national or pan-Arab  faction with a creed different from our Islamic creed or that  differs from our political line in some details but at the same  time is ready to confront Israel and the U.S.-Israeli plans of  hegemony in the same way we would cooperate with any Islamic  movement. This is because we are aware of this priority and we  are sincere to this nation.    Accordingly, and as part of the optimism of the Islamic  movement throughout the region, I am optimistic about the future  of Hizballah. In any case, we believe in the Koranic promise.  All expectations, prophecies, analyses, and facts indicate that  our Islamic world, whether the major powers and the ruling  regimes in our countries like it or not, is the future for the  Islamic movement. I and many others from our generation may not  be alive then, but undoubtedly the future will be for this  movement and its various and successive generations that will  take charge of our Islamic world's affairs. The Islamic future  in this region is no longer a choice, but a destiny and a  predetermined heavenly will, and nobody, God willing, will be  able to change this.</p>

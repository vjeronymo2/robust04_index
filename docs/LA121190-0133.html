			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLOODHOUND LEADS DEPUTIES TO BANK ROBBERY SUSPECT  </P> <P> A man who allegedly robbed a bank Monday afternoon was tracked down three hours  later by a bloodhound and arrested, sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> According to Sheriff's Lt. Larry Richey, Mikaele Luamanuvae, 31, of El Toro  walked into the Bank of America branch at 22491 El Toro Road at about 3:30  p.m., handed a note to a teller demanding money and fled with $1,040.  </P> <P> No weapons were involved.  </P> <P> Three hours later, a sheriff's helicopter located a brown 1977 Toyota believed  used in the robbery at the Irvine Medical Center on Sand Canyon Avenue, Richey  said. Deputies found the money in the car and then summoned Reserve Sgt. Larry  Harris and his bloodhound Duchess.  </P> <P> "The dog took a good sniff of the vehicle, went out of the parking lot, went  into the medical center, went up three flights of stairs and went directly to  the suspect," Richey said. "And when the suspect saw the dog and the officers,  he gave himself up."  </P> <P> Luamanuvae was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of robbery, Richey  said, adding that it was not clear why the suspect had gone to the medical  center.  </P></p>

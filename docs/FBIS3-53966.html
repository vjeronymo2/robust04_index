			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Outside the Labor Bureau  meeting, Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, who is close to  Rabin, said if al-Asad would do what the late Egyptian President  al-Sadat did, 16 years ago, he might discover that Israel is  willing to withdraw completely from the Golan Heights.    [Begin Ben-Eli'ezer recording] With all the problems that  we had with Egypt, once President al-Sadat came to the  parliament of Israel and made his declaration -- once he stated:  No more war. -- I think he did 70 percent out of the problem  [as heard]. He had convinced the Israeli people. If President  al-Asad will do the same, maybe. He might be surprised and get  maybe the same thing. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

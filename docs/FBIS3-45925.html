			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 24 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese  leader called for strict control over population growth, while  concentrating on development of the national economy.    Peng Peiyun, State Councillor and minister in charge of the  State Family Planning Commission, made the remark at a seminar  on China's population closed here on Sunday [23 January] in  Beijing.    Peng said that it is prerequisite to continue to carry out  the policy of birth control in order to achieve China's  strategic goal in the future.    The family planning work must be handled in a climate of  social and economic development, Peng said, adding it must also  be done well to create a good environment of population for the  country's socialist modernization drive.    Due to a large population base, China is still facing a grim  situation in birth control, she said, adding that it is urgent  to build a family planning structure in line with China's  socialist market economic structure.    Peng continued that close attention should be paid to the  following aspects in dealing with national family planning:    -- what is most important is to redouble efforts to keep the  birth rate down, which still remains high in some areas in the  country.    The development of family planning is uneven across the  country and outdated beliefs regarding birth still exist among  sectors of the Chinese population, Peng said.    In addition, new problems concerning the birth control may  also occur in the course of establishing a socialist market  economy.    As a result, China's family planning will take long-term and  hard work and should not be neglected at any time.    -- forceful measures should be taken to provide for better  births and better education, in a bid to improve the quality of  the population, Peng urged.    Of the more than 50 million disabled in the country, more  than 10 million were born with deformities, and there are now  4.17 million disabled children under 14 with birth defects,  accounting for more than half of all disabled children, Peng  said.    Of every one thousand newborns, 13 suffer from birth  defects.    Also, over 400 million people are living in iodine-deficient  areas, which could cause the birth of hundreds of thousands of  mentally retarded children by the year 2000 if the problem was  not solved.    She added that there are also 180 million illiterates or  semi- literates in the country presently.    -- efforts should be made to promote the establishment of  pensions and life insurance.    Peng warned that China is also facing the problem of aging  due to a decline in the birth rate and a rise in average life  expectancy of the population.    -- equality between men and women should also be advocated  and measures taken to protect women's rights and interests and  lift their social status.    Peng added that this is crucial because females have fallen  behind males in China's current sex proportion.    -- last but not least, Peng said, urbanization must also be  advanced in a planned way.    She added that the surplus rural labor force should be  encouraged to flow in an orderly manner between regions and to  transfer to job vacancies in non-farm sectors, as the country's  urbanization has been quickened since the policy of reform and  opening was instituted in the late 1970s.    Peng concluded that this is also an important issue that has  close bearing on China's economic development and social  stability.</p>

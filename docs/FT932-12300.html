			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Polly Peck's auditors to face writ for damages THE ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck, the fruit to electronics group owned by Mr Asil Nadir, are to proceed with legal action against the company's auditors. Mr Christopher Morris, joint administrator and a partner in accountants Touche Ross, confirmed yesterday that action against Stoy Hayward, Polly Peck's auditors from 1980 till the company entered administration in October 1990, was 'inevitable'. Mr Morris said: 'We believe there is a significant degree of liability attaching to the auditors for not qualifying the accounts of Polly Peck, which have now transpired to be grossly inaccurate.' Accountants at Ernst &amp; Young have recently completed a report commissioned by the administrators which examines the conduct of the company's auditors. The writ is likely to claim damages and interest against losses to creditors, but may not claim a specific sum. Mr Morris said total deficiencies during Polly Peck's corporate life were Pounds 371m. Mr Adrian Martin, managing partner of Stoy Hayward, said: 'Stoy Hayward has not been served with a writ and is unaware of any specific claims from the administrators. Any litigation arising from this case will be strenuously defended.' Mr Morris lodged a writ in December 1991 which claims damages from Stoy Hayward for 'negligence and/or breach of contractual duty of care' in the preparation of Polly Peck's accounts for the year to December 20 1985. He said that writ was still 'live'.</p>

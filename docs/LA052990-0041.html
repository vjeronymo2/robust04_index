			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICK DU BROW: CHANNELS THAT VIEWERS WATCH THE MOST -- AND THE LEAST  </P> <P> TV or not TV . . .  </P> <P> FACTS OF LIFE: In the new vast array of TV channels, what do viewers watch most  -- and least? Well, the ratings folks have a little list.  </P> <P> The old networks, of course, lead the way in prime time with 65% of TV homes in  the season that started last September -- NBC, 24%; ABC, 21%, and CBS, 20%.  </P> <P> But then. . . .  </P> <P> Independent stations, cable, pay TV, superstations, the new Fox network and PBS  now are drawing 44% of the households.  </P> <P> Yes, we know, 65% plus 44% adds up to more than 100% of TV homes. How come?  </P> <P> "Multiple-set households are factored in," says a network spokesman.  </P> <P> PBS supporters should be most concerned because that most civilized of TV  networks is on the low end of the numbers.  </P> <P> Which is why Bill Kobin, president of KCET Channel 28, has been warning that  cable networks such as the Discovery channel and Arts &amp; Entertainment are  wooing away PBS viewers with similar shows -- and that public TV desperately  needs new, innovative programs to stay in business.  </P> <P> Here in Los Angeles, KCET has to go increasingly local and reflect both the  city and Southern California to separate itself from cable and develop a  distinct image. Or else . . . well, let's not even think about it.  </P> <P> SILVER LINING: What an irony that youth-crazy NBC's three most successful 8  p.m. series -- the shows that presumably attract viewers for the night -- are  held together by Robert Stack, 71 ("Unsolved Mysteries"), Andy Griffith, 63  ("Matlock"), and Bill Cosby, 52 ("The Cosby Show").  </P> <P> SHOWCASE: Glenda Jackson guest-stars Saturday on Carol Burnett's "Carol &amp;  Company," playing a pop psychology radio host who doesn't give a hoot about her  audience and who is more interested in plugging her new book. Burnett's  successful new NBC comedy anthology recently offered a show with Robert  Guillaume, L.A.'s new "Phantom of the Opera."  </P> <P> FOX TROT: If imitation is the sincerest form of television, then CBS' "48  Hours" should send a thank-you note to Fox's "Cops." Not long ago, "48 Hours"  scheduled a piece about the public and private lives of Florida police -- the  original basis of the "Cops" series. Now, this Thursday, "48 Hours" goes to  Moscow to follow Soviet police as they go about their work. "Cops" has already  been there and done the same thing.  </P> <P> HURRICANE WILLARD: Weatherman Willard Scott of the troubled "Today" show  addresses the Hollywood Radio and Television Society on June 6. Scott, as you  recall, was an object of anchor Bryant Gumbel's criticism in a memo that leaked  out last year. That was the start of an ongoing "Today" furor that now has seen  the ratings nose-dive. I like silly old Willard because he plays straight to  the heartland -- no excuses.  </P> <P> OVERKILL: How many times is the American Movie Classics channel going to play  "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" (William Holden, Jennifer Jones)? It's been  absurd. And, oh yes, those long, repetitive coming attractions on AMC -- and  those press-release-type mini-bios of Hollywood stars like John Wayne and Jimmy  Stewart -- aren't going to help the channel's credibility. Just put the films  on -- they speak for themselves.  </P> <P> OUT OF THE BLUE: I wouldn't mind, though, if AMC ran "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"  again. Never realized what a really wonderful film it is -- James Dunn as the  alcoholic but loving father, Dorothy McGuire as the strong-willed but  not-quite-understanding mother, Peggy Ann Garner simply spectacular as the  child determined to better herself. Caught it right after the "Twin Peaks"  finale. A night to remember.  </P> <P> CHERRY PIE: Say, what about rerunning "Twin Peaks" starting in August and then  climaxing things with a big two-hour season opener, directed by David Lynch,  that solves Laura's murder and frees the series for new directions?  </P> <P> COMEUPPANCE: Oh how smart we thought we were last week. "Anybody want to buy a  network?" we asked. "Anybody want to buy the Brooklyn Bridge?" Well, we have  been nailed. An ABC employee called to remind us that when Capital Cities  bought the network in 1985, a new combined share of stock was worth about $220.  Cap Cities closed Friday at nearly $600 a share.  </P> <P> REMEMBRANCE: KSCI Channel 18, which specializes in programming for Asian  Americans, marks China's student revolt of a year ago with a one-hour Monday  documentary, "The Ceaseless Fire," which airs at 10:30 p.m. It'll be followed  by the two-hour "Concert for Democracy in China," which features performing  artists and was taped in San Francisco.  </P> <P> ON TAP: Sharon Gless' planned new CBS series, "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill,"  stars the former "Cagney &amp; Lacey" headliner as a recently divorced public  defender. Producer Barney Rosenzweig, who set up shop in a warehouse near  downtown to shoot "Cagney &amp; Lacey," is doing the same for the new show in a  building that's a short hop from City Hall.  </P> <P> BIRTHDAY: Cable News Network's 10th anniversary Friday will also be the  publication date of the book "CNN: The Inside Story" by Hank Whittemore. CNN  founder Ted Turner recalls that the network was such a shoestring operation  when it started that "our L.A. bureau didn't get hooked up, I don't think,  until about five minutes before we were on the air."  </P> <P> ROOTS: There'll be a Steven Spielberg Exhibition Gallery in the new Museum of  Broadcasting building in New York. Spielberg, who began in TV directing such  shows as "Columbo," "Duel" and "Night Gallery," pledged $1 million to the  museum.  </P> <P> BEING THERE: "I like a wine that fights back," observed Jonathan Steed (Patrick  Macnee) in "The Avengers."  </P> <P> Say good night, Gracie. . . .  </P></p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Observer: Artistic licence Dyed-in-the-wool opponents of the Channel Tunnel will be happy to hear that there will soon be one less reason to use it. From September, it will no longer be necessary to cross into former enemy territory to inspect the Bayeux tapestry because a rather good replica resides much closer to home in Reading. The Museum of Reading, which is soon to be reopened, is planning to show off a 230ft Victorian replica of the famous eleventh-century tapestry recording William the Conqueror's invasion of England in 1066. The replica, presented to Reading a century ago by a patriotic alderman, is said to be a remarkably good copy. However, it suffers from one defect. The Victorian embroideresses made the naked male warrior put on a pair of trunks and an overly-endowed stallion was cut down to size and appears as a gelding. If you want to see all the naughty bits, a trip across the channel will still be necessary.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The second round of negotiations between  representatives of the government and a delegation that includes  15 representatives of trade union confederations, led by Bogdan  Hosu, president of the Cartel Alfa confederation, Victor  Ciorbea, on behalf of CNSRL [National Confederation of Romania's  Free Trade Unions] Fratia, and Cornel Popescu, on behalf of the  National Trade Union Block [BNS] are continuing at Victoria  Palace at the time of our broadcast. The talks started about  three hours ago.    The government is represented by State Ministers Dan Mircea  Popescu and Florin Georgescu, Secretary General of the  Government Victor Hrebenciuc, head of the office in charge of  trade union- employers' association relations, Octavian  Partenie, counselors, and experts.    The sides resumed discussions that were interrupted last  night on ways to solve the four claims put forward by trade  unions, claims that triggered the latest protest actions and  trade union rallies.    There are different views on the first claim, which refers  to  the minimum 50 percent increase of salaries necessary to  stimulate the purchase power and to give up the notion of  maximum admissible fund.    Minister of Finance Florin Georgescu said that this increase  should be connected first of all to the increase of production.    The claim on supplementing the education budget by 500  billion lei -- which in fact is a sub-point of the first claim  -- was also left unsolved, due to the fact that the minister of  finance stressed that in accordance with the current financial  possibilities, the budget for education will be supplemented by  about 30 billion lei.    As far as the second claim is concerned, that is to step up  the act of signing collective labor contracts at all levels and  of offering guarantee that these contracts are respected, the  representatives of government said that they will do all they  can to urge the employers' association to resume negotiations  with trade unions on this issue. However, the government  representatives affirmed that everything depends on the  agreement of both sides.    In this context, the representatives of trade unions called  on the government to draft a normative act that would establish  the deadline for the signing of the collective labor contract.  The sides agreed that this aspect should be discussed when the  current law on collective labor contract is modified.    At this hour the sides are holding discussions on the third  claim, that is, the recognition of legislation for working  groups that was drafted after the 1989 December revolution. In  this respect, Minister of State Mircea Dan Popescu said that  until a new law is drafted, activity will be carried out  according to the laws currently in force, our correspondent  Silvia Ilies informed us.    A calm atmosphere is currently prevailing in Victoria  Square.  The demonstrators are waiting for the results of the  negotiations that are currently taking place, our correspondent  also informed us.</p>

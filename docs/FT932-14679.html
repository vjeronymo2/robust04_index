			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Man In The News: A narrowing of horizons - Rocco Forte Mr Rocco Forte is in Warsaw today where Lady Thatcher is due to reopen the 92-year old Bristol Hotel. The Bristol, a joint venture between Forte and the Polish tourist agency, is a striking demonstration of the UK hotel and restaurant group's drive to expand outside its home market. Or so Mr Forte might have said a few months ago - expanding in continental Europe has been Forte's priority for years. However, when this Thursday he presented his first full-year results since taking over from his father as chairman, the message was markedly different. Forte is to sell Pounds 500m of assets over the next few years. It is scaling back its US operation. The Continent will have to wait. Forte's pre-tax profit of Pounds 72m before exceptional and property items was only slightly up on last year's Pounds 70m, itself well down on the year before. The value of the property portfolio has fallen by Pounds 344m. Gearing has risen to 48 per cent. There are few signs of recovery. The dividend was cut for the first time in 20 years. These are burdens piled on top of the one Mr Forte has faced ever since, as a 16-year old, he spent his holidays working in the cellars of the company's Cafe Royal: that no-one is prepared to judge the son of Lord Forte, Britain's greatest hotelier, in the way they would any other businessman. 'Poor old Rocco is trapped,' a City analyst once said. 'If things go well, it's because of the company his father built up. If they go badly, it's because Rocco cocked it up.' It is an observation with which Forte insiders grimly concur. Investors criticised the group's announcement last October that Mr Forte was adding the title of chairman to the position of chief executive he had held since 1983. Unease was heightened by the news that the 84-year old Lord Forte was remaining on the board as president  - suggesting that little would change. The appointment of three new non-executive directors - Sir Anthony Tennant, former chairman of Guinness, Sir Paul Girolami, chairman of Glaxo, and Mr Alan Wheatley, departing chairman of 3i - has only partly mollified critics. The question of bringing in outside senior directors provokes an uncharacteristically fiery response from the mild-mannered Mr Forte. He says: 'There are a lot of people who would want to be on the Forte board. But I went out and chose some high-powered and independent individuals.' The critics accept that the three new non-executives are not pushovers. They concede, too, that their appointment has changed the Forte board's balance of power. 'These are Rocco's choices rather than his father's colleagues,' says one. Several close observers note that Mr Forte seems more confident since becoming chairman. Other board changes are likely to follow. Mr Forte says that Sir Anthony, who is now Forte's deputy chairman, plays an active role in the group. But when asked how often he sees Sir Anthony, it turns out to be once a week at most. City critics still want Forte to appoint a strong managing director. Mr Forte says the group will appoint one eventually, but that it will not be a complete outsider. He also makes it evident it will not be the sort of person who might shrug him aside. 'It would have to be someone who has worked in the business for at least a year,' he says. 'Someone from outside might have very different views. We don't want to have rows. You've got to have harmony. The idea that you can have two equally powerful men is complete nonsense. You either have a strong chairman or a strong chief executive.' The Forte group knows all about rows. The struggle between Lord Forte and Lord Crowther, chairman of Trust Houses, rocked the City when the two groups merged in the 1970s. The 1980s row was with the Savoy group. Mr Forte says he does not intend to repeat that one either. An acrimonious takeover battle left Forte with a majority of Savoy shares but a minority of votes, after which the two sides declared a five-year truce which ends in November next year. Mr Forte has not hidden his desire to gain control of the Savoy, but he says he wants the two sides to reach a civilised agreement when the five years are up. 'I think the way towards a solution is on a discussed basis - not having a slanging match and punching each other in public.' Controlling the Savoy group would give Forte an internationally-renowned name under which it could group its luxury hotels. Despite owning the Ritz in Madrid, the Plaza Athenee in New York and the George V in Paris, Forte has never entirely shaken its image as, in the sneering words of the then embattled Savoy management, 'a vast combine which, among other things, runs service stations on the main arterial roads.' In the meantime, Mr Forte has enough to contend with. Last year, the group bought the Relais motorway restaurant business in France and announced a joint venture with Agip, the Italian state petrol company, to manage 18 hotels in Italy. It sold its Gardner Merchant catering company, but the exceptional profit of Pounds 257m was outweighed by the collapse in property values. In the US, 15 Travelodge hotels are for sale. Mr Forte says the remaining US motels are likely to be floated separately. He still wants to sell Forte's in-flight catering business. Even the core hotels business might be reduced. Mr Forte says 70 per cent of hotel profits comes from just 40 establishments. The group this week offered shareholders an enhanced scrip dividend as an alternative to the reduced cash payout. Mr Forte says the group will only consider a rights issue if it has a large purchase in mind. With the City still stunned by the financial crisis at the rival Queens Moat Houses, the hotel sector is not currently an investors' favourite. By the time the hotel business follows the rest of the UK economy into recovery, memories of Queens Moat may have faded a little. If he can reduce the group's debt, Mr Forte might then be able to fashion a new, more internationally-based business. Until then, he will have to make the most of what he has inherited.</p>

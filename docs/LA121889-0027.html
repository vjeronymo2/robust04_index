			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHUTIST DIES IN NIGHTTIME JUMP FROM OFFICE TOWER  </P> <P> A veteran sky diver was fatally injured early Sunday in what police said was an  illegal parachute jump from atop a Century City high-rise office building. He  slammed into the structure at least three times on his plunge.  </P> <P> Police identified the victim as Richard Allen Pedley Sr., 57, of Walnut. He was  among a group of parachutists who jumped from the building at about 1:30 a.m.,  Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> Pedley fell 12 to 15 stories before landing on another structure adjacent to  the 40-story building, which was under construction at 1999 Avenue of the  Stars, Police Sgt. Lee Bradford said. Pedley was flown to UCLA Medical Center,  where he died later.  </P> <P> Apparently three other parachutists made the jump successfully before Pedley's  fatal jump, police said.  </P> <P> Pedley's son, Richard Allen Pedley Jr., 22, also of Walnut, not one of the  parachutists, was arrested by a security guard and booked at the West Los  Angeles Division station for investigation of trespassing. He was released on  his own recognizance, Lt. Lee Carter said.  </P> <P> The victim was well known in sky diving circles, but had relatively little  experience with the nuances of jumping from fixed objects.  </P> <P> "Pedley had thousands of jumps from from aircraft," said Jean K. Boenish,  executive Director of BASE, a base-jumping parachutists' group which -- unlike  sky diving groups -- includes chutists who leap from fixed objects such as  bridges, skyscrapers, antenna towers and towering earth formations.  </P> <P> Boenish, 29, of Hawthorne, said that Pedley, although affiliated with her  group, was "new to base jumping," with less than 10 jumps from fixed objects.  </P> <P> Boenish said she was briefed Sunday on the fatal accident by individuals  familiar with what occurred at the Century City site. Pedley's parachute, she  said, "opened backwards," swinging the victim into the building, instead of  away from it.  </P> <P> "I know he hit it (the structure) at least three times," she said. "It was more  than likely a packing error."  </P> <P> The three other parachutists who preceded Pedley came to his aid and then  called for medical help, she said. They were gone by the time police arrived.  </P> <P> Pedley's son, who could not be reached for comment, did not parachute off the  building, Boenish said.  </P> <P> "I've known (the senior) Pedley for about 10 years," she said. "We used to jump  together in Perris," a Riverside County community popular with sky divers. "He  and I were in the same field of free-fall photography."  </P> <P> In 1981, Boenish's husband, Carl, an internationally famous sky-diving  photographer, successfully jumped off a 54-story building in downtown Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Three years later, Carl Boenish was killed, at the age of 43, in a parachute  jump from a 5,600-foot Norwegian peak. Two days after his fatal accident, his  wife, Jean, scaled the same mountain and made a successful jump.  </P> <P> Most jumps off buildings and other fixed structures generally go unreported in  the media, Jean Boenish said.  </P> <P> "There are about 100 a year in Los Angeles. They're done with frequency," she  said.  </P> <P> Police said it is a misdemeanor to jump from buildings in Los Angeles without a  permit.  </P> <P> People who jump from buildings, Boenish said, "try to keep as low a profile as  possible. That's why it's usually done at night."  </P></p>

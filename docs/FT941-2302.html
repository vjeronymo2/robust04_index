			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Matrix prosecutor attacks Whitehall secrecy The chief prosecutor in the Matrix Churchill trial yesterday launched a scathing attack on the conduct of Whitehall in the case at the heart of the arms-for-Iraq affair. Mr Alan Moses QC told the Scott inquiry that if he had been told by officials about the extent of their knowledge of British arms-related exports to Iraq he would not have gone ahead with the case. He said: 'The people concerned should have told the prosecution that their position was: 'We knew as near as dammit that it was going to military production'.' Mr Moses described the difficulties he faced in gathering relevant Whitehall documents and in obtaining truthful witness statements. The inquiry heard that among the documents Mr Moses was not shown before the trial was an intelligence report in October 1989 from GCHQ, the government listening post. This linked Matrix Churchill to Iraq's military build-up. Mr Moses said this had been the 'most disturbing omission' as it seemed to him the 'clearest possible indication of (government) knowledge' and thus supported the case for the defence in the Matrix Churchill trial. 'I can't understand why on earth I didn't know about it. I can't say I would have gone on with the prosecution had I known,' he said. He said that in preparing his case he had not been shown documents relating to the minutes of the Restricted Enforcement Unit, a secretive Whitehall department, where Customs, intelligence officers, and officials exchanged information about arms exports to Iraq. Mr Moses described the obfuscation he encountered at the heart of Whitehall on the eve of the trial. He had been given access to key files held by the cabinet office only on the Friday before the Monday on which the trial had been due to start. The files include many which the Scott inquiry has been examining. He and a senior Customs investigator had been led into the office of Sir Robin Butler, the head of the civil service, and left alone at a table with badly identified and unsorted files. Mr Moses said: 'I was furious . . . what I should have done was walk out and say . . . these are not the circumstances, on the last working day before a trial, for me to look at anything sensibly.' Mr Moses criticised by name only Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister, for being responsible for the eventual collapse of the trial. He said Mr Clark had given evidence at the trial which was inconsistent with what he had told Customs officials in pre-trial witness statements. But he said government lawyers had used 'red pens' on draft witness statements by civil servants, with the apparent intention of preventing wider knowledge of 'what had been said to whom'. Mr Moses said he understood officials at the Department of Trade and Industry had been unhappy with the trial because 'it was going to expose all the defects in the system'. Customs, said Mr Moses, had been both determined to make up for the 'laxity' of the DTI and to reassert its independence from government interference. Mr Moses admitted that as prosecuting counsel he bore some responsibility for not having made a greater effort in securing the necessary information before the trial. Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, came under renewed pressure from Labour MPs in the Commons yesterday to explain the decisions he had taken over the Matrix Churchill trial, James Blitz writes. He said that he was 'looking forward' to giving evidence to the inquiry on Thursday, when MPs would hear his record of events.</p>

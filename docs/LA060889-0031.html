			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: COFFEE GROUNDS REMOVE ODOR FROM REFRIGERATOR  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I was away on vacation for two weeks and when I returned, I  discovered that I had left a package of meat in the refrigerator. It was awful.  I thought I'd never remove the terrible odor.  </P> <P> I tried washing the inside with baking soda, but that didn't help. Then a  friend said the same thing happened to her and she used fresh ground coffee to  remove the odor. All I did was put some coffee grounds on a couple of paper  plates and set them on two shelves. I couldn't believe how the odor disappeared  after two or three days.  </P> <P>  -- MRS. W., Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I was at a friend's home last week having dinner when I  accidentally got a few drops of salad oil on my blouse. Automatically I ran to  the sink ready to put cold water on it when my friend stopped me.  </P> <P> She handed me some baby powder and told me to put some over the spots. It was  amazing how the powder got thick as the oil absorbed. I wiped it off and  applied more and let it set awhile. The spots disappeared when I wiped the  powder away. I washed the blouse the next day and there wasn't a sign of an oil  stain.  </P> <P>  -- LOUISE, Houston  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My family enjoys pasta, but I just can't seem to make it right.  It's sticky and my family doesn't like it. What can I do to prevent it from  sticking all together?  </P> <P>  -- A READER, New York City  </P> <P> DEAR READER: All you need to do is put about a tablespoon of oil (olive oil  works well) in the water before boiling the pasta.  </P> <P> When the pasta is ready, drain and rinse it if you prefer with cool water. This  should make your pasta sticky-free, and your family will enjoy it.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have found a new way of getting my house fresher smelling when  I vacuum. I just get a couple of cotton balls, spray them with my favorite  cologne or perfume and put them in a new vacuum-cleaner bag.  </P> <P> As I vacuum, my house smells terrific. No more musty odors.  </P> <P>  -- LORIE, Birmingham, Ala.  </P> <P> DEAR READERS: Picnic and barbecue time is fast approaching; in fact, it's  already here for a lot of us. A leisurely weekend outdoors is always great, but  you can still enjoy cooking out even when time is short by using a few  time-savers. One of the best is your microwave oven.  </P> <P> Start the meat in your microwave. Cook it about three-quarters of the way done,  then finish it on the barbecue. The microwaving will help the meat stay moist  as well as getting it done quicker, and finishing it on the grill will give it  that great barbecue flavor.  </P> <P> Vegetables can also be cooked in the microwave, then reheated on the grill.  Bake potatoes, corn on the cob and onions according to directions for your  microwave oven, then wrap them in foil and put them into the coals for 10-15  minutes to reheat.  </P> <P> These shortcuts can be used even when the barbecue is at a picnic site rather  than in the back yard. Start the foods in the microwave oven, then chill them  thoroughly. Be sure to keep them well chilled until you finish cooking or  reheating them.  </P> <P> Use your barbecue to cook ahead too. Grill extra steaks, chops, hamburgers and  chicken, then wrap and freeze quickly. Next time you're hungry for barbecue but  don't have time to fire up the grill, just pop the frozen pieces in your  microwave oven to defrost and heat for a fast, easy picnic without any fuss.  </P> <P> Spring and summer are just too nice to waste, so take advantage of all the  tricks you can to get out and enjoy yourself.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I like natural peanut butter with no sugar or additives, but the  oil separates and comes to the top. This makes it difficult to stir without  sloshing the oil out of the jar.  </P> <P> My husband showed me how to solve this problem. He stored it upside down for a  couple of days before opening it. The oil rises to the top, which is really the  bottom of the jar. When you turn it right-side-up, the oil is on the bottom and  you can stir it without a mess.  </P> <P>  -- A READER, Fairfield, Calif.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Your directions for seasoning a cutting board were certainly a  great help. I hope you can also give me directions for seasoning a new iron  skillet before using it for the first time.  </P> <P>  -- YVONNE, Garden Grove, Calif.  </P> <P> DEAR YVONNE: It may already be seasoned. Most cast-iron utensils sold now are  preseasoned, so no further treatment is necessary. Just wash thoroughly and  dry. Be sure to lightly grease any cast-iron piece before storing.  </P> <P> If it does need to be seasoned, use solid, unsalted shortening to coat the  inside of the skillet. Place the skillet in the oven on a baking sheet and  leave it for a couple of hours at about 250 degrees. Keep the shortening evenly  distributed by swishing it around every so often with paper towels. Let the  skillet cool, then wipe off any excess shortening. It should be ready for some  great cooking.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: It seems that I am forever on a diet. One tip that helps me a lot  is this. When I get home from work, I prepare supper and then eat. When I am  finished eating, I prepare my supper for the next night. This keeps my nibbling  to a minimum, since I'm already full.  </P> <P> The added plus is when I arrive home the next evening, my supper can be popped  into the microwave and ready in a few minutes.  </P> <P>  -- PAM, Bath, Penn.  </P></p>

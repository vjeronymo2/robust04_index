			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / MPs warn on rising cost of US missiles Britain should speed up its purchases of US nuclear missiles for Trident submarines because the cost may rise sharply, the Commons defence committee warned yesterday. The government has so far ordered 44 of the missiles and has said it will buy about 24 more over the next four to six years. The committee, in a report on the Trident programme, warns that the unit cost of missiles sold to Britain will rise sharply if the US administration scales back its own procurement of the missile. While the government had already increased its estimate for missile costs by Pounds 80m, this could prove insufficient if this summer's US Budget calls for a reduction of missile purchases by the US Navy, and the price consequently rises. 'We fear that future (price) rises may far exceed provision, and consider that the Ministry of Defence must be prepared to complete its missile procurement programme as soon as possible to avoid such cost penalties,' the report said. The committee welcomes the fact that estimates for the total cost of the Trident programme have inched downwards for the eighth successive year - by Pounds 24m to Pounds 9.94bn. Some Pounds 6.9bn of this money had been spent by November last year. However, it expresses disappointment at the low share of sub-contracting work being awarded to British groups. As of last autumn, UK companies had won only Pounds 207m worth of business as a result of the Trident programme, while US groups had obtained orders worth Pounds 3.5bn from Britain. The committee says many elements in the Trident programme remain subject to sharp fluctuations in cost, and warns that there must be 'no lessening of strict control over all areas'.

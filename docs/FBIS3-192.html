			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kampala, March 2 (AFP) -- Rebels have freed a  kidnapped Spanish priest but seriously wounded an unspecified  number of travellers in an attack in northern Uganda, a church  source and press reports said here Wednesday [2 March].    The rebels, led by Joseph Kony, on Monday ambushed a vehicle  operating a daily passenger service between Lira and Kitgum, at  Ludel and subsequently set it ablaze, witnesses said according  to the NEW VISION newspaper. Some of the passengers, who were  badly injured, said a group of about 50 rebels jumped on to the  road ahead of the vehicle and opened fire, shooting sporadically  both in the air and at the vehicle.    The vehicle's driver was hit in the arm by two bullets while  the conductor got a hard kick on the knee from one of the rebels  who had taken cover in the nearby bush.    Earlier in the day, the rebels abducted and held hostage two  Roman Catholic missionaries, Spaniard Luigi Paolino Aguilera and  another unnamed black priest, together with two nuns from Lira's  Paranga mission, reports said.    The papal envoy here, reached by telephone by the Italian  news agency ANSA, said Father Aguilera had returned safe and  sound to the Kitgum mission, 380 kilometres (about 240 miles)  north of Kampala.    Aguilera, a member of the Comboniani order based at Padua in  northern Italy, was held by the rebels for just one day, but  subjected to five hours of "indoctrination" in the bush before  he was set free, ANSA reported. The Italian news agency said  the two nuns were still in the hands of the rebels of the Lord's  Resistance Army (LRA), but made no mention of the black priest  also said to have been abducted.    Other reports here said that at least one of the priests had  been released, but a Ugandan Catholic Secretariat spokesman  could not be reached for further details.    NEW VISION said two priests and two nuns were held hostage  by  the rebels apparently for use as human shields in the event of  an attack by government forces.    Security sources in Lira said on Wednesday that government  troops based at Pajule, 15 kilometres (12 miles) from the scene  of the incident, moved swiftly in pursuit, but arrived late and  only managed to find the vehicle in which the priests had been  travelling.    The attack on travellers is seen by the people in the area  as  an attempt by the rebels to make their presence in the region  felt, a gesture that would form the basis for future  negotiations with the government.    The LRA, a remnant of the voodoo priestess Alice Lakwena's  Holy Spirit Army, has stepped up attacks on government forces  since February 19, after negotiations with the government broke  down.    On February 13, President Yoweri Museveni gave the rebels  one  week to surrender or else face the might of the Ugandan army.</p>

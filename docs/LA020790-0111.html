			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Hallmark to Buy Back Network Debt: Hallmark Cards Inc. began an offer to buy  back at a discount some $270 million in debt securities used to finance  Univision Holdings Inc. under a plan to ease the debt burden on the  unprofitable Spanish-language broadcaster.  </P> <P> The action by Kansas City, Mo.-based Hallmark, which owns a 63.5% stake in  Univision, followed Univision's failure to make $10 million in interest  payments due last week on some of the debt. Univision, the nation's largest  Spanish-language communications company, said it missed the payments because of  insufficient cash flow.  </P></p>

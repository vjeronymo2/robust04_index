			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: Clinton wins respite from the clamour The Nato ultimatum buys President Bill Clinton some immediate relief from public pressure, but this may grow again if Bosnian Serbs do not withdraw their guns from around Sarajevo or if other Moslem enclaves under UN protection come under renewed fire. The drumbeat for action had been growing louder in Washington this week in Congress, in opinion polls and in the media. But, as the Congressional Democratic leadership reported after a meeting with Mr Clinton late on Wednesday, the general caveat is that the US should not act alone and should not insert its own troops to enforce a settlement. Reflecting this, initial editorial comment yesterday about the new Nato approach was by no means favourable. Both the New York Times and the Washington Post said that air strikes, while 'emotionally satisfying' as retaliation against the Serbs, would not in themselves induce a settlement. The Times argued again that 'the surest way out in the long term' was to lift the UN arms embargo to permit Bosnia 'to defend itself.' Its columnist, William Safire, positing the choice of 'intervention now or disaster later,' wrote that 'peace in the Balkans will come not when the Moslems agree to be good victims, nor when Christians and Moslems 'get tired of killing each other,' in Clinton's callous phrase, but when a good ol' European balance of power is achieved'. The Post, echoing an argument used often this week by Mr Laurence Eagleburger, the former secretary of state and a Balkan expert, wrote that 'it is American credibility that concerns us most,' a problem that would only be compounded if this latest Nato threat turned out to be 'empty'. It concluded: 'More talk policy is an obscenity. If the government isn't conducting a serious policy, it should shut up.' Divisions inside the administration still persist on what to do if the Nato ultimatum is ignored. Mr William Perry, like most secretaries of defence, is cautious on the effectiveness of limited military force, while Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, prefers diplomatic solutions. An additional constraining force remains Russia, vehemently critical of the air strike option. An indication of US concerns came from Mr Clinton on Wednesday night, when he said he had tried to talk to President Yeltsin by telephone but had been thwarted by technical problems. The higher profile now given by the US to negotiations is both a nod in the direction of Moscow and, according to the state department, a response to direct appeals from Europe, led on this occasion by France. Nevertheless, it does involve some shift in US tactics. Having repeatedly said that it would be wrong to exert undue pressure on the Moslems, because they have been the principal victims, the administration has now undertaken precisely this mission, hedged about as it is with qualifications about concessions that can reasonably be expected from the Bosnian government. The current US diplomatic effort, according to Mr Clinton, is to determine Bosnia's 'legitimate bedrock requirements' for a peace settlement. Yesterday, Mr Mohammed Sacirbey, the UN ambassador, defined these as the creation of 'a viable state,' the return of refugees 'to homes from which they have been ethnically cleansed,' and access to the Adriatic Sea, now under negotiation with Croatia. Mr Clinton himself has been conspicuously cautious in his own prognoses. 'There is no such thing as a risk-free air operation,' he said and no guarantee that the warring parties can be brought to a settlement. On both scores, any respite he has obtained may be brief.</p>

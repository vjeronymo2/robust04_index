			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Venture capitalists wary of burns Mention venture capitalists to entrepreneurs who are trying to raise start-up or early stage development funds and the hostility is often palpable. Their assessment that venture capital companies have 'stopped backing ventures or taking risks' is broadly correct. There are some notable exceptions, such as 3i and some houses that specialise in high-tech investment. But most venture capital companies have chosen not to back early stage companies since they were badly burned by high failure rates in the 1980s. With banks also increasingly reluctant to provide equity, there is little option for many entrepreneurs in the UK but to turn to business angels, the businessmen and women who bestow money and wisdom on companies in their early stages of development. This week we launch an occasional series on angels, the businesses they back and the marriage brokers that bring them together. Today we profile Sir Peter Thompson, former chairman of the National Freight Corporation, one of the most successful management and employee-backed buy-outs, and an active investor in private companies.</p>

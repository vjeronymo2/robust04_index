			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (23): Them and us together UNION BUSINESS: TRADE UNION ORGANISATION AND FINANCIAL REFORM IN THE THATCHER YEARS by Paul Willman, Tim Morris and Beverly Aston Cambridge University Press Pounds 35, 254 pages MOST OF Britain's unions have normally run on a shoe-string, with low subscriptions and limited services for the members. Their past strength derived not from bulging assets but industrial muscle and a constant drive for new members. Many union officials regarded finance as a sordid affair and business unionism as a term of abuse. But as Paul Willman and his colleagues at the London Business School indicate in their fascinating analysis of trade union finances during the Thatcher years, the familiar picture of thread-bare unions has changed. While their membership declined during the 1980s, trade unions saw an improvement in their financial performance with a growth in their asset income and fall in 'friendly society' benefits. The book provides a wealth of topical data on union finances with chapters on more interesting cases such as the Mineworkers, the Engineers and the Electricians. But its more general interest lies in its focus on an important and neglected issue: the reliance of trade unions for their very survival on the goodwill of employers. As the authors explain: 'No union we encountered could, in our judgment, fund day-to-day operations indefinitely from its own resources without massive subscription increases or exhaustion of assets. All are employer-dependent'. Nearly 80 per cent of workers in unions have their dues paid out of their gross pay packets by their employers in agreement with the unions. This check-off ensures administrative efficiency and keeps union current accounts liquid. However, it could decline during the 1990s, as the government's trade union legislation will make it more costly for employers to administer. But what if employers decide they no longer need trade unions? The authors point out that many unions are no longer 'activist-based voluntary organisations' and rely on 'inertia-selling'. Breaking free of a reliance on employers might actually reinvigorate unions in a time of decline.</p>

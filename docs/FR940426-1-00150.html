A copy of the physical examination shall be provided to the enrollee. A physical examination is a program benefit and shall not be interpreted as an eligibility criterion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Each individual selected for enrollment shall have a physical assessment within the 2-month period immediately before the first day of compensated participation which shall be used as part of the assessment process following eligibility determination. [Section 502(b)(1)(N).] Exceptions are provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Enrollees should be provided a physical examination every twelve months, but no enrollee may participate in community service employment for more than 15 months without a physical examination or a waiver, as provided by paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) An enrollee who is terminated may be reenrolled without an additional physical assessment, provided that the time elapsed since the last physical assessment does not exceed 15 months, and provided that a schedule of one examination within each 15-month period shall be resumed, based on the date of the last examination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(3) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, when an individual objects to a physical examination, the recipient or subrecipient shall obtain a signed waiver prior to the first day of compensated participation. Thereafter, an additional signed waiver shall be obtained from each enrollee before providing any compensated participation more than 15 months after the date of the enrollee's latest waiver. Failure to receive such waiver within the 15-month timeframe will result in the enrollee's preclusion from further participation in an assignment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Retirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Expenditures of grant funds for contributions into a retirement system or plan are prohibited, unless the recipient has documentation on hand showing that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The costs are allowable under the appropriate cost principles indicated at &sect;641.403(b); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Such contributions bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of providing such benefits to enrollees because: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) the benefits vest at the time contributions are made on behalf of the enrollees; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) the charges to SCSEP funds are for contributions on behalf of enrollees to a ``defined benefit'' type of plan which do not exceed the amounts reasonably necessary to provide the specified benefit to enrollees, as determined under a separate actuarial determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Workers' compensation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where an enrollee is not covered by the State workers' compensation law, the recipient or subrecipient shall provide the enrollee with workers' compensation benefits equal to that provided by law for covered employment. [Section 504(b).] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unemployment compensation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The recipient is authorized to pay the cost of unemployment insurance for covered enrollees, where required by law.

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Wine scandal prompts quality control tests THE ITALIAN government announced yesterday it had ordered quality controls on all domestically produced table wines in a bid to improve the image of Italian wine after a doctoring scandal, Reuter reports from Rome. A decree due to come into force at the end of this month, published in the official gazette, will extend tests already imposed on top-quality Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wines. Italian table wine is currently not subject to statutory testing. Police in the Veneto region around northern Padua arrested four men in January and seized 4m litres (880,000 gallons) of cheap red and white wine laced with a pesticide. Contaminated wine from Italy, which vies with France as the world's biggest wine producer, has since been seized in France and Germany. Britain's Marks and Spencer chain store recalled two types, white Pinot Grigio and red Merlot. 'Wine-growers and merchants all wanted tests to safeguard the image of Italian wine,' said a spokesman for the Confagricoltura association grouping several thousand producers. 'This is a sign to consumers abroad and in Italy that there are no doubts on the quality of the wine.' Under the decree from the agriculture ministry, Italian table wine will be subjected to 16 tests including alcohol content, acidity and the presence of the chemical methylisothiocyanate. It was the discovery of traces of this chemical, used in fruit fungicides, in the Veneto wine that sparked the scandal earlier this year. Wine producers have estimated that when the scandal first broke, sales of Italian wine slumped by 18 per cent in Britain and close to 8 per cent in Germany. The doctored wine is harmless unless drunk in huge quantities.</p>

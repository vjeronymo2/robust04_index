			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the DEA for most of its member firms, the NYSE is responsible for examining such firms for compliance with the financial responsibility rules. <FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>  The Commission believes that information about extensions for payment or delivery of securities is essential in helping the NYSE carry out its DEA responsibilities under the Act. <FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>  In particular, Regulation T and Rule 15c3&hyph;3 require that extensions be granted only if the broker-dealer is acting in good faith and exceptional circumstances exist to warrant an extension. As the DEA, the NYSE must ensure that requests that are granted have met these conditions. Under the current structure, however, another SRO may grant numerous extensions without the NYSE being adequately informed as to the nature of the requests and the conditions under which they are being granted. This not only can impair the NYSE's ability to ensure member firm compliance with financial responsibility rules but it can affect the NYSE's ability to detect potential sales practice problems. <FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 61 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For firms where the NYSE is the DEA, the Exchange is responsible for examining the firms' compliance with rules pertaining to, among other things: Hypothecation or lending in customer reserve accounts (under section 8 of the Act); the maintenance of books and records (under section 17(a) of the Act); capital, margin or recordkeeping (under section 17(d) of the Act); broker-dealer balance sheets (under section 17(e) of the Act), or any other Commission or SRO rules relating to the protection of customer accounts or securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 62 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees with the NYSE's claim that information derived from extension requests is necessary, among other things, to perform effective on-site review to detect potential sales practice problems. See 1989 NYSE Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 63 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that the NASD has expressed concern that this proposal would prevent the NASD from obtaining extension information necessary to perform its SRO functions. The NASD states that the proposal would prevent the NASD from obtaining information regarding a large number of its members since a significant portion of customer activities involving NASDAQ and OTC securities is handled by NASD/NYSE members for whom the NYSE is the DEA. The Commission finds this argument unpersuasive as the regulatory structure already distinguishes between DEA SROs and non-DEA SROs and this proposal merely follows this distinction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, the rule change will serve to eliminate the possibility of forum shopping among SROs for extensions. For example, the NYSE's 1989 comment letter notes instances where a NYSE member firm began to send its extension requests to another SRO after the NYSE took restrictive action against it. Although some comment letters dispute the extent of forum shopping, the Commission's experience in reviewing SRO compliance programs leads it to believe that the potential for forum shopping for extensions exists under the current scheme and that approval of the NYSE proposal will diminish this. <FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 64 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In this regard, other SROs may wish to adopt similar rule proposals that would require those members for which the SRO is the DEA to submit extension request to that SRO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, given the NYSE's Rule 17d&hyph;1 <FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 17d&hyph;2 <FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>  responsibilities under the Act, it will improve regulatory oversight by the NYSE if the Exchange receives extension request information for firms for which it is the DEA so that it may have a complete picture of each member's financial and regulatory situation. The proposed rule change will accomplish this by enabling the NYSE to have all the regulatory information necessary to get a complete view of each NYSE member firm's activity so that the NYSE may more effectively prevent members' financial difficulties or fraud. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 65 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 55. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 56. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also believes that implementing proposed NYSE Rule 434 is the simplest and quickest way to meet the goal of ensuring that credit related financial restrictions placed upon a member firm are based upon complete information. The Commission does not agree with assertions that the Act's objectives could be better met by implementing a uniform system of sharing extension information. Although improved sharing of extension information would provide data to the NYSE, it would not relay this information in time for the NYSE to act before the receiving SRO decides on an extension request. In addition, information sharing would involve two SROs reviewing extension requests and result in substantial expense and modifications of existing extension processing systems. This would necessarily involve considerable duplication of efforts since two SROs would review extension information. In contrast, the NYSE proposal is consistent with the current regulatory structure of designating one SRO as the DEA for firms that are members of more than one SRO. The DEA scheme was adopted in order to eliminate unnecessary duplication of efforts in the area of member regulation. <FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>  As a result, the Commission does not believe that the Act mandates that information sharing be utilized in place of the NYSE's approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 67 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See SEC Rule 17d&hyph;1, 17 CFR 240.17d&hyph;1 (1993), which provides that the Commission shall consider,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  unnecessary regulatory duplication when designating an SRO for purposes of examination for compliance with financial responsibility rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also believes that the regulatory benefits from NYSE Rule 434 outweigh any competitive concerns raised by the commenters. Under section 6(b)(8) of the Act, the Commission may not approve an exchange rule if it imposes a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes that any competitive burden raised by NYSE Rule 434 is necessary and appropriate under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the Commission believes that the NYSE, as the DEA for most of its member firms, is in the best position to monitor extension requests and to ensure that they do not affect the financial viability of member firms. In this regard, the NYSE has a sound system for monitoring extension requests and ensuring that member firms do not exceed established parameters. We do not believe that approval of the rule and the resulting lessening of competition for processing NYSE members' requests will have a harmful effect on the system for handling credit extension requests. In particular, because of the NYSE's responsibility as the DEA, it will have a continuing responsibility to ensure that firms are not receiving numerous credit extensions that may indicate potential abuse and financial difficulties, and accordingly, they will have an incentive to properly maintain their monitoring systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

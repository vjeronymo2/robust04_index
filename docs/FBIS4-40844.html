			<p>BFN     [Text] Nursultan Nazarbayev visited East Kazakhstan and  Semipalatinsk oblasts at the end of last week. He introduced  the new head of the regional administration Yuriy Lavrinenko at  a meeting in Ust-Kamenogorsk. Then he left for Semipalatinsk  where he introduced the new head of the regional administration  Galymzhan Zhakyanov. During a meeting there Nazarbayev briefed  his audience on the current economic situation in the Republic.  He said that we should toughen up control over credit  allocation to enterprises so as to speed up the process of  lifting the country's economy out of crisis. The existing  economic situation should be taken into account in addressing  any issue.    In a message to parliamentarians Nazarbayev dwelled on ways  of overcoming the crisis. He paid special attention to the need  for stability in society. This stability can be maintained  provided all citizens have equal opportunities and a careful  personnel policy based on regional characteristics is carried  out. The main thing is not to allow any kind of provocations,  and to observe the law on bringing charges against those who  inflame national feelings. The president answered all the  questions during the meetings.</p>

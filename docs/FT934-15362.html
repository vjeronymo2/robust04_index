			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: TI raises Pounds 40m from sale of Dowty units TI GROUP, the specialist engineering company, has sold for Pounds 40m businesses taken over last year following its acquisition of Dowty. The businesses formed part of the electronic systems division of Dowty and supply equipment to the defence and aerospace markets. The purchaser is Ultra Electronics, a new company led by Mr Julian Blogh, a former managing director of Dowty Avionics. TI said the net asset value of the companies being sold was Pounds 24.3m. Under FRS 3 TI will be taking neither a profit nor a loss through the P&amp;L. What would have been a profit on the sale under old accounting rules is offset by the writing back of goodwill already written off directly to the balance sheet. Montagu Private Equity and Phildrew Ventures are taking equity stakes in Ultra while debt is being provided by a syndicate of banks led by Bank of Scotland. The businesses being sold have operating profits of Pounds 6m on sales of Pounds 80m, according to Phildrew Ventures. Sir Christopher Lewington, TI chairman and chief executive, said the disposal would raise to Pounds 60m the proceeds from sales this year. TI was on target to achieve its disposal objectives by the end of 1994. The proceeds have been used to reduce group debt. Net gearing will fall from 85 per cent ahead of the deal to 64 per cent. Mr Blogh said the businesses had been less affected by the cut-backs in the defence and aviation sectors because the projects had long life cycles. Mr Tim Hart of Phildrew said that while defence was out of vogue, Ultra would have attractive market shares in a number of good niches.</p>

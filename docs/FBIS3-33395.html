The proposal was officially announced by Brazilian Foreign  Minister Celso Amorim. It calls for the gradual lifting of  customs tariffs in South American countries until a total  liberalization of regional trade is achieved by 2005.    The same sources added that although the Brazilian proposal  was not rejected, there was no enthusiasm for this new Latin  American integration proposal in the short term.    The foreign ministers of Mercosur [Common Market of the  South] countries will discuss this issue in their next meeting  scheduled for March in Buenos Aires. They will also discuss the  state of negotiations toward a common Mercosur customs tariff  and the Brazilian proposal.    Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu did not comment on  the issue but specified that the Brazilian proposal does not  contradict Mercosur.    The foreign ministers attending the ALADI meeting avoided  any  specific comment on the eventual establishment of free trade  zone in the short term. They reasserted their willingness to  strengthen regional integration.    In a speech he delivered on 11 February at the ALADI  meeting,  the Argentine representative stressed the need to strengthen  Latin American integration. He specified, however, that  subregional organizations must first be enhanced.    If the Brazilian proposal is to be implemented on the same  terms as those explained by Foreign Minister Amorim,  negotiations should be undertaken this year so that the 10-year  timetable for the elimination of custom tariffs may begin by  1995.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Television talk show host Morton Downey Jr. says he's clinched the deal to buy  Del Webb's Claridge Casino Hotel in Atlantic City N.J., but Claridge officials  refused to confirm that claim late last week. Downey said his attorneys were  notified of the acceptance and immediately began drawing up "a definitive  contact" for the purchase. Neither Claridge officials nor their investment  banking firm, Oppenheimer &amp; Co., agreed with Downey's assessment. "The  Claridge board of directors has not acted to accept any offer for the purchase  of the Claridge, and when it does, we will make it official," said Glenn  Lillie, a Claridge spokesman.  </P></p>

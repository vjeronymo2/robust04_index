			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-BEAUTY QUEEN GETS LIFE TERM FOR JEALOUSY MURDER  </P> <P> A former dairy princess was sentenced Friday to life in prison, without  possibility of parole until 2003, for strangling a former homecoming queen in a  jealous rage over a farmer whom both women loved.  </P> <P> Lori Esker, 21, was convicted in June of first-degree intentional homicide for  the September, 1989, slaying of Lisa Cihaski, 21, who was strangled with a belt  in a car outside of a Wausau area motel.  </P> <P> Marathon County Circuit Judge Michael Hoover, after six hours of testimony and  arguments from attorneys, decided not to set a parole eligibility date for  Esker, so the former Marathon County dairy princess automatically becomes  eligible for release after 13 years and four months in prison.  </P></p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Elkem cuts first-quarter net deficit ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, reported a reduction in first-quarter net losses to NKr33m (Dollars 4.94m) from NKr115m a year earlier. The result, which follows Elkem's warning that prospects remained uncertain, was far better than forecast. The A shares jumped 20 per cent to NKr29.50 on the Oslo bourse and the free shares advanced NKr5.50 to NKr33.50. Elkem attributed the lower loss to cost reductions, tax cuts, a fall in net interest expenses, and favourable exchange rates. Turnover dipped to NKr1.9bn from NKr1.988bn. Operating costs were cut by NKr152m to NKr1.741bn and net interest by NKr24m to NKr85m. The company reversed last year's first-quarter operating loss of NKr7m with an operating profit of NKr64m, the best operating result in four consecutive quarters. Last autumn, Elkem strengthened its financial base through a NKr580m share issue and established a NKr550m credit facility. The group pledged to continue to reduce costs and increase productivity and said that measures already implemented had made a substantial contribution.</p>

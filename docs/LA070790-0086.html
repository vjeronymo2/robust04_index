			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BLYTHE;  </P> <P> PUC TELLS RAILWAY TO RESTORE SERVICE  </P> <P> The state Public Utilities Commission ordered the Santa Fe Railway to resume  hauling truck trailers on flatcars on a rail line through the southeastern  California desert. The PUC said the railway closed its loading ramps at Blythe  in Riverside County in August with only four days' notice to local governments  and shippers.  </P> <P> The spur line, which runs from Ripley, south of Blythe, about 80 miles north to  the Santa Fe main line at Cadiz in San Bernardino County, has served the Palo  Verde, Coachella and Imperial valleys for many years, the commission said. The  discounted service allowed truckers to load more than 6,000 trailers a year  onto flatcars at Blythe for shipment. Santa Fe said the service was no longer  profitable and also argued that the state had no legal authority over service  on a spur line that is linked to a federally regulated interstate rail line.  The PUC concluded, however, that it had jurisdiction over a spur line within  the state and said Santa Fe had failed to document its claim that the service  was unprofitable for the railway.  </P></p>

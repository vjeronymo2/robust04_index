They spent the morning meeting with the presidents of  the two houses. They also decided to suspend payments to the  Judicial and Legislative Branches until the impasse over the  wage increase is solved.    The constitutional revision sessions will begin earlier as  of  today, that is, at 1500. The PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party], the largest party in Congress, will be in charge of the  political coordination. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays  the PMDB will gather the leaders of the other parties to try to  reach an agreement on the afternoon voting sessions.    The party leaders also decided to create two committees, one  to deal with the Social Security reform and the other to deal  with tax reform. Constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy  Nelson Jobim believes this will facilitate the revision work:    [Begin recording] If a consensus is not reached on a subject  it will then be voted on, approved or rejected. That is, the  process will continue. [end recording]    After the meeting the presidents of the two houses announced  they decided to suspend paying deputies, senators, and Congress  employees until an agreement is reached on the conversion of  salaries into URV's [Real Value Unit]. Neither Chamber of  Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira or Senate President  Humberto Lucena have mentioned retreating from their position  regarding the salary increase. Nonetheless, they bet on a  negotiated solution.    [Begin Humberto Lucena recording] I think we must act like  firemen, but we must not add fuel to the fire. Now, in a  presidential system such negotiations could only prosper by  initiative of the president of the Republic, who is the one who  commands the political, administrative, and institutional  process of the country.

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Sixty-seven bus drivers, subway motormen and conductors -- those trusted to  transport thousands of New Yorkers daily -- have tested positive for hard drugs  over an 11-week period, a newspaper reported. Traces of such drugs as cocaine,  methadone, morphine, codeine and marijuana were also found in the urine of 79  other Transit Authority employees, including police officers, dispatchers,  track workers and car cleaners. The results of the tests were released to the  Daily News under the Freedom of Information Act. Those testing positive  included 41 bus drivers, 10 subway motormen, 16 conductors and five transit  police officers, the paper said. In each group, at least half tested positive  for cocaine.  </P></p>

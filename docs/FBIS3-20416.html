When a mayor cheats on taxes, not only are the  nation's interests not protected, its very foundation is  undermined.    On 16 November 1992, Jin Xin [6855 9515], director of the  State Administration of Taxation, received an anonymous letter  from Xianning City, Hubei Province, reporting that several  enterprises and a number of tax revenue bureau individuals in  Xianning, acting in collusion with a group of tax cheaters, had  defrauded the government of large sums in export tax rebates.  Responsible leading cadres in the State Council individually  wrote comments and instructions onto the report, demanding that  thorough and organized investigation be carried out as soon as  possible. One leading cadre expressed his outrage by writing an  eight-word phrase: "Under the nation's law, such audacity will  not stand!" On the 24th, a joint investigation team organized by  the State Administration of Taxation and the provincial tax  bureau was quickly sent to Xianning City.    After more than three months of investigation, details of  the  case have gradually become clear.    On 10 August 1992, responsible personnel of four enterprises  in Hubei Province's Xianning City -- including the Wujin  Electric Wire Factory, Wenquan Electric Cable Factory and  Shuangqi Township Electrical Machinery Factory -- in collusion  with certain Municipal Tax Bureau offices and criminal elements  who cheat on taxes, submitted bogus export goods invoices and  fake certificates showing taxes had been paid, collecting from  the government export tax rebates totalling 9.74 million yuan,  from which amount they themselves made illegal gains of 695,000  yuan. In November of the same year, seeing what could be gained  by the above maneuver, a Xianning City factory specializing in  sewing uniforms negotiated an agreement with the office Xianning  City maintains in Shenzhen, and using the pretext of exporting  the uniforms through Shenzhen, requested the Xianning Municipal  Tax Bureau issue bogus export tax payment certificates with  which to claim export tax rebates. Municipal Tax Bureau Chief  Yin Chuansheng [1438 0278 0581], knowing full well that the  State Administration of Taxation had explicitly forbidden local  tax bureaus to issue export tax payment certificates, not only  did not turn down the request, but instead submitted it to Mayor  Chen Huiyou [7115 1863 0645]. Chen Huiyou, knowing the action to  be illegal but wanting the local enterprises to benefit,  actually insisted that the tax bureau "support" the request.  Chen even used a sleight of hand by back-dating his instructions  to the tax bureau to before the regulations were issued by the  State Administration of Taxation, and this enabled the criminal  elements cheating taxes to cheat the government of 2,248,900  yuan in fraudulent export tax rebates, of which 335,000 yuan of  illegal gains went to Xianning's Shenzhen office, the Xianning  Tax Bureau and the Uniform Sewing Factory.    Case 2: Tax Revenue Bureau Director Personally  Intervenes    On 27 April 1993, in Jiangxi Province, Ruichang City  Municipal Tax Bureau Vice Director Xu Zengchan [1776 1073 3934],  accompanied by deputy section chief Zhou Jiangfu [0719 3068  4395] and others, traveling in a tax bureau inspection office  vehicle, drove miles and miles to Shenzhen to "conduct business  in the field" for the convenience of those elements cheating on  taxes.    Since there were no export goods or invoices for inspection,  Vice Director Xu performed on the spot a series of six  procedural steps for the tax cheaters: even the dates,  descriptions and values of the goods shown on the tax payment  certificates and sales invoices were copied from drafts prepared  ahead of time by the tax cheaters. To further ensure against  detection, the officials followed the cheaters' request not only  to certify the tax payment certificates as the original copies,  but also to sign the letter requesting export tax rebate in the  name of the Ruichang Municipal Tax Bureau; in addition to  further authenticating tax payment certificates and invoices,  the action served to witness successful tax cheating by illegal  elements. The amounts cheated in the two categories amounted to  1,028,700 million yuan and 2.09 million yuan.    According to information from the "Joint Office for  Attacking  Export Tax Rebate Fraud" organized by the Supreme People's  Procuratorate and the State Administration of Taxation, a total  of 151 enterprises were investigated in 1992 for cheating the  government out of as much as 749 million yuan, and 204 million  in tax rebates. In January-August 1993, investigations revealed  that fraudulent use of fake invoices amounted to a total of 3.5  billion yuan, and frauds involving export tax rebates totalled  100 million yuan. The cases implicated some 150 export  enterprises in all 20 provinces, autonomous regions and directly  administered municipalities, over 50 factories and manufacturing  concerns and over 40 tax revenue bureaus.  <H5>  Cheating on Taxes, Cheating on Whom? </H5>   The so-called export tax rebate refers to taxes already paid  on products before they were exported from the country, and  involves the Government Treasury refunding the amounts of  product tax, value-added tax and special consumption tax paid  back to the exporting enterprises. Because of the increasingly  fierce international market competition, and the fact that such  taxes increase the cost basis of export products, the Chinese  Government has therefore instituted an export tax rebate system,  a practice generally in keeping with international customs,  which enables China's exports to gain entry in the world market  at tax-free prices and which serves the basic objective of  enhancing the competitiveness of China's exports.    Export tax rebate frauds involve using bogus invoices for  export products, including fake tax payment certificates and  customs declarations, to obtain rebates from the government.    This "malignant tumor" of tax cheating appears to be a twin  of the export tax rebate policy; it was born at about the same  time, and during the eight years when China had made  considerable progress in opening up to the outside world, tax  cheating also become increasingly widespread and audacious.    Cheating on taxes is in fact cheating on the country.    That being the case, people would ask, who benefits from tax  cheating? What do these people do with the tax money they have  cheated?    The Xianning tax cheating case, which created a furor,  cheated the government of 11,988,900 yuan in export tax rebates,  but the enterprises and tax bureau offices involved in the  scheme got only 1,025,000 million yuan for themselves, the rest  went to bosses in Hong Kong and illegal criminal elements in the  society.    The Jiangxi Province Ruichang City tax cheating case  resulted  in an export tax rebate loss to the government of 3,118,700  yuan, and the parties involved got only 280,700 yuan for  themselves.    Behind tax cheating cases are massive corruptions involving  the offering, seeking and demanding of bribes. Illegal elements  in society utilize money to pave their way, and many party and  government cadres and officials have fallen under "sugar coated  bullets."    Wang Tianpeng [3769 1131 7720], vice director of the Gansu  Provincial Tax Revenue Bureau, was arrested because he used his  position to facilitate tax cheating; he accepted bribes from a  certain export company in Gansu, and when caught accepting the  tax rebate, he still approved that company's request for tax  rebates amounting to more than 810,000 yuan.    As for Jiangxi's Ruichang Municipal Tax Bureau Vice Chief Xu  Zhengchan and others, when they would sign off on a tax rebate  application, criminal element Zhang Chaobin [1728 2600 1755]  would call them in turn into a room and pay each 5, or 3,  percent of service fees based on the size of his "contribution";  the several persons in the scheme illegally collected a total of  139,00 yuan.    In the major "12.17" [17 December] tax cheating case, 13  persons in Xianning City suspected to have received bribes were  investigated by the Xianning Prefectural Inspectorate; they were  found to have each received over 10,000 yuan.  <H5>  Why Is Tax Cheating So Rampant? </H5>   The fact that tax cheating crimes have spread quickly and  become rampant shows there are causes not only in terms of  ideology but also in terms of problems in the system and  organization.    1. Tax cheaters use as an excuse that they do it for the  local benefit. One important reason to cheat on taxes is to  derive benefits for the local area and for local organizations.  Since tax revenue collected is allocated among several entities  who use the revenue for their purposes, some localities have no  qualm about sacrificing the country's benefits to gain a little  advantage for themselves; they know they are breaking the law  but they do it willingly.    Xianning City Mayor Chen Huiyou put it plainly, we did this  mainly to earn some money for our city and to develop our local  economy. In Henan Province's Zhengyang County, the "four big  leading cadre groups," after collective study, unanimously  endorsed a move by the county tax bureau to make up bogus  certificates for 883,000 yuan, arguing that this amount will be  utilized for "local benefits."    2. There is the misunderstanding that "in a market economy,  one is entitled to speculate." The road toward establishing a  socialist market economy is one on which China must travel.  There are however comrades who misinterpret the market economy  and actually use the market economy theory as the basis for  cheating on taxes.    On 17 April, 1993, Jiangxi Province's Ruichang City Mayor  Chen Dingrong [7115 1353 2837] sponsored a government  coordination meeting keyed to tax cheating. At the meeting he  said: "To help factories and tax bureau offices deal with  certain procedural tasks...in order to gain some income for  Ruichang City, is a good thing. Now, we have a market economy,  and we can speculate to make gains."    A former Yunnan Province Kaiyuan City Tax Bureau Chief  actually and boastfully said: Are we not encouraging people to  "jump into business" nowadays? The fact that we issued bogus tax  payment certificates is proof that we are "doing business," and  in order to serve economic construction, we have to dare to "run  the red light."    Listen to high-minded rationales, and how good they sound!    3. When the system is not yet perfected, there is room for  exploitation. In the early period when the export tax rebate  system was first set up, the rebate was based on the export  enterprise's budget and inventory projections. Beginning in  1988, to generate enthusiasm in various regions to export to  earn foreign exchange, and to reduce the regions' financial  burdens, the handling of the entire export tax rebate system was  turned over to the Central Government, but this step actually  destroyed the unity of responsibility and authority for revenue  collection and expenditure between the Central and regional  governments, and gave illegal elements an opening to cheat on  taxes.    When the tax revenue collection system is overly  complicated,  efficiency of the tax rebate system is low. The product tax and  value-added tax constitute the two major tax categories in  export tax rebate. Because product taxes are collected at  different stages, calculation of the value-added tax is  complicated and not uniform, the numbers of tax categories,  taxable items and tax rates involved are excessive, plus there  are tax preferential policies set up by the localities, all  these result in quantitatively low and inefficient turnover  between the export product tax collected and the export tax  rebated, which provides more opportunities for tax cheating  elements to cheat on taxes.    The collection of product tax and the rebate of taxes paid  are not well coordinated. This can be seen in the inadequate  feedback between relevant information concerning export product  tax and tax rebate and the information need of export  enterprises and enterprises which produce goods for export.  Furthermore, between the processes of tax collection and tax  rebate, the collection process still has numerous problems such  as collecting taxes on export products for which local taxes  have been reduced or waived, and on export products which  undergo further processing before export; in processing rebate  applications, therefore, the tax rebate offices have great  difficulty dealing with them in a comprehensive or correct way,  to say nothing of arriving at accurate results from the  complicated calculations. In addition, in the tax collection  cycle there are situations where the turnover tax collection is  contracted out, and where such taxes are reduced or waived by  persons in charge without the proper authority or who exceed  their authority in doing so. Such situations lead to loopholes  in management of tax collection and rebate and consequently  create opportunities for tax cheating elements to commit fraud.  <H5>  We Should Dare To Ask What the Future Course Will Be </H5>   Export tax rebate fraud is a dangerous criminal activity  with  very bad consequences; the fact it is rampant does not mean  there is no law to control it, but does indicate that serious  attention has not been sufficiently aroused to deal with the  problem. Ever since the occurrance of the major "12.17" tax  cheating case, government authorities have launched a major  anti-tax cheating drive within China's borders. The facts  demonstrate that when jolted by the above incident, party  members and cadres now have a full understanding of the  seriousness of the tax cheating problem, and criminal elements  in society have become more restrained, so notable results have  been achieved. Therefore, in order to effectively control  cheating on taxes, we must carry out a sustained counterattack.  It is encouraging to note that the "Office To Attack Export Tax  Rebate Frauds," jointly established by the State General  Taxation Bureau and Supreme People's Procuratorate, was formally  opened for business in Shenzhen on 12 July, 1993.    We have reasons to hope that with conscientious enforcement  of law and regulations, it will be impossible for tax cheating  schemes to succeed.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Vodafone tariff cuts intensify price war VODAFONE, the UK's leading cellular mobile operator, has cut its London and low-user tariffs to match those offered by Cellnet - intensifying the price war in the industry. The low-user tariff drops by 15 per cent, and a reduced-rate tariff comes in for the London region, giving business users a 20 per cent price cut for calls made in the London region in return for higher prices for calls made outside. The cuts are virtually identical to those announced by Cellnet a fortnight ago, and reflect growing competition in the industry. Competition was given a significant boost last week with the launch of the Mercury One-2-One network within the M25 area. The new service features free evening calls at week-ends for personal subscribers. Vodafone's new London tariff - 'CapitalCall' - comprises a monthly subscription of Pounds 20, with call charges of 20p a minute peak-rate inside the M25 and 50p a minute outside. Vodafone has also introduced special incentives for users with bills of more than Pounds 62.50 a month.</p>

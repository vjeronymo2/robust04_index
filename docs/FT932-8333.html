			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Foster's in ADollars 120m China joint venture FOSTER'S, the Australian brewer, is to expand into China, the world's fastest-growing beer market. The group's Carlton and United Breweries subsidiary yesterday announced a ADollars 120m (USDollars 84.3m) joint venture with Huaguang Brewery in Shanghai. Mr Ted Kunkel, chief executive, said Foster's expected to brew as much beer in China within five years as it does in Australia. The joint venture is the start of a ADollars 200m investment strategy in China over the next seven years. Mr Kunkel said the aim was not to 'Fosterise' China, but to develop a range of local and regional brands. It would brew Foster's as its 'international premium brand' in due course. 'This historic step into China is a critical strategic move for long-term growth,' Mr Kunkel said. 'I expect it to become our fourth brewing arm, joining CUB in Australasia, Courage in England and Molson Breweries in North America.' The project, in which Foster's is providing 60 per cent of the investment, involves upgrading the existing brewery and developing a large new operation in Shanghai's Pudong development zone. Mr Kunkel said Foster's was also looking at joint ventures in other parts of China. Huaguang is one of Shanghai's leading brewers, servicing China's biggest city of 13m people and a huge population in the Yangtze delta. Its better-known brands include Guangming and Shanghai. CUB executives believe the latter has international potential. Huaguang said the state-owned company hoped to dominate the Shanghai market through its CUB joint venture. Huaguang's market share is 20 per cent. Mr Kunkel expects China to replace the US as the world's largest beer market within 10 years, and to overtake Germany as the second-biggest market within four years.</p>

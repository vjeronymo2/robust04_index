			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Markets retreat after early rally Republican success in Tuesday's elections sparked a strong rally in the dollar and US and European financial markets yesterday, as investors anticipated that a more pro-business Congress would pursue policies to aid growth and cut government spending. However, US markets were unable to sustain their early gains and Wall Street retreated amid concerns that conflict between President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress could undermine investor confidence in the economy and the dollar. The markets were also troubled by fears of rising US interest rates; most analysts expect rates to be raised next week to slow economic growth and restrain inflation. Some analysts believe the poll results have important implications for monetary policy. Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at the investment fund group Dreyfus, said: 'The Fed will be now more free to tighten as fast and as much as it wants. It had been under pressure from Democrats in Congress, and with the Republicans taking over both houses, the pressure against the Fed will fall.' The possibility that the Republican success could lead Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to raise rates further and faster than the markets had expected was behind some of the selling on US markets yesterday. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which had jumped 38 points in the opening minutes - had sunk back to 3,831.75 points, a gain of 1.01 on the day. But the dollar kept its gains in New York, up about two pfennigs against the D-Mark at DM1.52755, and at Y97.775. European stock markets greeted the Republican victories with impressive advances, but unlike Wall Street they kept most of their gains. London's FT-SE 100 index closed up 35.8 at 3,099.6, while in Frankfurt the DAX index rose 43.03 to 2,096.47. Wall Street was concerned that discord between Congress and the White House might lead to legislative gridlock, and that a hardline Republican leadership could block progress on trade. Mr Richard McCabe, chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch, said Wall Street was debating 'whether Republican control of both houses leads to more legislation that is good for the market, or whether it leads to more deadlock'. Mr Hoey said any positive effects from the elections would probably soon fade. 'The stock market is left with all the same issues it had before, in terms of the outlook for the economy and the possibility for more Fed tightenings. The core issue is how much more will interest rates go up.' Lex, Page 24 World stocks, Page 45 London market report, Page 48 Currencies, Page 38</p>

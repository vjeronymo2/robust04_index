			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Nation and the Emigre Community Conference  concluded today at the Convention Center in Havana. The  conference closed its doors, but opened doors to ties between  Cuba and its children abroad. The closing remarks were by  Politburo member Jose Ramon Balaguer:    [Begin Balaguer recording] We conclude the Nation and the  Emigre Community Conference with great satisfaction and the  natural uncertainty of those who begin a new path. Beginning our  journey down a new road is precisely what we have been doing  here these past three days. [end recording]    The meeting that was called by the Cuban Government  continues  a process which began in 1978 and that did not conclude with  just words. Regarding this conference, Politburo member Carlos  Lage said:    [Begin Lage recording] These meetings were held in an  atmosphere of respect. I believe these meetings have been useful  and positive and that they will not end here, but will continue.    I believe we can expect many things. Just yesterday we  announced some measures we had been analyzing. There may be many  openings, but the reality of our relations with the emigre  community is facing a difficult obstacle, an obstacle that  cannot be ignored: the U.S. blockade against Cuba. [end  recording]    The hosts announced several measures that will contribute to  advancing this identification between the two sides of the Cuban  culture. [passage omitted]</p>

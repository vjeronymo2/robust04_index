			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS  </P> <P> In your tribute to the 100-year anniversary of the Dodgers (editorial, "The  First 100 . . . ," June 15), you made two errors that even a moderate baseball  fan, let alone a trivia buff, would catch:  </P> <P> In 1947, when the great Jackie Robinson, with the help of Branch Rickey, broke  the color barrier, he played first base, not second.  </P> <P> Eddie Stanky was the second baseman. Gil Hodges played a couple dozen games, at  catcher, moving to first base in 1948.  </P> <P> Until the Dodgers and Giants moved West in 1958, the westernmost team in the  majors was the Kansas City Athletics, having moved there from Philadelphia in  1955. Ask Tommy Dodger if he pitched for them in 1956.  </P> <P> LARRY BERG  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

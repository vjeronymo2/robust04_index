			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 8 Apr (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice president of  the Council of Ministers, admitted today that the current sugar  harvest is facing difficult and tense moments, the reason for  which it has been decided that the sugar grinding will be  rescheduled during the month of May.    In statements to Cuban television, the member of the  Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] Politburo commented on the delays  in the production plans of several provinces.    Lage proceeded to cite the excessive humidity caused by  heavy  rains and the problems experienced in preparing the harvest as  being the main reasons for the delay.    In expressing his confidence that they will be able to grind  the quantity of sugar forecasted, Lage stressed that there is no  indication of exhaustion among the sector's leaders and workers  despite having been at work for more than 100 days.    During the past year, Cuba was only able to produce 4.2  million tons of sugar, an amount considerably lower than the 7  million tons the country was able to produce in previous years.    The sugar harvest will be rescheduled, a situation that had  been forecasted by experts, as a result of the beginning of  spring, a fall in productivity, and an increase in manufacturing  and equipment breakdowns after more than three months of  continuous activity at the agro-industrial installations.    Previously, Lage had indicated the economic need to grind  the  sugar as efficiently as possible and manufacture the entire  sugar committed, without neglecting to plant and clean the  thousands of hectares of land in preparation for next year's  harvest.</p>

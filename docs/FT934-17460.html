			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Gloomy growth outlook THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has revised downward its growth estimates for the US, Japan and Germany, three stalled motors of international economic activity, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD secretary general, told the Council of Europe's parliament in Strasbourg yesterday that a feeling of disappointment summed up the present situation among the 24 OECD nations. In the US, gross domestic product was forecast to grow 3 per cent next year, taking into account inflation, rather than the 3.1 per cent forecast published in June. This growth relied on an upturn in foreign demand, Mr Paye said. The Japanese scenario was much bleaker, he said. Instead of the forecast 3.25 per cent real GDP growth in the second half of this year, the OECD now sees stagnation and growth of only 2 per cent for 1994. This contrasts with a forecast increase in activity next year of 3.3 per cent. German growth next year has been drastically marked down to not more than 0.5 per cent from the 1.4 per cent earlier forecast. The other European nations would see mediocre performance. Mr Paye pointed to the apparent failure of the US and European models of economic life in sustaining growth and jobs. In the US, labour was highly mobile and competition speeded adjustments. In Europe, governments were more interventionist and there was a long-established social security system. But there has been a stagnation or even deterioration in US average living standards and more than 30m people were classed as poor. In Europe, unemployment was rising everywhere. Mr Paye said it was vital that OECD countries' policies should succeed otherwise, 'Fear of the future will continue to hold sway.'</p>

The Defendant, Westinghouse Communities of Naples, Inc., was issued a permit by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1981, which authorized the filling of approximately 76 acres of wetlands as part of a residential development project. In mitigation, the permit required Defendant to excavate a 5-acre tidal pond to create a shoreline habitat and it contained an express condition that no bulkhead or other structures would be allowed in Clam Bay's system or adjacent wetlands. Defendant subsequently discharged approximately 7 cubic yards of fill into the 5-acre mitigation pond in connection with the construction of a 400-foot-long vertical bulkhead and a portion of the bulkhead was placed over the fill. Those activities were contrary to the specific terms and conditions of the 1981 permit and, therefore, constituted violations of the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The site of the violations is north, east and west of Upper Clam Bay and south of Vanderbilt Beach Road (SR862) in Sections 32 and 33, Township 48 South, Range 25 East and Sections 4, 5, 8 and 9, Township 49, South, Range 25 East in Collier County, Florida. The property contains wetlands adjacent to Upper Clam Bay-Pelican Bay and those wetlands are waters of the United States as defined in the Clean Water Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Final (Consent) Judgment requires Westinghouse Communities of Naples, Inc. to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $15,000 for its violations of the permit. Under the settlement, the fill material and the bulkhead will be authorized to remain in place under Nationwide Permit No. 32. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice will receive written comments relating to the Final (Consent) Judgment for a period of 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to Michael A. Cauley, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Middle District of Florida, 500 Zack Street, Suite 400, Tampa, FL 33602, and should refer to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Westinghouse Communities of Naples, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Civil Action No. 94&hyph;234&hyph;CIV&hyph;FTM&hyph;17D (M.D. Fla.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Consent Decree may be examined at the Clerk's Office, United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Forty Myers Division, First and Lee Street, Ft.

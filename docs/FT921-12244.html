			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indians want to double sugar exports THE INDIAN sugar mill industry wants the government to authorise exports totalling 1m tonnes on the world market this year, up from 525,000 tonnes in 1991. At prevailing world prices the sales would be at a loss but the industry is keen to maximise exports because of expected oversupply throughout the year, according to Mr Om Dhanuka, spokesman for the Indian Sugar Mills Association. Last year's exports left the industry with a loss of about Rs450m (Pounds 9.7m) and this year's will be at a minimum loss of Rs160 a quintal (100 kg). The government, facing a serious balance of payments crisis, is likely to accede to the industry's request. It has , however, turned down a suggestion to create a buffer stock of 1m tonnes, claiming it does not have the money to finance it. Whatever happens the sugar mills, which in 1991 lost more than Rs7bn, will fare even worse in the current year. According to Mr Dhanuka, the industry is moving deeper into the red because of the unscientific pricing policy for sugar-cane and the high percentage of sugar the mills are required to sell to the government at much below production costs for distribution through 'fair price' shops. Every year the federal government lays down the statutory minimum price for cane, which forms the basis of the levy sugar price. For the 1991-92 (October-September) season the minimum cane price is Rs26 a quintal, based on a sugar yield of 8.5 per cent. But the states, seeking to placate the powerful cane growers' lobby, are forcing the mills to pay up to Rs16 a quintal more. The mills are supposed to make sufficient profit from the sale of 55 per cent of sugar production in the open market to compensate for the loss incurred on the 45 per cent levy portion. But they are realising a little over Rs700 a quintal, compared with the break-even price of Rs970a quintal. Because of these poor returns, the mills are not able to clear their cane bills. By April, the problem will be assuming threatening proportions when cane arrears are likely to be exceed Rs7bn. At one point last season the uncleared cane bills amounted to Rs3.5bn. About Rs1bn from the last season's arrears has been brought forward into the current year. The farmers, furious with the mills for their failure to clear their bills, have in many places destroyed the ratoon (autumn crop), otherwise sugar production in the current season could easily have reached 13m tonnes, instead of equalling last season's 12m tonnes, as is expected. Mr Dhanuka does not rule out the possibility of large scale diversion of land from sugar-cane to other crops.</p>

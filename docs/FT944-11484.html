			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Move north, pay more - Christopher Elias on a tax anomaly The owner of a house in Scotland could find he has to pay more to the Inland Revenue than someone with a property south of the border. This development, which could come as an unpleasant surprise to those concerned, affects staff who must sell up because their employer requires them to move their place of work from one area to another. In his spring 1993 Budget, the chancellor of the exchequer announced he had decided to withdraw various tax concessions. One result was that staff getting re-location costs from their employers became liable to tax on part of them. But because of differences in property law between Scotland and England, the additional tax has resulted in an anomaly. In most cases, staff members moving their workplace will not be taxed on benefits provided by their employer to help sell existing homes - such as payment of estate agents' commission - so long as the benefit is provided after the employee's 'beneficial interest' in the property has been transferred. There, though, is the rub. In Scotland, beneficial interest in property is not deemed to pass from the owner until the change in ownership is recorded at the Land Registry. In England and Wales, however, beneficial interest passes at the date of the contract to sell, and not when ownership itself passes to the buyer. One way in which the bill can be reduced in England and Wales is for the employer or re-location company to enter a contract to buy a staff member's existing home. By doing so, it acquires the employee's beneficial interest, which stops the potential tax bills adding up for him. The actual transfer of ownership is postponed (along with the legal costs and estate agent's commission) until a new buyer moves in. In Scotland, however, all the costs which the staffer would have had to bear if his employer had not paid them will, potentially, be taxable. Take a middle manager on a 40 per cent tax rate who is being moved from an Pounds 85,000 house in Scotland. The rules mean he could have to pay at least Pounds 850 in tax over and above that in England and Wales, while his employer could have to pay at least Pounds 1,000 more. Ian Payne, managing director of PRIcoa Relocation - part of the Prudential Insurance group - which is lobbying to amend the rules, says: 'While I appreciate the Revenue's hands are tied, we have a grossly unfair tax anomaly which must be rectified. 'This would remove a fiscal penalty on employees asked to move to or from Scotland which their English counterparts do not have to pay. The lobbying exercise aims to achieve tax parity as soon as possible.' The writer is a partner at City solicitor Elias Freeman.</p>

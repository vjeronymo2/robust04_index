			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Observer: Hi-di-hi, Trevor Can Trevor Hemmings do no wrong? If weekend press reports are to be believed the former builders' lad from Lancashire is poised to sell his string of gambling casinos, including Maxims, Charlie Chester's and the Golden Horsehoe, for another handsome profit. It is the latest in a series of deals which has made the 59-year-old Hemmings one of Britain's richest entrepreneurs. According to the Sunday Times he is worth Pounds 175m or more than three times as much as Lord Hanson. Hemmings is not known as a high-roller but when it comes to buying and selling businesses he's the man with the lucky touch for the moment. His first big break came when Sir Fred Pontin asked him to build him a holiday camp in Southport in 1967 and Hemmings became Sir Fred's right-hand man. After Pontins lost its independence, it was Hemmings and not Sir Fred who bought it back from Bass in 1987. Quickly, he more than doubled his money by selling it to another brewer, Scottish &amp; Newcastle. Since then Hemmings has been doing more of the same - buying low and selling high. Apart from owning Pounds 84m of S&amp;N shares, he also has a seat on the board and a Pounds 14m stake in Wain Homes, the recently-floated Northern house builder, plus a raft of properties and a racecourse. When the receivers were called in to John Ashcroft's high-flying Coloroll, Hemmings was one of the first to pick up the more valuable pieces and it seems only a matter of time before his son of Coloroll re-emerges on the stock market. Given Hemmings undoubted flair for wheeling and dealing for his own private account, one wonders how he finds time for his day job running S&amp;N's leisure and property interests.</p>

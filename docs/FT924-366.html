			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Trade rags a rich read for the anxious investor - Harry Hopkins discovers a mine of information in the specialist papers ALL private investors will be familiar with those lengthy periods between Annual General Meetings when the Chairman appears to have taken a vow of silence, and the anxious questions pile up. This could be the time to turn to the British trade press, that vast mine of curious information, multiplying and flourishing as never before. There can be few areas uncovered. The 'Hotels and Catering' section of Willings Press Guide alone lists more than 27 titles. Is the investor in Harry Ramsden's growing chain of fish and chip palaces - which has now reached Hong Kong - beginning to feel anxious? To what better quarter could he or she turn for pointers than to the weekly Fish Fryers Gazette published for almost 70 years in Leeds. For long-suffering shareholders hunting for signs of revival 'Building and Contracting' offers choice of well over a hundred magazines, with four competing on roofing alone. The doyen, handsomely produced and wide-ranging, is Building, which under its earlier name, The Builder, has been chronicling booms and slumps, triumphs and disasters, for well over one and a half centuries. For the diligent investor it will still yield its regular trawl of projects, tenders, contracts and bankruptcies, but the premature optimist will receive small comfort. 'Only the lobotomised are cheerful now,' began a recent editorial, announcing 'more bad news'. The magazine's profile series was grimly titled 'Despatches from the Front' - all useful groundwork for those planning to buy building shares for recovery. It is this touch of the nitty-gritty which can make the trade press such an excellent antidote to the more bland approach of financial analysts, to whom all shares may look like statistical constructs. In the pages of trade papers nothing emerges more clearly than the fact that each industry has its own atmosphere and style, and that it could be important to know this. Students of the UK travel trade gazette, for instance, could hardly fail to see that what is being described here is a battlefield, in which no quarter is given to hold the line of market share, whatever the cost. To navigate this vast and unfamiliar sea, the investor may turn for charts to Willings Press Guide, stocked by public reference libraries of any size. The classified index will lead to individual paper entries citing circulation figures target audience and sometimes offering 'summary of contents'. A big sale figure will often - but by no means always - indicate the paper's usefulness. For the browsing investor it might be worth making a distinction between 'wide focus' and the more narrowly targeted weeklies. For instance Retail Week ranges over the business of the whole of the high street from Dixons to Habitat by way of Boots, keeping shareholders in many companies in touch with trends showing up there. A moving panorama of social history, Super Marketing can offer the alert investor many signs and portents. 'Small dogs take the lead', ran a headline in the aftermath to the Rottweiler scares, pointing out that a Irish wolfhound had been shown by research to eat 35 times more than a Yorkshire terrier, which might seem a fact worth weighing by investors in pet food companies. However, confidence was restored when experts demonstrated how the position was being restored with premium brands, 'life cycle' cans for puppy, adult, mature, and 'senior' dogs, new flavours and niches - vegetarian, organic and herbal. More narrowly focused, though with three times the sale, is the old established Grocer, organised by commodities, or the ebullient news-hungry Motor Trader - 'Profiling the Recession Beaters' - with many forewarnings for investors in this key sector. More peripheral, yet giving out signals usefully further ahead, are papers such as Campaign, anticipating advertising campaigns, PR Week, or Marketing, a recent issue running a story about 'M &amp; S jumping on the discounting band waggon' which might give pause to shareholders in Burton, C &amp; A, John Lewis and others which the paper pointed out - 'had already played the discounting card'. Whereas brokers' analysts may pay the occasional planned visit to plants, trade papers have the advantage of keeping their special fields under continuous surveillance over the years. Some have become the bibles of their trade. Thus, the weekly Pharmaceutical Journal has been putting wonder drugs - and not so wonderful drugs - under scrutiny across the counter ever since 1841 and commenting on the results in its pages. The trade daily, the Morning Advertiser, has been reflecting the licensed victuallers trade from behind the pub counter since 1784, while, going back another 50 years, trade paper Lloyds List International, possibly Britain's oldest newspaper, is no longer confined to ship movements and sinkings, but offers investors an up to date compendium of news of oil exploration, the great insurance companies, shipbuilding and trade currents all over the world, not to mention the vicissitudes of the newspaper industry.</p>

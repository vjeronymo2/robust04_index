			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Israelis, Palestinians split on economic policy DEEP divisions are emerging between Palestinians and Israelis over economic policy, the lifting of the Arab economic boycott of Israel and the trade regime which will exist between the two sides. At the heart of the disagreement is an Israeli demand that the Palestinians harmonise their tax and customs regime with the high levels in force in Israel, which reflect Israel's protection policies and the government's need to raise substantial revenues to meet its public expenditure. Israel is hoping for the creation of a customs union which would develop into an economic confederation between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian entity. The Palestinians firmly reject the idea of a customs union. They also believe it is too early to call for the suspension of the Arab boycott against Israel, which Jerusalem feels it should have in return for taking a big step towards peace, and say a more comprehensive regional agreement and details of the Palestinian interim period of self-government must be finalised first. The divisions were highlighted yesterday at a joint press conference by Mr Samir Abdallah, director of the Palestinian delegation to the multilateral talks on economic matters, and Mr Dan Proper, President of the Israeli Manufacturers' Association. The Palestinians feel that a customs union would drag them into protectionism and excessive taxation, making goods too expensive for Palestinians who have a per capita income less than 20 per cent of Israel's. Mr Abdallah said the Palestinians wanted the terms of trade between the occupied territories and Israel to be changed to free and open movement of goods and people, and more competition. The Palestinians opposed a customs union because of the different structure and priorities of the two economies, and wanted to develop freely their external trade relations. Israel, he added, would have to work hard to reduce its costs of production. The Israelis have warned that unless there is a customs union Israel would have to consider border controls to stop the movement and smuggling of cheap goods from the Palestinian economy into Israel. 'If you create different levels of customs and taxes you will be creating borders and controls where the difference will have to be paid and where Israel would have to stop the free flow of goods,' Mr Proper said. One area affected by the dispute is agriculture. Mr Proper said a three-year sliding scale of quantitative curbs on exports of Palestinian agricultural produce into Israel would have to be brought in, especially in eggs and poultry, livestock and some vegetables, to protect Israeli producers. The European Community could help to provide open markets for Palestinian agricultural products during the three-year period while protection was phased out. Mr Abdallah warned that Israeli curbs on Palestinian agricultural exports would provoke reciprocal protection arrangements on industrial products. The Palestinians had decided to introduce the Jordanian dinar as legal tender in the Palestinian entity to insulate it against the depreciation of the Israeli shekel and against Israeli inflation, currently 10 per cent. They wanted to pursue a 'liberal' monetary account, similar to the Ecu, as a way of issuing bonds to mobilise Palestinian financial resources, but believed it was too early to re-introduce the Palestinian currency as a means of exchange. Mr Proper said that once economic issues were solved, a Middle East trading bloc of 200m people lay ahead.</p>

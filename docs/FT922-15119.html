			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: LWT shows strong growth to Pounds 25m LWT (Holdings), the franchise holder for London weekend television, yesterday announced a 21 per cent increase in profits and appealed for a relaxation of rules governing the take over of television companies. At present large ITV companies can only acquire the smallest commercial concerns. 'We think it would be reasonable to relax restrictions on big companies being able to take over medium sized companies and let the market decide whether that is appropriate,' said Mr Christopher Bland, chairman. 'The limits on takeovers of medium or even large companies should be set by market share of advertising - about 25 per cent.' The attack on present restrictions came as Mr Bland announced that LWT had beaten the trend and the recession to increase pre-tax profits for 1991 by 21.5 per cent, from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 25.2m. Earnings per share rose 23 per cent, from 14.9p to 18.3p basic and from 13p to 16p fully diluted. Turnover fell from Pounds 275.7m to Pounds 260.5m. The fixed preferred dividend is raised by 50 per cent to 5.91p - the last increase possible before the share conversion scheme matures in autumn 1993. If the share price reaches 278p by then - and it rose 5p to 263p yesterday - Mr Bland and Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive, will be able to exercise options worth several million pounds, as will, to a lesser extent, 38 other executives. Mr Bland said yesterday he thought the chances of being able to exercise the options 'reasonably strong.' LWT has been able to increase profits against a background of three years of flat advertising revenue in the UK - a decline in real terms. It had also reduced debt by Pounds 17m to Pounds 27m over the year. Part of the answer has come from cutting costs. Staff numbers have fallen by more than 40 per cent since 1988 to 723 full time at the moment. The numbers will continue to fall but not drastically. At the same time it has increased its share of network and London advertising helped by successful drama. The company, which claimed the highest margins in ITV, said it attracted more viewers from the managerial and professional ABC1 groups than the BBC, and that 30 per cent of its weekend peak time ratings came from its own programmes rather than the rest of the ITV network. LWT retained its franchise against opposition with a surprisingly low bid of Pounds 7.58m. Mr John Scaife, media analyst at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said yesterday that LWT had taken costs out early and that when the economy improved would be taking money in 'in buckets.' Mr Bland forecast that 'some high bidders will find it difficult to survive on their own.' See Lex</p>

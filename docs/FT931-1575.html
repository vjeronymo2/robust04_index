			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke to reduce size of police authorities SMALLER and more businesslike police authorities will lead a drive for better performance and value-for-money under proposals announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, yesterday. He told the Commons he planned to devolve responsibility within police forces to 'local police units who will be directly accountable to their local communities,' cutting out unnecessary headquarters and management tiers. But, under pressure from cabinet colleagues and chief constables, he is moving cautiously on possible amalgamations between the 43 English and Welsh forces. There will be no immediate mergers but Mr Clarke intends to simplify statutory procedures 'to allow for amalgamations when the time is right'. Yesterday's proposals form part of a review of the Pounds 6bn-a-year police service aimed at improving its managerial and operational efficiency. The next phase is due in May when a committee of inquiry into police responsibilities and rewards under Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT industries, produces its report. This is likely to recommend a simplified rank structure and performance-related pay. Police authorities comprise two thirds local councillors and one third magistrates. Mr Clarke envisages much smaller 16-strong bodies - eight councillors, three magistrates, and five business people and others appointed by the home secretary. The home secretary would appoint the authority's chair from among the 16. A police authority for London will be created. At present, the home secretary is responsible for the Metropolitan Police. Mr Clarke told the Commons that the funding structure, with central and local government contributing to police costs, would continue in broadly the same proportions as now. The central government contribution would be cash-limited while the local portion would be subjected to local government expenditure controls. But police forces would have greater freedom to decide how to spend and manage their resources. Mr Clarke intends to set national objectives for the police service, while police authorities will produce local performance targets. The results will be published so that the public can compare forces' performance. The proposals will be addressed in detail in a white paper in June, followed by legislation. Mr Clarke's plans to reduce local authority representation on police authorities, and add his own appointees, is likely to prove the most controversial aspect of the package. MPs gave a cautious welcome to the proposals, but Mr Clarke was warned from both sides of the House not to follow a 'bigger is better' concept in initiating amalgamations to reduce the duplication of headquarters and other facilities. Mr Clarke refused to be drawn about the likelihood of the City of London force continuing as a separate entity, insisting that he had not begun to consider the number of likely amalagamations. He emphasised that the more powerful and businesslike police authorities envisaged would be able to decide how to apportion their budgets between expenditure on manpower and equipment.

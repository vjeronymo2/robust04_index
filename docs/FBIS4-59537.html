			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo--In exclusive statements to AL-ITTIHAD,  'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, former Yemeni foreign minister and head  of the Political Directorate of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP], stressed that he informed Arab League Secretary General  'Ismat 'Abd- al-Majid yesterday that 'Ali Salim al-Bid accepts  any measures the Arab League and the Arab countries will take to  stop the war in Yemen. He also said that interest in stopping  the war is not considered interference in his country's internal  affairs. He also underlined that the YSP has no intention of  seceding and denied that foreign parties were behind the start  of the fighting.    Al-Dali said the problem is that there is a party that does  not want to implement the first part of the pledge and accord  document which concerns the security and military situation.</p>

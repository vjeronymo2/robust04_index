			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Fragile reappearance of customer confidence  -Flames of hope spark sharp rally in share prices of leading motor companies ONE OF the purest recovery plays in the stock market is the motor trade. Car dealers proved particularly vulnerable to high interest rates, which raised their financing costs and reduced custom. Now that 'double whammy' has flipped into reverse. Share prices of the leading quoted groups have outperformed the market by nearly 40 per cent over the past three months - the flames of hope fanned by the revival of interest in smaller, UK-orientated, companies. This year sales of new cars are forecast to rise by about 7 per cent to 1.7m. It would reverse a trend which has seen the market fall from a record 2.3m in 1989 to less than 1.6m in both 1991 and 1992. The picture also looks better for used cars as the lower levels of new car sales feed through into a shortage of quality second-hand ones. If firmer demand can be used to improve profit margins from the niggardly 1 to 2 per cent brought about by widespread discounting, bottom lines could revive quite rapidly. However, most of these rosy factors are for the future. Few of the motor traders due to report 1992 results over the next few weeks will show a rebound in their figures. Two exceptions are T Cowie and Lex Service. Cowie, which has a substantial fleet leasing operation - and hence substantial debt - went through the fire in 1990 when pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 9m. Interest costs soared to Pounds 44.6m and the dividend was cut. Profit is estimated to have recovered to Pounds 23m last year - not far short of the Pounds 25.8m peak recorded in 1988. Lex, which slumped to Pounds 500,000 pre-tax in 1991 and cut the dividend, is expected to have bounced back to Pounds 25m. The group's exit from electronic components has proved highly profitable through a residual investment in Arrow of the US. Payments from Volvo to end an import agreement have cleared debts and allowed the Pounds 46m purchase of Swan National to boost the dealership network. While these two put most of their troubles behind them, one or two others - such as Pendragon and Reg Vardy - have limited the recessionary damage and enhanced their managerial reputations. More commonly, however, motor traders' profits have remained bogged down. Among the laggards is Appleyard Group, one of the oldest names. Its expansion ran out of steam after the purchase of Ian Skelly in 1989. In 1991 profits slumped to Pounds 1.81m and the dividend was uncovered. The figures may be worse for 1992 and a dividend cut is feared. Companies which disappointed at the interim stage included Evans Halshaw and Perry Group, while Lookers was more than 40 per cent down at the pre-tax level in the year to September. But even the laggards have outperformed the market. Apart from the recovery arguments, a number of other issues have gingered up the sector and should continue to do so. The first is takeover talk. Popular choices of predator are Cowie and Lex. The former tried unsuccessfully to acquire Henlys in a hostile bid last year, but remains keen to expand both its dealership network and its leasing fleet - the latter from 60,000 to 100,000 cars. Nor has Lex made any secret of its expansion plans, with the priority going to car retail. A substantial deal could propel it to the top of the motor retail league, as monitored by the magazine Automotive Management. The two organisations ahead of it are Inchcape's UK motor retail operation, a small part of an international concern, and Automotive and Financial Group (AFG), controlled by Mr Octav Botnar. Inchcape has cut dealerships from 110 to 87 since last March's takeover of TKM. AFG has had to react to the loss of the Nissan franchise by finding replacements. Turning to the mooted acquisition targets, the most frequently cited are Appleyard, Lookers and Perry Group, all quoted, and Dutton Forshaw, part of Lonrho. The background to the speculation is that the sector remains fragmented. The long list of quoted motor traders only accounts for a small portion of the market. Last year saw a fair amount of consolidation. Apart from the Inchcape-TKM and Lex-Swan deals, Hartwell won control of Trimoco, and emergent motor groups - such as European Motor Holdings and Sanderson Murray &amp; Elder - added to their portfolios. An advantage the smaller groups have is that they have some way to go before bumping up against the limits imposed by Ford, which still has about 22 per cent of the new car market. Hartwell was left with 12 Ford dealerships after the Trimoco takeover, four more than Ford's limit. Ford says agreement has been reached for four to be sold off. It is sticking to its rules, which also limit location, in spite of criticism of manufacturers' restrictions in a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report published last year. Ford's stance, which contrasts with Rover and Vauxhall's modified approaches, also has a bearing on another big issue in the motor trade: multi-franchising. This involves a company selling a variety of makes of new car either on one site or from a local network of sites. Evans Halshaw, for instance, is developing two multi-franchise sites in the Birmingham area. One is orientated towards Japanese makes, the other will bring together Vauxhall, Rover and Toyota. Currie Motors, on the other hand, which has nine showrooms in London, has recently switched from Ford to five new franchises, although there will be only one brand of new car available at each site. Ford argues that multi-franchising will enable local dealerships to be concentrated in too few hands, and that it will compromise after sales service - in terms of the range of parts carried and the skill of fitters. As about 28 per cent of cars on UK roads are Fords, the after-sales operation has considerable weight. This is not the case with the Japanese makes, which are not yet around in sufficient numbers. However, the build-up of UK-made Japanese cars is a big issue in the new car market. Mr Rob Golding, motors analyst at SG Warburg, says Japanese cars are forecast to increase their share from 11 to 25 per cent by 1996. A key factor is that fleet buyers will increasingly consider the home-grown models  -and corporate sales account for 60 per cent of the new car market. This has led motor traders to queue up for Japanese franchises, although the weak after-sales outlook has led Cowie, for instance, to utter reservations about 'rushing in in a big way'. While the Japanese build-up offers a long-term opportunity, the dealers' immediate attention will be focused on the Budget. Mr Golding says the money which the Treasury has given up in car sales tax will be raised from motorists in some other way. Given the level of recovery hope in the share prices, there is a fear that increased road tax or petrol duty could hinder the fragile reappearance of customer confidence and make 1993 another year of disappointment.</p>

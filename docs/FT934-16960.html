			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Milan judges recover funds in Switzerland MAGISTRATES in Milan have recovered more than L100bn (Pounds 41.4m) placed in Swiss banks by Italians involved in corruption scandals. The magistrates have gained access to these funds by devising a scheme that is quick and avoids Swiss sensitivities about accounts being opened to foreign investigators. It is based on the tactic, already widely used by the city's magistrates, of plea-bargaining with those accused of bribery and corruption. When confessing, the accused are asked to identify illicit funds held outside Italy and then to sign a power of attorney for them to be collected. Until now, Italian magistrates claim to have faced resistance by Swiss authorities in tracing and gaining access to funds alleged to be held in Switzerland. The Swiss judiciary has blamed Italians for overloading it with unnecessary and poorly edited documents. The new procedure has speeded investigations by avoiding the need to send bulky documentation to the Swiss authorities. At least six people are thought to have co-operated thus. Among them is Mr Duilio Poggiolini, a former senior civil servant in the health ministry, who last week told magistrates he had SFr11m (Pounds 5m) in Switzerland and an estimated L200bn in gold at one of his Italian properties. The Swiss funds are being collected by lawyers for the accused, then deposited in an escrow account in Milan. The magistrates are reported confident of recovering more, which raises the issue of the real ownership of the money once it is proved to have been obtained illicitly. Some citizens' rights groups have already suggested claiming the money on the grounds it belongs to the taxpayer. Milan magistrates are also believed to be negotiating the return to Italy of Mr Enrico Braggiotti, a former chairman of the state-controlled Banca Commerciale Italiana, in the hope they can gain access to an alleged sum of Dollars 50.2m (Pounds 33.3m). An international arrest warrant was last month issued for Mr Braggiotti, for alleged corruption related to the Enimont affair - the reorganisation of the Italian chemicals industry involving Eni, the state oil concern, and Ferruzzi's Montedison, then headed by Mr Raul Gardini. According to usually reliable extracts of transcripts of evidence, leaked to the weekly magazines L'Espresso and Panorama, Mr Pino Berlini, in charge of the Ferruzzi family's offshore finances, arranged for a total of Dollars 50.2m to be paid to Mr Braggiotti in 1989-90. The funds are alleged to have come from offshore Montedisdon monies and were transferred on the orders of the late Mr Gardini in return for favours granted by Mr Braggiotti at Banca Commerciale.</p>

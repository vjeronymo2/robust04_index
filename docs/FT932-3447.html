			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Trust banks IN reference to a report in the Financial Times on June 1, Japan's seven trust banks say they did not change their accounting procedures, and counted as revenue only cash received on their trust accounts, and did not utilise accrued basis accounting methods. The banks attribute their improved operating profits for the year ending in March to favourable margins on interest rates, which fell during the period, and to cost cutting.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Paymaster-General's Office to be agency THE Paymaster-General's Office, which provides the Treasury with various financial services, is to become an executive agency on April 1. The change will mean greater autonomy for the organisation, but it will also face tough financial and service-quality targets. The office employs the equivalent of 850 full-time staff to: Administer and pay public-service pensions. Provide public-sector banking services. Supply the Treasury and the Central Statistical Office with information on public expenditure. The post of chief executive will retain the title of assistant paymaster-general. The title of paymaster-general is a ministerial one, held by Sir John Cope, Treasury minister. The office was at one time responsible for handling civil servants' pay. This is now the responsibility of individual departments and agencies, many of which use the Treasury's Chessington computer centre in south London, which is also being prepared to become an agency.</p>

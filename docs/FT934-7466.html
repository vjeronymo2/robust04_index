			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Hong Kong aids C&amp;W advance CABLE &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, reported a 30 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 509m on the back of strong performance by Hong Kong Telecom. International traffic from the colony was up 24 per cent on last year, with a net addition of 80,000 exchange lines. Traffic with China increased by 32 per cent, representing nearly half of total international traffic. C&amp;W's results, for the six months to September 30, were lifted by exchange rate movements, without which pre-tax profits were up about 10 per cent. Turnover advanced 34 per cent to Pounds 2.33bn, with Hong Kong Telecom - 57 per cent owned by C&amp;W - accounting for nearly half, as well as most of the advance in profits. Mercury, C&amp;W's UK subsidiary, increased turnover by 24 per cent to Pounds 701m (Pounds 567m). C&amp;W claimed that demand for Mercury One-2-One, its cellular mobile joint venture with US West launched in the London area in September, was outstripping the availability of handsets. Lord Young of Graffham, chairman, said Dixons, the electronics retailer, had wanted 20,000 to sell in the Christmas period. However, at Pounds 99m Mercury's operating profit was only 5 per cent ahead of last year. Profits were depressed by the building of networks, including One-2-One, the cost of launching Mercury's fixed-wire service into the domestic market, a Pounds 5m contribution to the pension fund, and failure to agree a inter-connect deal with BT, which will provide Mercury with a rebate backdated to June 1992. Lord Young said Mercury intended to pioneer a wireless local network, linking existing 'fixed-wire' subscribers to its long-distance network. At least two pilots are scheduled for next year. If successful, the initiative could enable Mercury to by-pass BT entirely, intensifying UK competition. Hong Kong Telecom will trial a video-on-demand service next year, which also has implications for the UK market, where BT plans a video service. Lord Young said China remained C&amp;W's medium-term priority. Earnings per share rose to 11.1p (9p). An interim dividend of 2.6p per share was declared, a 9 per cent increase on last year.

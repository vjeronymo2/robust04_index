			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK's use of the democratic system going wrong somewhere Sir, As is common to most of those who bemoan the Tories' 'steady, purposive and highly effective destruction of local democracy', Joe Rogaly ('Dustbin-lids to the fore', February 15) omits to mention that local democratic government is for most voters just as unaccountable as central government. In that light the end result is much more important than the route by which it is reached. Hence the 'pretty picture' which Mr Rogaly suggests is conveyed by the mandarins, of schools run by school boards and of hospitals run by hospital trusts is far more than superficially appealing to the consumers involved. In many historically Labour-controlled areas there is a justified feeling of disenfranchisement among non-Labour voters. This feeling is now in danger of taking root at national level among those who did not vote for the present government. Democracy, or our use of it, is going wrong somewhere, but whether this is the failure of the system in a structural sense or results from the inadequacy of politicians to present viable alternatives to their electorate is open to debate.

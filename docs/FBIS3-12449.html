And he warned of the  threat of civil war.    The Yemeni official said at a press conference in Abu Dhabi  following his meeting with Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan,  president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE], that "the document  will not see the light of day in practice except in the areas  which fall under YSP influence." He also said that Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid will not go to Sanaa except after  the implementation of the document begins.    The Yemeni Presidential Council member -- who visited the  UAE  in the framework of a tour designed to explain the horizons of  the Yemeni crisis after the signing of the Pledge and Accord  Document -- added that "there are those who are helping to  bolster military action and military option tendencies and to  turn the tables on all parties." He praised Shaykh Zayid  Bin-Sultan's understanding of conditions in Yemen. He said that  "without securing a new mechanism to implement this document, it  will remain in the drawer." He broached the experiment of the  past four years, saying that "it has caused us to believe that  signing is not the important step, but, rather, implementation  and starting implementation."    He described the incidents which have occurred over the past  two days in Abyan Governorate as "designed to torpedo the Yemeni  people's prospects after the signing of the document." He said  that "the document is not a medical prescription to remedy the  Yemeni crisis. The crisis needs mutual and united efforts from  all political parties and from all sincere people who want to  spare Yemen a civil war and the road of violence, terrorism, and  fragmentation."    Salim Salih Muhammad stressed that "'Ali Salim al-Bid, YSP  secretary general and vice president, will not go to Sanaa under  the present security situation unless this situation is resolved  and armed troops are withdrawn from the cities and unless  credibility regarding what has been agreed upon is proved."    Asked whether that means that the document is merely ink on  paper, the Yemeni official said: "It will be so if it remains  in the drawer, if the situation remains as it stands, and if the  Armed Forces and security forces continue to detonate the  situation here and there."    He stressed that the document "will not see the light of day  in practice except in the areas which fall under YSP influence."    Asked about the benefit of signing the document when the  disputes are still there, Salim Salih said that "the signing is  binding on all parties, and it exposes any parties that refuse  to implement the document. At then the people will know who  does not want to implement it."    He added: "It is clear that there are those who are helping  to bolster the military action and military option tendencies.  They want to turn the table on all the parties. This is what  we want the brothers, friends, and the Yemeni people to be aware  of."    Salim Salih Muhammad accused "some military commanders and  other forces of supporting this tendency." He said that "the  testimonies of those arrested pointed to the existence of these  forces, which help, support, and sometimes embrace elements  which have returned from Afghanistan and elements accused of  carrying out bombing operations and assassinations and recently  abducting three Chinese engineers."    On the nature of the disagreements which emerged in Amman  after the signing of the document and prevented the return of  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid  to Sanaa, accompanied by King Husayn of Jordan, Salim Salih  Muhammad pointed out that "what was agreed upon in Amman is only  what is mentioned in the published document. However, there  were some issues which needed to be discussed. But regrettably,  the brothers in some parties, including the General People's  Congress and the Reform Grouping, did not give us the  opportunity to do so." He added that the YSP submitted a  working paper about what should be done after the signing, "but  they refused even to read it."    Salim Salih Muhammad urged all parties on the Yemeni scene  to  take account of current changes and to work together to spare  the Yemeni people the threat of civil war and fragmentation,  secure whatever guarantees stability and development, and  implement the various political, economic, and social plans.    He stressed that the YSP leadership is working to bolster  Yemeni unity; it is not seeking separation. However, he warned  that "unless matters are resolved fairly and rights are returned  to their claimants, and unless local government is implemented,  powers allocated, and a clear relationship between Sanaa and the  other governorates and regions secured, we will find ourselves  in a different position. What we fear is for Yemen to turn into  more than one part, not just north and south, as was the  situation in the past. Because changes have imposed on us new  realities in relations and in understanding people."    On his visit to Kuwait -- the first by a Yemeni official  since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 -- Salim  Salih described this visit as "a good start in the framework of  establishing normal relations between the two countries." He  also said that "for our part, we presented our view to normalize  relations between the two countries."    He expressed his hope that Kuwait will transcend the deep  wound with regard to Yemen's official positions during the Gulf  war. he said, "we as brothers should transcend the past and  look to the future."    He stressed that current conditions in the region, including  the efforts to secure a solution to the Palestinian issue and  the Arab-Israeli conflict, require the achievement of a degree  of Arab solidarity. He expected Kuwait to embark in the period  ahead on steps toward normalizing its relations with a number of  states. He described the results of 'Ali Salim al-Bid's visits  to Egypt and Syria as good, saying they have achieved their  results at all levels.</p>

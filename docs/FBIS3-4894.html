			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sony Magnetic Products (Thailand) will use Thailand  as a production base for Southeast Asia for its video and audio  compact cassettes. Hiroshi Takauchi, president, said the  company's plant currently has an annual production capacity of  49 million audio and 13.4 million video cassettes. The plant  occupies 52,000 square metres of land at Ladkrabang industrial  estate. Its registered capital is Bt272 million and it employs  540 staff.    He said the company has invested [yen] Y400 million to  increase capacity to 107 million audio and 20 million video  cassettes. The firm is in the process of installing machines  and expects to begin production in October this year.    He said the company currently exports 98 per cent of output  to Europe, Japan, the US and Southeast Asia. Europe is the  biggest market for exports, accounting for more than 50 per cent  of the total volume, followed by Southeast Asia with 30 per  cent, Japan with 10 per cent and the US, 10 per cent.    The company plans to increase domestic sales to 20 per cent  of total sales. Audio cassettes will be the major products,  which should account for 70 per cent of the domestic sales. He  said the domestic market is affected by "dumped" products from  Korea and Taiwan. For Sony, several components and raw  materials have to be imported from Japan resulting in higher  costs.    For fiscal 1993 which will end next month, the company  expected exports of Bt1 billion. It hopes to increase sales 150  per cent by the end of 1994. He said the company also suffered  from the strengthening of the yen which raised costs by 5 per  cent.    The company plans to invest Y50 million to shift production  of small parts of audio and video cassettes to Thailand. Three  or four items will be produced here this year. Local production  will reduce costs by 3 per cent. Some components such as  punching dies and mold dies cannot be produced domestically.  The company is looking for supporting industries to supply  these components to the plant. Thailand will be a production  base for Sony in Southeast Asia. He said Thai staff can meet  Sony's standards but a shortage of infrastructure such as roads  and communications is still a problem.</p>

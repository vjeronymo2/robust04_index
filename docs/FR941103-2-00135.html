			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Applicants do not request relief under section 12(d)(1) of the Act. Section 12(d)(1) limits purchases by registered investment companies of securities issued by other investment companies. Section 12(d)(1) (E) provides, however, that section 12(d)(1) shall not apply to securities purchased by a registered unit investment trust if the securities are the only ``investment securities'' held by the trust. Applicants believe that the U.S. Treasury zero coupon obligations are not ``investment securities'' for purposes of section 12(d)(1) (E) <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  and that the Fund shares are the only ``investment securities'' which the Trust will hold. Accordingly, they do not believe relief from section 12(d)(1) is necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Equity Securities Trust, (pub. avail.

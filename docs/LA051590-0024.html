			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> NBC Called on Clay: Phones were ringing off the hook at NBC's Burbank and New  York offices after the appearence of comedy bad boy Andrew Dice Clay on  "Saturday Night Live." The two offices received 1,764 calls against Clay and  198 in his favor in what was probably the highest number of pre-show protests  in the program's 15-year history, NBC officials said. Clay apparently brought  its largest audience all season -- an 11.6 rating and a 31% share of the  audience in the 24-city overnight Nielsens, NBC said. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

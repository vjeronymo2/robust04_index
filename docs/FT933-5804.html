			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Western Mining disciplines director THE BOARD of Western Mining Corporation, the Australian metals producer, has taken the rare step of publicly disciplining the company's managing director, Mr Hugh Morgan, over the loss of a mining lease earlier this year. The disciplinary action was announced yesterday by Sir Arvi Parbo, WMC chairman, following an internal inquiry into the loss of the mining lease, known as Ernest Henry, which is expected to reduce the company's annual earnings by ADollars 20m (USDollars 13.50m). Sir Arvi's statement said that Mr Morgan, one of Australia's highest-profile businessmen, accepted managerial responsibility in the matter and would not be eligible for the company's senior officers' share plan for two years. 'Mr Morgan is further required to minimise his involvement in outside activities to enable him to concentrate on the implementation of the actions decided upon by the board,' Sir Arvi said. The announcement was viewed in Australia yesterday as a humiliating rebuff for Mr Morgan's strident management style and outspokenness on a range of issues including the mining industry's relationship with aboriginals. WMC lost the Ernest Henry lease to a small Australian mining company, Savage Resources. The lease is now almost certain to be developed into a copper mine by Savage and its new partner MIM Holdings, a mining rival to WMC. The WMC board has also disciplined Mr C. N. Middleton, the exploration manager most directly responsible for the lost mining area, and two senior exploration executives, Mr D. N. Harley and Mr R. Woodall. But the enquiry found that none of the company's officers behaved in a manner which required dismissal. The company has indicated that it would be making procedural changes, especially in its exploration division.</p>

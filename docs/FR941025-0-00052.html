			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment objected to the requirement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;65.14(e)(1) that the community submit, as part of its application for designation of AR Zones, a statement whether the flood protection system is the subject of pending litigation or administrative actions. FEMA believes that the information is pertinent to FEMA's determination whether the restoration project is viable and likely to be completed in accordance with the restoration plan required in &sect;65.14(e)(7). An affirmative response would not necessarily result in FEMA's denial of the community's application. It is imperative that FEMA be aware of any and all existing and potential obstacles to the timely restoration of a flood protection system so that the Director can accurately evaluate a community's application for designation of AR Zones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were raised regarding the application requirement in &sect;65.14(e)(5) that the community applicant submit a feasibility study performed by a Federal agency that deems that the flood protection system is restorable. Several comments observed that the term ``feasibility study'' as used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is a specific document within the framework of the project planning process, and depending on the type of restoration project, a feasibility study may not always be performed. Other comments were concerned about the length of time that may be required to prepare a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers feasibility study and the associated delay in the community's eligibility for AR Zone designation. At least one comment suggested that for projects sponsored by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a ``reconnaissance'' level study would provide the assurances that FEMA requires by demonstrating a Federal interest in the project that would restore a minimum 100-year level protection and which would identify a local sponsor for the restoration project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim final rule has been revised to delete the reference to ``feasibility study'' at &sect;65.14(e)(5) and instead to refer to a study performed by a federal agency that would demonstrate that there is a federal interest in the restoration of the system and that it is deemed to be feasible to restore the system to provide at least 100-year protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment suggested that the application requirement to submit a feasibility study would delay the community's eligibility for AR Zone designation which would be contrary to legislative intent. This comment implies that community eligibility for an AR Zone designation should follow immediately after the decertification of the existing flood protection system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The eligibility requirements contained in the statute refer to a level of activity that would not likely be in place as soon as the system was decertified. Therefore, FEMA anticipates that communities would be mapped as special flood hazard areas with flood elevations (AE Zones), until such time as the progress on the restoration of the flood protection system reached a point that would meet the eligibility requirements for AR Zone designation. This process is similar to the process used to designate A99 Zones under provisions in the NFIP regulations at 44 CFR 61.12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments objected to the certification requirement in &sect;65.14(e)(6) that the design and construction of the restoration project involve Federal funds in order for the community to be eligible for AR Zone designation. One specific comment noted that the statute does not specify a Federal flood protection system. As stated in the supplementary information of the proposed rule, the existing FEMA regulations, 44 CFR 61.12, limit A99 Zone designation to communities that have made adequate progress on the construction of a flood protection system involving Federal funds. Requiring that the restoration project involve Federal funds is consistent with the existing regulatory provisions of &sect;61.12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the statute provided for floodplain management provisions that permit development in flood control restoration zones to take place at elevations below the base flood elevation (BFE) that would apply in the absence of a flood protection system. Not only will new structures be exposed to increased flood risk until the flood protection system is fully restored, but those same new structures can be insured at less than actuarial rates. The insurance subsidy established in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was originally intended for the benefit of those who built without knowledge of the risk. In contrast, the subsidy for AR Zone designations is extended to those who are aware, or ought to be aware, of the increased risk. This special consideration is granted on the specific assumption that the increased risk is temporary and will be mitigated in the near term. Therefore, in extending the subsidy in the AR Zones, there has to be a high degree of assurance that the restoration project will be completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Part 32_Uniform System Accounts for Telecommunications Companies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 50. We reject the parties' requests that we amend our accounting rules to require carriers providing video dialtone to segregate all video plant investment in new Part 32 accounts or separate subaccounts. Part 32 accounting rules were designed to create a stable basic account structure that would not require modifications as technologies, services, or reporting requirements change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 51. We further conclude that, in the case of video dialtone, our regulatory information needs can be satisfied without making permanent changes to the accounting system at this time. Because it would help our monitoring effort and tariff review process to have a record of LEC video dialtone costs, we hereby require that LECs offering video dialtone identify all video dialtone costs by establishing two sets of subsidiary accounting records: one to capture the revenues, investments and expenses wholly dedicated to video dialtone, the other to capture any revenues, investments and expenses that are shared between video dialtone and the provision of other services. These accounting records will also assist state regulators in assuring that video dialtone costs are not improperly included in local rates. LECs authorized to provide video dialtone must file a summary of these subsidiary records with the Commission on a quarterly basis. All video dialtone Section 214 authorizations will be conditioned upon compliance with this requirement. We delegate to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, the authority to determine the content and format of the subsidiary accounting records as well as the quarterly reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 3. Part 64_Separation of Regulated and Nonregulated Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 52. We reject claims that we should amend Part 64 because current rules would not prevent LECs from improperly subsidizing video dialtone nonregulated services. To the contrary, we conclude that existing Part 64 rules do not require modification to prevent such an outcome. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 53. The Joint Cost  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> rules set forth in Part 64 were formulated to accommodate new enhanced services offerings in an increasingly competitive telecommunications environment. Part 64, for the most part, does not prescribe cost categories or allocation factors. Rather, each carrier selects, subject to public comment and Commission review, the cost pools and allocators it needs to identify the costs of all of its nonregulated activities. The Commission chose this approach because it believed that the mix of nonregulated activities and the organizational structure would vary widely from carrier to carrier, and that a single, prescribed manual could not adequately encompass the possible variations. No party has shown that video dialtone-related nonregulated products and services will exhibit, initially, less variety than other nonregulated activities, or will be more amenable to uniform treatment. Similarly, parties that object to the aggregation of video dialtone-related nonregulated costs with the costs of other nonregulated activities fail to explain what valid regulatory purpose of this Commission would be served by revisiting our determination in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Joint Cost Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 52 FR 6557 (March 4, 1987), to avoid product-specific cost allocations to nonregulated products and services. Therefore, we decline to promulgate video dialtone-specific cost allocation rules for nonregulated activities related to video dialtone service at this time. However, we may require uniformity in the video dialtone cost allocation procedures in the future as we gain experience with video dialtone services and LEC Part 32 subsidiary accounting records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

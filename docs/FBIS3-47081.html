"As of today, we still intend to unveil it by around January  20," the government's top spokesman told a news conference.    He cited the talks among the ruling parties and Diet debate  on political reform as potential stumbling blocks to the release  of the new measures to stoke up the languishing Japanese economy.    Asked if the package will include income tax cuts, Takemura  said the government will take high public expectations of such  cuts into account in working out details of the pump-priming  measures.    Earlier Monday, a government source predicted the government  will have to delay the announcement of the additional stimulus  measures beyond January 20 because of conflicting views in the  coalition on whether the consumption tax, now standing at 3  percent, should be raised to finance proposed income tax cuts.    The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  timing of the announcement of the income tax reduction should be  decided by February 11, when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is  scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.</p>

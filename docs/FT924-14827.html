			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Caretaker PM to oversee Korean election SOUTH Korea's President Roh Tae-woo yesterday picked a university president to head a neutral cabinet that will preside over December's presidential election. The opposition parties welcomed the choice of Mr Hyun Soong-jong, 73, (pictured above) a law professor and president of Hallym University. President Roh last month promised the appointment of a neutral caretaker cabinet to persuade the opposition to end its three-month boycott of the National Assembly. The two opposition parties wanted guarantees that the government would not use its agencies to influence the presidential election in favour of the ruling Democratic Liberal party. This followed allegations of government interference in the March parliamentary election. The National Assembly resumed work on Monday. New non-partisan ministers for the politically sensitive posts of justice, home, information, political affairs and possibly the intelligence agency will be announced tomorrow. The rest of the cabinet, including the economic ministries, will remain unchanged.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Domburs: "Does Voldemars Selga Surpass </F> Those Who Vanished in Lake Constance?"]    [Excerpts] Western security services are linking the trade  in radioactive and nuclear materials with threats to  international security. However, big money apparently can also  be earned by dealing with nonradioactive isotopes, prices for  which on the black market often are no lower and sometimes even  higher than those for radioactive ones. The deal that Rimmele  and Eichler [not further identified] concluded in Riga was  valued at $2 million. Nevertheless, even this seems to be  nothing in comparison with the sums with which Voldemars Selga,  a well-known business man in Latvia, is operating in deals  concerning rare metals.    The document, which can be seen in the picture [published in  English and Latvian next to the article and reported below],  dated 3 February of this year, is called, literally translated,  "Usage of bank guarantees of the Reconstruction and Development  Bank [RDB] of Latvia for buying osmium." The text refers to an  already received [two last words underlined] guarantee from RDB  for $4,555,000,000 (! - J.D.) for the Finnish company  "Wimco-Erica Finland Ltd" to purchase osm-187, and contains a  requirement to confirm the right to use this guarantee to buy  32.9 kg of osm-187 in Russia. The RDB board president and owner  of the control package is Voldemars Selga.    There are also materials in which the Finnish side confirms  that the purchasing of osm has already begun. Actually, it must  have started before one of the signatories, visible in the  picture, began to talk about seeking -- even with the assistance  of INTERPOL -- V. Selga's partner, RDB Vice President Andrejs  Zagars, on suspicion of fraud...    The fax visible in the picture did not reach its intended  recipient, and this explains why V. Selga's signature is not on  the document. The sources of the above mentioned information  are not sufficient to provide a precise description of the deal.  Nevertheless, there can be no doubt about such guarantees by the  bank. According to the initial capital and capital stock,  amounting to several hundred thousand lats, RDB only ranks  somewhere in the top 40 or 50 commercial banks in Latvia, and it  should not have the right to give a guarantee for a million  dollars, let alone any figure in the billions.    Suspicion also arouse over the fact that the mentioned  quantity of osm -- 33 kg -- is too big. Experts in Germany,  commenting on the plans of Rimmele and Eichler to buy only 6 kg  of osm-187 in China, acknowledged that demand for this material  is measured in milligrams...    We do not have any more detailed information about the  Finnish role. This cannot be said about possibilities to  describe the personality of V. Selga. In 1984, during the era  of the Soviet Union, he was sentenced to prison for fraud and  falsification. Is Selga a crook? This was the question that  arose in September 1992, when he was arrested on suspicion of  cheating in a deal with the confectionery firm "Uzvara." V.  Selga's background in the highest political circles could be  observed when he was released from jail thanks to Latvian  Supreme Council Deputies V. Kalnberzs and V. Steins, who posted  bail for him. After all, he did not deliver the promised sugar  for "Uzvara," but the money he had accepted in advance -- 50  million Latvian rubles -- he only returned a few months later.  [passage omitted]    These operations with the participation of Voldemars Selga,  together with the Lake Constance story, provide food for thought  -- what is the nature of the environment in which the trade in  isotopes in Latvia is occurring? Shady. The house of Victor  Balulis on Sarma Street, where Eichler was kept after his  capture, is undoubtedly connected to criminal circles. After  his return from prison -- in the second half of the 1980's, when  the cooperative movement began -- V. Selga was connected with  these circles. Viktors Abakumovs and Aleksandrs Kisels,  well-known people in the criminal world, were employees of his  in the "Merkurijs" joint stock company. The first was murdered  in the fall of 1991, the second was arrested for the second time  last autumn and confronted with charges of blackmail. Today, it  would be out-of-fashion to call them bandits, as they are all  businessmen, doing legal business. However, it can be done in  various ways -- deals can be fair or shabby, and taxes can be  paid or ignored...    In the West, the deals with rare metals are being watched by  special services and by police, looking for evidence of cheating  or blackmail, as well as by financial experts, who look for  possible instances of "money laundering." In Latvia, minimal  attention is paid to these problems and there are practically no  chances for controls of any type. How can grams of anything be  detected, if there are tons of sugar and flour being smuggled  over the Latvian border? Still, a few grams of isotopes are far  more valuable than several tons of sugar... Who has ever heard  of any Latvian special services stating that they are in  possession of some information in this respect, for instance  regarding the production and trade control of isotopes in  Russia? The story of Rimmele and Eichler provided sufficient  grounds to begin speaking about it, but it seems that while  quarreling with each other, there is no time left for such  things. Can we speak about narrowing down the possibilities to  "launder" money? Probably not, especially since, to date, any  attempts by tax inspectors to control cash transactions have  remained in the realm of dreams.    The dangerous thing is that trade in nonradioactive  materials  can not be discerned from trade in radioactive materials, which  are hazardous for human health and life, because both come from  the same delivery sources. In a secret report by the German  Federal Intelligence Service on the black market of radioactive  materials and the threat of radioactive terrorism from the East,  Kaunas and Vilnius had been mentioned as centers of illegal  trade. Anyhow, this may be little consolation for Latvia.  Trading will continue in places where there are few hindrances  to businessmen.    [Published in a box accompanying the article is a copy of a  letter in English dated 3 February from the Finnish firm  Wimco-Erica Finland to RDB President Voldemars Selga, reading:    "Dear Mr. Selga,    "Reconstruction and Development Bank of has issued A Bank  Guarantee No. 4008/KN/AZ/is, with a value of USD 4,555,000,000  [previous amount circled] (Four Billion Five Hundred Fifty-Five  Million).

The letter is signed by Horst Hamm, "chairman of the Board  of  Directors of Wimco-Erica Finland," and Kyoesti Lallukka,  "managing director" of Gencar Ltd.; there is place for RDB  President Voldemars Selga to sign, but his signature does not  appear.]</p>

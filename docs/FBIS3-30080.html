Korean Authorities' </F> Scheme To Take Away Koreans From Sakhalin" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- The Central  Committee of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea released a statement on February 24 denouncing  the crafty and insidious scheme of the South Korean authorities  to take Korean residents in Sakhalin, Russia, to South Korea in  conspiracy with the Japanese Government as a treacherous act  selling off the dignity and interests of the nation for a few  amount of money.    The South Korean authorities, absurdly contending that the  issue of Korean residents in Sakhalin had been a political one  but it is now purely a humanitarian issue, revealed their  intention to settle this issue by receiving a few amount of  money from the Japanese Government as traveling expenses for  their immigration, the statement says:    The residence of Koreans in Sakhalin resulted from the fact  that when the Japanese imperialists illegally occupied Korea,  they forcibly took them away by issuing an outrageous "general  mobilization order" and overdrove them before leaving them in  Sakhalin.    The Japanese Government has neither officially apologized to  the Korean people nor compensated for Japan's past crimes.  Then, how can the problem suddenly become a mere humanitarian  problem, losing its political nature?    The problem of Koreans taken to the Far East by the Japanese  imperialists is not a matter confined to the 40,000 Koreans  resident in Sakhalin but a serious matter which can be solved  only when the Japanese Government make an apology and  compensation to nearly 500,000 Koreans who are living in the  former Soviet Union.    Our nation has the right in view of the international law to  get an apology and claim compensation from the Japanese  Government for the national misfortune and sufferings  experienced by all the Koreans overseas, not to speak of those  living scattered in the former Soviet Union, for nearly one  whole century.    This notwithstanding, the South Korean rulers, under the  humanitarian [word indistinct] have launched a deceptive  "charity" offensive among the Sakhalin-resident Koreans. This  is motivated by a sinister intention to [words indistinct]  "foundation" in the Far East of Russia and foster discord and  confrontation within the nation by winning over them, thus  perpetuating the division of the country.    As all Koreans overseas who visited South Korea confirmed,  the South Korean society, a corrupt and ailing society where the  rich is getting richer and the poor poorer, provides no  political and economic guarantee for the life of those who  return to South Korea from foreign countries.    We believe that all the Koreans in Russia and other areas  (?of the) former Soviet Union will rise up as one in the staunch  struggle to reject the insidious and crafty moves of South  Korean and Japanese authorities to bring them to South Korea and  defend the dignity and interests of the nation.    Our nation will settle scores to the last for all the crimes  committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past and will  never pardon the traitors who are selling the interests of the  nation to Japan, courting its favor.    The South Korean and Japanese authorities must be mindful  that if they persistently resort to base plots to bring  Sakhalin-resident Koreans to South Korea, ignoring our solemn  warning, they will by no means evade the possibility for such a  crime as insulting and abusing the noble humanitarian idea and  will bring a greater disgrace to themselves under the eyes of  the world.</p>

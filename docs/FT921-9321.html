			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Noranda registers CDollars 133m loss NORANDA, the diversified Canadian resources group, blamed lower commodities prices for a CDollars 133m (USDollars 120.9m) loss last year, and warned that no recovery was in sight until the second half of 1992. The Toronto-based group, whose earnings traditionally fluctuate widely in line with markets for forestry products, metals and oil and gas, posted net earnings of CDollars 120m in 1990. The per-share loss last year was CDollars 1.04, compared with earnings of 36 cents. The 1991 setback includes writedowns and other restructuring charges totalling CDollars 108m. Revenues fell to CDollars 1.99bn from CDollars 2.29bn. Earnings from mining and metals plummeted to CDollars 66m in 1991 from CDollars 301m in 1990, due almost entirely to lower prices. The forestry division swung to a loss of CDollars 75m from earnings of CDollars 16m, also reflecting lower prices and mill operating rates well below capacity. Oil and gas earnings dropped to CDollars 11m from Dollars 59m. The company, which is controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family and their managers, does not expect significant improvement in the economy in the first half of this year. However, it predicted that lower interest rates and a weaker Canadian dollar will lead to improved results in the second half. It is hoping for a 'reasonable recovery' in 1993. Long-term debt totalled CDollars 4.5bn on Dec 31 1991, little changed from the previous year. But net interest payments fell to CDollars 450m from CDollars 493m.</p>

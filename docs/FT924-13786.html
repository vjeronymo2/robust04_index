			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Oilseeds still block agreement on Gatt The principal stumbling block to a settlement of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation is a still-yawning gap between the US and the EC on Europe's oilseed subsidy regime, according to a leading US farm lobbyist. Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau, said, at the end of two days in Brussels lobbying US-EC trade and agriculture negotiators as they fought to settle a 20-month dispute over the EC's subsidised farm trade regime, that he was not optimistic that differences on oilseeds could be settled. His mood yesterday contrasted with that of the negotiators, who despite the apparently inconclusive end to negotiations on Monday night, appear confident agreement can be reached. This confidence has been underpinned by significant progress in settling two issues at times felt to be intractable: US demands that the EC cut the volume and the value of its subsidised farm exports, and EC demands that compensation payments to European farmers for price cuts under the Common Agriculture Policy reform should not be seen as subsidies, and so exempt from any agreement on subsidy cuts. 'You don't have anything until you have everything,' Mr Kleckner warned, pointing to considerable differences between the US and the EC on oilseed production. US negotiators are demanding the EC cuts its output from the current 13m tonnes a year to 7m tonnes in six years. EC negotiators are currently refusing to cut below 9.5m tonnes. He warned that failure to reach agreement in the next 10 days would 'make it a dead certainty' the US will carry out threats to impose punitive tariffs amounting to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 587m) on EC farm exports in retaliation for alleged damage done to US farmers by the EC oilseeds regime. 'There's a little more time, but we are counting in days,' he said. 'If we failed to reach an agreement, that would be dreadful for the Uruguay Round, and for economies throughout the world.' He insisted negotiators could be even further apart on the oilseeds dispute than the public realised, largely because the EC's target of 9.5m tonnes annual output will be based not on firm policy objectives, but on an assumption that the CAP reforms, intended to reduce the acreage sown with oilseeds, will automatically achieve the targeted reduction. 'It would create a firestorm of protest among US farmers if the administration were to settle for anything less than a cut to 7m tonnes,' Mr Kleckner said. 'The gap may not seem great, but we just can't believe the EC figures are accurate.' EC officials did not share Mr Kleckner's pessimism yesterday, as they weighed the significance of the breakthroughs achieved on farmer compensation and volume cuts for farm exports. It is understood that US negotiators, in accommodating EC demands on compensation, have agreed to nothing less than a re-drafting of relevant parts of the draft Uruguay Round agreement published in late December last year. It will allow direct payments to farmers under production-limiting criteria to be exempt from year-by-year reduction in subsidies. In settling differences on the US demand for the EC to cut the volume of its subsidised farm exports, three formulae have apparently been tabled: the EC is willing to agree a 24 per cent cut in all farm products by the end of six years, provided annual progress to that eventual target allows for 10 per cent 'swings', with certain products moving towards 24 per cent faster than others. the US accepts this proposal, but insists on the annual 'swings' being limited to 4 per cent. a standby proposal for volume cuts to be limited to 21 per cent at the end of six years. This appears the least likely to be agreed upon.</p>

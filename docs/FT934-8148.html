			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Error puts school in the spotlight SCHOOLS can shoot to the top of the league tables if someone at the Department for Education makes a typing error. Yesterday Chapel-en-le-Frith school in Stockport, Cheshire, enjoyed a fleeting moment of fame in the nation's newsrooms. According to the league tables it had only one pupil in the sixth form, but he or she was the new Einstein - amassing 54 A-level points, equivalent to four grade As, one B and one C. The school's headmaster had an even better story - the education department had given the accolade of top A-level performer to a school which did not even have a sixth form. Officials said external contractors had made a computer error, which will be corrected when booklets of the results are distributed to schools. Five other schools briefly benefited from high-performing, but non-existent, A-level candidates.</p>

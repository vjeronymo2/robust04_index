			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese crop setback may herald new rice age European consumers will soon be paying at least 15 per cent more for rice because of poor harvests and crop failures in the main producing countries, most notably Japan. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that the Japanese harvest fell by about 25 per cent last year to 9.7m tonnes, and this has forced the government to import huge amounts of rice to its previously closed market. Heavy demand from such an important rice consumer has triggered a near doubling in international prices since September, fuelled by smaller supplies than usual being available from some other big producing countries. 'I've been in this trade for 30 years and I've never seen a year quite like the one we've had,' said Mr Danny Driscoll, director in charge of rice at UK food trader Stevens &amp; Brotherton, which has seen a 110 per cent increase in the price of its unmilled US long grain rice to Dollars 440 a tonne. 'But then, Japan has never come into the market before.' Japan announced in September that typhoons and a cold summer would force it to import at least 1m tonnes of rice. The international rice industry now estimates that it may be in the market for up to 3m tonnes. Rice supply and demand have tended to be fairly stable in recent years. But the rash of bad harvests has upset everyone's calculations. Crops in China, India, North Korea and the Philippines were hit last year by exceptionally wet or stormy weather, while cool conditions affected the South Korean crop. In Europe, the Spanish crop was down by about one-third because of severe dry weather in the Seville region. The FAO estimates that world output of paddy rice fell to about 520m tonnes, 6m tonnes less than the record harvest in 1992. It predicts that, as a result, world trade in rice will rise to an all-time high of at least 14.6m tonnes this year, some 800,000 tonnes more than last year. The type of rice favoured by Japanese consumers is high quality short-grain Japonica rice, grown mainly in the US and Australia apart from Japan. But the industry believes that its requirements far exceed available exports and that it will have to consider buying long grain Indica rices from the US and from Thailand. According to the FAO, Japan bought 200,000 tonnes in early October, contracted for further amounts for delivery in December and has confirmed that it will import 900,000 tonnes in the first quarter of this year. 'Although no indications were given on the volume to be imported after March, it would appear that substantial quantities may still be needed to cover the shortfall,' the FAO said. There has been no let-up in the rise in world prices and buyers are running out of the stocks they bought in advance to protect against sudden price changes. As the new US crop arrives on the European market, consumers are next in line to feel the squeeze. In addition to the world rice price, European consumers are affected by a levy on rice imports into the European Union. When world prices rise, the levies are meant to fall, to keep prices stable. But the rise of at least 80 per cent in world prices has so far been met by a fall in import levies of only about 12.5 per cent and the industry wants the European Commission to reduce them further. Tilda Rice, a leading brand rice manufacturer, is raising its prices of American long grain rice by 15-20 per cent this month in the UK and continental European markets and says there may be further increases later in the year. 'It's a very moveable feast; 3m tonnes is a hell of a lot to mop up,' said Mr Tim Smith, Tilda marketing controller. 'It depends where Japan does finally source all its requirements. If a huge proportion of that shortfall has to be taken up from the US that puts extra cost pressures on rice from the US, and the same goes for Thailand.' Mr Smith said that if Japanese consumers developed a taste for imported long-grain rice, which cost three or four times less to produce than domestically-grown Japanese rice, they could push international prices higher still. 'We could be at the start of a new rice age,' of rising prices, he warned.</p>

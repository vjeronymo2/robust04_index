			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Delyagin, Institute of Economic Problems </F> of the Transition Period: "Conversion of Currency Credits Helps  Regenerate Russia's Economy"]    [Text] The gradual, but steady stabilization of the ruble,  as far back as the middle of last year, compelled us to seek  more refined mechanisms for currency operations.    The most promising, and at the same time most complicated of  them has now been singled out: conversion of foreign currency  credits into domestic ruble credits. The difference between the  interest rates on world markets (from 3.5 to 17 percent) and in  Russia (the Central Bank discount rate, let us remember, is 210  percent), given the slow rise in the dollar exchange rate, is  fully capable of compensating for even the high risk of  investments in Russia.    The financial sphere is very conservative. In order to take  low-interest credits on Western markets, one must have great  prestige and reliable guarantees. The instability in Russia  makes it so difficult to obtain them that today it makes the  mechanism described inaccessible even for the most serious  structures.    The most widespread method of surmounting the difficulties  involves using Russian capital located overseas. For example,  the capital legally circulating there can be used as a guarantee  of the redeemability of Western currency credits, subsequently  being converted to ruble credits in Russia.    A promising route is to sell sizable blocks of shares of  major Russian structures, allowing potential creditors or  guarantors to control them, in order to win the necessary  confidence.    The largest Russian banks today are studying mechanisms to  provide other Western guarantees and to draw in low-interest  currency credits. At the same time, one should emphasize the  exceptional profitability, and this means also the exceptional  scale, of the forthcoming operations, which does not simply lead  to enriching individual commercial structures, but has a major  influence on the entire development of Russian society.    The spare capital of the world economy many times exceeds  the  entire monetary mass circulating on the territory of our country.    As a result of the strong conservatism of the financial  market, this change in investment volumes will be quite smooth,  and society will most likely succeed in adapting to its  individual manifestations. The scale and depth of the influence  to which Russia is to be subjected in the next few years,  however, makes it necessary to foresee at least its basic  consequences, which should not take us unawares -- as, for  example, when the catastrophic exacerbation of the deficit  (depressed inflation), connected with the mass pumping of  non-cash monies into the wage fund, took us unawares in 1988 and  1990.    The influx of currency funds is capable of replacing the  administrative mechanism of the infusion of centralized funds  with the market mechanism and therefore, with the much more  effective mechanism of an infusion of commercial credit. Under  these conditions, the variant, approved in world practice, of a  unified emission mechanism, in which the increase in the  national monetary mass would be limited by the influx of foreign  currency, would be fully applicable. It is this mechanism which  improved the war-destroyed financial systems of Europe and  Argentina (the latter was poised on the brink of  hyper-inflation, periodically breaking down into it, over a  period of six decades).    In this way, we would by-pass major acceleration of a rise  in  prices. The possible surpluses of the monetary mass would be  small and would be compensated for with the aid of the "fine  tuning" of the Central Bank (an efficient change of the discount  rate and norms for reserves, differentiation of the latter by  types of assets) and with the aid of the natural expansion of  the markets (through the share market and the real estate  market).    The effect of the "currency vacuum cleaners" may become the  most important instrument for surmounting the economic crisis  and the main path to regenerating Russia as a supreme power.  They should therefore be supported to the utmost by the state,  right up to creating the corresponding insurance funds for the  capital coming into Russia.</p>

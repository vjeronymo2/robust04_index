			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Tory flagship council is biggest grant loser Mr David Curry, the local government minister, yesterday made a point of announcing that Wandsworth - the Conservatives' 'flagship' south London borough - was the English local authority which had done worst out of the redistribution of local government grants. This, said Mr Curry, showed that the reallocation of grants had been 'colourblind'. The process, criticised on grounds of fairness over the past year, had been carried out without regard to a council's political control. But the redistribution has been so drastic that the government has introduced a Pounds 280m 'buffering' scheme to ensure that no council's grant will fall by more than 2 per cent this year. However, 82 authorities will suffer a reduction of at least this amount. The grant each council receives towards its spending from central government  -additional money is made up from council taxpayers or from the council's reserves - are determined by a complicated formula known as the Standard Spending Assessment (SSA). SSAs are worked out on a per capita basis and multiplied by the total population in each authority to arrive at a figure for the overall grant it will receive. Figures from the 1991 census were incorporated for the first time this year, so the biggest 'losers' have been inner London authorities. Wandsworth suffered the greatest cut in SSA (10.6 per cent), followed by Hammersmith and Fulham (9.8 per cent), Havering (8.6 per cent), Brent (8.5 per cent) and Lambeth (7.5 per cent). The government also made changes to the factors determining grants within the formula. The weight given to the proportion of ethnic minorities in an area has been reduced, in recognition of the fact that many immigrants are well-established and do not put as many extra burdens on the education service as they once did. Instead, measures which capture levels of economic deprivation have been introduced. For the first time measures of homelessness and unemployment will be included. The latter addresses widespread complaints from northern cities with minimal ethnic populations but high levels of unemployment, particularly in former mining communities, that the old formula unfairly withheld grant from them. There is also a measure of the number of people who suffer from long-term illness, in recognition of the demands the growing elderly population place on social services. The government has introduced a measure of the number of day visitors to an area, to capture the problems created by areas with low populations but large numbers of commuters. Most controversially, the 'area cost adjustment', aimed at compensating the south-east for its high labour costs, has been increased. Northern authorities have repeatedly branded this measure a political fix to allow more aid to go to marginal seats in the south-east.</p>

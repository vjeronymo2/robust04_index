			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Book Review: Military leader, not a moralist ONE HUNDRED DAYS: The Memoirs of the Falklands Battle Group Commander By Admiral Sandy Woodward (with Patrick Robinson) HarperCollins (Pounds 18) It was George Orwell who remarked that in England 'all the boasting and flag-waving, the 'Rule Britannia' stuff, is done by small minorities'. Writing more than 50 years ago, he noted that popular war writing always concerns tales of disaster and retreat. British military heroes have a tendency to remove themselves from the limelight after the main event, which makes this book an unusual contribution to the large Falklands library, as the 10th anniversary of the war fast approaches. At a superficial level Admiral Sandy Woodward, commander of the British task force, gives the lie to the view that the Falklands experience was simply an accident of history with no wider application. It is a celebration of a military victory won against enormous odds, asserting, to quote Mrs Thatcher who wrote the preface, 'the massive sense of justice ever-present in the minds of the (British) men who fought in the South Atlantic'. Not for the first time we are reminded, in some detail, of the extraordinary logistics of the South Atlantic war. The book also notes the military co-operation between the UK and the US, which was to be echoed eight years later in the Gulf war and which saved men like Woodward from the consequences of UK defence cuts. Its pages record the courage, military skills and professionalism of some of the men involved, while not attempting to ignore the extent to which events often turned on luck. The opening chapter, ghost-written by author Patrick Robinson, describes the loss of HMS Sheffield - sunk by a French-made Exocet - in the staccato rhythm of the comic strip war hero. The style, however, settles down and there is enough material - including extracts from his own personal diary - to justify Admiral Woodward's reputation as the most controversial senior commander on the spot. Take his first reaction to the Falklands, for example: 'Twenty degrees warmer and it would be the yachting centre in the world. As it is, bloody awful, . . . definitely not a jewel in the Queen's crown.' Woodward was an admiral in the Thatcherite mode: non-traditional, vaguely classless and often ruthless. During the war, he told journalists on the command ship, HMS Hermes: 'South Georgia was the appetiser, now this is the heavy punch coming up behind . . . This is the run-up to the Big Match which in my view should be a walkover.' Most of the criticism that followed came from those who considered him too confident. The Royal Navy lost nearly half of the ships it had started with and played little part in the final military defeat of the Argentine army. It is the British army commanders, not Woodward, who deserve credit for the recapture of the islands. Being remembered as a nice man or a moralist does not rank high in Woodward's list of priorities. Nor does he want to be remembered as a politician or a diplomat. He does want to be seen as having helped lead Britain into war in the only way that had a chance of military victory. The loss of HMS Sheffield is blamed on a mixture of bad luck and a succession of military lapses by officers under Woodward's command. But the most controversial of the naval episodes, the sinking of the Belgrano, was in Woodward's view a necessary means to an end. He confirms that the enemy's cruiser was moving away from the task force when it was hit, but insists that its speed and direction were irrelevant. 'What counts is his position, his capability, and what I believe to be his intention.' The Belgrano had been involved earlier in a pincer movement and, as far as Woodward was concerned, it could have become so again. The book reveals how the conduct of the campaign was dictated by this kind of military logic. It was the navy that convinced Mrs Thatcher to send the task force, and the navy that convinced her to change her rules of engagement to make the sinking of the Belgrano possible. Once the islands had been reached, the war entered an irreversible military momentum. To that extent, it is a chilling reminder of the subservience of politics in times of war, and the ease with which a minor incident can develop into a bloody conflict. And yet Woodward was no Admiral Anaya or General Galtieri, the repressive junta chiefs for whom the invasion was a political necessity. Returning to his office after the war, Woodward opened one of his first official letters. It was the navy's Pay and Pensions Department, advising him that his entertainment allowance was being trimmed. Woodward comments: 'That letter brought me down to earth with a considerable thump. This country really does have its own wonderful way of ensuring that no one gets too big for his boots.' It is a pity that Mrs Thatcher didn't write that into her preface too. The reviewer is the author of The Land that Lost its Heroes: the Falklands, the Post-War and Alfonsin (Bloomsbury).</p>

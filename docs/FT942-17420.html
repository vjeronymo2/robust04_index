			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / People: Bowlin moves up at a bad time Is this the time to take over the running of an oil company, asks Richard Waters. Mike Bowlin, who becomes chief executive of Atlantic Richfield on July 1, could hardly have picked a worse moment. Oil prices, which slumped late last year, slumped again last week. 'It was not what we expected,' Bowlin says ruefully. Like others, Arco had predicted that oil prices - now around Dollars 14 a barrel - would rise to Dollars 20 a barrel this year, and stay there for some time to come. 'Episodes like the one we have just gone through make us stop and wonder,' he says. If that wasn't bad enough, Arco has just poured hundreds of millions of dollars into trying to build its reserves in Alaska (the location of most of its current reserves) with little success. Under Bowlin, Arco is set to direct more of its efforts overseas. The company has already scaled back its Dollars 1.9bn development budget for this year, he says, with the US taking the brunt of the cuts. 'We have not cut back in the international arena.' Bowlin, 51, was behind Arco's first push overseas, in the late 1980s, and is set to continue the drive. As head of international acquisitions, he was behind the takeover of Tricentrol in the UK in 1988 and the development of gas projects in Indonesia and China. The aim is to push overseas upstream activities up to the level of those in the US, he says. There is at least one silver lining to the current slump, says Bowlin. Foreign governments will be forced to change the terms of their contracts with international oil groups to encourage them to continue exploration. And the oil price? 'There is one thing I'm certain of: it will still go up and down.'</p>

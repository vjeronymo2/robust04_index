Military sources said mountain trails in the area are used by both spies and  smugglers, and that the incident was the first of its kind in the area for at  least five years. About 15,000 Druze, members of a secretive Islamic sect, live  on the strategic plateau that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast  war and annexed in 1981.  </P></p>

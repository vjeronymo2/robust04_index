			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Arts: Market forces put sponsor rivals on clearer footing - The difference in approach to arts funding by BT and Lloyds is fundamental There is rivalry between BT and Lloyds Bank for the title of the UK's biggest sponsor of the arts. BT, despite freezing its budget for 1994-95 at Pounds 1.8m, wins so far. The rivalry reflects a fundamental difference in approach to sponsorship. BT concentrates money on the classic arts and does not include its modest hospitality and marketing expenditure (probably about Pounds 200,000) in its figures. Nor does it advertise its sponsorships. Lloyds, with two sponsorship initiatives each in fashion and film, plus the Young Musician of the Year competition which reaches its climax on BBC2 tomorrow, spends Pounds 2.4m, but this includes a substantial tranche of advertising expenditure. Around Pounds 1.5m goes to the arts. Lloyds wants public recognition and goes for events with certain, or likely, television coverage. BT is more philanthropic, but market pressure is forcing it to promote awareness of its generosity. Lloyds Bank, which has heavily promoted the Young Musicians this year, will this weekend run a campaign on Classic FM offering free CDs of the final to the first thousand of its customers who phone in with the name of the winner. This should boost viewing figures and reward the loyalty of customers. Lloyds will soon begin negotiations with the BBC to renew its contract for the biennial event, which remains the Corporation's biggest lapse into commercial sponsorship. Lloyds is inclined to sign up again, as long as the BBC decides not to increase substantially its fee of Pounds 500,000. By an odd chance, the two largest sponsors have taken it in turn to back the Royal National Theatre's educational work. Lloyds supported it for five years with its Theatre Challenge, and now BT has put up Pounds 400,000 for the next two years with its BT National Connections Scheme. Leading playwrights will be commissioned to create new works, or undertake translations, for performance by young people. Around 200 groups are expected to participate. Some will then go on to work with 10 local theatres, such as the Traverse in Edinburgh and the Sherman in Cardiff, and a few will progress in July 1995 to a celebration of youth theatre on the RNT stage. * The arrival of the Lottery next year is likely to have profound ramifications on every aspect of the arts world, including corporate sponsorship. This week the Arts Council chose Jeremy Newton, chief executive of Eastern Arts, to be its Lottery Director. He will take charge of the money raised by the Lottery to be devoted to arts ventures. Newton will have at least Pounds 70m a year to hand out for capital projects for new arts buildings and improvements to existing structures. This will be challenge money: arts organisations will be expected to contribute some of the cash towards their planned developments. The obvious source for such additional funds will be corporate backers, who have been notoriously reluctant to back capital projects (with the exception of Glyndebourne, which raised more than Pounds 30m from business for its new theatre). They prefer to support new creative work which they can use for hospitality or marketing spin-offs. If companies are persuaded that they can best help arts organisations by providing seedcorn cash for new building projects, there will be less sponsorship money available for new productions, exhibitions, competitions and festivals. * National Power wants to make the piano competition it backs in London every three years comparable to similar events in Moscow and Leeds. Sir Trevor Holdsworth, chairman of National Power, a first-class pianist with performances at the Festival Hall under his belt, is enjoying the preliminary rounds for the follow-up event, scheduled for London this September. While it is facile to say that a company's sponsorship follows the inclination of the chairman, or his wife, it is often true. But Sir Trevor has a wonderful excuse: National Power backed the first World Piano Competition in 1991 before he had any links with the company. Last year, National Power launched a World Piano Series, which matches top pianists to top orchestras at performances throughout the country, which are used for corporate and staff entertainment. National Power seeks no marketing payoff from its expenditure: it comes from its 'good causes' as opposed to its charity budget. The Pounds 400,000 plus National Power spends on the competition is the largest slice of this budget, with scholarships on top of the Pounds 28,000 prize money, which is shared between the four finalists. * The National Gallery of Scotland has pulled off its biggest sponsorship deal to date - Pounds 150,000 from Fondation Elf to make possible Monet to Matisse: Landscape painting in France 1874-1914, which opens in Edinburgh on August 11. The French company's total support for the exhibition, including a gala dinner, will be much higher. The deal was signed just in time. Elf, the leading French oil company, is being privatised and seems certain to reduce its contribution to culture. Another important show, from the NGS, The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990, at the Royal Scottish Academy and the Fruitmarket, is supported by Beck's.</p>

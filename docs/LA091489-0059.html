			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> TRAVELING THROUGH MILES OF DEAD AIR  </P> <P> Ordinary Time by A. G. Mojtabai (Doubleday: $17.95; 223 pages.)  </P> <P> A.G. Mojtabai evokes the travel-death of a cross-country bus ride with the  tormented precision of a dentist's drill. She writes of a mother enduring the  cicada-like demands of a restless child; of an old man declaring at a rest  stop: "I step off the bus and my feet are tired already." We feel the thousands  miles of dead air, the stopped time, the heat rising off the Texas hardpan.  </P> <P> Throughout her new novel, "Ordinary Time," Mojtabai's writing is instilled with  a disciplined passion to get things right. It is a humane as well as an  aesthetic virtue; it is a sign of intelligent love, just as a splendidly  ordered house might be.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Without Guarantees  </P> <P> But a splendidly ordered house is no guarantee of life within. In "Ordinary  Time" the immaculate and often inspired quality of the writing does not quite  make up for the lack of those brutal transactions that even the most refined  novels require -- think of Henry James -- in order to be alive.  </P> <P> "Ordinary Time" portrays with entire integrity two heroic characters; both of  them, as the title indicates, heroes of the ordinary. They live in a decaying  Texas town where no one is on the streets after 5 o'clock, and where the  downtown stores display perpetual closing-sale signs.  </P> <P> The town's name is Durance, which means imprisonment, of course; but which also  suggests the long endurance of Father Gilvary, the Catholic priest in a  Bible-belt town; and of Henrietta, the aging, blowzy proprietor of the Three  Square Meals, universally known, because of its location, as Henrietta's  Cemetery Restaurant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prosaic Martyrdom  </P> <P> Father Gilvary resolutely bears his prosaic martyrdom. He tried being a  missionary in India, but his stomach was weak; and so he finds himself visiting  a dying Catholic or two in the local hospital, calling upon a few housebound  widows, and struggling with the finances of a parish church that will  undoubtedly close once he retires. He is a St. Sebastian of the trivial; the  arrows are roof-repair bills, parish committee chit-chat, and a breezy,  company-man of a Vicar General. The only thing that keeps his church afloat, he  reflects with patient irony, are the town's Baptists. Not allowed to gamble in  their own church, they flock to his bingo evenings.  </P> <P> Henrietta is an endurer of another kind. She was "Miss Rattlesnake 1948"; now  she is 57, keeps four floppy dolls on her bed to talk to, laments her dead  husband, entertains an elderly lover who mostly wants to rest, and waits "for  someone or something to walk into her life." Her morning toilette, with  mascara, rouge and false eyelashes, resembles an urban renewal project. "All  lit up," a customer tells himself, watching her preside over her cafe. "Looks  like one of those painting by the numbers jobs."  </P> <P> She seems silly but she isn't. Her work gives her dignity; the Cemetery  Restaurant is run with fierce devotion. Her hopes are few and perhaps pathetic,  but she sustains and abandons them with equal dignity. She, like Father  Gilvary, is faithful to what she has chosen. Ordinary time, aside from its  usual meaning, also refers to that long stretch in the Catholic liturgical  calendar when there are no major feasts. It is Henrietta's and the priest's  time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Risks of the Ordinary  </P> <P> There are several kinds of risk in setting your subject upon the ordinary, even  if your point is the heroism to be found in it. One is that the reader will be  bored. To Mojtabai's priest and cafe-owner, time often seems to stand still;  "Ordinary Time" often seems to do so as well, and perhaps all the more because  of the clear honesty with which it is written.  </P> <P> A novel of stasis can be redeemed by unforgettable characters. The two endurers  in the book are appealing and sometimes moving, but they are rather crowded. We  feel sympathy for them, but it would be greater if the author hadn't placed  them so perilously close to other literary models. Father Gilvary is a cross  between a J. F. Powers priest and a Bernanos cure; he lacks the combativeness  of the former and the profundity of the latter. Henrietta, for all her doughty  appeal and individual touches, is too close to other valiantly raddled literary  beauties to seem quite fresh to us. Mojtabai treads the edge of imitation with  grace and precarious originality, but she treads too close and sometimes falls  in.  </P> <P> There are two modest elements of action in the book. One is the arrival in town  of Val, a loner with a blanked-out past. He has lost a job, a woman, a life;  but he can't remember them. There is a pent-up violence in this amnesia, and it  works for a while; it gives Val the effect of an explosion waiting to take  place. It is hard to sustain latency, however. After 100 pages or so he seems  not so much mysterious as null. When the violence does come -- it coincides  with Val's beginning to remember his past -- it is muted and anticlimactic.  </P> <P> Climax would be against the purpose of the book. Father Gilvary's growing  blindness is more of a dramatic theme than Val's stranger-in-town turbulence.  Time, in a sense, is the action in "Ordinary Time." It is a haunting concept,  and in many ways this is a distinguished book.  </P></p>

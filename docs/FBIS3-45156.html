			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Chien-ping [7115 1696 1627]: "Lu Ping </F> Says That Cutting Apart Airport Project by Hong Kong Government  Is Bound To Increase Costs"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--Lu Ping, director of  the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said here  today that facts have proved that the British Hong Kong  Government has not separated politics from the economy. The  British Hong Kong Government has adopted a non-cooperative  attitude toward the Chinese side on the issue of the new airport  in Hong Kong. When airport talks can be resumed has become a  question, and a solution to the airport issue has become  complicated.    When asked by reporters about the new airport in Hong Kong  today, Lu Ping said that the issue of the new airport in Hong  Kong can be said to be very simple, and what is needed is to  follow the Memorandum of Understanding signed by China and  Britain. When a reporter asked about Chris Patten's remarks  that the Hong Kong Government is acting in accordance with the  Memorandum of Understanding, Lu Ping said that with the present  financial arrangements made by the British side, the debt  involved greatly exceeds the amount mentioned in the Memorandum  of Understanding. How could he say that the Memorandum of  Understanding is being followed? Since the debt has exceeded  the memorandum, it is necessary for the two sides to negotiate  to solve the problem.    When asked about the issue of land allocations along the  airport railroad, Lu Ping said that the British side had  proposed allocating 58 hectares of land along the airport  railroad all at once. The Chinese side holds that since it is  necessary to build an airport railroad, land along the railroad  should be developed. Whether or not the land should be  allocated in one go should be determined by the land supply and  demand situation each year. Such allocations should be  cordinated with those of the Land Commission [Sino- British Land  Commission], the purpose being not to cause confusion in the  whole land market.    When a reporter mentioned that the Hong Kong Government had  separated the airport project, Lu Ping held that the costs of  the new airport should be settled by an overall financial plan.  The present piecemeal approach is bound to increase costs. He  said that according to figures on the financial reserve  published by the British Hong Kong Government, the British Hong  Kong Government surely has the strength to build the new airport  in accordance with the memorandum. Lu Ping said that the  Memorandum of Understanding stipulates that, in the future,  HK$25 billion [Hong Kong dollars] should be reserved for the  government of the special administrative region and debt should  not exceed HK$5 billion. The financial secretary of the British  Hong Kong Government has said that, in the future, HK$78 billion  will be kept for the government of the special administrative  region. We said that HK$25 billion would be enough. The rest  can be used for injecting funds so that debt will not exceed  HK$5 billion. In this way, the airport can be built.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Tietmeyer sees need for dollar stability An excessive fall in the US dollar is damaging for everybody, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, said yesterday in a statement of support for the US currency. 'The world economy has an interest in an internally and externally stable dollar,' said yesterday in Frankfurt at a lunch held by the American Chamber of Commerce. The dollar, meanwhile, continued its cautious recovery on foreign exchanges yesterday, helped by supportive comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary. Mr Tietmeyer said the strengthening of the D-Mark against the US currency this year was in part due to overreaction in financial markets, as well as overdone fear of new inflation in the US. 'Unfortunately now and then there are exaggerated developments in the foreign exchange markets, as seems to be the case now with the dollar,' he said. Although economists believe that a cut in short-term German interest rates - particularly if coupled with an increase in US rates - would take the pressure off the US economy, Mr Tietmeyer said yesterday: 'The prime responsibility for the dollar's strength lies in the US itself. 'The thesis current at the beginning of the seventies - it's our currency but your problem - is clearly too short-sighted. It didn't do the US much good at the time either.' He welcome the commitment of Mr Bentsen to a stronger dollar, as well as the conclusion of G7 ministers at Naples that a further weakening would be neither desirable nor justified. He said that as yet the economic recovery in Europe had not been endangered as a result of currency developments, and that in fact the latest developments helped to hold costs down. Further export growth was dependent on a lasting worldwide recovery, for which a central precondition was lasting price stability, in the US as elsewhere. He said a return to fixed interest rate systems would not work, nor would a move to 'target zones' for currencies. Long-term fixed exchange rates could only work with convergence of economic conditions, he argued, 'and at the moment we are a long way from that - at least worldwide'. Reviewing recent German interest rate policy, Mr Tietmeyer said the Bundesbank had not given way to pressure for a forced, aggressive sinking of interest rates. This would have had a negative impact in the markets. Markets cautious, Page 5; See currencies and money page</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that the  methods pursued so far on the Cyprus issue have not yielded any  results, adding that the time has come to try a new approach.  Demirel said: A reasonable solution is being sought. A  reasonable solution cannot be found by making territorial  concessions as well as concessions involving the flag. Yavuz  Yorulmaz reports from Kishinev:    [Begin Yorulmaz recording] Demirel, who is in Moldova on an  official visit, held a news conference yesterday evening and  assessed his contacts. He also replied to reporters' question  on foreign policy. In reply to a question on Cyprus, Demirel  said that the Cyprus problem cannot be solved through the recent  report prepared by the UN secretary general. He added: There  have been many similar reports in the past. What is being  sought? It is a bizonal and bicommunal federation. The  Butrus-Ghali report states that this method has so far not  yielded any results. A bizonal and a bicommunal Cyprus solution  is not yielding any results. As was the case prior to 1963, if  you try and bring together two peoples with separate languages,  religions, and cultures in a world where federations are  crumbling will the problem be solved?    Demirel also described as unjust the fact that the Western  countries have so far failed to recognize the Turkish Republic  of Northern Cyprus. He added that the 150,000 Turkish Cypriots  living on the island have been isolated and that no results have  been achieved from the efforts exerted within the framework of  the United Nations. Demirel said: This is the case because  they want the flag as well as territorial concessions. When you  give both away then you cannot explain such a solution to  anyone. Demirel noted that the Cyprus solution should be  acceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. He added: The  methods pursued so far have not yielded any results. The time  has come to try a new method.    Assessing his visit, Demirel said that his contacts in  Ukraine and Moldova was aimed at seeking cooperation between  Turkey and these countries. Pointing out that during his  contacts he also found the opportunity to discuss the situation  of the Crimean Tatars and the Gagauz Turks, Demirel said that no  one should be concerned that these issues have been included on  Turkey's agenda. Demirel noted that Turkey has a historic  responsibility toward the Crimean Tatars and the Gagauz Turks,  adding that it will be appropriate to extend financial and moral  support to these peoples. Demirel added: Turkey is obliged to  act in line with the requirements of a great state. Pointing  out that Turkey should not give the impression that it is  exhausted in the face of its problems, Demirel said: Turkey  will continue on its path and will solve its difficulties. New  possibilities and means of cooperation will be created. Turkey  will continue its growth and prosperity in stability.    In reply to a question, Demirel said that his visit has  generated a lot of interest in the foreign press, adding that it  has raised the question of what Turkey is aiming at. Pointing  out that Turkey is an independent country whose policies are not  mortgaged and which maintains friendly relations with its  neighbors, Demirel added: We do not pursue policies of enmity.  In other words, our bilateral relations do not, in any way,  pose a threat to a third country.    Demirel said that Turkish entrepreneurs precede the state in  investing in regional countries. He added that a risk insurance  system should be developed with the aim of guaranteeing these  investments. Pointing out that the loans extended by Turkey  through Exim Bank are clumsy and inept, Demirel added that  devising a new loan system will encourage investments.    Demirel will conclude his contacts in Moldova today. He will  inaugurate the temporary building of the Turkish Embassy in  Kishinev and attend the signing ceremony of various bilateral  agreements. Demirel will then hold a joint news conference with  Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and assess his visit. He will  also visit a winery near Kishinev and leave for Ankara this  evening.

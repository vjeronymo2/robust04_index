			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 8 Jun (AKP) -- According to a report from  Puok District, during a clash with government forces on the  morning of 8 June, the Khmer Rouge [KR] cut the Toek Thlang  bridge on National Route 6 on the border of Puok and Kralanh  Districts in Siem Reap Province.    The report adds: "The bridge was mined by Khmer Rouge troops  from Division 912 following an attack lasting nearly one hour."  The report, however, does not mention any casualties.    Three bridges already were damaged recently: "Stoeng Preah  (?Sre)," a stone bridge built in 1937; a bridge on National  Route 6; and a bridge on National Route 5 in Pursat Province.    According to two reports from Srei Snam District and [words  indistinct], Siem Reap Province, Khmer Rouge forces have again  made preparations to destroy two bridges, one at "O Chik"  between Srei Snam and Chongkal, and another along the road. The  reports say that the same Khmer Rouge troops will launch an  attack against the districts located near National Route 6, road  18, before 15 June 1994.</p>

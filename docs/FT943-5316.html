			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / This Week: Music There is little doubt that the cult sound of the autumn will be Jan Garbarek's collaboration with The Hilliard Ensemble, Officium (ECM New Series), released today. Garbarek, the Norwegian saxophonist, has added his instrumental skills to a collection of ancient chants, some of which date back to the 12th century. The result is a curiously compatible blend, which certainly meets the current demand for spirituality in music - expect the Gregorians to be knocked off the top of the classical charts. After a seven-year break, Bryan Ferry (below) has brought out Mamouna (Virgin), a new album of original songs, with the unlikely aid of some old friends - Phil Manzanera, Andy Mackay and even Brian Eno, who co-wrote 'Wildcat Days'. Plus ca change. The narcissistic Ferry, as ever surrounding himself with glamour, still pays too much attention to slick production values at the expense of his song-writing. The album marks the beginning of a world tour, with four British dates in October. The Three Tenors are not the only ones cashing in on post-World Cup fever; the first in what is bound to be a rush of compilations of Brazilian music is Brazilica], Talkin' Loud's collection of samba and bossa nova, featuring seminal names such as Sergio Mendes, Milton Nascimento and Gilberto Gil. Best to play on a wet February evening while practising one-touch back-heels in the sitting room. In brief: Nicholas McGegan conducts the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra and the choir of Clare College, Cambridge for a bright, crisp performance of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (harmonia mundi). Riccardo Muti and the Orchestra Filarmonica della Scala combine Elgar's In the South (Alassio) overture with Brahms's youthful Serenade No. 1 in D major (Sony). The Ensemble Musique Oblique with Rachel Yakar and Isabelle Veyrier tackle a selection of works by the Belgian composer Guillaume Lekeu, who died in 1894 just one day after his 24th birthday (harmonia mundi).</p>

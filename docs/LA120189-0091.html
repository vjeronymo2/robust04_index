			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT HAS BECOME HOTTEST TICKET IN TOWN;  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL: COMMUNITY SUPPORT IS A BIG REASON WHY FONTANA HIGH HAS ONE OF  THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA.  </P> <P> In the football coaches' office at Fontana High School, a chart hangs on the  wall near a window facing the school's football field. The oversized chart is  really a composite schedule of the school's opponents this season.  </P> <P> The results of every game are written in the square above the school's name and  there is a noticeable diagonal line of scores reading: 0-47, 9-35, 14-30, 0-30,  6-18, 0-46, 0-41, 0-41, 7-41 and 22-30. They are all losses to Fontana.  </P> <P> As Fontana heads into its Southern Section semifinal game Saturday night  against Edison of Huntington Beach, the Steelers are the top-rated team in the  state with a 12-0 record and are ranked third in the country.  </P> <P> Sometimes teams are overrated in national polls, but a lot of Southern Section  coaches figure Fontana's rating is appropriate.  </P> <P> Coach Steve Grady, whose Los Angeles Loyola teams have won their share of Del  Rey League titles, gave a respectful chuckle when asked about Fontana's  football tradition.  </P> <P> "I think its program speaks for itself," said Grady, whose Cubs are 1-4 against  Fontana. "They are always well coached and they play extremely physical,  hard-nosed football. A major reason why they are so great is the support they  get from their community."  </P> <P> Fontana is in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains, 50 miles east of  Los Angeles. In a city of 78,000 people with only one high school, prep  football is a way of life. And since 1974, that way has meant winning.  </P> <P> Overflow crowds of 8,000 fill Fontana's stadium for late-season games against  Citrus Belt League rivals Riverside Rubidoux, Colton, Rialto Eisenhower and San  Gorgonio of San Bernardino.  </P> <P> Having one of the 1,500 season tickets is recommended because, in order to get  a seat on the home side with a general admission ticket, people start lining up  at 5 p.m., even though the game does not start until 7:30.  </P> <P> "When teams come to play us they get mad when they find out that our fans have  bought up all the tickets on their side because our home side was filled up,"  said Fontana Coach Dick Bruich, in his 13th year as coach. "We have a unique  situation, where the community gives so much support."  </P> <P> Fountain Valley Coach Mike Milner told the San Bernardino Sun after the  Steelers had defeated his team in the first round of the Southern Section  Division I playoffs, 51-6: "You have to play a perfect game to beat Fontana.  They're that good. And on this field . . . It's the one field in the CIF where  there is a distinct home-field advantage with their fan support and tradition."  </P> <P> Support is a word commonly used in connection with Fontana football.  </P> <P> "I'm spoiled," Bruich said when asked about a new high school, planned for  1992. "The situation here is so good that I am like an only child. I don't want  to look ahead when I'll have to share (players and community support) because  I've been spoiled all of this time. I don't think that there will ever be a  situation like this again."  </P> <P> How good is Fontana's football program?  </P> <P> The Steelers have defeated seven playoff teams and have outscored opponents,  436-64, shutting out six. In the tough Citrus Belt League, they have allowed  opponents not even a touchdown a game.  </P> <P> In Fontana's 28-0 quarterfinal win at Long Beach Wilson last Friday, the  Steelers held the Bruins to 21 yards in total offense. One Wilson player said  after the game: "We hit 'em and played hard, but they just dominated us."  </P> <P> Fontana intimidates opponents before the teams even meet with its reputation  for fierce hitting. And next year the Steelers will be strong again, with the  entire offensive line returning, including 6-foot-4, 270-pound tackles Clay  Hattabaugh and Robert Loya.  </P> <P> Under Bruich, the Steelers have made 13 consecutive playoff appearances, won  seven Citrus Belt League titles, one Southern Section championship, and a  mythical national title. Bruich's teams have a 125-31-1 record and have shut  out 51 opponents.  </P> <P> Fontana High opened in 1953, when the city population was under 14,000. In its  early years, the Steelers' football program took its lumps and after the 1973  season had a 65-118-8 record. In 1974, John Tyree, now coaching at Pasadena  Muir, took over the Steelers' program and quickly turned it around. In his  three seasons at Fontana, Tyree had a 26-9 record, leading the Steelers to the  Southern Section major division championship game against Los Altos at Anaheim  Stadium in his final season.  </P> <P> The Steelers' success continued when Bruich, Tyree's defensive coordinator,  became head coach in 1977. Bruich had no prior experience as a head coach, but  he surrounded himself with talented assistants, such as Skip Fazio and John  MacKinney, who still coach at Fontana.  </P> <P> And the Steelers' program began to grow as rapidly as the community. Fontana  eventually grew into the largest school in the Southern Section with an  enrollment of 3,400.  </P> <P> "When I first started here we had only 50 kids on the team," Bruich said. "Now  we have a total of 83 and that is counting varsity and junior varsity."  </P> <P> As the team got stronger, so did the community support. Bruich said that the  Steelers' philosophy of "success breeds success" has played an equal role.  "Over the years we have had to make many adjustments," he said. "We used to  have only kids who were Fontana-bred. Now, with people moving here at such a  rapid pace, we have many kids who are not familiar with Fontana or the area.  </P> <P> "Fontana used to be a town based on the Kaiser steel mill, but when that shut  down (in 1983), different people started to move into the area because of  affordable housing. I would say now the mix of kids here is 50-50, with  Fontana-bred kids and outsiders."  </P> <P> Whatever the mix, Bruich and his staff have the players and the community  committed to the Steelers' winning style. When Fontana lost to Rubidoux last  season, some players did not know how to react.  </P> <P> "I was in total shock," said Kenneth Cannon, a senior two-way starter for the  Steelers this season. "Winning is a tradition around here, it is something  expected."  </P> <P> In most cases, winning high school football programs are filled with talented  players who have graduated from youth programs geared to match the high  school's. That is not the case in Fontana, though.  </P> <P> "We just take the players as 10th-graders and then start to work with them,"  Bruich said. "We do not have any control over the programs at the junior high  level. We take them as sophomores and then try to work out any bad habits they  may have."  </P> <P> So how does Fontana continue to win?  </P> <P> "There are times when we are not the best team on the field but we win," Cannon  said. "We win because we have a group of guys who have worked hard and play as  a team."  </P> <P> For Fontana, the mixture has worked successfully for the last 15 years.  </P> <P> And Steeler opponents? They can only hope that the second high school in  Fontana is finished on schedule and that 1992 comes quickly.  </P></p>

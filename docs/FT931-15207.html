			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Confidence in business declines in Scotland BUSINESS confidence in Scotland declined slightly in the last quarter of 1992 and demand contracted in almost all sectors, according to the latest quarterly survey of Scottish business opinion, James Buxton writes. The survey, by Scotland's chambers of commerce and analysed by the Fraser of Allander Institute, Scotland's principal economic research organisation, said business confidence fell in manufacturing, distribution and tourism. There was a slight increase in confidence in construction, but from a low base. The only sector to report buoyant and rising demand was manufactured exports. Expectations for the first quarter of 1993 are for a continuation of recessionary conditions but with a slower rate of contraction than in the last quarter of 1992.</p>

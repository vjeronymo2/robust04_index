			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> AXL ROSE, NEIGHBOR RESTRAINED  </P> <P> Guns 'N Roses singer Axl Rose and his next-door neighbor agreed to avoid each  other to chill a simmering feud marked by the rocker's arrest on an assault  complaint, Rose's lawyer said.  </P> <P> Rose, 28, and Gabriella Kantor, 37, entered an agreement stating that "she  stays away from him and he stays away from her," attorney Jeff E. Scott said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The agreement was filed with Santa Monica Superior Court on Nov. 29, Scott  said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Rose at his West Hollywood  apartment on Oct. 30 following a dispute with Kantor, who said the musician was  blaring his music.  </P> <P> Rose spent several hours in jail before posting $5,000 bail. Prosecutors  declined to file charges, citing a lack of evidence.  </P> <P> Kantor claimed Rose confronted her outside his 12th-floor apartment, threw her  keys off a balcony and hit her on the head with a wine bottle.  </P> <P> Rose denied striking Kantor and suggested she hurt herself by repeatedly  pounding on his apartment door.  </P> <P> Both Rose and Kantor have obtained temporary restraining orders against each  other.  </P></p>

Ambassador for Nuclear Affairs Kim Sam-hun told a press  conference Thursday afternoon, "Now is a time when we should  mobilize all possible means." He said his government has been  led to doubt if the government should or can carry on efforts to  resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. "We cannot fulfill  what have been agreed on at this time when North Korea has not  kept agreed matters," Ambassador Kim said. He thus hinted that  the third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level talks could be put  off indefinitely and the `94 Team Spirit exercise carried out.    Kim said North Korea has expressly violated the agreement it  reached with the IAEA on last Feb. 15 and another it made with  the United States on Feb. 25.    Saying that a final decision would depend on the outcomes of  the next inter-Korean working-level contact slated for March 19  and a special IAEA Board of Governors meeting on March 21, the  ambassador said, however, "The patience of the international  community let alone our government's has almost exhausted."    Regarding the issue of Patriot missiles, he said that no  final decision has been made yet on the matter. "But, if it  becomes impossible to resolve the nuclear issue through  dialogue, we don't see any reason why we should delay their  deployment in Korea especially because the Patriots are  basically defensive weapons," Kim said.    He said that if and when the special IAEA Board of Governors  meeting refers the North Korean nuclear issue to the United  Nations Security Council, the Seoul government would respect and  follow the decision. "At this moment, our government is really  tired and feels the strong skepticism if we should continue to  regard North Korea as the other side in dialogue," Kim said.</p>

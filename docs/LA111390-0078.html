			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Changes in Plastics Ban: Minneapolis, which caused a tremor in the plastics  industry when it decided to prohibit some plastic packaging for consumer goods,  announced that it would launch a broad-based recycling effort that would allow  continued use of some plastics.  </P> <P> The ban will still go into effect Jan. 1. But the recycling effort will, in  practice, keep on store shelves much plastic packaging originally targeted by  environmentalists. The new recycling effort comes after a six-month  demonstration program by a Washington-based industry group, the Council for  Solid Waste Solutions.  </P></p>

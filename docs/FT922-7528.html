			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / The phoenix rises, but slowly The worst mistake in economics is to make projections with a ruler - in other words to assume that the future will resemble the past. This rarely happens because human beings tend to learn from their mistakes. As the US economy emerges gingerly from recession, the strong sectors of the 1980s - such as consumer spending and construction - are noticeably subdued while the weak sectors - such as manufacturing production and exports - are doing better than expected. At the very least this rebalancing of sectors suggests that the economy is not going to be plagued by huge trade and current account deficits in the 1990s. Judging from the scramble to restructure balance sheets, dangerously high ratios of debt to income in the consumer and corporate sectors may fall more rapidly than expected. The gigantic federal budget deficit is a more entrenched problem, but the enthusiasm on Capitol Hill for a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget is a telling sign of changing attitudes. Don't assume, in other words, that debts and deficits are an unalterable aspect of US economic life. Several powerful forces are conspiring to bring about change. The importance of demography is brought out in a recent circular by Roger Brinner and David Wyss, economists at the forecasting group DRI/McGraw Hill. The 1980s saw rapid growth in employment reflecting both the coming of age of baby-boomers and the entry of women into the labour force. With both the population and the ratio of employment to population rising rapidly, a surge in consumption spending and housing demand was inevitable. It made sense to finance some of the spending out of borrowing. But these forces have played themselves out. As baby-boomers grow older they are likely to borrow less and save more; consumption will stop outpacing national income. The psychological impact of three recessionary years can only reinforce these tendencies. Few middle class families anticipated the end of the housing boom. Fewer still realised that their jobs might become nearly as insecure as those of blue collar workers. For the first time since the 1930s, many households have cringed as easily serviced debts turned into millstones. The consequence - already evident in the failure of car sales to respond to lower interest rates - is greater caution in personal financial affairs. With the housing boom over, savings are more likely to be channelled into productive assets. Consumer caution will inhibit recovery in the short-term but it may be an asset in the longer-term. At the same time, US industry is undergoing a partial rebirth. The overvaluation of the dollar in the mid-1980s was a turning point for many manufacturers - the event that finally brought home the need for fundamental reform. More recently, many service sector companies have cut costs and shed labour to raise efficiency. The fruits of reform are evident. The quality gap between US and Japanese cars, for example, is obvious to the naked eye. The surprising success of small speciality steel makers marks a renaissance for the steel industry. In overseas markets, US manufacturers have steadily recaptured market share since 1986. In five years the trade surplus on advanced technology products has nearly doubled to Dollars 37bn. Most economists seem confident that export growth will remain strong despite the slowdown in Europe and Japan. Sales are running at double-digit rates in Latin America and south-east Asia. The shock of tougher world competition is forcing US industry to sharpen its game in subtle ways. It has imported new management philosophies. It has developed tighter methods of inventory control: the recession was relatively shallow partly because supply and demand were more closely matched. US employers, always quick to fire, have become even more ruthless: last autumn a second mild downswing led to immediate job cuts. According to Ms Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board in New York, the economy's 'systemic efficiency' is improving: she means that it is able to respond to change faster than before. Relative to Europe, the flexibility is most evident in wages With unions virtually impotent, US employees do not have a 'going rate' mentality. The real pay of all groups except the highly skilled has thus fallen sharply in recent years. The US economy is still troubled. Consumer confidence remains fragile for this stage of the business cycle. The recovery from recession is far from firmly established despite recently improved figures. Olympia &amp; York's bankruptcy filing is a timely reminder of the chronic weakness of north American commercial real estate markets. Budget deficits will continue to drain away domestic savings. But the balance between consumption and production looks set to improve as manufacturers regain confidence and consumers adopt more conservative habits. A sharper focus on the needs of industry and export markets does not mean the US economy will be a roaring success in the near future; indeed, shorn of the stimulus of unrestrained borrowing, growth rates may look rather unimpressive. The important point is that a new chapter is beginning: the economy's behaviour in the 1980s is likely to be a poor guide to the shape of the current upturn.</p>

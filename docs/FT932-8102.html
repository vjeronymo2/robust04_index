			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Off note from Bass Bass has a disingenuous way of describing the beer market as subject to increased aggression rather than a price war. But there is no mistaking the gauntlet it threw down yesterday. With its existing market share of around 23 per cent, economies of scale from brewery closures and a balance sheet strong enough to support more free trade loans, the chances are that it will succeed in raising market share where others fail. The real question concerns the cost. Some of that is coming through already. Bass claims its underlying beer margins rose in the first half, but that is before the Pounds 9m increase in the provision for bad debts. After the provision, which must reflect its efforts to win new business, margins fell to 8.7 per cent from 9.3 per cent. That sacrifice has, however, produced a gain in market share of only 0.2 per cent. Yesterday's 9 per cent fall in the shares may be a step adjustment to a situation where Bass can expect little increase in earnings over the next couple of years while other companies enjoy the recovery. But there are other niggling worries which prevent the shares seeming much of a bargain. These include the sudden need for a further Pounds 4.9m restructuring charge in brewing, the downturn in European hotels, and - an issue the company glossed over yesterday - the weakness in US hotel profits despite higher occupancy and room rates. Since it is on such tricky ground, Bass might do well to reconsider its refusal to split the roles of chairman and chief executive.</p>

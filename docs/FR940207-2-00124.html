			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current proposal, however, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to permit the listing of options on an ADR without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the foreign market where the underlying security trades, as long as the U.S. market for the underlying ADRs is at least as large as the market for the underlying foreign security. Specifically, the proposed listing standards require that 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security occur in the U.S. ADR market, which consists of the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE, the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx. The proposal further requires that for the continued trading of the ADR options the percentage of the world-wide trading volume occurring in the U.S. ADR market must not fall below 30%. The Commission believes these standards will ensure that the relevant pricing market for the options on ADRs is the U.S. ADR market rather than the market where the security underlying the ADR trades. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the Commission believes that the proposed method for determining whether the trading volume in the U.S. ADR market meets the required percentages is adequate to ensure that the U.S. ADR market is and continues to be the price discovery market for the foreign security underlying the ADR option. Specifically, the CBOE has represented that it will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security, and other related securities which can affect the pricing of the underlying foreign security. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  To list an ADR option without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement, the proposal requires the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, to be not less than 50% of the combined world-wide trading volume for all classes of the issuer's stock and all ADRs that overlie any of these classes. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 6, and accompanying text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

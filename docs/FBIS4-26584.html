			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Officials and scholars  from several government departments last have held a forum on  the white paper on intellectual property rights protection in  China, which was released by the Information Office of the State  Council on the 16th of this month. [sentence as published]    Jia Mingru of the State Council's Bureau of Legislative  Affairs said at the forum that the white paper has for the first  time systematically expounded China's stand on and attitude  toward intellectual property rights in the form of an official  publication.    He said that China will draw up border measures later this  year for the benefit of intellectual property rights protection  as well as promulgate laws and regulations to bolster the  protection of integrated circuits and flora species.    Dong Baolin, a senior economist from the Trademark Office of  the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said that  the implementation of the country's trademark law since 1983 has  been followed by a rise in the number of both domestic and  foreign trademarks registered in China.    By the end of 1993, China had approved over 410,000  trademarks, including some 60,000 items from 67 countries and  regions worldwide, the economist said.    He added that the application volume in the first five  months  of this year has outstripped that of the corresponding period of  last year.    "This has demonstrated China's sincerity and resolution in  protecting trademarks," Dong stressed. "It also shows an  attractive Chinese market and a sound investment environment in  China."    Duan Ruichun, an official from the State Science and  Technology Commission, said that the white paper will help  eliminate misunderstandings about China's intellectual property  rights protection situation and promote bilateral and  multi-lateral cooperation between China and the rest of the  world.    Wen Xikai of the State Patent Office said that the state  patent law, in effect since 1985, has spurred domestic  inventions and foreign patent applications and resulted in a 24  percent annual increase in the overall number of patent  applications.    By the end of last year, the bureau had received 360,000  patent applications, 13.6 percent of which were from outside the  country.    "Any fair-minded person should no longer harbor any doubt  about China's sincerity and ability in protecting intellectual  property rights," she noted.    Wang Huapeng, an official from the State Copyright Bureau,  said that though the country's copyright law is only three years  old, China is one of the few countries in the world to have put  computer software under protection.    Zhang Yuqing, a senior scholar at the Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that international trade  would be virtually impossible today if there were no  intellectual property rights protection.    He said that pirated compact and laser discs are still seen  in some parts of China.    "This has harmed the development of the national music  industry," he said. He hoped to see further measures  implemented to deal with the problem.    Vice-Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission  Hui Yongzheng said that China's expected economic development  will be accompanied by the arduous task of protecting  intellectual property rights.    "China is always ready to cooperate with other countries on  the basis of equality and mutual benefit," he said. "However,  China resolutely opposes any act of interference in its internal  affairs under the pretext of intellectual property rights  protection."</p>

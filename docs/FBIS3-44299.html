[Qian] How are you?    [Reporter] On behalf of our listeners, I would like to first  express our thanks to you for agreeing to this interview in  spite of your busy schedule.    [Qian] I am also very glad to be interviewed by the Central  People's Broadcasting Network. I would like to take this  opportunity to send my regards to listeners across the country.    [Reporter] Thank you. Vice Premier Qian, 1993 is coming to  an end. We would like to ask you to briefly review the  international situation over the past year in your capacity as  foreign minister.    [Qian] The past year has been unusual. The international  community has witnessed many significant events. There have  been both inspiring developments and worrisome issues. The  civil war in Cambodia, which had dragged on for more than 10  years, was eventually brought to an end. Palestine and Israel  accorded each other recognition, fueling hope for a solution to  the Middle East issue. After eight years of difficult  negotiations, the Uruguay Round of trade talks eventually  produced an agreement. These are all inspiring. However, the  world is still far from peaceful. Regional disturbances and  bloody conflicts have continued unstoppably. The global  economic recession has cast a shadow over many countries. The  number of unemployed people in the United States has surpassed  10 million. The unemployment rate in the EC has breached the  double-digit mark, forcing 18 million people out of work, the  highest total since the end of World War II.    Nevertheless, the economies in the Asia-Pacific region --  especially those in East Asia -- have maintained robust growth  throughout the year. According to data provided by the Asia  Development Bank, the gross domestic product of the major Asian  countries increased by an average of 7.1 percent in 1993,  turning the region into the most economically vibrant part of  the world with the world's highest growth rate. Such growth has  breathed new life into the world's economic development. China  is an important member of the Asia-Pacific region. Over the  past two years, our country has increased its gross national  product by some 13 percent annually. Its foreign trade volume  in 1993 is expected to top $190 billion. The scene is one of  national prosperity, peace, good administration, harmony,  success, and promise. International public opinion, as well as  that of the business community in various countries, is upbeat  about China's prospects for economic development.    In the past year, our country has achieved great success in  foreign affairs under the leadership of the Jiang Zemin-led CPC  Central Committee. Our country has further improved its good-  neighbor and friendly relations with neighboring countries,  bringing these relations into the best-ever period since the  founding of New China. Our country has maintained stable and  friendly relations with developing countries. Its relations  with European nations and the United States have either improved  markedly or developed. The heads of state and government of  some Western countries have visited China. The official meeting  between the heads of state of China and the United States in  Seattle has enhanced mutual understanding, and this has brought  about a new beginning in Sino-U.S. relations. While  consolidating our gains, we will not forget the support and  assistance given to us by countries and people who have upheld  justice. Looking ahead, we are full of confidence. China's  development cannot be divorced from the world's, and the  development of the world also needs China. We are ready to work  together with all countries of the world and to make greater  contributions to international peace and development.    [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, today when the world economy  in general is in a slump, the economies in the Asia-Pacific  region are, as you just said, developing vigorously. Last  April, you attended the 49th annual meeting of the UN Economic  and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and last  November you again flew to Seattle to attend the fifth  ministerial meeting of the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation  [APEC] forum. Could you give your views on APEC's prospects for  development and China's role and position in the Asia-Pacific  region?    [Qian] The population of the APEC member states accounts for  two-fifths of the world's population. Their GNP's and volume of  foreign trade represent 50 percent and 40 percent, respectively,  of the world's total. In recent years, the economic growth  rates of the great majority of its members far exceeded the  world's average. In addition, the economies of these countries  and regions are fairly complementary to each other, thus  providing very favorable conditions and a foundation for  economic cooperation. Furthermore, a major attribute of the  region is its variety. The region has both developed countries  and countries which are still developing, both sovereign  countries and regional economies, both Oriental civilizations  and Western cultures. Social systems and ideologies vary or  even differ greatly from one country and region to another.    This variety dictates that economic cooperation in the Asia-  Pacific region can only be based on common economic interests.  Only by opening themselves to each other and adopting flexible  and diversified approaches in accordance with the principles of  mutual respect, seeking common ground while putting aside  differences, and equality and mutual benefits can economic  cooperation in the region produce substantial results. The  realities in this region show that the conditions for  establishing an economic community for the Asia- Pacific region  are not yet ripe.    [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, you have had frequent foreign  visits and busy diplomatic activities at home this year.  Particularly during this year's UN General Assembly, you met  with the leaders of more than 60 countries. I believe that this  kind of broad contacts reflects China's importance on the  international stage. We would like to ask you to discuss  China's position and role on the international stage.    [Qian] China is the largest developing country in the world  and one of the five permanent members of the UN Security  Council. Thus, China's obligations and influence in the world  are obvious. China upholds a foreign policy of independence and  peace. We stand for establishing a new order governing  international relations on the basis of the Five Principles of  Peaceful Coexistence. In international affairs, we are opposed  to interference in the internal affairs of other countries, to  hegemonism, and to power politics. At the UN forum, we uphold  justice and seek to safeguard the legitimate rights of  developing countries. We have made our due contributions to  safeguarding international peace and security, promoting the  political settlement of regional flash-point issues, and easing  tensions.    As China accelerates reform and opening up, its economic  relations and trade with other countries of the world have  continued to expand. China's market has been increasing in  capacity. A huge market potential is becoming a reality. This  has great appeal to Western countries for investing in China and  conducting all kinds of business activities. As President Jiang  said in Seattle, a stable, developed, strong, and prosperous  China will not pose a threat to any country but will only make  greater contributions to peace and development in Asia-Pacific  region and in the world as a whole. This is the role that China  should play on the international stage.    [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, China has made great progress  in its foreign relations in the past year. China has  established diplomatic relations with 158 countries. Could you  analyze for us the characteristics of China's diplomatic  activities in the past year?    [Qian] China has made great progress in its foreign  relations  in the past year. As you just mentioned, China has established  diplomatic relations with 158 countries. In the short period of  only one year, more than 30 heads of states or government  leaders and over 50 vice premiers, presidents, and foreign  ministers visited China. Arguably, our country's foreign  relations have expanded. Especially important, I think, were two  events which took place in November. One was the visit by  German Chancellor Kohl to China, and the other was President  Jiang's official meeting with Clinton in Seattle. These two  events signified that Western powers are beginning to adjust  their policies toward China. In view of China's economic  development, the world is taking a new look at China and is  carrying out a new appraisal of it weight and the role it is  capable of playing. This is a very important change.    [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, thank you for granting us this  interview. Before concluding this interview, we would like to  ask you to say a few words to our listeners.    [Qian] Today is the last day of 1993. I would like to wish  everyone a happy new year. I wish comrades and listeners  success in your work and happiness in your family life, and I  hope that everything goes according to your wishes. I also want  to add that the "Global Information" program of the Central  People's Radio Network has done a great job of providing  information and improving listeners' understanding of  international issues. I take this opportunity to congratulate  you and express my appreciation. Thank you.</p>

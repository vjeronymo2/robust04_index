			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Special EC summit idea takes shape THE IDEA of a special autumn EC summit to discuss implementing the Maastricht treaty received the backing yesterday of Mr Hans van den Broek, European commissioner for external political relations. Speaking in London, he said such a meeting would provide 'new and credible impulses for carrying out and bringing forward the integration process'. The proposal was made on Wednesday by six Christian Democrat leaders, headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The idea of calling a special summit to mark the ratification of the Maastricht treaty fits in with the German chancellor's desire to revive popular enthusiasm for the Community and give it 'a special push ahead'. One idea which could be explored is the possibility of bringing Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the Community before the end of 1995, as currently planned. A second theme would be to offer a better deal to eastern Europe countries whose full EC membership is a much more distant prospect. Yesterday, Mr van den Broek said he was optimistic that the regular six-monthly EC summit to be held in Copenhagen later this month would endorse Commission proposals for further liberalisation of trade with central and eastern Europe. The measures are due to be discussed by EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday. As for the suggested special summit, there is some doubt in Bonn whether it should try to settle the thorny problem of siting new EC institutions, in particular the European Monetary Institute. It would require tough negotiations, particularly between Germany, which wants the EMI in Frankfurt, and Britain, which would prefer any other site. Such haggling would be out of keeping with an optimistic, smiling summit, which is clearly what Mr Kohl wants. Just when a summit could be called depends not only on the British parliament, but also on the German constitutional court, which is considering a series of legal challenges to ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The court is expected to hold its oral hearing into the complaints by the end of June. Mr Kohl hopes that a final decision will come before the summer recess, but other officials are more cautious, suggesting that it may not be ready until mid-September, or even early October. That would still allow the special summit to be held by the end of October. The incoming Belgian presidency of the EC yesterday declared its determination to set up the European Monetary Institute on schedule by January 1, 1994 - the start of the second stage of European monetary union, Lionel Barber adds from Brussels. In a speech in Brussels, Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, called upon EC member states to make the process toward Emu irreversible. Failure to do so would encourage currency speculators, he said. Federalist-minded Belgium takes over the presidency from Denmark on July 1.</p>

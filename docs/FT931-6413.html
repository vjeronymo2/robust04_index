			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Refloat attempt SALVAGE experts were last night attempting to refloat the Freja Svea, a Danish-owned oil tanker grounded off Cleveland, as gale-force storms swept across north-east England. An RAF helicopter landed four salvagemen on the deck yesterday with gale force winds and waves of 30 to 40 feet. The four joined 12 members of the 21-man crew who stayed on board.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean-Pierre Tuquoi: "Official French Employers' </F> Delegation Plans Visit to Baghdad"]    [Text] French business circles are reacting increasingly  negatively toward the maintaining of the trade embargo against  Iraq. While Iraqi managers multiply visits to Paris, an official  employers' delegation is planning to travel discreetly to  Baghdad on 24 or 25 June, from Jordan, where the CNPF [National  Confederation of French Employers] delegation will also be  staying at the same time.    After Israel, Iraq. Last month, a CNPF delegation, led by  its chairman Francois Perigot, made an official visit to Tel  Aviv, ending years of ostracism of the Jewish state. Now it is  Iraq's turn to welcome France's employers.    No doubt this will be a very discreet, almost clandestine  visit. The 20 or so companies on the trip (including, according  to our information, Citroen, Renault, Alcatel, EDF [French  Electricity Company], Schneider, Babcock, and others) have  planned to make only a detour to Iraq, under the pretext of an  official visit to Jordan on 24 and 25 June. But this is one of  those visits whose symbolic importance outweighs its brevity.  Any one can be sure that the Baghdad regime will take  advantage, if only toward its public opinion, of the discussions  which the French delegation will have with Iraqi leaders (no  doubt with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz, or even with  Saddam Husayn, who doubles as head of state and head of  government).    It is true that Baghdad is in an unpleasant position. On 18  July, the UN Security Council will examine, as it does every two  months, whether it is appropriate to maintain or lift the  embargo against Iraq decreed in 1990, immediately after the  invasion of Kuwait. Barring last minute surprises, everything  leads us to believe that once again, the "most hideous crime of  history" (as the Iraqi press describes the embargo) will be left  untouched, and that, from August onward, Baghdad will have to  undergo a fifth year of embargo.    This status quo is due to Washington's intransigence. For  Washington and its British ally, Saddam Husayn's regime has  still not conformed to the many UN resolutions and "sanctions  must remain in place," at least until the end of the year.    France would like to be more accommodating, in the name of  "progress" made by Iraq on the path of disarmament. In the name  also of commercial interests. With Iraq, these were previously  substantial. In 1982, in the midst of the Iran-Iraq conflict,  Baghdad absorbed more than 7 percent of France's non-OECD  exports, making Paris Iraq's third largest supplier of  non-military goods.  <H5>  Oil Contracts </H5>   It is the threads of this privileged relationship which the  French groups are discreetly trying to retie, pending the  eventual lifting of the embargo. Thus, several French companies  are negotiating agreement protocols with Baghdad for the repair  of equipment previously sold by France. This is already the  case in the water treatment area, and will no doubt be so soon  in the telephone sector. A delegation of senior officials from  the Iraqi Transport and Communications Ministry is currently  negotiating with Alcatel [French telecommunications concern].  "Between Frenchmen and Iraqis, the welcoming back has been  warm," we are assured by a businessman who frequently shuttles  between Paris and Baghdad.    All these deals which are being arranged have a strong smell  of oil about them. Heavily in debt and lacking foreign  currency, Baghdad is relying on its crude oil resources (10  percent of world reserves) to finance the reconstruction of the  country. In this area, too, French companies are in the lead  (footnote 1) (Dr. Fadel A. Othman [name as published], the  director general of SOMO, the company in charge of selling Iraqi  crude, will be in Paris on 27 June to take part in a symposium.)  For more than two years, ELF has been negotiating for the  exploitation of the giant Majnoun oil field in the south of  Iraq. Total is similarly negotiating for the Nahr-Umr field,  also in the south of the country, while Italy's AGIP is well  placed to obtain the operator slot for Halfaya, a third "giant"  field. (Footnote 2) (Exploitation of a fourth giant field, that  of West Kurnah, is said to have been entrusted to the Russians,  who already began exploiting it several years ago with the help  of the French engineering company Technip.) On each of these  fields, whose exploitation will require billions of dollars, the  French and Italian companies will not remain alone. If  negotiations are successful, they will have to integrate their  participation and, with Baghdad's blessing, bring in foreign --  probably American and British -- partners.    But will ELF and Total, who maintain difficult relationships  in Iraq, end up carrying off the deal after years of laborious  discussions? Will Baghdad not finally prefer foreign  competitors? "Negotiations are well advanced. The items still  open no longer constitute an obstacle," one of the negotiators  affirmed. "The decision whether or not to sign the contracts  lies now with Baghdad."</p>

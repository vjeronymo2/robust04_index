			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs give warning on housing cash PRESSURE on the government to maintain the present level of housing association grants mounted yesterday with the publication of a Commons environment committee report warning that cuts would put decent housing beyond the reach of many families. The report, which says that ministers must consider the wider social consequences of short-term budget savings, was welcomed by Sir George Young, the housing minister. Sir George faces a fight to protect housing association budgets in the forthcoming spending round negotiations with the Treasury, which has identified housing expenditure as an area for possible savings. He said he would assess carefully the implications of the committee's report and expected to publish his response after the summer recess. The report says that previously published government plans to reduce housing association grant rates from the current 67 per cent to 55 per cent by 1995-96 would prevent some associations from building homes and leave many tenants facing higher rents. MPs say the government should therefore drop the planned cuts. Ministers are also urged to set up a working party to review the relationship between housing association grants and housing benefit entitlements - and to develop a strategy for easing the problems faced by tenants caught in the poverty trap. Mr John Battle, Labour's housing spokesman, said housing associations needed an end to the uncertainty surrounding their future so that they could attract additional private finance. Tenants needed to know that their rents were not going to 'rocket' because of grant cuts. Mr Jim Coulter, director of the National Federation of Housing Associations, said the report confirmed that the government was stifling the potential growth of social housing. 'We call on the minister to announce that housing association grant rates will not be reduced in the coming two years'.</p>

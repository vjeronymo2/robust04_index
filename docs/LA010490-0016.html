			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MONSTER OF 'ZERO DEFECTS' STILL LIVES;  </P> <P> MILITARY: THE INVASION OF PANAMA REVEALED WEAKNESSES IN OUR FORCES'  CAPABILITIES -- AND IN THE PUBLIC'S OVER-HYPED EXPECTATIONS.  </P> <P> The U.S. military invasion of Panama highlighted some fundamentals that will  continue to influence the application of American power. First is that Karl von  Clausewitz's 160-year-old concept of "friction" -- i.e., nothing will ever  proceed exactly as planned -- is still with us. For example, at Ft. Bragg,  N.C., the takeoff of elements of the 82nd Airborne Division was delayed by an  unexpected ice storm; on the opposite coast, at Ft. Ord, Calif., the takeoff of  elements of the 7th Infantry Division was delayed by dense fog. Despite all the  advances of modern technology, the caprices of weather still have a major  effect on the execution of military operations.  </P> <P> And despite the most detailed and precise planning -- and the planning for  Operation Just Cause was thorough indeed -- mistakes still happen, just as they  did at the Normandy beachhead 45 years ago. From a military point of view, such  glitches are to be expected: The best way to deal with friction, Clausewitz  said, is to anticipate and be prepared for it. But how civilians perceive these  mistakes may be quite another matter.  </P> <P> The American public has been led into false expectations by the Pentagon brass.  Trying to build public support, Defense Department bureaucrats discarded  Clausewitz as inimical to the public relations image they wished to create.  That was the image of an American military that could conduct flawless  operations where everything went exactly as planned and where practically no  one got hurt.  </P> <P> Unwittingly, this "zero defects" mentality created a monster, for "surgical  precision" became the standard by which the media and the public measured  military prowess. The successes of the Libyan raid and the Grenada incursion,  for example, were overshadowed by the "frictions" that denied the perfection  that Americans had been led to expect. Pentagon powers, realizing they had  created a false and misleading picture, have since made a concerted effort to  drive a stake through the heart of the "surgical precision" monster. The  mythology lives on: Initial media reporting on the Panama invasion once again  focused on glitches rather than successes.  </P> <P> This is serious business that goes far beyond public-relations glitz. In the  1990s, when fewer and fewer Americans will have firsthand combat knowledge, the  false notion that military operations can be "surgical" could have disastrous  consequences. It could tempt us into actions we would soon regret. Americans  must be told and understand the bloody and imprecise nature of military force.  </P> <P> Another fundamental highlighted by the Panama invasion is that the United  States remains a world island that must project its power beyond its borders in  order to influence international events. With geography education in such  disrepute that some college students believe the Soviet Union is somewhere in  Central America, such elementary facts bear repeating.  </P> <P> The first requirement of American military strategy is to get there from here.  In the Panamanian invasion, that reality was somewhat hidden by the fact that  airlift alone was able to move most of the combat forces into position. But  Panama was a special case. Not only was it within flying distance from  continental military bases, there was also a major logistical support  foundation already in place.  </P> <P> If, as would be the case in most other projections of American power, that  support base had had to be established concurrent with the invasion, our lift  capability would have been severely strained. Taking nothing away from the  enormous effort put forth by the Military Airlift Command, it still remains a  fact that America's strategic lift capability is in sad shape. Sealift in  particular is in shambles as America's maritime fleet continues to shrink, and  it is sealift that normally moves the majority of oil, ammunition and heavy  combat arms and equipment.  </P> <P> The lack of such heavy lift could be deadly. Our success in Panamashould not  blind us to the fact that the lack of sufficient airlift and sealift remains  our greatest strategic military shortcoming. Correcting that deficiency should  be one of the major priorities for the 1990s.  </P></p>

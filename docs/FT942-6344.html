			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK's 'silent industrial majority' must show support for Europe Sir, British industry must stand up and be counted in the forthcoming European election. There are four key issues which we, as chairmen and chief executives of leading industrial and business organisations, support and regard as vital if Britain is to play its full part in Europe, as well as creating jobs and wealth: 1) We support the development of a single market on the assumption that Europe remains able to compete successfully in a global marketplace and does not become 'Fortress Europe'. 2) We believe it is inappropriate to speculate on the formation of a central bank or a single European currency until it is much clearer how and when the economic convergence of European states, which vary significantly in economic and political terms, will be achieved. 3) We believe the full implementation of European employment legislation would severely damage the competitiveness of British industry in world markets and increase levels of unemployment. While recognising the responsibilities of industry to its employees, the British government must continue to resist the implementation of such legislation as European works councils and restrictions on working practices. 4) We wholeheartedly support the continuing government commitment to the geographical expansion of the European Union. The silent industrial majority must make its voice heard above the political bickering.

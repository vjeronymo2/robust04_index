			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, the Rules adopted today require broker-dealers to inform customers in writing, when a new account is opened, about the dealer's policies regarding the receipt of payment for order flow, including whether payment for order flow is received; and a detailed description of the nature of the compensation received. As discussed in greater detail below, the new Rule and Rule amendments require that broker-dealers provide information in account opening documents about order routing decisions in orders subject to payment for order flow, including an explanation of the extent to which unpriced orders can be executed at prices superior to the displayed NBBO at the time the order is received. Second, the Rules adopted today require dealers to update this information and to provide such information annually to all customers. Taken together, this information should assist customers in assessing the quality of trade executions they receive and encourage broker-dealers to consider the opportunity for price improvement in establishing order routing arrangements. Finally, the Rules adopted today require broker-dealers to indicate on confirmations whether the broker or dealer receives payment for order flow, and the availability of further information on request. These are described in greater detail below, beginning with the scope of securities subject to the Rules and the types of inducements covered by the Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Securities Subject to Disclosure Obligations and Definition of Payment for Order Flow <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Securities Subject to Disclosure Obligations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, the obligations of both Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and the amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 were limited to orders in national market system securities. The Commission requested comment on whether both Rules should be extended to Nasdaq Small-Cap and OTC Bulletin Board Securities. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  Commenters addressing this issue supported the inclusion of both and, accordingly, the Commission is expanding Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 to include these securities. As revised, both Rules would include ``any subject security as defined in &sect;240.11Ac1&hyph;2 or a security authorized for quotation on an automated interdealer quotation system that has the characteristics set forth in Section 17B of the Act * * *.'' <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Proposing Release,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 1, 58 FR at 52940 n.44 and n.46. Two commenters support the inclusion of Nasdaq Small-Cap and OTC Bulletin Board securities in the Commission's proposal. One commenter states that if the goal of disclosure is to provide customers with as much information as possible to make an informed decision regarding where to place their orders, it does not make sense to limit the disclosure requirement to national market system securities but rather the requirement should extend to Nasdaq Small-Cap and OTC Bulletin Board securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two exchanges support the inclusion of options in the confirmation disclosure requirements. One exchange suggests that the Commission consider the ramifications that payment for order flow may have on the options marketplace, especially once multiple trading of options is taken into consideration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> letter from Leopold Korins, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated December 9, 1993. The Commission, therefore, is soliciting comment in a parallel action today on whether amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 and Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 should extend to the options markets.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Companion Release,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The OTC Bulletin Board is currently the only automated quotation system that has the characteristics set forth in Section 17B of the Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> letter from Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary, SEC, to Richard Ketchum, Executive Vice President, National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), dated Dec. 30, 1992. The revision to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 is intended to cover securities included in any other automated quotation systems at such time as the Commission designates them under Rule 15g&hyph;3(c)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that inclusion of these securities provides customers with the best picture of a broker-dealer's policies regarding the routing of customer orders and the receipt of payment for order flow. As discussed in the Proposing Release, <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  the practice of payment for order flow originated in the OTC market, and since then has been routinely used as a competitive tool in that market. Payments for Nasdaq and OTC Bulletin Board stocks, moreover, are generally greater than for exchange-listed national market system securities. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, the Commission believes that the disclosure protections should be extended to the OTC market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Proposing Release,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 1, 58 FR at 52935. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See id.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR at 52936 n.16. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Definition of Payment for Order Flow <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, Rule 10b&hyph;10(e)(9) defined payment for order flow broadly, to include all forms or arrangements compensating for directing order flow. The Commission received 23 comment letters addressing the scope of the definition. The majority of these commenters were supportive of the Commission's efforts and agreed that non-cash inducements for order flow are economically equivalent to, and have the same effect as, cash payments for order flow. Opponents of the proposed definition, which include most of the exchanges, argued that rebates and fee reductions are structurally different from other cash payments and should be excluded from ``monetary'' payment for order flow. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  The Commission has considered all the comments, and for the reasons discussed below, believes that the items enumerated in Rule 10b&hyph;10(e)(9) appropriately include arrangements involving payment for order flow. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Several exchanges argue that, unlike cash payments, all exchange charges and fees are filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act and are a matter of public record. The New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') added that unlike exchange fee structures, dealers do not charge fees to brokers for use of their services; because there is no ``fee'' to discount, the NYSE argues that it is disingenuous to suggest any similarity between the two practices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letter from James E.

What type of data would help to either support or refute the predictions made by QSAR?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Plausible Mismanagement Scenario  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency developed baseline risk estimates by selecting plausible mismanagement practices based on information collected in the RCRA Section 3007 survey for current management operations. For wastewaters, the Agency selected the plausible mismanagement practice to be the current practice of deep well injection. The Agency has no information or reason to believe that, if not listed, the wastewaters are likely to be managed in a different manner, except if pretreatment of wastewaters is required prior to injection. For sludges and waste solids, the Agency selected the plausible mismanagement to be an unlined landfill. Currently, a portion of the waste goes to a lined Subtitle D landfill. In addition, the Agency has information that a portion of these wastes, while not regulated as hazardous, are managed as hazardous with disposal in Subtitle C landfills. However, the Agency lacks adequate information showing that, if not listed as hazardous, the wastes would continue to be disposed in lined landfills and result in significantly lower estimates of potential risk. The Agency requests comment on this approach to modelling plausible mismanagement practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Risk Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Risk characterization approach. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The risk characterization approach follows the recent EPA Guidance on Risk Characterization (Habicht, 1992) and Guidance for Risk Assessment (EPA Risk Assessment Council, 1991). The guidance specifies that EPA risk assessments will be expected to address or provide descriptions of: (1) Individual risk to include the central tendency and high-end portions of the risk distribution, (2) important subgroups of the population such as highly exposed or highly susceptible groups or individuals, if known, and (3) population risk. In addition to the presentation of results, the guidance also specifies that the results portray a reasonable picture of the actual or projected exposures with an open discussion of uncertainties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Individual risk. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Individual risk descriptors are intended to convey information about the risk borne by individuals within a specified population and subpopulations. These risk descriptors are used to answer questions concerning the affected population, the risk levels of various groups within the population, and the average risk for individuals within a population of interest. The approach used in this analysis for characterizing baseline individual risk included: (1) Identifying and describing the population of concern for an exposure route; (2) determining the sensitivity of the model parameters used in the risk estimation; (3) estimating central tendency and high-end values for the most sensitive parameters in the risk estimation procedures; and (4) calculating risk for an exposure pathway that provides a characterization of the central tendency and high-end risk descriptor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Population risk. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Descriptors of population risk are intended to convey information about the risk borne by the population or population segment being studied. These risk descriptors are used to answer questions concerning the number of cases of a particular health effect that probabilistically could occur within the population during a given time period, the number of persons or percent of the population above a certain risk level or health benchmark (e.g., RfD or RfC), and risk for a particular population segment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Risk assessment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The analysis of risks was developed using both the input of derived or measured toxicological information and the modelling of waste mismanagement scenarios. Specifically, for disposal of solids in unlined landfills, the concentration of the constituents of concern in the landfill leachate first was determined using the Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) on selected record samples, or when TCLP data were lacking, by assuming a leachate concentration based on the aqueous solubility of the constituent. It then was assumed that the leachate would be diluted by a factor of 100 (as described in the Toxicity Characteristic Rule 55 FR 11798, March 29, 1990) before reaching the nearest drinking water well. The resulting diluted concentrations can be then compared with the health-based values. In the case of this analysis, a one-in-a-million (10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) risk level or hazard quotient of 1 was used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For wastewaters, the situation was more complicated. One facility has been granted a no-migration variance from the land disposal restrictions. The second facility, which consists of several separate plants, has not obtained such a variance. The plants at the second facility currently dispose of process wastewaters by deep well injection. Modelling for specific wastewater streams was based on the possibilities of leakage of injected wastewaters from the injection zone upward to a drinking water aquifer through the abandoned oil and gas wells in the area. Details of this modelling are given in the Risk Modelling Background Document and summarized in the individual wastewater risk assessment to be discussed in the following sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

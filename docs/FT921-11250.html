			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cash in on your bricks and mortar - How to . . . get income from your home ARE YOU sitting at home in retirement, wishing you could get some more income from somewhere? Chances are that the source for that income is close to home - in fact it is your home. Bricks and mortar are precious assets. But converting the value which has accrued in your house into a viable income can carry risks, so think carefully before acting. If you still have a sizeable lump sum salted away you could buy an annuity with it, or possibly, if you want to protect your estate, a selection of income unit trusts. If that is not an option, the simplest way to increase income is to sell your house and buy somewhere cheaper. This may be attractive if you are unfortunate enough to be widowed. However, if you do not want to move, schemes exist which allow you to take income from your house while continuing to live in it. But they are complicated. Consider your heirs. If you have no children, or are happy with the amount you have already given them while bringing them up, you may not mind a scheme which destroys the value of your inheritance. If you are keen to leave your heirs a nest egg you need to be more careful. For those with no spare capital and who cannot countenance leaving the home of all their memories, there are two ways to extract income from your house: Annuity-linked Home Income Plans This is the simplest scheme. You re-mortgage your house, or a portion of it, and buy an annuity with the proceeds. The sums should work out so that the annuity pays the mortgage and leaves a worthwhile increase to your income. Usually, both the mortgage rate and the annuity payment are fixed. The rate you receive on the annuity, which repays a fixed income until your death, depends on your age. The longer you wait before starting one of these schemes, the better value you will receive. As a rule, you cannot effectively benefit from such an arrangement unless you are at least 70 years old, the minimum for many schemes. Most will not allow you to borrow more than Pounds 30,000, as this is the limit for receiving mortgage interest relief at source. Loans are not economic above this level. On a loan of Pounds 30,000, a woman of 75 can currently receive an annual income of Pounds 1,525 from Allchurches, and Pounds 1,649 from Carlyle Life, according to the Consumer's Association. This may not sound particularly exciting, but it could be a useful supplement to your pension. Separate rates are available for couples. You can put together one of these plans yourself by shopping around, but it is easier to use one of the established schemes. Home Reversion Schemes Reversions generally produce greater income, but are less kind to your heirs. Typically, the plans work as follows: you sell your house to a life office, which only has the right to use it once you have died. In return for taking the risk that you live for a long time, the life office pays only a fraction  -usually around a half - of the value of your home. Variants on this include cash reversions, where you receive a cash sum up front and invest it for income as you wish, and schemes where you pay a nominal rent for the house, while the money from the reversion is put into an annuity. Stalwart Life offers a scheme which effectively allows you to make a straight swap of a reversion for an annuity. While you are alive, a reversion costs you nothing. But if you have heirs, they may not thank you for using one of these schemes. With a standard home income plan, the heirs are left a house, and an outstanding loan. This gives them a worthwhile inheritance. With a reversion scheme, they are left nothing as the house reverts to someone else. You can buy a 'capital-protected' annuity - which might guarantee to repay capital to your estate within three years, for example - but again this will not help if you only just survive the period of capital protection. Reversions do, however, tend to provide greater slices of income - according to the Consumers' Association a 75-year-old woman, using the same assumptions as above, would receive Pounds 2,924 from Carlyle Life, Pounds 3,180 from Cavendish Property, and Pounds 2,595 from Stalwart Assurance. You do not have to sell your entire house. Reversions can involve pledging fractions of the value of your house to the insurers, which lessens the difficulties for your descendants. Carlyle Life also has a 'renewable' plan, which allows you to sell successive slices of your house. Depending on your circumstances, either reversions or home income plans could make sense. However, the following should not be touched with a barge pole: Variable-Interest Mortgages With any luck, no ill will come of using a variable mortgage. Maybe interest rates will continue to fall. But 'safety first' is a good motto in this situation. Roll-Up Loans These are re-mortgages, but you do not repay the interest. Instead, it 'rolls up', to be retrieved from your estate. These schemes could make sense before retirement, as you try to boost your standard of living before pension and endowment policies mature, but they are too risky for the elderly. If the loan builds up to 75 per cent of the value of the house, you may be required to repay some of it. If that is not possible, you could lose the house. Steer clear. Investment Bond Schemes These have been more or less outlawed, and if you are offered such a scheme, you should report it to the regulators. The concept is the same as for the standard home income plan, but money is invested in an investment bond, not an annuity. There are many circumstances where an investment bond, which fluctuates with the market rather than offering a fixed return, makes sense. This is not one of them. With your house at stake, the risk that the value of the bond will go down is simply not worth taking. Many pensioners were thrust into these schemes just as mortgage interest rates began to rise, and equity markets fell. In many cases, they have been forced to sell their homes. Do not touch. Before taking professional advice, which is essential before taking any steps towards financial packages as complex as this, two publications will be useful to you. Age Concern England publishes the standard text on the subject, written by Cecil Hinton, an independent financial adviser who specialises in home equity-release plans for the elderly. Also, an up-to-date and comprehensive consumer survey of the products on offer comes in the current issue of Which? magazine, published by the Consumers' Association. Using Your Home As Capital by Cecil Hinton, published by Age Concern. England, 1268 London Road, London SW16 4EJ. 081-679-8000. Pounds 2.95.</p>

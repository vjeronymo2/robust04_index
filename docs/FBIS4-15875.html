			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Mirny (Murmansk region) April 11 TASS -- "Russia is  neither producing nor testing nuclear weapons", ITAR-TASS was  told by Lieutenant-General Yuriy Zhuravlev, head of the state  testing area under Russia's Strategic Missile Command.    On Monday, a large group of journalists from various  publications, information agencies, and radio and tv stations  arrived at the top secret garrison in Mirny. They will be able  to acquaint themselves with some of Russia's latest military  technology, in particular, with the "Topol" experimental missile  system which is expected to become part of the armed forces in a  couple of years.    The journalists' arrival corresponded with celebrations of  Cosmonaut's Day. In Mirny, this holiday is widely celebrated,  since much has been done here for progress in space.    "We have no secrets to hide from Russians and the world  community, but our openness does not hinder our responsibility  for the security of Russia", Yuriy Zhuravlev declared.</p>

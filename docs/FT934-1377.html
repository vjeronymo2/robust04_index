			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Police told to probe Lib Dems Scotland Yard said last night it had been asked by Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, 'to look at the allegation of incitement to racial hatred' made against Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets. The investigation will centre on whether a leaflet issued by the party in the east London borough amounts to an incitement to racial hatred. Scotland Yard said the instruction by Sir Nicholas had been made at the request of Mr Jack Straw, chief Labour environment spokesman. Earlier, the local Liberal Democrats faced a split over the issue after an internal inquiry recommended the expulsion of three party members. Mr Jeremy Shaw, one of three accused of circulating racist leaflets, said local members were 'very likely' to set up a splinter group. A substantial breakaway could deprive the Liberal Democrats of its eight-seat majority on Tower Hamlets council, which the party won from Labour in 1986. The internal inquiry, chaired by Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat peer, was set up after controversial leaflets were published during a council by-election won by the far-right British National Party. The report contains an indictment of campaigning tactics by Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats during the past three years. The tactics continued after the inquiry was established. The report also urges the national party to appoint a campaigns officer to monitor Tower Hamlets until after local elections next May. The three members, who deny racism, have the right to appeal to an independent panel to be set up by the party. The report says the members involved did not intend to stir up racial prejudice. But their populist approach pandered to resentment and anxiety among local white voters. The report's most damaging section asserts that the national Liberal Democrat party knew what was happening in Tower Hamlets three years ago, but took 'no effective concerted action'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, tried quickly last night to limit electoral damage to the party by making clear that it would act firmly to end racism. Mr Graham Tope, president of the Liberal Democrat London region, said the exposure of racism in Tower Hamlets was unlikely to affect the party's prospects in the elections. He said: 'Where people comment at all, they recognise that this party has not tried to sweep it under the carpet. Far from hurting us next May, I think it is going to help us.' Mr Straw called the report 'a whitewash'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lai Chin-hung (6351 6930 1347) from Taipei] </F>   [Text] The mainland State Council transmitted some days  ago a document worked out by the State Planning Commission.  According to the document, no construction of new horse racing  and golf courses is allowed in the future. All provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions are expected to strictly  follow the "four no's principles": No horse racing and golf  courses established as listed projects; no permission granted to  such projects; no land provided; and no loans given.    An informed source in Beijing said: The State Council  transmitted the document to various provinces, municipalities,  and autonomous regions across the country in mid-January,  requiring them not to grant permission to construction of new  horse racing and golf courses as of the day the document was  received. In the meantime, the Construction Ministry, the State  Land Administration Bureau, the PRC State Administration for  Industry and Commerce, and the State General Administration of  Taxation jointly issued a circular stressing that no licenses,  land, and loans shall be given to projects involving a high rate  of consumption, including horse racing and golf courses. This  is another specific administrative measure against the building  of new golf courses since the national conference for land  bureau directors held last October.    It is reported that central authorities had earlier made it  a  rule that apart form a few major cities like Beijing and  Shanghai, where golf courses have been built, only one golf  course shall be built in each province and municipality.  However, many provinces ignored the order and pressed ahead  with the construction of golf courses under the pretext that a  good recreational environment is necessary for attracting  foreign funds. Take Hainan for example, the provincial  government gave formal approval to 15 golf courses last year and  more golf courses are in preparation pending permission.    The same source said: Many people on the mainland are  presently interested in "speculating in certificates," believing  "speculating in real estate is more profitable than speculating  in stocks; speculating in futures is more profitable than  speculating in real estate; and speculating in membership cards  is more profitable than speculating in futures." "Speculating  in" golf club membership cards serves as a shortcut to getting  rich. Possessing a golf club membership card is regarded as  enjoying a higher social status.</p>

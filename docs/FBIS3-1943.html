Anti-riot police and the para-military People's Armed Police  (PAP) have been deployed to help restore order to cities and  towns badly hit by industrial incidents.    A news blackout has been imposed on the number and severity  of strikes in the past year, but sources said the authorities  were concerned enough to release emergency funds in spite of the  worsening budget deficit.    The sources said the hardest hit sector was the depressed  coal industry, with many mines and factories owing labourers  months of salaries.    Just before Lunar New Year, the State Council set aside 1.6  billion yuan to help miners and other staff in the coal industry.    One of the worst industrial incidents took place in the  mining town of Jixi near the Russian border in northeast  Heilongjiang province, when nearly 10,000 miners took part in a  strike in January.    The action was called off when the authorities paid workers  enough money to take home for the Lunar New Year.    It is understood state coal-producing companies had been  crippled by competition from private mines which offered coal  for a third of the state company price. Transport shortages  caused stockpiling.    Sources familiar with Chinese industry said a depressed  market and restructuring of state units had forced at least half  of government-run enterprises to lay off workers or delay paying  wages and bonuses in the past year.    They said the managers of 88 large-scale state enterprises  recently petitioned the State Council for special relief funds  so that they could pay their workers up to 75 percent of regular  wages.    The sources said that instead of paying salaries, many state  factories had from last year issued workers goods from  storehouses, which employees sold on the streets.    Such practices sparked many demonstrations, even in  relatively prosperous Tianjin and Shanghai.    Human resources experts have admitted that the labour  problem  has been compounded by inflation, which is approaching 25 per  cent in urban areas.    An internal report last month said the livelihood of more  than 20 percent of employees in urban state firms had been  "significantly affected" by hyperinflation.    Analysts said the spectre of strikes, demonstrations and  urban unrest had already forced the leadership to scale down  plans to modernise state businesses by transforming them into  Western-style shareholding or stock companies.    Internal estimates said at least 30 percent of the state  sector's 100 million-strong workforce was superfluous. Laying  the workers off was the only way to improve efficiency.    Meanwhile, security sources said Beijing's police,  paramilitary police, and state-security agents had been  instructed to keep a close watch on "trouble-makers" in  factories.    Those to be watched included underground trade-unionists and  labour organisers who in several instances had established  contact with dissident intellectuals and those involved in the  1989 pro- democracy movement.    The sources said for the first time since the Tiananmen  Square crackdown, security agents were closely watching workers  during the politically sensitive period that runs from the  beginning of the National People's Congress to the anniversary  of the June 4 crackdown.    Sources said the frequency with which various police and  paramilitary units had been mobilised to handle industrial  unrest had increased in 1993.    Tianjin sources said two PAP platoons were deployed last  month to help defuse a strike that involved 4,000 workers.    Last December, the Ministry of Public Security set up  China's  first patrol police force.    A dispatch by the semiofficial China News Service said last  night that 88 cities had set up patrol police squadrons. Patrol  police numbers had reached more than 15,000 officers.    While the aim of the new police unit was to fight crime,  analysts said it would also be used to handle urban crises  including industrial action.    An official report last month said there were 250,000 labour  disputes, including strikes, from 1988 to the end of last year.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mixed report for opt-out schools THE FIRST report by the school inspectors into schools which have opted out of local authority control in England and Wales has found no conclusive evidence that they have raised standards. Overall standards in grant-maintained schools were slightly higher than in those which remained under local education authority control. The standards were judged to be satisfactory or better in 3 per cent more of the lessons in grant-maintained schools than in local-authority schools. Grant-maintained Schools 1989-92. HMSO. Pounds 3.50.</p>

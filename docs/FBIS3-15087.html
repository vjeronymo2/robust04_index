The agreement is effective from March 1.    Three Armenian soldiers were wounded as the Azeri army  mounted artillery fire in the north of the Martuniskiy Region,  the press office of the Karabakh Defense Forces told Interfax.  The Azeri fire was not returned because of the ceasefire  agreement, it said.    However, Armenian forces reserve the right to retaliate if  Azerbaijan continues to violate the agreement, Chief of Staff of  Karabakh Forces Seiran Oganian said.</p>

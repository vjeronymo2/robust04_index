			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign Affairs  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said here today that the Bosnian issue  could be solved only by political means.    Kozyrev made these remarks at a joint press conference after  meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the  U.S. mission in Geneva.    According to Kozyrev, a military solution to the Bosnian  conflict is an extreme solution which should not be used.    He also said that the warring sides in Bosnia should search  for a compromise within the framework of negotiations over  territorial concession by the Bosnian Serbs.    On economic sanctions against the Serbs, Kozyrev said this  issue is linked to the search for a political solution, adding  that lifting of the sanctions will be put on the agenda if a  cease-fire is concluded.    Christopher said the U.S. and Russia have the same  objectives  in Bosnia.    On the situation in Goradze, the U.S. secretary of state  said  things are developing in a "good direction" and the Bosnian  Serbs are withdrawing their heavy weapons some 20 kilometers  away from the town.    However, Christopher added that NATO planes will monitor  Serb  compliance with the withdrawal.    Kozyrev and Christopher also discussed the Middle East, the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Russian participation  in NATO's partnership for peace plan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 5 (BTA) -- A rally held in Sofia by  the anti-communist Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS) today  called on the cabinet to resign and demanded early elections.    Addressing the rally, SDS leader Filip Dimitrov said the  union will use all parliamentary means to make the cabinet step  down. He called upon the people to flood into the central  square and remain there until the cabinet resigns in case the  parliamentary means prove ineffective. The demonstrators  chanted their approval.    "The Communists (the successor to the disbanded Bulgarian  Communist Party is the Bulgarian Socialist Party) are ruling  this country, pulling the strings of straw man Berov (the prime  Minister)," said Ivan Kostov, MP of the SDS and former finance  minister. "The choice is elections provoked by the SDS. Only  the force that can bring about elections can be sure of winning  them in this chaos," said Kostov.    SDS floor leader Stefan Savov said the SDS needed to poll  not  35 percent but 51 percent of the vote to form a strong  government. The SDS scored a 34.6 percent victory at the 1991  polls, which was not enough to form a stable cabinet.    The speakers charged the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights  and Freedoms and the New Union for Democracy with allying  themselves with the Communists by backing the present  government. President Zhelev was also accused of helping form  the cabinet and supporting it so far.    For the first time at the rally, new songs written  especially  for the SDS election campaign were performed. The speakers  called on people not to despair and go to the polls.    The rally chanted the name of exiled Bulgarian King Simeon  and sang the old Bulgarian anthem (from the monarchy days)  banned by the communist regime.</p>

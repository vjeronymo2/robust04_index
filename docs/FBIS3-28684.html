			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor  Yasushi Mieno urged financial institutions Wednesday [9  February] to work harder to clear their mountains of bad loans  in line with Finance Ministry guidelines issued the day before.    At a regular press conference, he also welcomed Tuesday's  record 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package as  "appropriate" for helping spur the long-flagging economy. But  Mieno said his view has not changed that the economy remains  weak with no clear signs of recovery amid a continued mix of  good and bad signs. Even if banks should have to post losses --  long a taboo in the Japanese financial system -- to write off  the bad loans they hold, that "would not be a grave thing"  because of their underlying strength, Mieno said.    Stressing the importance of financial institutions' own  efforts to dispose of problem loans, he urged them to do more  than they have so far in clearing the loans, a hangover from  speculative excesses of the late 1980s that continue to weigh on  bank lending. He urged them to make the efforts in line with  ministry guidelines included in Tuesday's pump-priming package.    The guidelines propose establishing an institution to  shoulder bad loans expanding special write-offs to cover  "restructured" loans, those in danger of default on which  lenders have lowered interest rates or forgiven some repayment  obligations.    But Mieno declined to endorse calls to require banks to  report the restructured loans on their books. Only loans to  bankrupt enterprises and those at least six months in arrears on  interest payments must now be disclosed, prompting calls for  more openness.    Mieno pointed to a government panel report issued last year  that called for gradual improvement in disclosure while taking  into account possible disruptions it would cause in the  financial system.    On the economy, he referred to the recent bright spots of  stabilizing corporate sentiment and smoothly proceeding  inventory adjustment. But he said they remain pitted against  such minus factors as a gradually worsening employment situation  and time-consuming adjustments in corporate balance sheets.    As a step to help revive the still-stagnant economy, Mieno  praised Tuesday's stimulus package, citing its record size, its  inclusion of income tax cuts and proposals for financial  deregulation. He noted some "supply-demand uneasiness" in the  bond market, which fears that the flood of new government bonds  needed to finance the pump-priming package could overrun market  demand and push interest rates higher.    Recent rises in longer-term market rates also reflect  recovering stock prices and a correction from earlier large  falls in rates, Mieno said.    Asked about banks' recent 0.3 percentage point hikes in  their  long-term prime rates, the first in eight months, he said they  would not hurt the economy as rates remain at historically low  levels.    Mieno played down last week's hike in a key U.S. overnight  interbank lending rate, the first such tightening in five years.  "I don't think it will have a big, immediate effect on the  currency markets," he said. He noted that his U.S. counterpart  Alan Greenspan said in hiking the federal funds rate that it had  been too low and that interest rates should be neutral to ensure  long-term economic expansion.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PITTSBURGH BEATS ANOTHER RANKED TEAM  </P> <P> Maybe Pittsburgh should play only highly-ranked teams and not schedule weak  opponents.  </P> <P> The Panthers lost earlier this season to Siena and Duquesne and had lost 3 of  their last 4 games before surprising the third-ranked Sooners, 99-91, Sunday at  Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Brian Shorter scored 37 points and had 12 rebounds, and Rod Brookin had 24  points as the Panthers overcame Mookie Blaylock's 37-point performance.  </P> <P> Oklahoma (13-2) had won 11 straight, and the loss was the first for the Sooners  in the 12 games they have scored 90 or more points.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh's only victories in its last 5 games have been against then-No. 2  Syracuse and Oklahoma, which hadn't lost since the second game of the season to  Nevada Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Shorter, a 6-foot 6-inch sophomore, had 22 points in the first half as the  Panthers used a 9-point run -- aided by a technical foul on Sooner Coach Billy  Tubbs -- to take a 55-49 halftime lead. Pittsburgh was defeated, 76-57, by No.  7 Georgetown last Wednesday.  </P> <P> Brookin scored 11 second-half points as the Panthers (8-6) never let the  Sooners get any closer than 5 points after halftime.  </P> <P> Oklahoma, averaging 110.5 points a game, trailed by as many as 12, but closed  to within 86-81 on Herman Henry's tap-in with a little less than 5 minutes  left. But the Panthers scored 7 straight points -- 4 by Brookin and 3 by  Shorter -- for a 93-81 lead with 2:30 to play.  </P> <P> Virginia 106, North Carolina 83 -- Senior guard Richard Morgan scored a  career-high 39 points and the Cavaliers broke a 5-game losing streak by routing  the No. 8 Tar Heels in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Charlottesville,  Va.  </P> <P> North Carolina (14-3 overall, 1-1 in the ACC) had won 6 straight games against  Virginia (8-6, 1-2) and 13 of the last 14.  </P> <P> The Tar Heels played the last 5:23 without Jeff Lebo, who was leading North  Carolina with 26 points when he twisted his left ankle and had to leave the  game.  </P> <P> Louisville 67, Georgia Tech 65 -- Kenny Payne made 2 3-point baskets in the  final 77 seconds to lift the No. 9 Cardinals past the No. 19 Yellow Jackets at  Atlanta.  </P> <P> Payne's first 3-pointer, with 1:17 to play, gave the Cardinals a 63-62 lead.  His second, with 44 seconds left, built a 66-64 advantage. Pervis Ellison, who  scored 20 points, made a free throw with 4 seconds left as Louisville (12-2)  extended its winning streak to 12 games.  </P> <P> Brian Oliver missed a 40-foot shot at the buzzer for Georgia Tech (10-4).  Oliver had a chance to tie the score with 5 seconds left, but he missed 1 of 2  free throws.  </P> <P> Florida State 101, Tennessee 90 -- Tony Dawson scored 30 points and George  McCloud had 29 as the No. 14 Seminoles easily defeated the No. 17 Volunteers at  Tallahassee, Fla.  </P> <P> Florida State (12-1) opened a 50-28 lead late in the first half and withstood  several Tennessee runs in the second half. The Volunteers (11-2) closed to  within 66-61 with 12:14 left in the game on Dyron Nix's 3-point shot, but were  never able to get any closer.  </P> <P> McCloud scored 5 points on a breakaway dunk and a 3-point shot to cap a 7-point  run that lifted the Seminoles back into a 73-61 lead.  </P> <P> Washington 82, California 80 -- Todd Lautenbach scored 6 points in the final  1:17, including the winning basket as time expired, giving the Huskies the  Pacific 10 victory at Seattle.  </P> <P> Lautenbach rebounded a missed shot by teammate Dion Brown and made a 4-footer.  Just before that shot, the 6-10 reserve center made 2 free throws, then stole a  pass at midcourt and drove for a layin to give the Huskies (5-8 overall, 2-3 in  the Pac-10) an 80-78 lead with 1 minute remaining.  </P> <P> Leonard Taylor tied the game, 80-80, with 2 free throws with 45 seconds left.  Taylor led all scorers with 26 points.  </P> <P> California is 12-5 overall and 3-3 in the Pacific 10.  </P></p>

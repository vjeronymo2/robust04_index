At a security policy  conference in Berlin today, Karaganov, deputy director of the  Institute of European Affairs of the Russian Academy of  Sciences, at the same time opposed the admission of East  European countries into NATO.    Enlarging NATO by admitting the countries of East and  Central  Europe interested in joining the alliance would "water down"  NATO's strength, Karaganov said. Russia's minimum security  interest was not being excluded from new alliance structures, he  said.    The Partnership for Peace offered by NATO to the former  Warsaw Pact states opened up the prospect of an expansion of the  Western defense alliance, said Walter B. Slocombe of the U.S.  Defense Department. Failure of the reforms in Russia would also  have destabilizing repercussions on Western countries, he said.  [passage omitted]</p>

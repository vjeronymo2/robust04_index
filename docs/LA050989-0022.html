			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: UNITED EDUCATION REPORTS LOSSES OF $14.3 MILLION  </P> <P> United Education &amp; Software, an Encino company that ran into trouble last  year when authorities discovered a series of foul-ups at a United Education  operation that serviced government-guaranteed student loans, said it lost $14.3  million in the year that ended Jan. 31.  </P> <P> The results are in contrast to a profit of $4.4 million earned a year earlier  by the company, whose main business is operating vocational schools. Revenue in  the latest fiscal year rose 15% from a year earlier, to $81.1 million, mainly  because United Education operated more vocational schools and had increased  enrollment at some of them.  </P> <P> The results for the latest fiscal year included a loss of $8.8 million from the  discontinued student loan servicing operation and a loss from continuing  operations of $5.4 million.  </P> <P> Included in the loss for the year is a provision for the sale or closing of  nine vocational schools that were lagging in profits, the company said. United  Education said it has sold six schools to International Training Corp., a  private company in Denver, for an undisclosed amount.  </P> <P> Last year, a review led by the U.S. Education Department uncovered a series of  problems in a United Education unit in Costa Mesa that serviced student loans.  The problems included failure to properly contact thousands of delinquent  borrowers. United Education blamed the problems on computer errors, although  student- loan authorities said there was widespread sloppiness in the  operation.  </P> <P> After the foul-ups surfaced, Education Department officials said the government  would not pay for the bad loans that United Education had serviced. Bank of  America, trustee for bonds that were sold to raise money to buy student loans,  has said it and a group of major banks that issued letters of credit backing  the bonds could lose as much as $650 million.  </P> <P> Last month, nine of the world's largest banks, most of them in Japan, sued Bank  of America, alleging that it failed to properly oversee United Education's  work.  </P></p>

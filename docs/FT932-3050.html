			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Arts: Everybody seems to be 'morphing' - Television Remember Murray Mints, the too good to hurry mints? We're going well, we're going Shell? Wondering where the yellow went when you cleaned your teeth with Pepsodent? How straightforward matters were in the days when television commercials were simply supposed to sell things. Now bafflement is the order of the day and smart references to famous movies or previous commercials are de rigueur. You see a picture of a man with a bird cage on his head, and then a woman with a model of a Richard Rogers building in her hair. A grand piano falls in slow motion from a high bridge. The picture cuts rapidly from a human skull with smoke emerging to a sinister bald black man wearing a patent leather corset as he sits in front of a navy blue sky. Big ball bearings whiz through the air. What on earth is being advertised? A dungeons and dragons computer game? A new pill to banish nightmares caused by Gorgonzola and gherkin sandwiches? We hear what sounds like David Bowie singing as events become even more obscure: three creatures, part animal, part human, wade through a river, bending as though to look for something under the water. An old man is seen, covered in gold paint. A car drives through water sending up a huge sheet of spray. A head appears in a black leather sado-masochist's mask bristling with metal spikes and with a zip across the mouth. Finally comes the sales pitch, written round a rubber tyre: 'Tested for the unexpected, Dunlop'. Had this been produced as a show reel by a student on a mass media studies course we would have said it was technically competent but derivative in rather too studied a manner: it echoes every overdone rock video from 'Relax' to 'Justify My Love' and on the way borrows from every mass media fashion from James Bond to Derek Jarman. The mystery is why anybody imagines it might sell car tyres. The commercials for the current British Telecom share sale are not baffling but they, too, are full of references to other trendy mass media material; indeed they consist entirely of parodies of Inspector Morse, with Mel Smith as John Thaw. It is fairly funny to have the Morse figure bustling into the manor house and ignorantly blowing away the forensic man's fingerprint powder, or using a megaphone from the top of an Oxford tower to tell his people on the ground to 'Grab that one, the one in the gown, no not that one in the gown . . .' and so on. But again the question arises, why anybody thinks that this is the best way to sell the product. Why not tell us something about the advantages of owning BT shares? The amount of information conveyed in these commercials is startlingly small. Do you understand the Toyota Celica commercial? Two pantomime Italian policemen pull into a petrol station which, instead of an Italian sign saying 'Gasolio', has a huge American sign saying 'Gas'. They peer admiringly into an empty right hand drive Celica. An attractive girl walks up and climbs into the left hand seat. The driverless car magically moves off and the police follow. We see that the Toyota has a British number plate and has somehow acquired a second person, in the driving seat. The police pull out to overtake, the Toyota disappears, then reappears going in the opposite direction, and a voice says 'The car in front is a Toyota'. But of course by this time there is no car in front, only a car behind. What on earth is it all supposed to mean and why does anyone imagine it might sell us a Celica? These are not isolated examples, dredged up from remote parts of the schedules. On the contrary, they are some of the most frequently repeated commercials presently appearing on ITV and Channel 4, and there are plenty more like them, where mystification seems to be paramount. Since all cars now have adjustable seats, glove compartments, handbrakes and windscreen wipers, and many have cassette players, Volkswagen cannot be trying to use these as unique selling points. So just what are they doing in the ad where the woman pulls the seat forward, stuffs the sweets in the glove compartment, takes off the handbrake, puts on the windscreen wipers and rejects the cassette only to be followed by a man who pushes the seat back, takes out the sweets and so on? Why do the man and woman in the Pirelli commercial swap seats and why isn't he allowed to sit beside her? Why does the second blues musician in the Heineken ad fall through the verandah floor: does this beer no longer reach the parts that others cannot reach? The more carefully you watch the commercials, the more powerful becomes the feeling that many of them are now being made by people who are more concerned with the furtherence of their own careers than with sales of the products. Perhaps this is not surprising, given the fame of men such as Ridley Scott whose progress from Hovis ads to Blade Runner has been told so many times that most of us can recite it. However, there does appear to have been a sea change. In Scott's day television commercials were at the forefront of innovation: you could trace the introduction of new techniques from commercials to Hollywood and then into the mainstream of television. Today the innovations seem to be coming from rock videos and Hollywood, moving into commercials and then spreading elsewhere. 'Morphing' is a good example. This trick, in which a computerised dissolve is used to give the appearance of one thing literally turning into another - metamorphosis - first appeared in rock videos just over a year ago (notably Michael Jackson's last major offering), was used extensively in Terminator 2, and is now unavoidable in the commercial breaks. From Andersen Consulting where a snail turns into a frog, via Castrol GTX where an Aston Martin turns into a Vauxhall, then a Land Rover and so on, to the BBC's latest house commercial in which John Humphrys, Lenny Henry and Kate Adie rapidly turn into one another, everybody seems to be morphing. No doubt television programmes will soon discover the technique and overwork it until it becomes a cliche. There are still enjoyable commercials with beer, as ever, providing a lot of the laughs, many of them, once again, depending upon knowing references to previous commercials. In Boddington's current campaign the lady goes through the old Camay routine, dabbing her cheek with 'lather' (foam from the head of the beer) and being told by her man 'By 'eck, you smell gorgeous tonight petal'. Greene King has hired the chap who used to tell us that he liked his Remington razor so much he bought the company and got him to say 'I had a taste of Greene King IPA and liked it so much - I bought a pint'. Meanwhile, in the background, two men shave themselves with electric razors. Panasonic has a wonderful ad in which a very old lady extols VHS video cameras . . . with help from her mother. But this is about as close as you come today to a simple sales pitch. The great bulk of any commercial break nowadays appears to be devoted to auditions from directors who would like to be working for rock video producers, or who are already doing so and would now like to move on to Hollywood. It makes for some amazing technical trickery, and some fascinating virtuoso passages of film making. Whether it increases sales of sweets, petrol or toothpaste as effectively as the old jingles and pack shots is a different matter entirely.</p>

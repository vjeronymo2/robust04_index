			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Books: Rough justice for women - AC Grayling welcomes a book which demonstrates the shortcomings of the law when dealing with minority groups EVE WAS FRAMED: WOMEN AND BRITISH JUSTICE by Helena Kennedy Chatto and Windus Pounds 16.99, 285 pages DO WOMEN get a fair deal at the hands of the criminal justice system in Britain? That is Helena Kennedy's central question. Her answer is an unequivocal 'no'. Her book is a sober and sobering explanation of why this is so. She puts her case, and suggests remedies, with compelling clarity. This is an important book; if it gets the wide readership it deserves it will make a substantial difference to public debate about Britain's legal system. Kennedy practises at the criminal Bar. There are more lucrative and mannerly regions of the law, but Kennedy's choice is governed by the fact that in criminal proceedings the liberty of the subject is at stake. Her achievements are not restricted to the courts; she is an active campaigner for penal and constitutional reform, and television has made her widely known. Women have to struggle to succeed in any of the professions, the Bar not least among them. But that is not Kennedy's main point. Her concern is with those who are at the receiving end of criminal justice, especially women. Practising as a barrister has given her ample opportunity to experience the failure of the system to treat women and other disadvantaged groups fairly. It is a mere commonplace to say that the legal system was created by men for men. Relatively few women commit serious offences, and the assumptions and practices of the courts reflect this fact. They show it also when women come before the courts as victims of crime. In a host of ways the courts fail to recognise the reality of women's lives, with unjust results. The same applies to members of ethnic minorities. Kennedy uses a wide range of cases to show how women are disadvantaged, whether as victims of rape and domestic violence, or as defendants on charges ranging in seriousness from prostitution to murder. Even though in a recent instance a woman was exonerated from a murder charge, the cases make grim but profoundly instructive reading. A salient example is that of battered women who appear before the courts either as accessories to the killing of a child, or because they killed their partners. There are widespread misconceptions about such women among judges and juries, who cannot understand why they stay with their battering partners. Do they take perverse enjoyment in beatings - or are the beatings not really so bad after all (as if there were an acceptable minimum of domestic violence)? In the US the behaviour of abused women has been recognised as a species of stress disorder, now called 'Battered Woman's Syndrome'. Research shows its devastating effects: victims come to be oppressed and controlled by the mere threat of violence, and find themselves frozen into an inability either to escape or resist - even, in some cases, into inability to protect children at risk, as in the Hedda Nussbaum case in New York. Battered women mask the physical and mental effects of their suffering, and in court seem emotionally detached. Profound misperceptions result. One concerns the crucial matter of provocation. A defence can attempt to reduce a murder charge to one of manslaughter by pleading provocation, but courts will only comply if the provocation was immediate - as when someone discovers his wife's infidelity, and kills her in a rage. There have been cases of women killing partners not in blind anger, but when the men were unawares, perhaps in drunken sleep. The cumulative effects on women of years of persistent beatings and fear are still not understood by courts, who apply the standard provocation test, with resulting injustice. These misunderstandings parallel many assumptions about women which distort the law's treatment of them. Whereas 'fragrant' examples of femininity like Mary Archer prompt lyricism from judges, the case is otherwise for prostitutes, lesbians, and women with children in care, who risk condemnation as much for what they are as for the crime they have committed. Barristers learn to urge women clients to dress and behave demurely in court; anything that challenges acceptable stereotypings runs a risk. This applies as much to the rape victim as to the alleged murderess, and deeply affects the justice either can hope to receive. Kennedy describes case after case where these considerations apply. Her sober language cannot hide their shocking nature, and as they accumulate one has the sense that the law is truly a foreign country for women who find themselves in its toils. But the story is not entirely negative. Kennedy applauds the improvements - few and slow though they are - which are taking place, and suggests further reforms. These include public scrutiny of judicial appointments, training for judges, and positive action to increase the number of women judges. As her book eloquently testifies, reform is long overdue.</p>

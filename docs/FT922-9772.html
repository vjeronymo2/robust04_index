			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Inco battens down the financial hatches - The various pressures facing the Canadian nickel producer Management upheaval has propelled Mr Michael Sopko to the top of Inco, the western world's biggest nickel producer, several years ahead of schedule. It has also put new management in charge of every one of the Canadian group's primary metal operations. 'These were the middle managers who got us through the recession in the early 1980s, when some analysts suggested Inco might go belly-up,' Mr Sopko points out. Inco is back under financial pressure today. Low metal prices and uncertainties about the intentions of the Russian nickel producers - the biggest in the world - are just part of the picture. Inco has also seen its operating costs rise steeply in the past four years. Mr Ray Goldie, analyst at Richardson Greenshields, a Canadian stockbroker, estimates that, whereas in 1989 it cost Inco only USDollars 81 to mine a tonne or ore, last year it cost Dollars 105 and in 1992 it will be Dollars 116. Meanwhile, the price Inco realised on its nickel has fallen from Dollars 5.61 a lb to Dollars 2.72. There is little Inco can do about the nickel price. So Mr Sopko sees as his top priority 'our urgent need to lower the cost of production.' He was appointed president of Inco only a year ago. In normal circumstances an Inco president would expect to spend some years in that role before getting a stab at the top job. But in December Mr Don Phillips surprisingly announced he was to retire in April this year and Mr Sopko was named as his successor as chairman and chief executive. During his brief term as president, Mr Sopko restructured the management at Inco's Ontario division in Canada, its biggest, replacing four vice-presidents with three new ones. He also reduced the number of managers to five fromseven and three of the five are new appointees. The new management team was instructed to cut costs by 20 per cent in the next three to four years. Mr Sopko is the first Canadian-born chairman of Inco in the history of the Toronto-based company which celebrated its ninetieth anniversary in March. He is the son of Czechoslovakian immigrants and a metallurgical engineer who graduated from McGill University in 1960. Now 53, he has spent all his 28-year working life with Inco. He says he was given some opportunities to shine along the way and took them wholeheartedly. But he suggests there are half a dozen other managers at Inco who could do his job 'and the important thing is to be the right person in the right place at the right time. 'I replace a marketing man. Having a production person in place now that production costs have to be cut makes sense. People are selected according to the corporation's needs at the time.' Since his appointment was announced, Inco has been battening down the hatches. At present nickel prices it is breaking-even at best. It has cut planned capital expenditure this year to the bare minimum - only Dollars 280m compared with the Dollars 350m scheduled last autumn and the Dollars 440m spent in 1991. The group, which had a cash shortfall of Dollars 172m last year, has also saved money by issuing shares in part payment of its contribution to the employee pension scheme. Debt at the end of last year was Dollars 1.26m, giving Inco a debt-equity ratio of 42-58. Mr Sopko says he does not want it to rise further and aims to return it to the 35-65 level as quickly as possible. He and other members of the Inco board have been talking to the credit rating agencies because Inco treasures its investment-grade rating. Which explains why the dividend has not been cut - but neither has it been lifted since 1989. Mr Sopko insists Inco's financial pressures have to be seen in perspective. Although the company was criticised in some quarters for giving away too much during recent past pay negotiations, production costs since 1987 have risen only 15 to 16 per cent because of employment costs. Fully one third of the rise was caused by lower ore grades (less recoverable metal in the ore) and lower tonnage because some Inco mines are nearing the end of their lives and their replacements are not yet ready. A strong Canadian dollar also made an impact and, because Inco's capital spending has been very high, depreciation and amortisation costs have risen sharply. As the group's investment in new mines begins to pay off, costs will fall when tonnages metal yields improve, he points out. Inco's biggest investment  -a Dollars 520m, six-year project to reduce dramatically sulphur dioxide emissions at its Sudbury metallurgical complex - is nearly complete. This investment will bring savings of about Dollars 20m this year and by 1994 an annual Dollars 80m. Mr Sopko suggests demand for nickel will grow at least by an annual 2 to 3 per cent, so nickel will remain Inco's core business. 'We intend to be the lowest-cost producer and maintain our one-third market share.' That share makes Inco market leader, 'and enables us to do things others can't - better research and better products'. It also gives Inco credibility with customers who are therefore more likely to 'join us in our long-term plans'. Already 80 per cent of Inco's annual nickel output is spoken for by long-term contracts and sales to its downstream operations. And, even with a production person in charge, Inco's financial goal remains a 15 per cent return on equity averaged out over the economic cycle.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Observer: Steady helm The reappointment of the glamorous Lady Wilcox as chairman of the National Consumer Council must be a relief for a Labour-founded quango which at times seemed in danger of succumbing to Thatcherite scepticism about its role. Two previous chairmen sent in to inject a spot of free-market realism into the government-funded consumer watchdog - businessman Michael Montague and ex-MP Dame Sally Oppenheim-Barnes - were moved on fast after going native. The strange thing is that Judith Wilcox has been no less vociferous in defence of the consumer interest. Although she is a member of the prime minister's advisory panel for the Citizen's Charter, the NCC has published a series of reports which have challenged government claims to be radically improving public services such as the health service and British Rail. Indeed, far from impeding Lady Wilcox's career as one of the great and the good, her high profile at the NCC has led to membership of the Local Government Commission, the Board of the Inland Revenue, and the Money Advice Trust. She seems to have caught the prime minister's eye. Wherever next for the high octane woman who proudly proclaims that, where she comes from, 'all the men go to sea and the women run the business'?</p>

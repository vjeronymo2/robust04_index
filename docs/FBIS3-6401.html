The United States backtracked on an earlier  non-tariffication  accord and instead slashed import duties in its final schedule  screened at the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT).    It stated that the scaled-down package was conditional on  other countries making comparable tariff concessions.    Korea followed suit and submitted a schedule containing  tariff cuts of 3 percent on the same copper goods and 4 percent  on electronic items, instead of none.    Seoul proposed bilateral negotiations on March 8 while  screening the U.S. offers in Geneva, charging that Washington  had broken its promise made last December.    It called for bilateral talks because the U.S. list included  items of interest to Korea, said Pyun Hyong, director-general of  the customs and tariff bureau at the Finance Ministry.    Washington is also unhappy about Seoul's withdrawal of  earlier offers to abolish tariffs on the nine items and is  likely to complain at the two-day screening of Korea's  industrial offers in Geneva from Thursday.    After Korea's schedule has been screened by Saturday, the  two  countries will sit down to iron out their differences in tariff  cuts before the March 25 deadline for all countries to finalize  their schedules.    Seoul blames Washington for breaking its promise first while  the latter argues that it had attached conditions -- it could  scale back its offers if Japan also did so -- and made changes  accordingly, pointing out that Seoul made alterations without  having attached conditions earlier in the agreement last  December.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT: TONY CIRCLES THE GLOBE;  </P> <P> PRESS FINDS BOY AVIATOR LIKES TO ACT HIS AGE  </P> <P> Some people might relish the attention, but chances are their lives are hardly  as young and fresh and full of promise as that of 11-year-old Tony Aliengena.  </P> <P> So if this youngster would rather watch cartoons or send a paper airplane  sailing across a room full of serious-minded adults than appear on national  television, write it off to the frivolity and innocence of youth.  </P> <P> But Tony cannot escape the limelight, and as the San Juan Capistrano  fourth-grader continues his quest to become the youngest person to fly an  airplane across the world, there are few places where he is not considered to  be news.  </P> <P> It's enough to make the shy, soft-spoken preteen break into a huge grin on one  those rare occasions -- like his stop in Moncton, Canada -- when the press  isn't around to greet his arrival.  </P> <P> The Moncton stop stood in stark contrast to his European landfall here and  United States stops in Salt Lake City, Denver, Lincoln, Neb., and St. Louis,  where Tony was greeted like a politician on the campaign trail, stepping out of  his small Cessna Centurion to the flash and whirl of cameras.  </P> <P> Waiting at the airports were throngs of local reporters, as they were here,  where Norwegian news photographers asked him in thickly accented English to sit  astride his plane's propeller for pictures.  </P> <P> Everywhere, reporters have been ready to pounce on Tony with the same questions  he had answered a dozen times before. Tony has politely fielded the inquiries  and posed for pictures, but he has quickly tired of the press attention.  </P> <P> At a stop in suburban Boston, it was all Tony could do to pull himself away  from a card game and do yet another interview with local television, this one  with WLVI reporter Joe Shortsleeve.  </P> <P> The interview went like this:  </P> <P> Reporter: "How did you pick out where you were going to stop?"  </P> <P> Tony: "Umm, it was the easiest way around the world."  </P> <P> Reporter: "Are you excited?"  </P> <P> Tony: "Yeah."  </P> <P> Reporter: "Anything else I should have asked you?"  </P> <P> Tony: "No."  </P> <P> With that, Tony dashed off to more enjoyable pursuits.  </P> <P> Gary Aliengena, Tony's father, said his son does not like dealing with the  press because he finds it tiring -- more tiring, it seems, than flying an  airplane for hours on end.  </P> <P> The reporter, Shortsleeve, said he was not surprised to find Tony so  unenthusiastic about his trip.  </P> <P> "That's the way he was when we interviewed him last year (following Tony's  record-breaking flight, at age 9, across the United States)," Shortsleeve said.  "The problem we have, as reporters, is we don't normally interview 11-year-olds  and can't relate.  </P> <P> "Now, if we had an 11-year-old asking him questions, he'd probably do a lot  better."  </P> <P> Pat Wiesner, a Colorado businessman who is piloting one of the two chase planes  for the flight, said that as father of a 10-year-old boy, he understands Tony's  predicament with the press.  </P> <P> "What you've got is an 11-year-old doing a very adult thing like flying around  the world. But he is still just an 11-year-old kid," said Wiesner, 52, whose  son, Michael, is accompanying Wiesner and his wife, Janet, on the trip.  </P> <P> Tony is always accompanied at press gatherings by his father, a certified pilot  who is riding with his son in the co-pilot's seat. Aliengena, 39, a real estate  investor, is close at hand to help Tony field questions.  </P> <P> Tired of the constant grilling from the press, Tony is apt to answer questions  as he did in Lincoln, when a reporter inquired how long the trip was.  </P> <P> Tony's response: "Umm, it's long."  </P> <P> In the press conferences, Tony's boyishness is underscored by the fact he has  to stand on a chair to be seen over the lectern. He also needs a booster seat  in his plane to see out the windshield.  </P> <P> Tony is in the habit of horsing around with other members of the entourage  before and after the press questioning. He is accompanied on the trip by his  10-year-old sister, Alaina, and 10-year-old Roman Tchermenekyh, his Soviet pen  pal, in addition to Wiesner's son..  </P> <P> And Tony is not immune to childish antics. Before a Denver press session, for  instance, he sent a paper airplane sailing across the room as his father spoke.  </P> <P> Tony is equally unimpressed with big-time celebrity journalists.  </P> <P> When Guy Murrel, the public relations consultant for the trip, arranged an  interview between Tony and his father and Jane Pauley on NBC's "Today" show,  Tony responded to the news with typical aplomb.  </P> <P> "Who's Jane Pauley?," he asked.  </P> <P> Roman (pronounced Ro-mar) has become almost as much of a media curiosity as  Tony. At every press conference and public gathering, Tony introduces Roman as  his pen pal, and Roman is called to the podium, usually wearing an oversized  baseball cap and a shy smile.  </P> <P> But Roman, who is the son of a powerful air minister who helped approve Tony's  flight across the Soviet Union, knows little English and usually manages only a  weak, "Hi, I Roman." He smiled widely in St. Louis, though, when a reporter  asked through an interpreter what he had liked most about his journey across  the United States.  </P> <P> "The most exciting thing was the amusement park in California and the cowboy  saloon in Denver," Roman said, referring to his visits at Knott's Berry Farm in  Buena Park and a country-western steakhouse in Denver.  </P> <P> After Tony's "Today" appearance in Boston, his interpreter, Maxim V. Chikin, a  correspondent for the Moscow youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, arranged for  him to be interviewed by telephone by a reporter for the Soviet news agency,  Tass.  </P> <P> Later that same morning, he signed autographs for a mob of 300 elementary  school students who had unfurled the 1,000-foot banner of U.S. friendship  signatures that he hopes to deliver to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in  Moscow.  </P> <P> The next morning, however, Tony got to do what he really likes: he sat in front  of the television, along with Roman and the other two children, watching  cartoons.  </P></p>

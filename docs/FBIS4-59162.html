			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 8 May (INA)--Vice President Taha Yasin  Ramadan has received the Jordanian al-Mustaqbal Party delegation  led by its Assistant Secretary General Samir Khirfan.    During the meeting, Taha Yasin Ramadan said that taking  sides  with Iraq is supporting right, justice, principles, and laws.  He added that the hostile U.S. policy needs no proof to be  denounced because it is clear and declared against Iraq,  Palestine, and the Arabs.    The head of the al-Mustaqbal Party delegation praised  President Saddam Husayn's courageous leadership and the bravery  of the Iraqis who have confronted a military aggression and  challenged economic aggression represented by the embargo  clamped on Iraq through the reconstruction campaign. He  stressed that the aggression against Iraq is an aggression  against the Arab nation, especially since Iraq has become the  revolutionary Arab base whose struggle for the sake of Arab  causes is based on firm and principled stands.</p>

			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Chile to speed Pinochet human rights trials PRESIDENT Patricio Aylwin has attempted to close a chapter of Chilean history by speeding up the trials of officials accused of human rights abuses under the previous military government of General Augusto Pinochet. In an eagerly awaited national address on Tuesday night, Mr Aylwin proposed the appointment of special judges who would be given the responsibility of rapidly processing the trials, which have become bogged down in the legal system. Judges would hear evidence in secret in an attempt to learn the truth quickly and, where possible, to discover the whereabouts of missing bodies, the prime concern of most victims' families. There are more than 2,000 recorded cases of extra-judicial killings and disappearances, most of them brought to light in a 1991 report commissioned by the government. A 1978 amnesty law precludes punishment of abuses committed between 1973 and 1978 - the bloodiest period of the Pinochet regime. Mr Jaime Castillo Velasco, president of the Human Rights Commission, said the proposals were 'very important and could produce the desired results'. A successful outcome, however, rests on the willingness of military officials  -under the cloak of secrecy - to help unearth fresh evidence. Mrs Sola Sierra, president of the Association of Families of the Disappeared, said: 'We are not satisfied. The president's proposal favours those who violated human rights, belittling the just demands of victims' families for truth and justice.' Calls from the military and some right-wing politicians to put a 'full stop' to all trials were rejected by Mr Aylwin as 'morally and legally inadmissible'. To bury the past, he said, would undermine the painful process of national reconciliation. The president said his proposal, which will shortly be submitted to Congress, aimed to put into practice the so-called Aylwin doctrine, namely: 'The whole truth, and justice as far as possible.' He admitted, however, that his was not a 'perfect solution'.</p>

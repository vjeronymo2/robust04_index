			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: NationsBank turns in 22% income rise THE recovery trend in US banking continued yesterday when a 22 per cent rise in net income was reported by NationsBank, the large south-eastern regional group formed last year by the merger of C&amp;S Sovran and NCNB. Yesterday's bank results also included a 65 per cent jump in net profits at the Chicago-based Continental Bank and a profitable quarter for the Connecticut-based Shawmut National, compared with a loss in the second quarter of 1991. NationsBank's net profit was Dollars 251m in the second quarter, up from Dollars 206m in the same period last year. Earnings per share were Dollars 1, some 14 per cent higher than the 88 cents of a year ago. The bank, the fourth biggest in the US with Dollars 111bn of assets and more than 1,800 offices in 10 states, said net loan write-offs were Dollars 141m in the quarter, down significantly from Dollars 262m a year ago. Second quarter bad debt provisions were almost halved year-on-year, from Dollars 294m to Dollars 150m. Non-performing loans declined by Dollars 126m during the quarter, to Dollars 1.76bn. At Continental Bank, second quarter net earnings totalled Dollars 51m, up from Dollars 31m a year ago. On a per share basis earnings were 78 cent against 41 cents. Although net interest revenue was unchanged at Dollars 119m, Mr Thomas Theobald, chairman, said reduced operating expenses and lower bad debt provisions contributed to the profits rise. Continental Bank's provisions were Dollars 25m against Dollars 63m in the second quarter of 1991. Operating expenses dropped by 16 per cent to Dollars 134m in the quarter. Shawmut, an indicator of the state of the New England economy, recorded an Dollars 8.6m net profit in the quarter, compared with a Dollars 58.7m loss a year ago. Earnings per share were nine cents against a loss of 81 cents.</p>

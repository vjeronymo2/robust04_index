			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The number of corporate  bankruptcies in Japan fell 2.9 percent in fiscal 1993 for the  first dip in four years, despite staying above 14,000 for the  second straight year, a private credit research agency reported  Friday [15 April].    Corporate failures with liabilities of 10 million yen or  more  numbered 14,019 in the year ended March 31, while liabilities  left by the bankrupt firms slid 10.7 percent to 6.65 trillion  yen for the second consecutive yearly fall, Teikoku Databank  said.    The amount of liabilities was the third largest on record,  it  said. The record for liabilities was 7.77 trillion yen in  fiscal 1991 when the economy was hard hit by a stronger yen.    Despite the overall decline in business failures, the number  of recession-induced bankruptcies or those going bankrupt due to  poor sales climbed 14.6 percent to 8,645, signaling that the  economic slump still drags on, the agency said.    This type of bankruptcy accounted for 61.7 percent of total  failures, up 9.5 percentage points from the previous year, it  said.    Corporate failures were at high levels throughout the entire  year with over 1,000 failures reported each month, during the  worst economic slump in decades.    The findings come at a time when the economy is showing  brighter signs in some sectors and as Bank of Japan Governor  Yasushi Mieno has declared the worst is over.    But Teikoku Databank said Japan is still mired in the  prolonged economic slowdown despite signs of recovery in some  sectors, and noted that a full-fledged recovery is not expected  until 1995, judging from such negative factors as the strong yen  and an increase in long-term interest rates.    In March, corporate failures fell 4.3 percent from a year  earlier to 1,282 cases with liabilities shrinking 40.2 percent  to 463.62 billion yen, the agency said.    March was the second consecutive month in which business  failures fell from the year-earlier level, but it was the first  time in three months they have risen above 1,200, it said.    In the latest reporting month, the number of  recession-induced failures dropped 5.8 percent from a year  earlier, but their share of total bankruptcies exceeded 60  percent for the eighth month in a row.    Such bankruptcies totaled 789 cases, compared with 838 cases  a year earlier.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 2303 describes the assignment of automatic exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options. Because all cash-settled foreign currency options in a series that is in the money will be automatically exercised, an assignment will be made to each short position in the series. Accordingly, Rule 2303 contains no reference to OCC's Rule 803, which describes the random assignment of exercise notices. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Paragraph (b) of Rule 2303 states that OCC shall make available to each clearing member with cash-settled foreign currency options an Exercise and Assignment Activity Report on the business day following the expiration date. This report will reflect the clearing member's exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options and its assignments of obligations relating to exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The random assignment procedure described in Rule 803 is built into OCC's exercise and assignment system. Because OCC will use its exercise and assignment system to administer and generate reports for assignments of cash-settled foreign currency options, OCC, as an operational matter, will actually use the random assignment procedure for assignments of automatic exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options. However, the use of the procedure will have no effect on writers or assigned clearing members because all short positions will be assigned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 2304 states that the settlement date for exercised cash-settled foreign currency options will be the day immediately following the expiration date. Rule 2305 states that settlement of cash-settled foreign currency options will occur by the payment of the exercise settlement amounts from assigned clearing members to OCC and by the payment of the exercise settlement amounts from OCC to exercising clearing members. Under Rule 2305, OCC may net exercise settlement amounts to be paid by a clearing member against exercise settlement amounts to be paid to the clearing member to obtain a single net settlement amount for cash-settled foreign currency option exercises with respect to each account. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  This is consistent with OCC practices respecting other foreign currency options. All exercise settlement amounts will be paid within OCC's usual timeframes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 2305 replaces Chapter IX of the Rules and supplements Rules 502 and 607 for cash-settled foreign currency options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 2306 makes it clear that exercised cash-settled foreign currency options to which a suspended clearing member is a party, whether the clearing member is an exercising clearing member or an assigned clearing member, generally will be settled in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2305. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 2306 supplements Rule 1104 and replaces Rule 1107 for cash-settled foreign currency options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

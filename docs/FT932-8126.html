			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television ITV's interpretation of 'current affairs' is neatly defined by 3D (ITV, 7.30pm) which returns tonight and includes the story of three sisters fighting a 'dieting battle' against their collective weight of 60 stone. And these are the people that won the franchises. But at least 3D can plead that it is trying to be weighty. Thursday nights are often a desert for television and tonight is no exception. Does anyone actually find Ruby Wax (The Full Wax: BBC1, 10.30pm) amusing as opposed to embarrassing? She substitutes innuendo for wit and hopes we won't notice. One hour earlier there is a chance to see another one-line joker. Rik Mayall Presents (ITV, 9pm) gives Mayall his own showcase for three weeks, an hour of 'comedy-drama' which tonight features a TV show and presenter facing problems. But two documentaries look promising. Under The Sun (BBC2, 9.30pm) examines a Cambodian ballet teacher's efforts to resurrect her Phnom Penh school . And Death of a Wagon Train (Channel 4, 9.35pm) digs into the misery of an 1846 US wagon train.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Easier access to Japan urged for foreign groups A GROUP of visiting British executives yesterday called on the Japanese government to ensure that foreign companies have the same access in the country as Japanese companies have in the UK market. The six-company group - headed by the Duke of Kent and Mr Michael Perry, the chairman of Unilever, and including executives from Glaxo Holdings and SG Warburg &amp; Co - presented a list of proposals to Japanese industry representatives and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti). In an 'Agenda for Action by Japanese Business', the executives expressed confidence that British companies will expand Japanese market share 'unless that market is distorted for political reasons or because of excessive bias towards Japanese domestic suppliers.' However, Mr Perry said the delegation, in Tokyo as part of the Priority Japan campaign, does not regard Japan as a 'problem' but as an 'opportunity'. He added that UK industry does not 'want to argue about the rules of the game'. UK exports to Japan fell from Pounds 2.63bn in 1990 to Pounds 2.26bn last year.</p>

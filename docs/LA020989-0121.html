			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAST CALL TO DEFEAT DOS PUEBLOS WRESTLERS?  </P> <P> The Santa Barbara school system might accomplish what Channel League wrestling  teams have been trying to do to Dos Pueblos High for more than a decade: Pin it  with a loss.  </P> <P> Dos Pueblos, the league's smallest school with about 1,200 students, extended  its league dual-meet winning streak to 75 matches by completing another  undefeated season. The Chargers have won 13 consecutive league titles, 12  outright, under Coach Mike Hart.  </P> <P> Yet while the school has overcome its low enrollment admirably in competition,  the lack of students may force Dos Pueblos to close next year and send its  students to San Marcos High.  </P> <P> The Chargers, indeed, could have the mat pulled out from under them. The league  tournament Saturday at Santa Barbara High could be the last time the Chargers  roll out that not-so-welcome mat and take down the rest of the league.  </P> <P> Of course, Rio Mesa and Ventura -- the strongest of the Channel League  challengers -- are vying for a reversal of recent fortunes. Both believe they  can give Dos Pueblos a going-away pin.  </P> <P> All wrestling leagues in the Southern Section cap two months of dual meets with  league tournaments, during which all teams gather under one roof for a dual  purpose. Individuals qualify for the Southern Section meet based on their  finish in the league tournament and the league team title is at stake because  dual-meet and league-tournament standings count equally.  </P> <P> In the Channel League that means a chance -- perhaps the last chance -- to  defeat Dos Pueblos, the team that has had all the right moves for a long time.  </P> <P> "It's gonna be competitive," Rio Mesa Coach Todd Stoke said of the league  tournament. "Going in, I'd have to say Dos Pueblos is the favorite. But we've  got a shot and Ventura has a shot."  </P> <P> Dos Pueblos has a 7-0 league record, Rio Mesa (6-1) is second and Ventura (5-2)  is third. Dos Pueblos is ranked fourth in the 3-A Division and Rio Mesa is  fifth.  </P> <P> Ventura, however, came within a point in the last weight class of tying Dos  Pueblos in a dual meet. Rio Mesa lost to Dos Pueblos, 34-25, but defeated  Ventura, 35-27. Those scores are not altogether predictive of success in the  league tournament, however.  </P> <P> "In the league meet there are more variables than in a dual meet," Stoke said.  "The contrasting styles of wrestlers comes into play. And some guys wrestle at  a lower weight in the league meet than they did during the season."  </P> <P> Said Ventura Coach Paul Clementi: "D.P. has dominated so much in the past, but  this year will be more balanced. We need help from other schools. At this point  in the year -- it's been a long season -- a lot depends on how hungry your  wrestlers are."  </P> <P> Certain weight classes -- the ones that were most competitive in dual meets --  will be key in the league tournament. Success at the 145 and 177 weights are  crucial to Rio Mesa's upset hopes.  </P> <P> Wyatt Anderson of Rio Mesa and Steve Dick of Dos Pueblos split two close  matches this season at 145 pounds. And every league wrestler at 177 has been  defeated.  </P> <P> "For us to win league, Anderson has to win at 145," Stoke said. "And first  through fifth place is up for grabs at 177."  </P> <P> Dos Pueblos' top wrestlers are Tyler Stetler (heavyweight) and David Ellis  (154). Stetler is unbeaten but only defeated Ventura's David Mitchell by a  point. Ellis, a senior, is the defending league champion and was runner-up in  the 3-A last season. Brian Gunsolley (165) is unbeaten in dual meets.  </P> <P> Rio Mesa's standout is 132-pound senior Robby Cook, who is undefeated in league  meets and 35-1 overall. Cook is a four-year letterman, returning league  champion and was named the league's outstanding wrestler in the lower weight  divisions last year.  </P> <P> Tony Flores (191) is another four-year letterman for the Spartans and he has  improved each year, finishing fourth in league as a freshman, third as a  sophomore and second as a junior. Flores is unbeaten in league matches this  year.  </P> <P> D.J. McCown (126), Ventura's best wrestler, had the flu and missed the Cougars'  close dual-meet loss to Dos Pueblos. McCown is unbeaten in league matches.  Ventura sophomore David Atherton (98) is also unbeaten in league meets. Junior  Brian Adams (177) pinned his opponents from Dos Pueblos and Buena.  </P> <P> Other top wrestlers in the league tournament include Oxnard's Noel Juarez, who  may drop from 112 to 105 pounds for the tournament, and Hueneme's Delphino  Ochoa (119), a two-time league champion.  </P> <P> Juarez is unbeaten in league meets and has only one loss overall. Ochoa is  trying to become only the eighth wrestler to become a three-time Channel League  champion.  </P> <P> And as for beating Dos Pueblos? "It's not going to take a miracle," Stoke said,  "just an excellent performance."  </P> <P> MARMONTE LEAGUE  </P> <P> Balance has characterized the Marmonte in dual meets. Westlake, Simi Valley,  Camarillo, Channel Islands and Newbury Park field representative teams. Only  Royal and Thousand Oaks have consistently struggled.  </P> <P> "Westlake has the best chance," Newbury Park Coach Marty Maciel said. "They  have a real good tournament team."  </P> <P> Billy Hunter (175) and Neil Mason (145) are the Warriors' top wrestlers, but  Darrell Valance (165), Farzin Daneshnia (112), Brad Miya (119), Shawn Valance  (138) and Dave Schumm (191) also could take league titles.  </P> <P> Channel Islands boasts the best group of lightweight wrestlers. T.R. Merickel  (98) is favored -- unless teammate Valo Barajas drops from 105 to challenge  him. At 112, Chris Corpuz of Channel Islands may drop from 119 and challenge  Westlake's Daneshnia. Channel Islands also has favorites in M.T. Merickel (132)  and Chris Whitmore (191).  </P> <P> Newbury Park boasts excellent wrestlers in Chris Kilbane (154) and Kevin Mabry  (105). Kilbane was the league and 4-A champion at 145 pounds last year and is  34-0 this season. Mabry was third in the 4-A last season. Panther heavyweight  Jeff Jay, a junior, is also a defending league champion.  </P> <P> Although Bryon Ha (138) is Simi Valley's only favorite, the Pioneers have  several wrestlers capable of pulling off upsets, including Robin Song (105),  William Cardinos (126) and Charlie Verhoven (154).  </P> <P> Jim James (119) and Zak Achen (165) are among Camarillo's top wrestlers. Sean  Toner of Thousand Oaks could top Darrell Valance or Achen at 165.  </P> <P> "When coaches are talking to their teams this time of year," Maciel said,  "there is still one motivating factor. They tell the kids they have the league  tournament to shoot for."  </P> <P> FRONTIER LEAGUE  </P> <P> Fillmore, under second-year Coach Bobby Calderon, has rebounded from a winless  league season last year to a first-place finish in the dual-meet standings.  Moorpark and Santa Paula are also strong. Agoura, Santa Ynez and Calabasas  round out the league.  </P> <P> "The teams are closely matched for the league tournament," Calderon said.  </P> <P> Calderon, an undefeated state champion at 115 pounds for Oxnard High in 1964,  has put together a solid program. Fillmore took up wrestling only two years  ago.  </P> <P> Fillmore's Jaime Valdez (Heavyweight) and Moorpark's Gau Diaz (105) are the  league's top wrestlers. Valdez is 17-1 overall and Diaz was 1-A champion at 98  pounds two years ago.  </P> <P> Also favored in the league tournament are Fillmore's Jeremy Hernandez (112),  Moorpark's Paul Gutierrez (126) and three middleweight Santa Paula wrestlers --  Jerry Hernandez (145), Chris Mendez (154) and James Ary (165).  </P></p>

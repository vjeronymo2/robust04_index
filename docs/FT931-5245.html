			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Property: Serious planning makes dreams come true . . . - Homes are available in France to suit all pockets OWNING A home in France is a dream for many Britons. Now, with the advent of the European free market, and with the Channel Tunnel set to open by the end of the year, it is easier than ever to make the dream come true - even with the pound trading at around FFr8. There are many suitable properties for sale in France at prices perhaps 25 per cent below their British equivalents. They are in every size and state of repair, from ruined byre to immaculate chateau. But do not let dreams blind you to reality. If you are set on a French farmhouse or manoir you must know why you want to go, how you intend to make a living and how ready you are to adapt. Do you really love French life and culture? You may meet your Waterloo if you are not clear about fundamentals. Houses in France soared in popularity in the UK in the property boom of the 1980s. When UK prices were sky-high French homes offered both value  - they often cost less than half the sum of anything comparable in Britain - and a better quality of life, says Sarah Francis, of French property consultants Sifex (071-384-1200). You should decide why you are going long before you talk to a property consultant, who will usually represent several agents in different parts of France. Are you going to make a new main home? If so, you will be liable for French income tax after six months, even though the UK Inland Revenue will still treat you as resident and ordinarily resident in the UK. However, you may be able to obtain double taxation relief. If you are planning a holiday home what do you intend to do there? Ride, ski, garden, laze around, write, cook, make wine - or spend all your time doing the place up? How much help can you afford? How far are you from an airport, railway station, ferry or the Channel Tunnel? What society - French or expatriate - do you need around you - or are you a loner? A driving holiday in France, letting these queries roll through the subconscious in the intervals between degustation and sightseeing, is a good start. If deciding is hard, do not feel pressured. There are plenty of houses for sale in France, so there is no hurry to buy. Eventually, you are bound to find something you like and can afford, from FFr100,000 (Pounds 12,550) to millions of francs. In Paris, Philip Hawkes (42 68 11 11), a leading agent in chateaux, Paris apartments and hotels particuliers, is offering an exceptional first floor apartment in the Hotel Mansart de Sagonne, at 28 Rue des Tournelles in the Marais, very close to the Place des Vosges. Louis XIV's architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart, Comte de Sagonne (who gave his name to the mansard roof) built the house for himself in the 1680s, and little has happened to it since. It is a glory of polished floors, painted panelling and mirrors that reach to an extraordinary group of ceilings painted by Le Brun, Mignard, Coypel and other court artists. This exquisite piece of old Paris has a guide price of FFr19m (Pounds 2.38m) and is a Classe Monument Historique (or Listed Grade I). That entitles the owner to more help than the cumbersome VAT relief rules for listed buildings in the UK, Hawkes explained. The Paris flat qualifies for grants for work of up to 75 per cent; the remainder is deductible from income tax. If the house is open to the public, all expenses are deductible. If there is an entry fee, then it is a business, which allows one to carry losses forward. Some 120 km south of Paris Hawkes has the spectacular octagonal Chateau de la Motte, complete with moat, swimming pool, tennis court and 66 acres, for FFr25m. Cheaper, at FFr6.5m, is an attractive chateau in the Yonne, south east of Paris, which has been in the same family for 23 generations - and yes, it does need modernising - with handsome outbuildings, park, tenanted farm, 340 acres and shooting. Cheaper still at FFr1.5m is a romantic small chateau in the Lot owned by Roderick Galloway, Hawkes's correspondent in the south west. Near Vichy he has a 15th century manor that looks like the French country idyll, with 62 acres, for FFr2.8m. In Normandy's Pays d'Auge (Calvados country) another manor in the same half-timbered vernacular as its cousins across the Channel is on sale for FFr2.7m. At the top of Hawkes' list is the palatial 17th Chateau de Menou, halfway between Sancerre (wine) and Vezelay (architecture and food) 210 km south of Paris. Jacques Garcia, owner of the flat in the Hotel Mansart, has decorated this house sumptuously. With a guide price of FFr38m, it is a place for the seriously rich to take themselves back three centuries. In Normandy, GAK Williamson (0962-734999) has an interesting range of houses with many below FFr1m, including a farmhouse with plenty of outbuildings on the edge of Domfront for FFr700,000. For FFr2m there is a charming 17th century watermill and cider orchard in the Suisse Normande, an hour from Caen, and another for the same price in the southern Charente, which would make an attractive hotel or restaurant - or a fine family house. And at FFr8m it offers the early 17th century Chateau Malitourne between Le Mans and Tours. Provence has always been popular and has houses to suit all purses. New at the top end of the market is the grand 18th century Domaine de la Bastide Vieille, at Besse sur Issole, with 120 acres of rolling countryside, 28 of them vineyards producing 65,000 to 80,000 bottles of AC Cotes de Provence red and rose a year. It looks like a dream house, especially the the dining room, where you eat surrounded by trompe l'oeil. Dreams may be easier to realise if you buy a house to restore. Williamson has several in Provence at FFr500,000 or less and Coeur de la France (071-254-4570) has some in the Cher and the Allier in the centre for around half that, including working farms. Sifex offers some attractive medium-size properties, such as a maison de maitre in the Gers with 7.5 acres for FFr1.8m, and one in Tarn et Garonne at 1.65m, including a six-acre vineyard. In Lot et Garonne it lists an authentic 12th-14th century chateau with three towers and new roof, described as 'habitable in parts.' The chateau with 131 acres costs FFr2.8m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) For a species that does not breed in the country of export, certification by the Scientific Authority of that country that the species occurs in the country of export only during the nonbreeding season;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) For a species that breeds in the country of export, scientific assessment (with documentation) of the nesting ecology of the species. Such an assessment may include the availability of active nest sites and the number of females or pairs that successfully produce young per year in each area or region of take; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) For a species that breeds in the country of export, estimation (with documentation) of recent reproductive rates (number of young produced per egg-laying female or pair per year) or mortality rates; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Estimation (with documentation) of annual mortality or loss, including natural mortality and take for subsistence use, export trade, and domestic trade in each area of take.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Determination of biologically sustainable use:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Estimation of the number exported from the country during the past 2 years, and the number of birds removed from the wild for export, domestic trade, illegal trade, subsistence use, and other purposes (specify) for the country of export during the past 2 years;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The estimated number of birds that will be removed from the wild from each area of take each year for all purposes (export trade, domestic trade, illegal trade, and subsistence use), including a description of age-classes (nestlings, fledglings, sub-adults, adults, all classes), when applicable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For the projected take addressed in the management plan, a description of the removal process, including, but not limited to, locations, time of year, capture methods, means of transport, and pre-export conditioning;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Documentation of how each level of take was determined;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Explanation of infrastructure and law enforcement and monitoring mechanisms that ensure compliance with the methodology in the management plan and that the species will be removed at a level that ensures sustainable use; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Description of future plans to monitor the species in each area or region of take and to determine whether the number of birds taken has been sustainable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) A description of incentives for conservation, including a description of how the sustainable use management plan promotes the value of the species and its habitats by means of environmental education, cooperative efforts or projects, development of cooperative management units, and/or activities involving local communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Additional factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Description of any captive-propagation programs (private and governmental) for the species carried out in the country of export;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Description of any existing enhancement activities developed for the species, including, but not limited to, annual banding programs, nest watching/guarding, and nest improvement; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Description, including photographs or diagrams, of the shipping methods and enclosures proposed to be used to transport the exotic birds, including but not limited to feeding and care during transport, densities of birds in shipping enclosures, and estimated consignment sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Approval criteria. Upon receiving a sustainable use management plan in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will decide whether or not an exotic bird species should be listed as an approved species for importation from the country of export, under &sect;15.33. In making this decision, the Director shall consider in addition to the general criteria in part 13 of this subchapter, all of the following factors for the species:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Whether the country of export is effectively implementing the Convention, particularly with respect to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) establishment of a functioning Scientific Authority;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) the requirements of Article IV of the Convention;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) remedial measures recommended by the Parties to the Convention with respect to the species, including recommendations of permanent committees of the Convention; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Article VIII of the Convention, including but not limited to establishment of legislation and infrastructure necessary to enforce the Convention, and submission of annual reports to the Convention's Secretariat;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Whether the country of export has developed a scientifically based management plan for the species that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) provides for the conservation of the species and its habitat(s);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) includes incentives for conservation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) is adequately implemented and enforced;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) ensures that the use of the species is:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) sustainable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) maintained throughout its range at a level that is consistent with the species' role in its ecosystem; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) is well above the level at which the species might become threatened;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) addresses illegal trade, domestic trade, subsistence use, disease, and habitat loss; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) ensures that the methods of capture, transport, and maintenance of the species minimize the risk of injury, damage to health, or inhumane treatment; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the species has a multi-national distribution:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Whether populations of the species in other countries in which it occurs will not be detrimentally affected by exports of the species from the country requesting approval;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Whether factors affecting conservation of the species, including export from other countries, illegal trade, domestic use, or subsistence use are regulated throughout the range of the species so that recruitment and/or breeding stocks of the species will not be detrimentally affected by the proposed export;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEACE PROSPECTS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ARABS  </P> <P> Buckley's column is representative of a racist, might-over-morality ideology  that is becoming obsolete in the wake of the dramatic collapse of oppressive  regimes in Eastern Europe and the impending demise of apartheid in South  Africa.  </P> <P> Buckley writes that a perpetuation of Israel's subjugation of Palestinians by  annexing the occupied territories would lead to "the kind of strategic  composure that comes from the knowledge that that is the way things are, and we  had all better get used to it."  </P> <P> Before proposing such a ridiculous scheme, Buckley should consider how other  peoples have "gotten used" to repression. If there is anything we have learned  from recent events in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, it is that no government  can impose its iron will on an entire population indefinitely, and Israel is no  exception.  </P> <P> JAMIL RASHID  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Arts: La Gran Scena pays tribute In case anyone still does not know who they are, La Gran Scena is a group of American males whose speciality is presenting opera snippets in drag. Such a bald description fails to do justice to the affection that has gone into their portrayals of composite prime donne: a bouffant hairstyle here, a shy protestation of unworthiness there. Detailed knowledge, too - the cooing pianissimo whitening into the curlew mew of Madame X, the gallantly heaved-out top register of Dame Y. The effect is less brash, even less outrageously camp, than might be expected. These men obviously love their opera. It's no surprise that their fans include Leontyne Price and Joan Sutherland. Above all, they love their dive. The pervasive image is that of the 1960s, when Sutherland, Tebaldi and Bumbry were at their imperious height, high-piled coiffeurs as much part of the uniform as the codified hierarchic display of a mandarin's robes. But Ira Siff, the company's founder and chief writer, has kept up with the times. One of the highlights of the new programme is a tribute to such exponents of the new post-modern deconstructionist school of opera production as 'Peter Sellout' (no prizes for guessing who): the last act trio from Der Rosenkavalier set in a New Jersey shopping mall, replete with surtitles for those who loathe them, sung by Marsh-Lynn (a sleek matron returning from a barmitzvah), Octavian (jiggling to his walkman in his 'I Love Older Women' T-shirt: Philip Koch, impeccably in character as a woman playing a man) and a blonde hop-head Sophie. The programme's humour veers from pantomime-dame clumping via hoary Coarse Acting jokes to the wickedly observant. Keith Jurosko's 105-year-old prima donna quavering through Home Sweet Home evokes those crackly old dinner-plate 78s and is oddly touching. Johnny Maldonado's mezzo is unnervingly convincing, though it is not true that Covent Garden has cast him as Amneris in their forthcoming Aida. The company also includes Mirella Frenzi, the tenor Mario Costa-Plenti and such distinguished understudies as Anna Turnover-Somehow, Batleen Cattle and Mo Guiseppe Monopoli. And Ira Siff, the company's only begetter, triumphs in the last act of La Traviata, which sums up the show's ambiguities under its layers of artifice on artificiality: part parody, part homage, part shadow of mortality falling across brittle, painted things. Bloomsbury Theatre until April 13.</p>

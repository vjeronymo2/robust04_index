			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The Central Union of  Agricultural Cooperatives registered its opposition Wednesday [6  April] to an accord to be signed by Japan that will bring the  seven-year-long Uruguay Round of world trade talks to a  conclusion, officials of the union said. They said Hakaru  Toyoda, president of the union, met with Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura and Eijiro Hata, minister of the agriculture,  forestry and fisheries.    The union said it opposes the accord because it will lead to  liberalization of Japan's markets for farm produce, the  officials said. Toyoda urged the government to, instead,  implement policies that will create a stable working environment  for farmers and adopt farm trade laws that secure the survival  of Japan's agricultural industry.    The Uruguay Round accord, which comprises a broad range of  trading rules agreed on at talks sponsored by the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will be signed in Marrakech,  Morocco at a ministerial meeting to be held April 12-15.</p>

This is the first contract for foreign cooperation in  petroleum exploration and development in the Tarim Basin, and  the first contract reached through open bidding for petroleum  cooperation on the China mainland.    Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum and  Natural Gas Corporation, said the signing of the Tarim petroleum  contract by China, the U.S. and Japan not only represents the  new era for the input of foreign funds and technology into the  exploration and development of petroleum in Tarim, but it also  signals the arrival of a new era for the Chinese petroleum  industry and of fully opening up to the outside world.    State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, and Tomur Dawamat,  Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing  Committee, attended the signing ceremony. Before the ceremony,  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and Vice Chairman Tomur Dawamat met with  the three representatives who signed the contract.    The area of the southwestern Tarim Basin scheduled for  foreign cooperative development is located within the boundary  of Qiemo County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and  covers an area of 14,475.4 square kilometers. This February,  with the approval of the State Council, the southwestern part of  the Tarim Basin was designated a new area for expanding foreign  cooperation in petroleum development on the China mainland.  Public bidding began on 1 March, and 68 corporations from 17  countries responded with bids, some of whom made on-site  inspections of the subject area. By the end of October, the  various bidding organizations had delivered their bids and  planning documents to the China National Petroleum and Natural  Gas Corporation. After careful consideration the U.S.  corporation was the first organization invited for contract  negotiations, and an agreement was reached after numerous  discussions.    It is understood that the form of the contract signed on 20  December is consistent with the terms used in all Chinese  offshore and mainland cooperative endeavors. During the  eight-year prospecting period, the foreign parties will bear all  prospecting expenses and risks, and when oil and gas fields are  found, both parties will jointly fund development and  production, and will divide the crude oil produced in accordance  with the stipulations of the contract. China will observe the  international market price structure, and use U.S. dollars to  buy the oil apportioned to the foreign participants that is  taken from the Tarim area. This will dispel any misgivings the  foreign interests may have about shipping crude oil out of that  area.</p>

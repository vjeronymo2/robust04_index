			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Trend is reversed in sharp share surge - FT Election Share Index THE politically sensitive shares in the FT Election Share index reversed the trend of the campaign yesterday. Shares that might benefit from the Conservative victory leapt by more than 10 points, three times as far as those which might have benefited had Labour won. 'Conservative gainers' rose twice as fast as the FT-SE index, to finish 1 point higher than the level at which they closed on the day the election was called, March 11. 'Labour gainers', which had outperformed their Conservative rivals throughout most of the campaign, finished a hair's-breadth behind. Among the Conservative portion of the index, Thames Water (up 21 per cent), Forte (up 14 per cent) and SG Warburg (up 13 1/2 per cent) did best yesterday. All three might have suffered from policies in Labour's manifesto. On a day when almost the whole market rose, the only member of the election index to lose ground was Zetters, the pools company, which dropped by just under 1 per cent. The Conservative manifesto promises a national lottery, which might harm the pools promoter.</p>

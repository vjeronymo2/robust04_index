			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon in Australian purchase Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, is to acquire Australia's largest independent risk management company, Richard Oliver International. The UK group could ultimately pay Pounds 17m to acquire full control of Richard Oliver, which it will merge with its local broking subsidiary, Willis Corroon Holdings. Willis will initially acquire 40 per cent of ROI's issued share capital for ADollars 4.5m in cash. Willis may purchase the remaining 60 per cent of the risk management group under put and call options subject to the approval of the Australian statutory authorities. The consideration for this second part of the deal will be calculated on an earnings-related formula subject to a maximum of ADollars 35m (Pounds 17m) and a minimum of ADollars 10m (Pounds 4.85m), both figures inclusive of the initial payment of ADollars 4.5m, with the consideration to be paid in either cash or shares.</p>

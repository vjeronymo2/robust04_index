			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: THEY'LL SOON MAKE MARRIAGE THE STATE OF THEIR UNION  </P> <P> In sickness and in health, until Election Day do they part, should read the  wedding vows of Maine Rep. Olympia J. Snowe and Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., who  credit politics with cementing their decade-long courtship. The two Republicans  will marry Friday at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Lewiston  and will then divide their time between Washington and the executive mansion in  Augusta. "What holds our relationship together is the fact that we love  politics," said Snowe, now in her sixth term in Congress. "For some, that  becomes a dividing factor, but in our case that obviously hasn't been the  situation." Says McKernan, a former two-term congressman who was elected  governor in 1986: "We understand the pressures that are on each other." The  romance blossomed while the two were in Washington, serving as Maine's  delegation in the House. Their private joke on their trips home: "Your district  or mine?" Their honeymoon will be a weekend in New York, as McKernan must be in  Washington next week for a meeting of the nation's governors.  </P> <P>  -- His culinary tastes are suspicious (he prefers green eggs) and his villain  (the Grinch) is as nasty a character as you'd ever hope to meet in a Brothers  Grimm tale. But one can't dispute the influence of the ubiquitous Dr. Seuss on  children worldwide, says Ruth K. MacDonald, who has become an expert on the  literature of Theodor Seuss Geisel. While her colleagues painstakingly pick  apart Shakespeare and Chaucer, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway,  MacDonald, head of the English and philosophy department at Purdue  University-Calumet in Indiana, pores over "The Cat in the Hat" and "Horton  Hears a Who." MacDonald lauds the playfulness of Geisel's language, and notes  that his books' themes let children be children. "He has loud and rowdy  stories. You don't get rewarded for being good but for being outrageous," she  says.  </P> <P>  -- Speaking of storybook endings, Popeye, the pugilist who first weighed  anchor as a minor character in a now-forgotten comic strip, is still going  strong at 60. Popeye, who appears in 250 newspapers worldwide and speaks 25  languages, first appeared in 1929 in the "Thimble Theater" comic strip --  featuring Olive Oyl and her family -- when two of the characters were going on  a boat trip and needed a sailor, said Carl Langrock of King Features, which  syndicates the comic strip. "He was written in and out several times during  1929," Langrock said. "But people responded so strongly to his character,  because Popeye is really Everyman fighting back against bullies and tyranny."  ANN CONNORS  </P></p>

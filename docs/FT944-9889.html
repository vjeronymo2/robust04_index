			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Bhutto arrests father of opposition leader Ms Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani prime minister, yesterday ordered the arrest of the 75-year-old father of opposition leader Mr Nawaz Sharif, on allegations of tax evasion. The detention of Mr Mohammed Sharif is the latest development in the bitter battle between Ms Bhutto and Mr Nawaz Sharif which has overshadowed politics for five years. The move came on the eve of a joint session of parliament, the first since she took power last year, at which President Farooq Leghari is to make a key speech. Mr Nawaz Sharif's supporters last night promised to engulf the meeting with protests. The Federation of Pakistani Chambers of Commerce and Industry warned of 'a severe reaction' from businessmen unless his father was released. Mr Mohammed Sharif was arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency, which alleged tax evasion of income of about Rs100m (Pounds 2m). The agency also charged, but did not arrest, Mr Nawaz Sharif's two brothers, Mr Abbas Sharif and Mr Shahbaz Sharif, and his son, Mr Hussain Nawaz Sharif. Mr Mohammed Sharif, a self-made industrialist, is regarded as the architect of Mr Nawaz Sharif's rise to power. His arrest follows a sustained attack on the family business empire by the Bhutto government, which has ordered tax and fraud investigations by the Federal Anti-Corruption Committee and the Federal Investigation Agency. Mr Nawaz Sharif yesterday denied the tax fraud charges: 'The regime is totally rattled and in panic on the eve of the joint session of parliament.' The arrests come amid factional violence in Karachi, the commercial capital, where about 20 people have died since last Thursday, and an armed uprising by tribesmen in the north. The government at the weekend also suffered a serious foreign policy defeat when it failed to secure the support of other Islamic states for a motion on the troubled region of Kashmir at the United Nations General Assembly. The State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank, at the weekend cut the maximum bank lending rate from 19 per cent to 17.5 per cent, to promote investment and economic growth.</p>

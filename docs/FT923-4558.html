			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Western Sarahans join in vote Residents of the disputed Western Sahara were among 11m voters eligible to participate yesterday in a referendum called by King Hassan II to institute limited constitutional reforms, AP reports from Rabat. The inclusion of Western Saharans was meant to consolidate Morocco's 1975 annexation of the former Spanish colony. King Hassan claims the territory was part of Morocco for centuries before Spain and France colonized north-west Africa. The reforms, widely expected to win approval, would retain the powerful monarchy but strengthen some of parliament's powers.</p>

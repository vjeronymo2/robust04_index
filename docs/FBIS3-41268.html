He  said the task force is in line with the promise to fight the  menace of hard drugs contained in the head of state's maiden  broadcast. State House correspondent Mohammed Labo reports:    [Begin recording] [Labo] Inaugurating the task force, Lt.  Gen. Diya said that it is ironical that the government agency,  created to fight drug abuse and trafficking in narcotics, has  become prone to corrupt tendencies. He described the recent  disappearance of some wraps [individual packages] of heroin  seized last year from a suspected hard drug trafficker as a  manifestation of the level of corruption and collusion that  emasculates Nigeria's anti-narcotic efforts. The terms of  reference given the panel include: Eradication of all problems  associated with hard drugs in the country, enforcement of  security checks at all ports and international routes with  immediate effect, working in close liaison with the Armed  Forces, police, and particularly the Ministry of Justice to  ensure immediate arrest of culprits through investigations and  prompt prosecution in the courts. The chief of general staff  has the other terms of reference:    [Diya] [video in progress shows chief of general staff  seated, reading out terms of reference to the task force]  ...render monthly reports to the head of state and  commander-in-chief, through the office of the chief of general  staff on all activities of the task force.    G. [As heard] Examine the capability and integrity of the  personnel of the NDLEA [National Drug Law Enforcement Agency] as  at presently constituted in carrying out its functions under the  enabling law.    H. Examine the general structure of the NDLEA and determine  its suitability for carrying out its functions under the  enabling law.    [Labo] Members of the task force are Brigadier General Musa  Bamayi, chairman; Group Captain William Pratt; Lieutenant  Colonel Taicos; Commander Odigie; assistant commissioner of  police Giade; and Mr. Adabale. The chairman of the task force,  Brig. Gen. Bamayi, promised that the task force would try to  accomplish its mission successfully. [end recording]</p>

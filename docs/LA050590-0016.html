			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AHH-H-H, THE SUN IS BACK  </P> <P> The waves have been hiding their foaming faces from me since fall slid into  winter. I'm sure the sand stayed where I left it in September, with its traces  of shell, seaweed and bottle caps.  </P> <P> But what of the multi-colored blankets, covered with human beings fleshy and  hard, listening to radios, dogs, kids -- playing, barking, running?  </P> <P> While I sat shivering, wrapped in a down-filled comforter and watching  football, ghostly Field of Dreamers played pepper and rundown to an empty  stadium, empty seats across town. No one tossed bags of salted peanuts. Ask  Shakespeare; winter is the season for ghosts.  </P> <P> The rains fell, but not too frequently. It was cold, very frequently.  </P> <P> The summer girls were there, of course, albeit stuffed into form-resistant  coats and mufflers. You knew they wanted to burst out of their cocoons, to  float their flora and forms, but couldn't. It was too damn cold.  </P> <P> To someone from the East, Los Angeles is a year-round mecca of warmth, but the  native Angeleno knows the difference. The novelty of winter wears off and the  sensible among us long for shorts, T-shirts and Gatorade.  </P> <P> Then it arrives. Quietly. It may be the kiss of a warm breeze or the pollen  that makes us sneeze. I push ahead my clock and the grasses grow faster. The  idled lawnmowers growl again.  </P> <P> Off come the cocoons. The butterflies look beautiful. Real baseballs get tossed  around the infield; bags of salt-roasted peanuts arc in the bleachers, into my  hand. On go the swimsuits. The waves are just as I left them, spiked with  boogie boards. Children and lovers dig toes in the sand.  </P> <P> Summer is here at last. Ain't life glorious!  </P></p>

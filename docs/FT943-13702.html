			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Haute couture comes back into fashion It might be seen as a poignant symbol of the prospects for haute couture, the most exclusive - and expensive - form of Paris fashion, that this week's couture collections opened last night with a show by Gianni Versace, a designer who is not French but Italian. An interloping Italian, however, is only one of the problems confronting the French couture houses, which have been fighting for survival in the early 1990s in the face of economic recession and the anachronistic structure of the haute couture system. The market had been in decline since the 1960s until a brief renaissance in the mid-1980s, with turnover peaking at FFr320m (Dollars 60m) in 1988 and 1989, according to the Chambre Syndicale. But the decline then resumed, with sales falling to around FFr290m in each of 1991, 1992 and 1993. Haute couture, once the most creative area of French fashion, had deteriorated into a source of publicity for the scents and sunglasses from which the fashion houses make most of their money. Yet couture now seems to be staging a revival after years of decline. 'There's definitely been an improvement,' says Christian Lacroix, one of France's most famous couturiers. 'Our spring collection sold very well at the January shows. The increase in sales hasn't been enormous, but business is better.' Mr Lacroix is not alone in having noted such an improvement. Denise Dubois, an official at the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, the industry body, reckons that most of the couture houses reported increased sales after this spring's collections. Some of the avant garde designers who show in Paris - John Galliano, Vivienne Westwood and Koji Tatsuno - have introduced their own versions of couture outside the Chambre Syndicale system. Meanwhile the official couturiers are attracting new customers again.</p>

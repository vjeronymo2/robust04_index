			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE chancellor's dampening of interest rate cut hopes permeated through the Footsie futures sector during yesterday morning, although later trading brought a recovery which limited the final damage, writes Christine Buckley. With fears also circulating over taxation moves on pension funds, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 was quick to fall back after opening at 3,179 - the day's high. Midway through the contract's morning slide there was a fire scare at the London International Financial Futures Exchange. But the evacuation of the trading floor for about half an hour was said to have had little effect on the day's dealing. As traders contended with a background of gloom provided by poor short sterling and gilts markets, the low of the day came just before lunchtime. Selling, said to have been mainly driven by independent traders, pushed the December contract down to 3,151. But a bouncy Wall Street added a little vigour to the afternoon and a convincing rally was mustered. December finished at 3,171, nearly two points ahead of its fair value premium to the cash market. The premium now stands at about 8 points. At 8,934 lots, volume was steady. Traded options were quiet, with index options accounting for a substantial chunk of the action. Total volume was 25,552 contracts, with 9,816 dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.</p>

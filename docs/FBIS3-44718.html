In  the first letter, SEF agreed to ARATS' suggestion on holding the  Chiao- Tang talks on 31 January. SEF said that Vice Chairman  Chiao Jen-ho will leave for Peking [Beijing] on 31 January for a  five-day visit. The agenda includes consultations on related  matters concerning the meeting between SEF and ARATS and on  increasing communications and understanding between the two  organizations. The second letter welcomed ARATS' suggestion on  holding early talks on the 4th follow-up working-level  discussions of the Ku-Wang talks, following the Taipei talks.  SEF stressed, however, that the talks should not involve  political and legal issues.    [SEF Spokesman Shih Chi-ping] Working-level consultations  between the two sides of the Strait should not involve political  issues and be mixed with political views. However, only by  taking into account the reality of different legal systems  between the two sides of the Strait; only then, can we work out  a realistic and effective arrangement to solve problems.    [Yang] Shih Chi-ping stressed the agenda of the Chiao-Tang  talks will include the SEF and ARATS meeting and related  matters, and further discussion of the differences which cropped  up during the past three working-level consultations, so as to  make arrangements for the 4th working-level talks. The second  Ku-Wang talks, however, will be not included in the agenda.</p>

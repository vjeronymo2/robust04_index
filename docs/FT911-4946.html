			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Letter: Priorities and the Abta president Sir, Having read the article by Clay Harris about the Association of British Travel Agents (April 13), I would say that it appears that Mr John Dunscombe, the association's president, has his priority wrong. Surely the most important thing ought to be getting back again the holiday-makers stranded thousands of miles away from their homes. In view of my terrible experience I feel qualified to count. Recently, when on an Intasun package holiday in Lanzarote we heard the news of their failure. We were not unduly perturbed at the time as it was assumed that Abta would be taking care of our welfare. With about a week still to run of the holiday we were abandoned by the Intasun representative. All Intasun literature was removed from the apartments, and we were left to fend for ourselves. In the absence of information, rumours were rife: Abta had gone bankrupt; they had withdrawn their bond. Unless we were able to board an airplane by Sunday March 24, we would have to make our own way home. The efforts to fly us back to England were pathetic. When an Abta member company fails, the primary concern of that organisation ought to be the welfare of stranded holidaymakers. It is appreciated that this could be a mammoth task and perhaps beyond the resources of the association. Harold Simon, 30 Pinewoods, Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Banking group chairman accused MR WALLACE Duncan Smith, chairman of Wallace Smith Trust, a small London banking and finance group, was yesterday remanded in custody for a week by Guildhall magistrates on a charge of fraudulent trading. He was arrested by the City of London police on Monday and held in custody before being charged. The police said yesterday that the charge alleged that between January 1 1985 and April 29 1991, in the City of London and elsewhere, Mr Smith was knowingly party to the carrying on of the business of Wallace Smith Trust with intent to defraud its creditors. The charge, under section 458 of the 1985 Companies Act, carries a penalty of a prison sentence, or a fine, or both. The Serious Fraud Office said yesterday that it had taken over the case from the City police. Provisional liquidators were appointed to Wallace Smith Trust yesterday on a petition by the Bank of England. The company has ceased trading and the liquidators are realising the outstanding positions. The provisional liquidators are Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Bill Ratford of KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock. According to its latest annual report, the net assets of the bank are about Pounds 13m. No deposits from the general public are believed to be at risk. Mr Duncan Smith is one of the backers of the Bruges Group, the pressure group opposed to European federalism. Wallace Smith Trust is owned by a trust representing the Smith family, which has extensive financial interests in Canada. It specialised in dealing in the money market, and in corporate finance. Its latest accounts show that it had assets of Pounds 370m, most of which consisted of money market instruments. Its share capital and reserves amounted to Pounds 13.2m. The other directors are Mr Michael Hamilton, joint managing director, and Mr JM Bradley. In the year ended April 30 1990, it made a profit of Pounds 175,000, down from Pounds 1.5m the year before. An associated company, Wallace Smith Trust Group, lost Pounds 1m in the same period.</p>

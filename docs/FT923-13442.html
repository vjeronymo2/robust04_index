			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Management: When relations become strained - An informal approach to hiring and firing staff often leads to trouble / Here is some advice Murder is commonly a family affair, as are numerous other unspeakable crimes that human beings perpetrate against each other. Any small business owner employing other people needs to bear this in mind. The more a business can boast it 'is just like a family' as far as relations between bosses and workers are concerned, the louder the alarm bells probably ought to ring. It could mean that little thought has been given to tedious matters such as contracts of employment, personnel records and disciplinary procedures. The informality is fine when times are good but potentially disastrous when 'family' members fall out, perhaps over redundancies, a dispute over pay, hours or holidays. Problems may be compounded by the employment of actual family members and the absence of professional personnel advice within the company. According to Acas, the conciliation service, the assumption is that because lines of communication are short, problems will resolve themselves. Acas daily sees the casualties of this approach; such a high proportion of cases come from small businesses that the service's enquiry team focuses on this sector. In the London region alone, Acas becomes involved in 10,000 disputes over employment rights each year - nearly 20 per cent of the total for the UK - and deals with 80,000 enquiries. About two-thirds are from employees and the rest are from employers and organisations. Top of the employers' list, making up 26 per cent of complaints and inquiries, are issues relating to redundancies. These are followed by disciplinary and dismissal problems (23 per cent) and other contractual issues (18 per cent). Then follow a host of other issues, including maternity leave, holidays and wages. The first basic error made by many small businesses, which gives rise to these problems, is failing to write things down, says Acas. This starts even before an employee begins work - job descriptions and written details of essential skills, qualifications and experience, will help to clarify exactly what is required from the job and what sort of person will fill it most successfully. As Chris Jones, acting director of Acas in London, says: 'It's easier to knock a square peg into a round hole than knock it out again'. The law requires employers to provide written details of the chief contract terms within 13 weeks of the person starting work (other rules apply to part-timers). These terms should include: employer's name; employee's name; date employment began; job title; amount of pay and interval between payments; hours of work; holiday pay and entitlement; sick pay and pension arrangements; notice periods; grievance and appeal arrangements; and disciplinary rules (where there are 20 or more employees). As well as these 'express' terms, the courts have established that certain 'implied' terms are contained in all employment contracts. These relate to co-operation, good faith and health and safety. Additional statutory rights, which cannot generally be overridden by contracts of employment, relate to sex and race discrimination, equal pay and maternity benefits. Some workers will be covered by wages councils, in which case they will be entitled to minimum pay. Among other statutory rights are those covering sick pay, time off for various (including trade union) activities and union membership. A company's own rules should also be written down to save arguments later (see checklist). But what if these rules are broken and things have gone so badly wrong that the employee needs to be disciplined or sacked? According to Jones, the balance of power has changed over recent years. 'Some companies used to think you couldn't dismiss people at all,' he says. Now employers are more assertive, but the rules still need to be followed carefully if the dreaded industrial tribunal is to be avoided - the time and trouble involved in a tribunal should not be underestimated. A solid week's work, perhaps for the most senior person in the company, could go into form-filling, communications between the parties, and attending the hearings. Average tribunal awards of Pounds 1,500-Pounds 2,000 may end up looking trivial when compared with the other costs involved. In summary, following investigations and informal warnings, a disciplinary procedure will normally have the following four steps, says Acas: Formal oral warning - in the case of a minor offence. Written warning - for subsequent minor offences or a more serious offence. Final written warning - for further misconduct. Dismissal - with appropriate notice . The fact that redundancy issues feature so highly among Acas' inquiries and complaints is partly linked to the recession - some small companies will be contemplating redundancies for the first time. Selection for redundancy is a problematic area, particularly since the practice of 'last in, first out' is in decline. Acas warns against using criteria that are too narrow when it comes to selecting for redundancy, like basing selection solely on how often an employee is absent. Compulsory redundancies may be avoidable altogether  - basic though it may sound, one employer recently in touch with Acas, for example, had not considered asking for volunteers. Salary, bonus and deductions problems, as well as arguments over alterations to contracts of employment, are also more common since the onset of the recession. Pay may be composed of several elements, including, for example, use of a company car outside work. An employee who is being paid off with a lump sum in lieu of notice may argue the car should be kept for the notice period, or may try to pursue additional compensation. Bonuses and commission payments may also be a source of argument if the basis on which they are calculated is not clearly defined. When margins are narrow, the incentive for small businesses to tighten up on timekeeping and cut down on waste will be even greater. However, Acas warns against making unlawful deductions from wages, for example for lateness or till discrepancies. These sorts of deductions should not be made unless the employee's permission has been given in advance. Agreement, preferably in writing, should also be gained before changes are made to contracts of employment. An industrial tribunal may consider it reasonable for an employer to alter a contract without consent, for example to make essential changes in working practices resulting from developments in technology. But Acas warns that proceeding without agreement is a risky strategy for an employer and could end in claims for unfair dismissal and - in the courts - wrongful dismissal. Clearly, negotiating rather than imposing change will be likely, ultimately, to lead to a more co-operative and flexible workforce. Misunderstandings may be caused by not spelling out to someone exactly what they are doing wrong; evading the issue or getting a third party to do the dirty work can create similar confusion. Avoiding a face-to-face discussion about a problem 'is in the British character', says Jones. Simply failing to ask for, or listen to, an employee's side of the story is a common root of subsequent tribunal action. And when the firm that is 'just like a family' has a breakdown in communications between family members, the ensuing feuding, ill-feeling and emotional as well as financial costs may be every bit as high as they would be in a domestic setting.

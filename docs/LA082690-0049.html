			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS AND BRIEFS  </P> <P> Doggone!: There are an estimated 50,000 dogs in the city of Lhasa, Tibet,  including 10,000 strays. To cope with the canines in a land where dogs were  once revered as messengers of Buddha, authorities have built the first dog  hotel.  </P> <P> Breaking the Ice: The Soviet Union's atomic-powered ice breaker Rossiya has  taken scientists and tourists on the first Arctic cruise to the North Pole,  according to the Soviet news agency Tass.  </P> <P> Passengers were taken a short distance by helicopter to Hayes Island in the  Arctic Ocean over a period of several hours, Tass said. The island is the site  of the largest observatory in the far north.  </P> <P> Tourists had the opportunity to view polar bears and visited the bathhouse and  homes on the island, where researchers from Canada and France recently studied  the ozone layer.  </P> <P> A Glass-Bottomed Boat?: Tom McClean recently became the first man to cross the  Atlantic in a "bottle" when he arrived in Falmouth, England, after a harrowing  37-day journey from New York.  </P> <P> McClean made the 2,950-mile voyage in the 37-foot, bottle-shaped Typhoon  Atlantic Challenger with the aim of raising $950,000 for charity. It was his  fifth solo Atlantic crossing.  </P> <P> The Rockets' Red Glare: Providing yet another reason that this is not the time  to be visiting India's Kashmir Valley, Moslem rebels recently fired rockets  into two hotels in Srinagar, including the Broadway, a modern four-star hotel  often frequented by tourists.  </P> <P> No one was hurt in the shellings, but it was the first time rebels had attacked  a hotel housing civilian guests.  </P> <P> The rebels view the establishments as "defense installations," an argument  given credence now that a dozen hotels in the city have been taken over as  barracks for security forces.  </P> <P> Tourism in the Himalayan valley has dropped from 250,000 visitors in the first  seven months of last year to 1,200 people through July this year, officials  said.  </P> <P> Talking Turkey: Conrad Hotels, a subsidiary of Hilton USA, will open a 672-room  luxury hotel, the Hotel Conrad Istanbul, in December, 1991.  </P> <P> The hotel is being built on a six-acre site on Ylidiz Avenue overlooking the  Bosporus.  </P> <P> Licking the Problem: Moscow, which often boasts of having the world's best ice  cream, has a shortage in these waning days of summer.  </P> <P> Ice cream kiosks on street corners and in city parks have been displaying "no  ice cream" signs, although they continue to sell souvenirs, marshmallows,  chocolates and other candies.  </P> <P> Ice cream is still available at foreign outlets, such as the Baskin-Robbins  stores in the Rossia Hotel and on the Arbat pedestrian mall, or the  Soviet-Swiss joint venture Pinguin.  </P> <P> But lines are long and prices are high for Muscovites who have always taken  pride in their own ice cream, which they buy in paper-wrapped slabs or on  sticks, rather than in cones.  </P> <P> Officials said the shortage has been caused by two of the three ice  cream-making factories in Moscow being closed for repairs this summer.  </P> <P> Forwarding Address: The offices of the Consulate General of France and the  French Cultural Services have moved to the Oppenheimer Tower, 10990 Wilshire  Blvd., Suite 300, Los Angeles 90024. The telephone is (213) 479-4426.  </P> <P> Jogging Escort: To allay the fears of New York visitors who would like to run  through Central Park but worry about being mugged, a new hotel in midtown  Manhattan is offering escort runners for hire.  </P> <P> For a fee of $35, Penny Baxter, jogger-in-residence at the Hotel Macklowe, will  escort hotel guests on a run through the park at any hour between dawn and  dusk.  </P> <P> The service, the newest in hotel offerings, comes about a year after a brutal  attack on a young female investment banker running alone in the park.  </P> <P> Baxter, who has a degree in exercise physiology and a corporate fitness  background, said middle-aged businessmen had shown the most interest in the  jogging service so far.  </P> <P> "Since last April, people are more fearful of running in the park," said Debbie  King of the New York Road Runners Club, referring to the 1989 Central Park  jogger attack.  </P> <P> "We are considering doing something similar with hotels throughout the city,"  said King, adding that despite growing fears about the dangers of Central Park,  crime in the 843-acre park has actually dropped 25% from a year ago.  </P> <P> For more information, contact the Hotel Macklowe, 145 West 44th St. (between  Broadway and 6th), New York 10036, (212) 768-4400.  </P></p>

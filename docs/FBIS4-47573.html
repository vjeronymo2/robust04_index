In  June of 1992 employees of the Vitamin and Mineral Substances  Metabolism Laboratory of the Nutrition Institute, RAMN, in  cooperation with public health workers of the Republic of  Bashkortostan had studied vitamin consumption by various groups  of Republic's population, in order to develop practical  recommendations on optimizing the vitamin status of the  population. The objects of studies were 169 industrial workers,  109 blood donors, 111 pregnant women and 40 children, 7 to 16  years old. The study results indicate extremely low consumption  of vitamin C by Bashkortostan population. Consumption of vitamin  A was fairly good. Carotene consumption was unsatisfactory.  Everybody in the study had a normal average level of vitamin A.  Consumption of vitamins B[.sub]1[/], B[.sub]2[/] and  B[.sub]6[/] was extremely unsatisfactory. There was moderate  to deep deficiency of vitamin B[.sub]12[/]. On the whole the  obtained data indicate extremely unsatisfactory consumption of  all studied vitamins with the exception of vitamins A and E. The  article characterizes the vitamin deficiency in the majority of  study participants as polyhypovitaminosis. Only 3.5% of  the  population have sufficient amount of vitamins, while 15%  have  vitamin deficiency in terms of at least one vitamin. Tables 4,  references 10: 4 Russian, 6 Western.</p>

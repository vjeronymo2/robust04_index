			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> .. . PHOENIX HOUSE . . .  </P> <P> I am supporting the proposed Phoenix House/Nancy Reagan Center to be located in  Lake View Terrace on the site of the former Pacoima Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> The long-term residential care offered there will be one of the few resources  available in the San Fernando Valley for the rehabilitation of teens. I believe  the outcry by neighbors should be considered and compromises be made to satisfy  some of their demands. However, their objection to the treatment center should  not be the determining factor for the zoning commission to deny Phoenix House  the permits necessary to operate in Lake View Terrace.  </P> <P> Many young adults die from drug overdoses or commit suicide from depression  brought on by the use of drugs. The Valley needs more treatment facilities for  these young people so they may reclaim their lives.  </P> <P> MELODY SULLIVAN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

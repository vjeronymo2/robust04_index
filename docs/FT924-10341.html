			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: Why Baccarat remains a cut above the rest MANY OF those who have collected and loved glass will know the name of Baccarat. Its wares have been sought after by tsars and princes, kings and counts, ever since it was first created by royal - French, bien sur - decree in 1764. For those who are used to ogling Baccarat's expensive wares in London's finer emporia, and wondering how and why any single glass could cost quite so much, a sumptuous volume entitled simply Baccarat reveals all. Baccarat's history is long and honourable, an industrial adventure that began in the little village of Baccarat in the Vosges Forest in eastern France and took its wares to the finest tables in the world. What this beautifully illustrated volume reveals is the role that innovation, creativity and design play in the development of any great company. Just as Arthur Lasenby Liberty forged creative partnerships with the movers and shakers in the Arts and Crafts Movement, and created pieces that design students still study to this day, so Baccarat commissioned work from designers such as Georges Chevalier, Salvador Dali, Robert Rigot and Thomas Bastide. Besides encouraging design innovation any great company needs to be alert to changes in society, in the way we live and here Baccarat shows itself to be very nimble-footed. As women went out into the workplace and as cosmetics became increasingly important in their daily lives, so it started working with the great beauty companies like Elizabeth Arden, for whom it produced a stunning white opal crystal hand holding a gold and enamelled perfume bottle with a rose-shaped stopper. For Guerlain, besides the famous 1912 Mitsouko bottle with its 'gendarme's cap' stopper it made a butter-fly shaped bottle in gilded cobalt-blue crystal with an emery-finished stopper. For those who associate Baccarat almost exclusively with a sumptuous, highly-decorative style, involving cut lead-crystal or ornate engraving this book makes riveting reading. Some of its designs are indeed sumptuous, way beyond the tastes of any modern home, but others are remarkable for their austere simplicity. A look at some of the ranges produced in the 1930s shows wine and cocktail glasses as timeless, as classically simple as anything that was produced in the post-war years. Indeed, way back in 1855 Baccarat produced a water jug that looks as contemporary as anything our finest glass-blowers are producing today: a simple curving shape in white opaline glass with a single strip of bright blue it is sends out loud and clear the message that fine design whilst ideally of its time always in some way stands above and beyond its own time. The book seems to me an indispensable tome for those who care about truly beautiful glass and its visual historical record of the finest work that Baccarat has done is of interest to all who ever have to consider the every day matter of which glass to buy and why. Baccarat By Jean-Louis Curtis, published by Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 65. An exhibition, Baccarat American Collection &amp; Bestiary, is on until November 7 at Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1. The works do not, to my mind, represent Baccarat at its finest aesthetic hour, but they are of undoubted historical and technical interest. If you have a taste to see what a 300 kilo crystal American Brown Bear sculpture looks like, now is your chance.</p>

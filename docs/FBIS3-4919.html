NODONG SINMUN today says this is only too natural a  condemnation of the traitor Kim Yong-sam's "civilian" fascist  rule.    Though the traitor has advertised "reforms" as if he would  bring some "changes" to South Korea, and made brag of his  administrative "achievements" after his assumption of office,  the reality shows that the "civilian" regime is violating human  rights more harshly than the preceding military dictatorial  regimes, the analyst says, and goes on:    The traitor has refused to abolish the notorious "National  Security Law," a legacy of the military dictatorship, and  expanded and strengthened such repressive tools as the  "security planning board" and the "secret affairs command."    After rising to power, the Kim Yong-sam group began brutally  suppressing the righteous desire of the students and people for  independence, democracy and reunification and mercilessly  cracking down on the struggle of the workers and peasants for  their vital rights, branding it as "collective egoism" and  "illegal riot." It has also put down the struggle of workers for  a wage hike by setting in-motion even the "emergency arbitration  power," which the preceding military dictators had not dared to  employ.    Noting that the South Korean people have keenly felt that  with the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique as sly as fox left in  power, they cannot feel ease even a moment but will undergo  greater misfortunes and sufferings, the analyst says they will  bring him to justice without fail.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> TRUCK DELIVERY HOURS LIMITED TO CURB NOISE  </P> <P> The City Council has approved an amendment to a city ordinance that will  prohibit commercial trucks from making deliveries while the city sleeps.  </P> <P> In a 4-1 vote, the council this week decided to limit the hours of truck  deliveries to 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., with no deliveries allowed on Sundays or  federal holidays.  </P> <P> The action came in response to complaints about noise from neighbors of Cypress  East Shopping Center.  </P> <P> Mayor Margaret M. Arnold voted against the amendment, saying it unfairly  infringes on companies that are not part of the noise problem.  </P> <P> "I think we need to identify what trucks are a nuisance and address those,  instead of limiting companies who may not be a part of the problem," Arnold  said.  </P> <P> The ordinance does not affect trash trucks, which can begin pickups at 6 a.m.  and can do earlier pickups at sites more than 600 feet away from a residential  community, according to Larry Hurst, finance director.  </P> <P> The ordinance will have a second reading at the next council meeting, Oct. 9.  </P></p>

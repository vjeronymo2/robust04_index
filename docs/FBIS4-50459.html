By  the end of 1993 the country's operating telephones reached 26.13  million lines, of which 57 percent are family telephones.    -- New telecommunications services are expanding. By the end  of last year, 1,709 cities had established wireless paging  services, with more than 5.61 million subscribers, becoming the  world's third largest wireless paging network; over 800 cities  have mobile telephone services, with more than 700,000  subscribers.    -- The national public telecommunications network has made  obvious improvement in developing capability for comprehensive  social services. By the end of last year, the capacity of the  national telephone network had reached 42.06 million lines,  while long-distance telephones reached 420,000 lines.    Ni said that by the end of this century, China will have a  modern telecommunications network with large capacity, advanced  technology, and highly efficient, high-quality services to cater  to various social demands.</p>

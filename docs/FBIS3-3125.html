			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Zheng Shouyi, leader  of a democratic party in China, today proposed ways to better  attract and utilize foreign funds and improve the management of  foreign-funded enterprises.    After reviewing achievements in the introduction of foreign  funds in recent years, Zheng Shouyi, vice-chairman of the  Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest  Party), said in a speech that attention should be paid to the  solution of problems in the introduction of foreign funds.    "Governments at all levels should draw up long-term plans  for  the introduction and use of foreign funds in a bid to improve  their macro-management in this regard," he told a meeting of the  current session of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference today.    They should also formulate policies and principles  concerning  the use of foreign funds, in line with specific economic  conditions of their respective regions, he said.    It is also necessary to formulate regulations and policies  to  encourage foreign investors, and examine both annual and  long-term plans for the introduction of foreign funds, he added.    He proposed setting up managerial departments to coordinate  efforts to solve major problems in using such funds.    In the future, it is necessary to attract investments from  multi- national corporations and international consortiums, and  encourage them to invest in energy, transportation and other  infrastructure projects, he said.    They should also be encouraged to undertake major projects  to  upgrade technology in existing large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises, he added.    "At present, the amount of foreign investment in public  health, education and culture is very small. I think we should  make breakthroughs in these areas," he said.    Zheng Shouyi called for efforts to perfect China's legal  system, noting that legislative measures must be compatible with  internationally accepted practices.    Foreign-funded enterprises inside China must be treated as  Chinese legal entities, he said, adding that both Chinese- and  foreign-funded enterprises should be treated equally.    Furthermore, it is imperative to tighten supervision over  tax  payments by foreign-funded companies, accurately evaluate  foreign assets and protect the legitimate rights and interests  of workers in these companies, he said.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUDGE HEARS PLEAS ON SEX IN ART EXHIBIT  </P> <P> Supporters and opponents of an exhibit of the late Robert Mapplethorpe's  sexually graphic photographs rallied today outside a courthouse where a judge  heard pleas to protect the show from censorship.  </P> <P> About 500 supporters marched about 10 blocks through downtown, ending at the  steps of the Hamilton County Courthouse.  </P> <P> They were met by about 100 people protesting tonight's scheduled opening of the  exhibit. Police kept the two sides apart.  </P> <P> The supporters chanted for freedom of expression and carried a banner that  read: "If You Give Artists Freedom of Expression, Soon Every American Will Want  It."  </P> <P> Opponents carried signs that read, "We Want Decency in Cincinnati" and "Calling  Pornography Art Does Not Make It So."  </P> <P> The Contemporary Arts Center asked a Hamilton County municipal judge to prevent  local authorities from filing criminal charges or taking any other action  involving photographs showing sexual or sadomasochistic acts.  </P> <P> More than 3,000 museum members were expected to attend a special preview  tonight. The exhibit is scheduled to open to the public Saturday.  </P> <P> City and county officials asked Judge Edward Donnellon to dismiss a lawsuit by  the museum, which wanted a jury to decide whether the photographs violated  local obscenity laws. Dismissal of the lawsuit would allow authorities to  intervene.  </P></p>

Rowen told attorneys Michael Rubin and Kenneth Schild. "You have subjected the  whole system to ridicule."  </P> <P> Rowen granted a request for an extension of a temporary restraining order  sought by Rubin to restrict the times during which the Schild family could use  the basketball court.  </P></p>

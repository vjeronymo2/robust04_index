			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- A former publisher of an  economic magazine said Wednesday [13 April] Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa lied about investment of his funds in his  resignation announcement last Friday. Yusei Kuwahata, 60, said  in a press conference that "Hosokawa's office made me out to be  like a criminal, using me as a tool to make Premier Hosokawa  look clean."    From around 1981 to 1985, Kuwahata invested Hosokawa's funds  and gained profits for Hosokawa of 20 to 30 million yen,  according to Kuwahata.    Kuwahata denied any illegality in his use of the funds, in  spite of Hosokawa's citing "new suspicions" over the legality of  his financial deals as one of the reasons for his resignation.    He said he did not invest the funds on the black market.    Some newspapers have reported that a former secretary of the  late former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka introduced him to  Hosokawa's financial secretary. Kuwahata, however, said an  "ordinary person" who has since died introduced him to Hosokawa  around 1980 when Hosokawa was a House of Councillors member of  the Liberal Democratic Party.    In investing Hosokawa's funds, Kuwahata promised him an  annual interest rate of 12 percent, he said.    "I did not care if I made a loss, because I thought of it as  a political donation," Kuwahata said.    Hosokawa told a news conference Friday, "from 1981 and for  several years, my office let a certain person use the funds, and  he gained personal profit from them. That person is an old  personal friend of mine."    The premier declined, however, to elaborate on the specifics  of the new suspicions, saying an investigation by his political  office was still under way.</p>

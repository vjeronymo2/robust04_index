			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Mesnage appears in Guernsey court MR Michel Mesnage, a French trawler skipper, appeared in a Guernsey court yesterday, Jimmy Burns writes. He was charged with fishing illegally in British territorial waters off the island and with failing to comply with an order from a fisheries protection officer. Mr Mesnage faces a maximum Pounds 50,000 fine for the first offence and a maximum Pounds 1,000 for the second. The charges relate to alleged incidents 10 days ago involving French fishing vessels and the Royal Navy. The case was further adjourned until today. Earlier yesterday more than a dozen British fishing vessels landed their catches at the French port of Cherbourg without the feared protest action by French fishermen. Last Friday French fishermen warned their British counterparts not to go to French ports because of tensions over disputed fishing rights and the arrest of Mr Mesnage.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: How investors can beat the cowboys - Ways to spot fund fraud IT IS easy to spot the criminal now. Peter Clowes, the disgraced managing director of the Barlow Clowes fund management company, which crashed in 1988, was jailed for 10 years this week. But when Clowes' career was in its prime, and he walked without handcuffs on his wrists, he was much harder to spot - as the painful experiences of his investors attest. He was not the first financial con-man to get away with it for a while and he will not be the last. The important point now is: how do you spot the next Peter Clowes before entrusting him with your money? Last year, the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), created by the Financial Services Act (FSA) to co-ordinate financial regulation, published a pamphlet called How to Spot the Investment Cowboys. It provides a useful series of checks to make when someone - either an intermediary or a product-provider - is asking you for money. Some are listed below. Would they have stopped you investing with Barlow Clowes? Your adviser offers a rate of return which seems higher than anyone else. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Unfortunately, Barlow Clowes would have passed this test narrowly. The rates on offer were good but did not stretch credulity. They were also perfectly in accord with what the company said it was going to do with the money - manoeuvre holdings of government bonds adroitly in offshore accounts. The Barlow Clowes Portfolio offered a high guaranteed tax-free annual return of 9 per cent - very good, but not stratospheric. Perhaps these rates should have been enough to prompt further questions. He invites you to put money into a special scheme run by him, which he cannot explain in detail. This comes closer to the nub, and SIB goes into details on the kind of questions you should ask to discover how your money really is being spent. It was through a test similar to this that David Kauders, a Taunton fee-based adviser specialising in gilts, spotted that Barlow Clowes was not to be trusted. Kauders said: 'I asked them to confirm that they were holding gilts and stock in clients' own names. They replied that their stock was held by a branch of Midland Bank. I was to contact the branch to find out details. When I contacted the branch directly, they said they could give me no details and I should contact Barlow Clowes. That was one of the classic danger signs.' As a result, Kauders advised any clients who came to him with Barlow Clowes investments to get out while the going was good. He now insists, partly in reaction to the Clowes experience, that clients hold all certificates themselves. Another point he makes is that if you use a fee-charging adviser, you can pay solely for the advice and then do the transactions yourself. This short-circuits the problem neatly. He advises you to put all your money in one investment. Diversification must always be a good idea. The Barlow Clowes 'portfolios' were supposed to be invested long-term in gilts, making them appropriate for wide-scale 'widows and orphans' investing. The pain so many investors suffered would have been that much less had all of their money had not gone into one investment. Your prospective adviser has an expensive lifestyle that seems out of scale with his business. Bulls-eye] As a quick look at this week's tabloid press will show, this test would have revealed Clowes as a suspect cowboy. You might not have been able to tell this from the intermediary who sold you the Barlow Clowes policy, but it still helps. Perhaps most important: Your adviser is not authorised. The definition of this word has changed since the introduction of the Financial Services Act. At that time, authorisation and regulation were the direct responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry. Barlow Clowes' authorisation was itself a vexed issue. From 1975 to 1981, the company was able to trade unlicenced due to what the ombudsman's report  -published at the end of 1989 - described as 'licencing errors.' This made it easier to avoid awkward questions as the licencing regime was tightened, and Barlow Clowes was to gain a licence for the last few years in which it traded. It is fair to say that this mess would be much less likely to occur now. Also, investing with an authorised company now at least opens the door to the Investors Compensation Scheme if things go awry. The register of all authorised companies is available via Prestel, or by writing or telephoning SIB. In addition, company advertisements, notepaper and business cards should carry the logo of the relevant regulator - such as SIB (the overall co-ordinating body), Fimbra (for independent intermediaries), Lautro (life assurance and unit trusts), Imro (investment managers), or the SFA (for securities and futures brokers). The absence of such a logo is a very bad sign. The FSA regime has its faults, many of which have been well-aired in these pages. But it has made it easier for small investors to protect themselves. There is little that can be done about outright liars - had Clowes done with the money what he said he was going to do, his portfolio might have been a sensible choice. But look out for the signs and you should be able to keep your life savings in your own safe hands without invoking the authorities.

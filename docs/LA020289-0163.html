			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> SAVING THREATENED BIRDS FROM FOXES TO BE TOPIC  </P> <P> Protection of two endangered bird species against red foxes in the Seal Beach  Naval Weapons Station will be discussed at a public meeting this evening in the  City Council chamber.  </P> <P> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Navy are sponsoring the meeting to  gather public comment for a planned environmental impact statement on  protections needed for the California least tern and the light-footed clapper  rail, which nest in the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge located on the  military base.  </P> <P> The goal is to control non-native red foxes that roam the wildlife refuge, said  Tracey Schwarze, public affairs officer for the station. Wildlife experts  contend that foxes prey on the birds, which nest on the ground in the salt  marsh, and are seriously depleting the fowl population. That led to a  controversial program to trap the foxes in 1986.  </P> <P> But the trapping program was challenged in court by an animal-rights group, the  Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn. Federal judges have refused to halt the trapping  but have asked the Navy to draft an environmental impact statement on  protection efforts.  </P> <P> Schwarze said there currently is no trapping under way in the refuge.  </P> <P> Other efforts to protect the birds have included an electric fence around the  tern nesting area and nesting platforms for the clapper rails.  </P> <P> The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. in the council chambers, located at 211 8th  St.  </P> <P> Written comments will be accepted through Feb. 15. The environmental impact  statement is expected to be completed in December.  </P> <P> For information, call (213) 594-7214 or (213) 594-7215.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: EASY IN THE ISLANDS BY BOB SHACOCHIS (PENGUIN: $7.95)  </P> <P> Languid, sultry and rum-soaked, Bob Shacochis' stories capture the heady  atmosphere of the Caribbean islands.  </P> <P> The title story, about the proprietor of a broken-down hotel who finds himself  stuck with his mother's corpse in the freezer, is reminiscent of a "Fawlty  Towers" episode. A petty grifter, who gets into trouble when he tries to go  jogging, extricates himself through his improbably lofty connections in the  weirder "Hot Day on the Gold Coast." The most impressive story in this mixed  collection is "Lord Short Shoe Wants the Monkey," a cautionary tale about a  reggae musician who slyly exploits a conniving white man's lust to achieve his  aims.  </P></p>

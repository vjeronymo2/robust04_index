			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKES SHAMIR LOOK LIKE A MODERATE;  </P> <P> * NEW ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS NOT BUILT FOR COMPROMISE  </P> <P> Israel's new government represents the most dramatic lurch to the right in the  country's 42-year history. And that is not going to help the peace process.  </P> <P> Israel's new government represents the most dramatic lurch to the right in the  country's 42-year history. And this is not going to help the peace process.  </P> <P> Its narrow base -- it was approved by only 62 members of the 120-member Knesset  -- leaves Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir dependent on two small parties best  known for wanting to annex the West Bank, and on a third that would expel all  Arabs living there. Further support comes from Orthodox religious elements  expected to demand tougher dietary and Sabbath closing laws.  </P> <P> In short, it is a government of rigidly fixed and obdurate views, of men who  for the most part have little inclination to pursue the democratic political  norms of compromise and conciliation.  </P> <P> What do Israelis think of such a coalition? An opinion poll published last  week, before Shamir finally forged his new alliance, found only 14% of voters  favoring establishment of a regime based on far-right and religious parties.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, that is the kind of government Israel now has. Israelis  uncomfortable with annexationist and expulsionist views may find consolation in  the prospect that internal disputes could soon send the coalition flying apart.  </P> <P> Shamir himself has been restrained in hailing the end of the 88 days of interim  government that followed the Labor Alignment's decision to pull out of its  coalition with his Likud party. His own preference clearly was to revive the  troubled but tolerable marriage with Labor that had produced six years of power  sharing. That would have assured continued paralysis in a number of areas, key  among them decisions about dealing politically with the Palestinians. But it  would also have spared Shamir the need to placate the extremists to whom he was  forced to turn for support. It says much about the political cast of the new  government that Shamir, by comparison, emerges as one of its more moderate  members.  </P> <P> In partial recognition of the trouble-making potential of his multiparty  government, Shamir has set as its first priority the integration of the 250,000  Soviet Jewish immigrants expected this year. It's a reasonable goal, first  because Israel remains appallingly ill-prepared to house and employ the sudden  wave of immigrants now flooding in, second because absorption is probably the  one issue most Israelis can agree on for now.  </P> <P> The drawback is that the man Shamir has put in charge of housing is Ariel  Sharon, the former defense minister and architect of Israel's disastrous 1982  invasion of Lebanon. It's no secret where Sharon would prefer to build  accommodations for new citizens: on the West Bank. Such an effort could set up  a renewed confrontation with the Bush Administration, which strongly opposes  the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> The shift to the far-right makes it all but inevitable that Israel will do even  less than it has so far to pursue political talks with the Palestinians. David  Levy, the new foreign minister, opposes Shamir's own 1989 plan for elections in  the occupied territories. In any event, the attempted May 30 attack on Israeli  civilian targets by an element of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and  the PLO's typically self-wounding refusal specifically to condemn such  terrorism, could force an effective suspension of the U.S. intermediary role.  </P> <P> That won't disturb Israel's hard-line government. But there's plenty about the  new government that can be expected to disturb the Israeli people, and distress  Israel's friends.  </P></p>

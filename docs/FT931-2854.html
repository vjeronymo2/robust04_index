			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: No Budget joy for the equity market MR LAMONT'S Budget proved no favourite of the UK stock market yesterday and, although selling pressure was not heavy, share prices gave ground steadily. Uncertainty over the implications of some corporate tax changes was reflected in 'the quietest post-Budget trading session recorded', said a senior trader at one of the largest integrated houses. The chief objections were the chancellor's apparent coolness towards hopes for another base rate cut and his changes to ACT (Advance Corporation Tax), and to foreign income dividends by UK companies. NatWest Securities warned that the new levels of ACT implied a drop on the gross yield on the equity market on April 6. The stock market was saved from the worst by a steadier performance by government bonds and by stock index futures. But the FT-SE 100 Index closed 29.4 down at 2,889.9. Although generally negative on the Budget, most London securities houses kept year-end Footsie forecasts unchanged  - at 2,850 at Strauss Turnbull and 3,000 at Nikko; Hoare Govett trimmed its 1993 forecast to 3,150 from 3,200. While there were sharp falls in many overseas-earning companies, which could be affected by the foreign income dividend proposals, few recorded significant trading volume. Analysts struggled to comprehend and assess the new proposals, at least one leading house promising clients a 'consultative document'. The dividend tax change has significant implications for UK pension funds. The stock market opened nervously lower following a round of generally bearish morning meetings at most trading firms. There was little selling, however, and the loss on the Footsie was held to around 16 points until stock index futures opened lower and at a discount, when the loss on the index was extended to 36.2. But this level of 2,883.1 proved to be the low of the day. Two US sellers of the Footsie future late on Tuesday stood on the sidelines yesterday and both the future contract and the FT-SE 100 Index itself steadied. For the rest of the session, the market traded quietly, with both buyers and sellers evident, but not on any great scale. Not all market strategists were prepared to abandon expectations of a base rate cut because of the chancellor's apparently negative stance. Attention now focuses on today's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council, where the chances of a reduction in the Lombard rate appear high. However, a good performance from store and retail shares was ascribed not to base rate optimism but to the latest UK retail sales figures, showing a modest gain for last month but an upward revision of the January data. Oil issues provided the firmest spots in the market as investors continued to respond to the Budget news of lower Petroleum Revenue Tax on existing oil fields. US buyers were active here but their efforts were counterbalanced by US selling of the pharmaceutical stocks. The activity in these two prominent market sectors boosted Seaq volume to 671.7m shares from the 492m of the previous day, when retail business was worth Pounds 1.30bn. Non-Footsie trade fell back to a more normal 57 per cent of the total yesterday.</p>

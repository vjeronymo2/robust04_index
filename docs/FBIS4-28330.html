			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Hiroaki Ito] </F>   [Text] Washington, 6 Jun -- With Japan-U.S. summit talks  in Naples one month away, the U.S. Government's concrete policy  on the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks is gradually coming  to light. Major points of the policy are that 1) with regard to  the number of car dealers selling foreign-built automobiles in  Japan, the U.S. Government will seek an objective criteria in  the form of a figure, but it will unequivocally indicate in  writing that the objective criteria does not mean any numerical  targets, and 2) the U.S. Government sees it as important to  achieve certain results in the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, but it will not  necessary seek the conclusion of a set of trade agreements on  all sectors prior to the summit talks. The Japanese Government  still takes the view that "setting any goals will become  numerical targets in the end." The U.S. Government's policy is  taken as a strategy designed to wring a "political decision"  from the Japanese Government by indicating that the objective  criteria does not mean a numerical target.    In his lecture given right after the Japan-U.S. framework  talks resumed, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor stated  that "the Japanese Government should promise to increase the  number of car dealers selling foreign automobiles by a certain  period." He made the request as an example of the objective  criteria to measure the future openness of the Japanese vehicle  market. The Japanese Government reacted strongly against his  request, claiming: "What he requested means a strict numerical  target. The government cannot tell car dealers what to do."    Another U.S. Government official has said: "What the  Japanese  Government needs to promise is not an increase in the number of  car dealers, but the `implementation of measures' to open the  Japanese market through the relaxation of regulations and  transparency of transactions. I think it is better to use the  expression  `desirable,' or `anticipated' instead of `promise.'" In this  way, the U.S. Government official has suggested that the U.S.  Government is willing to compromise with the Japanese Government  on the question of objective criteria. The U.S. Government wants  to avoid being criticized by Japan, the American news media, the  European Union (EU), and Asian nations for "seeking a numerical  target." Mindful of the criticism, a high-ranking White House  official has made it clear that "The U.S. Government will not  care about indicating that the 'objective criteria does not mean  any numerical target in a final agreement document.'"    Looking at the dispute over car dealers in Japan, there is  no  change in the fact, however, that "individual objective criteria  sought by the U.S. Government is very similar to numerical  targets," (says a Japanese Government official). The Clinton  administration, which has made "results-oriented trade" the  basis for its trade policy toward Japan, wants to set the  numerical targets one way or another in the future. How to  express that objective criteria does not mean numerical targets  in the final agreement document will be a task for the U.S.  Government.    Meanwhile, a Japanese negotiator has said: "The Japanese  Government has promised to expand market access and sales for  competitive foreign goods. When the U.S. Government criticizes  Japan for not opening its market widely, the term  `competitiveness' can be used by the Japanese Government as a  trump card to refute the criticism. The Japanese Government will  be able to argue with the U.S. Government about whether foreign  goods have been competitive or not on the Japanese market." In  this way, the official pointed to the importance of wording in  the final agreement document.</p>

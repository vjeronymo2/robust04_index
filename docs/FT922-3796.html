			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: BAA BAA has clearly set out to prove that there are other ways of investing in the air transport business than buying British Airways. The airports operator has outperformed BA by 75 per cent since flotation and yesterday produced full year figures which will do little to dim the enthusiasm of its fans. A 22 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, after all, had long been expected in the wake of the Gulf war and the recession. What stood out in the results, though, was the comfortable absorption of unexpectedly high property provisions, the depth of the cost cutting and a marginally more generous dividend than hoped for. The task of valuing BAA is complicated by the lack of comparative stocks. Last night's price of 679p represents a 5 per cent to 10 per cent premium on the market's forward earnings multiple. Productivity savings and traffic growth should offset the impact of a tougher regulatory regime this year and next. Whether the company can do better than the market depends on whether more optimistic forecasts for volume growth are justified. There-after, however, pricing pressure on airport charges starts to ease and retailing revenue will be building up. BAA, moreover, is now in the enviable position of having very little regulatory risk. The next review is almost 5 years away. Were the CAA to contemplate getting tough, the threat used so successfully this time of abandoning Heathrow's Terminal 5 might still be credible. But the more profitable BAA becomes, the more seriously a future government would have to consider bringing competition into the airports business. Hiving off Gatwick would not work; but separating the ownership of terminals at Heathrow might do the trick.</p>

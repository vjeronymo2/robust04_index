"We assess such a proposal  of the Ingush side as crude interference in the internal affairs  of the Republic of North Ossetia," says Yuriy Bagirov's  statement. "Their realization would make a further peaceful  settlement of the relations between the peoples of the two  republics impossible and reduce to naught the peacemaking work  done by the leaders of Russia and the provisional  administration; likewise the accords reached in the course of  the negotiating process."</p>

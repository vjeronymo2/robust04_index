			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / US-led Haiti invasion 'days away': US officials rule out third party mediation with military junta The US-led invasion of Haiti is now 'a matter of days away' and, when it comes, serious fighting will be over 'in a matter of hours', according to Mr Warren Christopher and Mr William Perry, respectively US secretaries of state and defence. US president Bill Clinton, whose televised address to the nation on Thursday night had laid out his justifications for intervention, yesterday cancelled a political trip to California scheduled for tomorrow. Mr Perry said US forces would be ready by the weekend and could maintain that state for several days. Washington was alive with rumours that one or more of the Haitian military junta was preparing to leave the island. But Lt General Raoul Cedras, the army chief who was interviewed live on US TV after the president had finished, said he was prepared to die for his country. US officials ruled out third party mediation with the junta, reported to have been offered by Mr Edward Seaga, the former Jamaican prime minister, and Mr Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier, the dictator overthrown in 1986. Any dealings with the regime would be handled by the US embassy in Port-au-Prince and these would only include negotiations about the manner of their departure. Mr Clinton held a meeting yesterday with Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Haitian president ousted by Lt Gen Cedras in the 1991 coup, and representatives of more than 20 nations which are contributing to an international peacekeeping force that will take over after the US invasion. Mr Aristide, in a significant concession to conservative critics of his leftwing politics and character, promised to step down when his term of office ends late next year and to respect the result of the next presidential elections. Although the Haitian constitution prevents him from seeking re-election, Mr Aristide had maintained that the clock should be stopped on his term at the 1991 coup. This would have given him, in effect, more than four years after he is restored to power. Mr Clinton's address appeared to reduce public opposition to invading Haiti. One instant poll found support for sending in US troops up to 56 per cent from 40 per cent, while another reported outright opposition to an invasion down from 73 per cent to 60 per cent. However, much political opinion was unmollified. Former president George Bush said yesterday he found Mr Clinton's arguments 'mind-boggling', but he added that if the invasion were launched 'I will support our own troops and our own president'.

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Letter: Silent enemy may be a paper tiger Sir, I read with interest your article 'Silent enemy poised for attack' (March 5) which discussed the potential threat that US warehouse clubs pose to UK retailers, and agree with much of your argument. While not wishing to be dismissive of a formula that has been so successful in the US, it seems appropriate to put the threat into context from the point of view of the UK supermarket retailer. In a typical US warehouse club, about 40-50 per cent of sales are in product categories offered by a large UK supermarket. Of this, US market research suggests that only 35-40 per cent is sold to the general public, while the rest is sold on a wholesale basis to small retailers and caterers. Assuming that a UK warehouse club had a sales pattern similar to that in the US, for every Pounds 1m of sales made by the warehouse club store about Pounds 200,000 could be at the expense of the supermarkets. In the US, warehouse clubs currently have sales of about Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) per week per store. Even if they were to increase this to Pounds 1m in the UK, the total impact that each new warehouse club could have on local food retailers would be less than half that which is currently experienced from a new superstore. Your article states that Goldman Sachs sees scope for only 30 warehouse clubs in the UK, with total sales of Pounds 2bn, giving a rather ambitious Pounds 1.3m per store per week. To put this into perspective, it implies that warehouse clubs will achieve a market share of only about one half of one per cent of the market in which food retailers such as Sainsbury's operate.

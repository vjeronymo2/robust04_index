			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Gardening: Time for a flirt among the petals - Robin Lane Fox is keen to improve the stamina of his roses THE first rose season has ended in a mass of sodden petals: after this week's storms, what are the prospects for a second? Poor roses, we expect so much of them. We want scent, colour, resistance to weather and flowers in at least two seasons. Second seasons are vastly better if you and I take trouble over them. We have to prune, feed, water and do our own research. This weekend, we should start by deadheading any rose which might flower for a second time. Deadheading is a most therapeutic job, especially before breakfast or in the half light of a warm evening. Like any therapy, it needs to be done properly: it involves a small degree of pruning. Do not cut off only the heads and leave bits of stem which wastes energy before they die back to the nearest pair of leaves. Cut them back to healthy leaves immediately and throw them away. If possible, feed any second-season roses with diluted Phostrogen, sprayed all over the leaves. Repeat this feeding every 10 days or so: specific rose feeds might be even better, but I use Phostrogen because it suits every other plant in the garden and is effective but vastly cheaper. All the care in the world will not make a once-flowering rose flower twice. Breeders have concentrated on the double season, except among ramblers. Many of their modern varieties will flower twice, but many of us wish they did not even flower once. Older roses have more flowers, better colours and better scent. The choice of long-flowering varieties is much more skilled. If you want an old rose which flowers almost continuously, you should choose a pink China Rose and learn to live with its slightly harsh colour. Alternatively, you can convince yourself that you are one of the many gardeners who likes small roses of purple fuschia-red. Here, one old-fashioned variety has a strong scent and an admirable record for flowering twice. It is called Rose de Rescht and will suit any small garden because it can be kept to a height and width of 3ft. As it grows over, its potency fades. It needs to be pruned hard each year if it is to perform twice from middle age onwards. I have heard it said that a pot pourri of this rose's petals will do similar wonders for the stamina of older owners, but I leave you to find out. Neither of these two easy roses ranks high on my list for colour. I much prefer pale pinks, stripes and crimsons: here I continue to learn, helped by the book of a great rose-grower, Peter Beales' Classic Roses. The original 1985 version has now been merged into a bigger dictionary called simply Roses and costs Pounds 35. Peter Beales distinguishes repeat-flowering roses (marked R) from continuous flowerers (marked C). He would be the first to admit that repetition and continuity depend on the season, soil and owner. Ever-suspicious, I have been fishing round his C's, hoping at least for an element of R. Sometimes, I have ended up with my own rating, BABS: it stands for, well, Bloody Awful Black Spot. Sometimes, I have had only one flowering, but there are some near-C's too and if they are C with me on a stony Cotswold soil, they will C like mad for Essex girls on rose-rich clay. Among climbers, the choice is pretty obvious. The most continuous is Kathleen Harrop, the pale pink sport from the stronger rose-pink thornless Zephirin Drouhin. On my soil, Kathleen scores high marks for BABS too, but she certainly flowers for months and is easy to train on to wire or into a low hedge because she has no thorns to catch you unawares. Among bushes, try the button-pink Jacques Cartier, my No 1 R which is almost C and certainly more C than its close relation, the fuller and more pink Conte de Chambord. Light pruning will keep Jacques Cartier about 3ft high and wide, making it a marvellous old rose for small gardens. This Portland variety was bred in 1868, but is almost unobtainable, except from a few specialists. I have seen it in France, growing with gusto near Aix-en-Provence. The leaves are tough and the flowers will stand sun: perhaps it could be more widely marketed for expatriate demand. As for the striped roses, Beales gives a C to the pale Vick's Caprice and a R to the darker Ferdinand Pichard which is flecked with white. I would give Vick an R and Ferdinand a half-R if you feed him properly. Certainly, they are the longest-flowering choices among old-fashioned forms with stripes and splashes and they refute the people who dismiss these colours because they last only for a fortnight. Among the oldies, they are good ones to choose, but like other oldies, they cannot always keep up the act all summer. What matters about an oldie is its quality and fashion, not its date of birth. Gardeners can be more relaxed about these matters and I am pleased to find that Beales gives the coveted C to many of the more recent varieties with China Rose blood in their pedigrees. I have never found that the pink Madame Butterfly is as continuous as he implies, but this year, I have filled a gap in the spectrum by finding a genuinely C dark red. Admittedly, Mme Louis Laperriere is even younger than I am, having started life in 1951. However, she grows only 2ft high and really does flower every fortnight, beginning with young flowers of a splendid dark red. She is not strictly an old rose, but the height and colour are most convenient. Every grower except Beales seems to have forgotten her, but who could resist a true C in red with a name as elegant as hers.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A SQUEEZE on stock index futures sent the June contract on the FT-SE sharply forward to trade at a large premium to the cash market for most of the session, writes Joel Kibazo. June opened at 2,623 but slipped back due to lack of interest. However, buyers returned sending the contract forward to 2,644, the high of the day, by mid-morning, underpinning the underlying cash market. Once again, a firm Wall Street had little influence on trading in London during the afternoon session which saw June decline slightly. However, a bid for 100 contracts in the dying minutes of the session sent June ahead. Dealers also talked of independent traders closing short positions towards the end. June closed at 2,643, up 14 on the previous session and around 21 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Volume was 5,809 contracts. Traders talked of further rises in after hours dealing and they expect a strong opening on the cash market tomorrow. Traded options were busy and turnover reached 41,545 contracts. Volume in both the index contracts was heavy. The FT-SE 100 option traded 13,365 lots while the Euro FTSE option reached 6,789.</p>

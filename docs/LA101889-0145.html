			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER DISTRICT VOTES TO BAN LANDFILL  EXPANSION  </P> <P> Citing an eventual danger to San Gabriel Valley underground water supplies, the  Metropolitan Water District voted unanimously on Tuesday to join in a legal  action to stop the expansion of a landfill in Azusa.  </P> <P> Browning-Ferris Industries, a Houston-based company chaired by former U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency head William D. Ruchleshaus, wants to expand  the landfill to accommodate 36 million more tons of trash. The company promised  to insert high-density plastic liners to separate the landfill from the water  table and, to sweeten the deal, to set up a $20-million fund to clean up  already polluted water in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> "No one is suggesting that the impact (on ground water) will be immediate,"  said Metropolitan Water District spokesman Jay Malinowski. "But from our point  of view, there's no reason to believe that liner won't leak eventually."  </P> <P> The water district will join the Main San Gabriel Valley Water Basin, which  oversees water rights in the region, in seeking to overturn a decision by the  State Water Resources Control Board allowing Browning-Ferris to proceed with  its plan.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Houston company said that officials would continue to seek  an amicable settlement that would permit expansion of the landfill.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: EL TORO;  </P> <P> MARINE COMMANDER RETIRES WITH 1 REGRET  </P> <P> Against a colorful backdrop of fluttering flags and rigid rows of troops in  camouflage fatigues, Brig. Gen. David V. Shuter turned over command of El Toro  Marine Corps Air Station to Brig. Gen. Wayne T. Adams on Friday.  </P> <P> Shuter, 53, retiring after 31 years -- which included flying combat missions in  Vietnam and piloting a presidential helicopter -- also relinquished command of  the Marine Corps Air Bases Western Area to Adams in ceremonies on the El Toro  Tarmac.  </P> <P> The western area command oversees Marine operations in El Toro, Camp Pendleton,  Tustin and Yuma, Ariz.  </P> <P> "The one thing that I hold most important in this command is our legacy,"  Shuter told about 200 spectators. "I'm giving up a wonderful command, and it is  significant that it ends here. Every air station is unique. In the Mideast  crisis, the toughness and skill of these teams has come to the fore."  </P> <P> In the last two months, El Toro has been a center of activity in the deployment  of troops, helicopters and other cargo to Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> After the ceremonies, which were punctuated with cannon fire to mark Shuter's  retirement and the installment of Adams, the outgoing general said his only  regret was that he did not go to Saudi Arabia in Operation Desert Shield.  </P> <P> "I volunteered to stay on," Shuter said. "I told 'em I was ready. That's what  we train for. I would have liked to have been involved in that, but it was time  to go."  </P> <P> Shuter will live in Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> Adams -- 50 and former director of the Marine Corps Facilities and Services  Division, Installations and Logistics Department in Washington -- said one of  his challenges will be to maintain good relations with community leaders and  local governments.  </P> <P> Adams was promoted to brigadier general in April, 1989. He is a native of  southern Florida and received a bachelor's degree in political science and  economics from the University of Alabama. He has also accumulated more than  3,600 hours as a pilot of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters and had two tours  of duty in Vietnam.  </P> <P> Lt. Gen. Robert Milligan, commanding general of Fleet Marine Force Pacific,  told the crowd that he had just returned from Saudi Arabia. He praised what he  described as a spirited group of soldiers "poised to execute whatever order is  given."  </P> <P> Milligan said he toured the Persian Gulf staging area with Marine Corps  Commandant Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr., who was the subject of news reports when he  dealt with the question of declining troop morale.  </P> <P> After the ceremonies, Shuter said he asked Milligan to comment on troop morale  in light of Gray's visit.  </P> <P> "It's tremendous . . . the attitude, morale, spirit, desire and dedication of  these young Marines and sailors," Milligan said.

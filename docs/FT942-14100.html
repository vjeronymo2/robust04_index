			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Opposition to Delta-Virgin link American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, yesterday said it would oppose the partnership announced last week between Delta Air Lines of the US and Virgin Atlantic of the UK. Nor did it believe the US government would permit it. The partnership would give Delta access to London's Heathrow airport by allowing it to book blocks of seats on Virgin's flights in and out of the airport and sell them as Delta flights, using Delta flight codes. American Airlines has a strong interest in the proposal because it is one of only two US carriers with the right to fly in and out of Heathrow. The other is United Airlines. Mr Michael Durham, American Airlines' chief financial officer, claimed yesterday the US was unlikely to permit the arrangement without a renegotiation of its aviation treaty with the UK. This was because Delta had no authorisation for the routes or the Heathrow landing slots under the existing treaty. He was speaking as AMR, American Airlines' parent, reported first-quarter net losses of Dollars 7m, or 30 cents a share, compared with net losses of Dollars 22m, or 43 cents, last time. It blamed the losses on fare discounting and bad winter weather. The company had warned last month its first-quarter losses would be bigger than the 24 cents a share analysts were then predicting. Group revenues were Dollars 3.81bn in the quarter, virtually unchanged from last time, but the airline's revenues were down by 2.2 per cent. Losses were reduced because the airline cut capacity, and fuel costs were nearly 10 per cent lower. Mr Robert Crandall, AMR chairman, said the actions the airline was taking - re-allocating and reducing capacity, refining yield management techniques, focusing on the cargo business, and cutting costs - were working. 'In that sense, we are encouraged,' he said. Mr Durham said the airline expected to be profitable this year. 'We do not expect to be adequately profitable, in relation to our assets, but we do expect to make money,' he said.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Greek telecom sale approved The Greek parliament has approved legislation allowing the partial privatisation of OTE, the state telecoms monopoly through a flotation on the Athens stock exchange. In a stormy session on Wednesday night, 12 deputies from the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, most of them ex-trade union leaders, abstained or voted against the law. OTE employees, striking in protest against the flotation, blocked traffic outside parliament. The law calls for tariff increases of 40 per cent on local calls in 1995 and 9 per cent in each of the following two years, so that OTE's domestic network can break even by 1997. The vote cleared the way for 25 per cent of the company to be sold next month. Eighteen per cent will be placed with institutions abroad and the remainder offered to local investors. The government expects to raise more than Dr320bn (Pounds 850m) from the flotation, but two-thirds will be set aside to fund OTE's five-year modernisation plan.</p>

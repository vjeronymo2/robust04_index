			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Business 'backs training levy' Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress general secretary, yesterday said there was growing support in the business community for a levy to pay for in-company training, Lisa Wood writes. He was addressing the annual conference in Birmingham of training and enterprise councils, which administer government training schemes in England and Wales. Mr Monks later said there was 'closet support' for the levy among employers, who consider it 'disloyal to pipe up in favour of anything that involves new regulation of the labour market'. A survey of Tec directors by the Financial Times showed interest in a more regulatory path towards training.</p>

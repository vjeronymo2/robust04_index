			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Milk hormone is panned: Alison Maitland finds resistance stems from fear of a backlash by consumers Retailers, consumers, farming organisations and animal welfare groups have come out strongly against the licensing in Britain of a hormone that boosts milk production in cows. More than 100 companies, organisations and individuals responded to a government consultation paper, with 62 expressing concern about bovine somatotrophin, or BST. Twenty-one favoured licensing it, including the BST manufacturers Monsanto and Lilly Industries, and the rest expressed no firm opinion. BST, an artificially produced version of a hormone that occurs naturally in cows, went on sale to farmers in the US in February after approval from the Food and Drug Administration last November. European Union agriculture ministers are due to decide in December whether a ban on its use should be lifted or remain in place until the year 2000. Britain is believed to have been in a minority of two in wanting the ban lifted when the 12 ministers discussed the issue last December. Germany is thought to have favoured an indefinite ban, while most countries wanted a moratorium until the end of the decade. Although the hormone has met EU and UK licensing criteria of safety, quality and efficacy, much of the opposition to it is based on fears of a consumer backlash. Monsanto last month cited figures from the US Department of Agriculture showing liquid milk consumption in the US had remained steady since BST was introduced. However, the British Retail Consortium said in its submission that 'consumer concern about BST has reached such a pitch that most, if not all retailers, would like to be able to guarantee that their products do not come from cows treated with it'. Safeway, the supermarket group, said that if BST went on sale it would seek supplies 'only from non-treated herds for milk and milk products for our own-brand products'. Pressure on Mrs Angela Browning, the new food minister, came in a letter opposing BST from the Conservative party association in her Devon constituency. In the event of licensing, it insisted on labelling to distinguish milk produced with BST, saying: 'It is one of the government's main planks of policy that consumers have the right of choice in a free market.' In spite of the generally accepted view that BST-produced milk is safe for humans, some groups expressed concern about the increased presence of a growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1). In a letter last month to The Lancet, the medical journal, four medical scientists wrote that 'the safety of BST-milk has not been established with adequate scientific rigour, because of possible adverse effects of substantially increased concentrations of IGF1 in the milk of BST-treated cows'. They said evidence was needed about the action on human gut tissue of IGF1, which is not destroyed by pasteurisation. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals pointed to problems such as mastitis, injection-site reactions and cystic ovaries which Monsanto warns farmers about in its product information. Those favouring BST included scientists and veterinary organisations who back ministers' views that a decision should be based on scientific principles and that approval would boost the biotechnology and farming industries. The Association of Veterinarians in Industry said approval of BST 'will put farmers in Europe on an equal footing with their cousins in the US'.</p>

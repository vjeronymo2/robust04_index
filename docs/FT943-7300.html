			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Oil-rich refuge of the caribou  -A look at US/Canadian national park links The similarity between US oilmen and polar bears is that they both want to set up camp in Alaska. Beneath the Alaskan coastal plain, where polar bears make their dens and porcupine caribou calve, lies possibly as much as 9bn barrels of crude oil. Proposals under consideration at the US Interior Department indicate that the Clinton administration is on the side of the polar bears. An internal memo proposes that the US and Canada 'co-ordinate management' of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), the 19m-acre Alaskan sanctuary, whose coastal plain is thought to contain the oil, and the adjacent Vunntut and Ivvavik Canadian national parks. Under current legislation, oil companies are prevented from drilling until ANWR is opened up by Congress. An agreement between the US and Canada to 'twin' their parklands would force companies to consult both countries to gain access to the area, effectively ending industry's ambitions for the so-called 1002 fields for a generation. The plan to link the US refuge in north-east Alaska and Canadian parkland in Yukon territory is part of an Interior Department options paper drawn up at the beginning of August. A White House official says the Clinton administration could support a system of 'co-operative management of resources in the area' because 'ecosystems spill over boundaries'. It was stressed that federal land would have to remain under American jurisdiction. Oil companies still hope to gain access to the fields in the longer term and oppose any move that would obstruct the future development of arctic reserves. Tom Koch, a spokesman for British Petroleum, says the company 'would prefer the US to maintain the opportunity to take future decisions on energy security'. BP and Chevron Corporation of the US, which together have drilled the only well in the ANWR, have not disclosed how much oil they believe to be in the 1002 fields. Industry estimates vary, with the most modest forecast for 500m barrels. The more common figure of 9bn barrels is plausible: the 1002 reserves are understood to be part of the same geological formation as the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay field, the biggest US reserve, which has exceeded the original 9.6bn barrel forecast and produced nearly 11bn barrels. It is not only the petroleum industry which is resisting the proposal for twin management of Canadian and US federal land. Alaskan state governor Walter J. Hickel says: 'It is unthinkable that the Department of Interior would proceed with a proposal such as this one without consulting the State of Alaska.' Responding to the suggestion that the federal government could include ANWR in a World Heritage Park, Hickel says: 'This is exactly the kind of unilateral federal decision-making that we fought for statehood over.' Principles of the constitution are not all that is at stake - the oil industry promises jobs. Oil production from Prudhoe Bay is declining, from 738m barrels in 1988 to 627m barrels in 1992. The American Petroleum Institute claims that exploration and production on the Alaskan coastal plain fields may generate as many as 735,000 jobs. Environmental campaigners argue that estimated economic benefits do not justify putting America's last undisturbed natural habitat at risk. Industrial development would threaten the 180,000-strong porcupine caribou herd that migrates across the coastal plain and into Canada twice a year, they say. It would have the knock-on effect of destroying the Guich'in community, the indigenous people whose subsistence and culture is based on the porcupine caribou. 'It is one of the unfortunate accidents of fate,' says Scott Kearin of the Alaska Wilderness League, 'that an area the oil industry thinks is very promising can't be developed without destroying the caribou herd. Caribou will never calve in an area that looks like New Jersey.' Twinning the refuge and the Canadian national parks is a proposal most environmentalists would like to see adopted, even though it does not meet their ultimate target of getting wilderness designation (which prohibits any future industrial development) for the ANWR coastal plain. What they fear, however, is that the proposal will be linked with a lift on the export ban of Prudhoe Bay oil which is currently before Congress. The Clinton administration is understood to support lifting the ban, which would create an expanding market at a time of depleting reserves.</p>

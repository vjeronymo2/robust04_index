			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Talks venue adds Pounds 5m to EC presidency cost BRITAIN's six-month presidency of the European Community, starting on July 1, will cost up to Pounds 5.5m more as a result of the decision to hold the Heads of Government summit in Edinburgh rather than in London. The Foreign Office said yesterday that the meeting will cost Pounds 6.4 million to stage in Edinburgh, compared with an initial estimate of Pounds 900,000 for holding it in London. However, the Foreign Office added that even had the summit stayed in the capital that figure would have been higher. The decision by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to hold the EC leaders' summit in Edinburgh was taken in the run-up to the general election with the aim of reinforcing his adherence to the Union with Scotland. A large part of the extra cost for staging the meeting in the Scottish capital will come from renovating Holyroodhouse, where the talks will be held. The cost of different locations has been taken into account by the Foreign Office in deciding on venues for the other council meetings and informal talks, all of which are expected to be held in London. A further Pounds 3.4 million has been set aside to cover the costs of the six-month presidency.</p>

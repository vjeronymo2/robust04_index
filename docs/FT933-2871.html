			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Telefonica returns fire in data network battle TELEFONICA, the Spanish government-controlled telecoms group, has countered an incursion by British Telecommunications into its domestic market by launching its own data transmission network. The response to BT was signalled yesterday when Telefonica announced an agreement to supply voice and image services, as well as data, to Caja Madrid, Spain's second-ranked savings bank, which has a national network of 1,200 offices. BT fired the opening shot in the battle when it joined forces with Banco Santander, the big domestic banking group, to form a data transmission company aimed at capturing up to 20 per cent of the local market. Investment in the BT venture, which will build on Santander's Megared data company, will be around Pta80bn (Dollars 625m) spread over 10 years. Telefonica said its service would be delivered early next year. It was finalising negotiations for similar ventures with two large domestic groups. Yesterday's development shows that competition will be strong in Spain's recently deregulated data transmission market, and is indicative of the struggle awaiting competing groups when business in cellular telephones is liberalised next year.</p>

Who is to blame?    ['Asfur] Beyond the self-understood condemnation, the  violent event at the Ibrahimi Mosque (the Cave of the  Patriarchs) reflects the collective mentality of the settlers,  and not only the individual mentality of the perpetrators. The  settlers would like to ruin the process over which we have been  toiling so hard. They are not a threat merely to the  Palestinian people, they are a threat to all those who want  stability in the region.    Basically, if Israel wants stability -- and it does -- the  settlers are its enemies. The Israeli Government should  therefore act against its enemies, hard as it may be. They are  the ones who would like Israel to remain a ghetto in the region.  They are a barbaric mob whose activities should be terminated.    [Bekhor] How should Israel put an end to the settlers'  activities in the territories?    ['Asfur] I would place the emphasis on turning the settlers'  acts into criminal offenses -- a criminalization of acts. That  would mean that they should be tried genuinely, and not in the  forgiving manner prevalent until now. They should be shown for  the murderers and criminals that they really are. It is now up  to Yitzhaq Rabin to prove that he can act, and not just express  his regret and shame, as he told President Yasir 'Arafat.    [Bekhor] The Oslo agreement, the drafting of which you took  part in, acknowledges the existence of settlements during the  interim period. The agreement forbids you from arguing against  them remaining in place at this time, and yet senior PLO  officials are now calling for their removal.    ['Asfur] We agreed to the settlements remaining in place on  the assumption that the settlers would be human, cooperate with  the others, and that they would not pursue their activity which  is barbaric and even worse, like that of animals. In the  present situation, their presence has become a hazard and a  threat.    [Bekhor] Do you intend to reopen the settlement clause of  the Cairo agreement, as we have just heard?    ['Asfur] What happened in Hebron is a direct message to  Yitzhaq Rabin to reconsider his security stands. As of now, he  should think of more than the settlers' security; on the  contrary, he should think of protecting the Palestinians. They  are not the threat, they are themselves threatened.    Everything we have committed ourselves to is still firm and  abiding and valid as far as we are concerned, and we will remain  committed to it. But what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque will  be tantamount to an Israeli violation of signed commitments,  unless the matter is given genuine and serious attention.    [Bekhor] How will the Hebron massacre affect the  continuation of the talks with your organization?    ['Asfur] The peace process is not a transient thing that is  related to any one event. Anything can threaten the peace  process. What is needed is a substantive change in the Israelis'  political thinking.    [Bekhor] Why has the PLO called for international  intervention?    ['Asfur] Our demand for international protection is not new,  and the Oslo agreement validates it in a way. When we asked for  international protection, the Israelis thought we were making  slogans. Now they realize we meant it.    Who will protect the Palestinians? You? When a settler is  killed, all Israel is in turmoil. You contact us demanding  condemnation and even threatening us. But today, a condemnation  by Rabin is not enough.    [Bekhor] What will happen when Palestinian rule is set up in  the future? Will a similar event, in which Palestinians are  murdered, suffice to ruin everything, or alternatively, will one  Palestinian murderer killing settlers do it?    ['Asfur] The Government of Israel should start worrying now  about the possibility of Israelis being murdered. We will be  responsible for the security of Palestinians. In any event, if  the Israeli Government intends to protect Israelis by  perpetrating daily massacres against the Palestinian people,  then peace will never materialize.    [Bekhor] What is your version of the chain of events during  the Hebron massacre?    ['Asfur] The PLO has issued an official communique, and I  refer you to it. I do not believe the Israeli version. Do you  believe a single man could murder so many people, and without  any intervention of Israeli soldiers to boot? It was all  prearranged, and there was more than one killer.</p>

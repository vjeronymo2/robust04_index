			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Korea, Led by Comrade Kim Chong-il, Is Strong" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The world public is  struck with admiration at the wise guidance of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il who is leading the Korean people and the  building of Korean-style socialism to a victory.    E. Balanandan, Politburo member of the Central Committee of  the Communist Party of India (Marxist), had this to say:    No one on earth matches the strength of Korea that has  achieved a steel-like singlehearted unity of the leader, the  party and the people.    It is entirely thanks to the wise guidance of Comrade Kim  Chong-il with iron will and grit that the Korean people have  maintained independence even under the difficult and complicated  circumstances where their country remains still divided and they  are in direct confrontation with the U.S. imperialists.    Mozambican educational figure Salvador Miguel Fondo said:    The Korean people firmly believe in, hold in high esteem and  follow Comrade Kim Chong-il as their eternal mental pillar, a  symbol of happiness and future and a benefactor.    He has given all blessings to the Korean people.    He is the saviour of the Korean people.    The matchless grit, iron will and faith of Comrade Kim  Chong-il are unparalleled and infinite.    Korea, led by Comrade Kim Chong-il, is always strong.    Chester Ndoro, administrator of the Supreme Court of  Zimbabwe, noted:    Comrade Kim Chong-il has mastered the outstanding military  idea, theories and war tactics of President Kim Il-song in his  early years and has the virtues befitting an iron-willed  brilliant commander.    The anti-socialist campaign of the imperialists is being  intensified as never before, but the Korean people under the  wise guidance of General Kim Chong-il are vigorously advancing.    The Bulgarian paper TRIBUNA said:    Comrade Kim Chong-il who is possessed of rare wisdom and  iron  faith has frustrated and destroyed the anti-socialist, anti-DPRK  campaign of the imperialists and reactionaries by countering  their counterrevolutionary offensive with revolutionary  offensive, with his swift and bold strategy and tactics.    He firmly defended the dignity and sovereignty of the  country  and the nation by shattering to pieces the anti-DPRK moves of  the international reactionaries with his clairvoyant wisdom and  rare commanding art.</p>

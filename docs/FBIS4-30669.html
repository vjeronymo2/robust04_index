			<p>CSO     [Text] Mr. Wichit Suphinit, the governor of the Bank of  Thailand (BoT), discussed the efforts being made to promulgate a  money-laundering law. He said that the BoT agrees in principle  with the need to promulgate such a law. The BoT has discussed  the principles and framework of this law with Mr. Tharin  Nimmanmoen, the minister of finance. It is felt that such a law  will eventually be promulgated.    As for reports that the BoT has not taken a clear position  in  supporting the promulgation of this law because of the fear that  this will affect foreign investment in accord with the policy of  providing financial freedom, Mr. Wichit said that if this law is  implemented, it definitely won't affect foreign investment.    Mr. Wichit said that the BoT is now studying this in detail,  including the limitations, responsibilities, means of  implementation, and effects of this law. It has compiled data  and participated in seminars with other countries that are in  the process of implementing such laws. The results achieved by  countries, such as Singapore, that have already implemented such  a law are being considered, too.</p>

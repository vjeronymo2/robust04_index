			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  1308 GMT on 6 May carries a four-minute live report from  Dushanbe by Mayak correspondent Arisher Khadzhayev, who gives  details of the attempted assassination of Former Tajik Vice  President Narzullo Dustov, and the unrelated killings of six  people.    Khadzhayev begins by saying: "The following news spread  around Dushanbe this morning, although no one reported it  officially: Unknown persons, presumably two in number, made an  attempt yesterday evening on the life of Former Vice President  of Tajikistan Narzullo Dustov right outside his home. He was  wounded in the leg. His bodyguard was shot twice. They are now  both in hospital."    Khadzhayev further says: "A number of suspects" were  detained  and an investigation was underway. He then continues:    "Another piece of tragic news has come into the Mayak office  from Kofirnikhonskiy rayon outside Dushanbe. According to  preliminary information, six people were killed there last  night. No motive for the murders has yet been established."    The rest of Khadzhayev's report was devoted to the hardships  facing Tajikistan's elderly World War II veterans and local  charitable efforts to help them.</p>

R.G. Hollifield, deputy general manager of the Sdupac  company  [name as received], and nine Chinese heads of different kinds of  firms in the zone received the special awards here today.    Sdupac is the first joint venture the U.S. Dupont Company  has  funded in China. It went into production in November 1992.    The company mainly produces a weed killer called  "nongdeshi".    Since its founding it has paid close attention to abiding by  the local rules and regulations concerning safety, health and  environmental protection in both its production and sales.    Efforts have also been made to guarantee the quality of its  products. It sets aside 16 percent of its fixed assets for  environmental protection, including the planting of trees and  grass around the factory.    An official of the Pudong New Area said that one of the  goals  of the zone's development is to maintain a fine natural  environment. All the new structures of the Pudong New Area will  be extended into the next century. Sdupac has set a good  example for other foreign- funded companies in the zone in  protecting the environment.</p>

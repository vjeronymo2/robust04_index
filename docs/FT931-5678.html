			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow takes lead from firmer Treasuries Wall Street AFTER Tuesday's sharp advance, US share prices posted modest gains yesterday, supported by the latest rally in the bond market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 3.51 up at 3,404.04. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 1.36 at 449.26, while the American SE composite finished 3.40 higher at 413.47. The Nasdaq composite was the day's best performer, rising 6.20 to 683.92. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 277.4m shares and rises led declines by 1,264 to 626. Markets spent the morning digesting the gains earned on Tuesday, when a rush of late buying left the Dow 45 points ahead. Consequently, prices opened slightly lower as some investors took profits and others sat on the sidelines wait-ing for the markets' next move. Gradually, stocks recovered from their early losses, aided by another big rally in the US Treasury market, where technical buying and hopes for lower German interest rates pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to below 6.8 per cent for the first time ever. Low interest rates are good for equity investors, because they provide companies with cheap capital for restructuring or expansion, and cut the cost of mortgages and other borrowings for consumers. The latest drop in long-term interest rates boosted financial stocks, especially mortgage providers and banks, which usually see an increase in loan demand when borrowing costs fall. Federal National Mortgage Association climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 82, Countrywide Credit put on Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 34 7/8 , and Federal Home Loan Mortgage rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 49 3/8 before slipping back to end just Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars 48 1/4 . Among banking issues, Wells Fargo advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 103 3/8 and Chase Manhattan rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 32 5/8 . Citicorp added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 26 3/8 in spite of a downgrade from NatWest Securities, which believes that the bank's strong performance will begin to wane in the second half of this year and in 1994. General Cinema moved forward Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 35 5/8 after the company announced first-quarter net income of 40 cents a share, up from the 34 cents a share reported as operating income a year ago. Woolworth receded Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 28 3/4 after the big retailing group reported fourth-quarter after-tax profits of Dollars 165m. On the Nasdaq market, prices continued to recover from recent losses. ChemTrak rose a further Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 15, with investors continuing to pick up the stock following the announcement that the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the sale of the company's non-prescription home cholesterol test. Canada TORONTO rallied further in very heavy trading, boosted by a round of prime lending rate cuts and a rise in Canada's bond and currency markets. The TSE 300 index ended 21.0 higher at 3,467.2 in volume of 61.9m shares, up from Tuesday's 52.8m. Wednesday's volume included two block trades in TransCanada PipeLines totalling about 6m shares. Rises led falls by 393 to 296. Mitel said it will sell 22m common shares at CDollars 2.05 a share in Canada. Four entities advised by Schroder Ventures will purchase about 4.9m of the shares. The stock surged 22 cents to CDollars 2.24.</p>

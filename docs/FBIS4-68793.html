			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "The Speaker Moves Away From the </F> Bank"]    [Text] The surprise impertinence of Ivan Rybkin,  chairman of the State Duma, who signed the Social Accord Treaty  without having obtained the formal authorization of the house  for this, has been viewed in the Duma has an action that was,  albeit not incontestable, undoubtedly unusual. Some people were  immediately reminded of the incomparable somersaults of Ruslan  Imranovich.    Those who reacted with the most irritation to the speaker's  unusual move were the old associates of both Rybkin and  Khasbulatov. Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the communist faction,  for example, believes that the chairman of the house had  absolutely no right to sign anything on behalf of the Duma  without having put this question to the vote and without having  obtained a minimum of 50 percent of the vote. Even more annoyed  by the speaker's action was Sergey Baburin, leader of the  Russia's Way group of deputies. Rybkin's actions, according to  him, "are an unprecedented step destroying the idea of the  separation of powers and the idea of parliament as such."  Baburin made a firm promise to seek the speaker's resignation  after the May holidays.    Subsequently, in conversation with your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  observer, he specified: "We will raise the question of the style  of work of the chairman of the State Duma. To what extent is  Rybkin coping with his duties? He is in breach of the standing  orders of the Duma almost daily and he disregarded the opinion  of the majority of deputies in the appointment of the leader of  the administrative system. If Rybkin's political predilections  are gaining the ascendancy, he should give way to someone else."    Baburin will hardly succeed in moving Ivan Petrovich from  the  presidium to the stalls. Even his fellow thinker Viktor  Ilyukhin, who has repeatedly publicly rebuked the speaker for  his "born-again" character, acknowledges that the question of  the speaker's resignation could only be raised at this time as a  warning. It could be attempted, but success is unlikely.    This does not mean, of course, that the chairman of the  house  may feel totally secure. As many people believe, the opposition  will leave him in peace only until the end of the summer  vacation and that subsequently his Agrarian Party and Communist  Party comrades, who moved him into the speaker's chair, will try  to talk with him in party fashion. It is said that the  agrarians, who have not as yet in public treated the speaker of  the house badly, have already "worked" on him several times in a  small group. Rybkin's withdrawal from the directive bodies of  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation is a purposeful  sign also.    But while losing friends in his native camp, Ivan Petrovich  is, naturally, acquiring them in the other. The Russia's Choicer  Gleb Yakunin told your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer that he  welcomes the Baburinites' intention to initiate Rybkin's  resignation: "This gambit will fail, for all that, and Rybkin  will move even closer to us. And his name is such that he will  swim from one side to the other."    That Rybkin is "swimming" is, indeed, noticeable. But to  suppose after Gleb Yakunin that the speaker's route will lie  from one political bank to the other and will soon bring him to  Russia's Choice would be to suspect Ivan Petrovich of an  uncritical assimilation of the experience of Khasbulatov. He  will, most likely, not go to the bank: The smart fish searches  where the water is deeper. In his inauguration speech even the  newly elected speaker promised to create in the Duma a "strong  center" by "weakening the fringes." It is in this sense, most  likely, that we should perceive also Rybkin's "social  democratism"--as something central between the communists and  the democrats. And the movement from left to right could,  generally, be aimed in actual fact at upward ascent.    In this sense Ivan Petrovich is the direct opposite of  Ruslan  Imranovich. Having come to head a "freely elected parliament,"  the first in Russia's history, whose legitimacy is not disputed  even by Yeltsin, a parliament for whose breakup Yeltsin would  have no justification, Rybkin has not made the slightest attempt  to take advantage of this "historic opportunity." On the  contrary, he is effecting an evolution the opposite of  Khasbulatov's. The latter went from unquestioning support of the  president to uncompromising struggle against him, Rybkin, from  being of an opposition frame of mind to manifest and unmanifest  actions of support.    The most important of these actions as of the present has  been the conclusion of that Social Accord Treaty itself. Ivan  Petrovich did not, after all, simply append his signature,  running the risk of a violation of the Duma's standing orders,  and did not simply afford the president an opportunity to "seize  the initiative" of peacemaking. Throughout this campaign he had  right from the outset prepared for both the Duma and himself the  modest role of "No. 2" and ally of the opposite side. Back in  the morning of 23 February, when no one knew how the intrepid  venture of the amnesty and the Duma accord memorandum would end,  Rybkin let slip the words, not noticed at that time, that "we  need... a unique Russian social treaty or agreement with the  consolidating role of President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin." It  was in this direction that he steered, despite the resistance of  the parliamentary opposition--in the direction of the  "consolidating" or, simply put, principal role of the president  in what had primordially been a Duma undertaking.    And how dexterously the chairman stepped on the brakes on  the  painful question of the location of the lower house! And how  decisive he was in the appointment to the position of chairman  of the Duma administrative system of the "president's man"  Andrey Voykov, although they had quite recently, in  September-October, been on different sides of the barricades!    No, Rybkin is definitely not an avenger, an insurgent. He  is,  rather, a skillful integrator who has expertly written the Duma  into the system of power created since October and who is doing  everything to ensure that it "not protrude" from this system.  One of my Duma interlocutors observed philosophically: "Rybkin  is Kant's 'thing in itself.' He does not lean toward either one  or the other, working only for himself. He has no desire to  perish beneath the rubble of the Duma and wants only to  consolidate his place in the system. In today's hierarchy he is  somewhere around the Ryabov level and would like to rise higher."    If a place in the hierarchy is determined by the volume of  services rendered, it is still too soon to put Ivan Petrovich  above Ryabov but he has, after all, only just begun, and  everything lies ahead for him. And it is by no means a fact that  he will "swim" directly to the president's fish pond. He could  at the right moment turn off to the side also. Journalists are  noting that the speaker of the Duma has become a frequent guest  of the prime minister also. The prime minister is seen with  Rybkin far more often than with Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of  the Federation Council and a man of the "president's group."  They are, evidently, in some way of interest and use to one  another....</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Investors query the rewards of risk: Unease over fees for venture capital fund managers Nobody is surprised to hear that venture capital has offered rich returns to investors during the past two decades. But the scale of the rewards available to venture capital fund managers may come as a surprise to those used to the less generous world of conventional investment management. The difference between the two worlds surfaced recently when a rival drew attention to the guidelines governing fund managers' personal investments at CinVen, Europe's second-largest venture capital fund manager. CinVen, which is part of the coal board's in-house pension fund management, allows its fund managers to invest their own money in the highest-risk but also highest-yielding portion of each transaction, known as sweet equity, while eschewing the lower-risk but less lucrative loan stock which typically accompanies it. CinVen fund managers may not pick and choose among investments but must invest in each one and in the same proportion. The practice is not uncommon in the venture capital industry, but it illustrates why remuneration in the industry has become a touchy subject. In the early years of venture capital - a sector in which investments may take 10 to 12 years to realise their full value - investors had to make sure the fund manager stayed around long enough to see each project through to fruition. Out of that has grown an elaborate remuneration structure where fees greatly exceed those of traditional fund management. Typically, venture capital firms receive a basic management fee of 2 1/2 per cent compared with the 0.15 per cent to 0.25 per cent charged by conventional fund managers on the more run-of-the-mill business of managing balanced pooled funds. Because the fees are paid on funds raised rather than on funds invested, the effective rate on funds under management is closer to 4 1/2 per cent. Typically, pools leave some funds lying idle while suitable projects are being found. Additionally, the fund managers earn a cut, known as 'carried interest', typically 20 per cent of all profits once the investors have earned back their full investment. CinVen says that because it does not operate a pool, it is administratively impossible to offer its fund managers carried interest. So it has offered co-investment in sweet equity to attract and keep the best managers. Mr John McCrory, partner at Crossroads, a Birmingham-based firm which advises investors on venture capital projects, said venture capital fund managers 'need to have significant commercial and industrial experience plus deal construction and 'realisation' skills - the ability to sell a company for what it is worth.' Individuals with those skills are at a premium and fee structures arose to tie fund managers into projects for long periods. Now some investors are unhappy with these arrangements. 'We are pressing hard for the economics to work,' said Mr John Brakell, director of Postel Development Capital, the venture capital arm of the giant PosTel pension fund which has roughly Pounds 350m invested in that sector. 'The remuneration is probably larger than the achievements of the industry so far,' Mr Brakell said. 'I don't believe there is any other sector of the fund management industry which is as highly rewarded as the venture capital sector,' said Mr Maurice Anslow, editor of the UK and European Venture Capital Journals. 'Somebody in their early 30s can earn Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 80,000 per year and all they are doing is looking at business plans.' Why investors agreed to pay such generous fees to venture capital fund managers may be explained by looking at returns. No UK figures are available, but data from the US show that during the past 20 years, the average annual return has been 15 per cent with the top quartile earning 21.3 per cent. But over the past five years, the average returns have been 5.8 per cent although the highest performing quartile of funds have annual returns of 13.1 per cent. Increasingly, investors are insisting that fund managers' carried interest should not take effect until investors have earned a so-called hurdle rate of return, typically the same as on a low-risk government bond. Underlying the investors' changing view of remuneration for venture capital fund managers is the changing nature of the business. The recession has taken a harsh toll of start-up and developing companies and the bulk of venture capital investment opportunities now lie in management buy-outs of established companies or refinancing debts. The skills required in assessing such investments are much closer to traditional fund management than to the glamorous world of risky start-ups. 'These are not the sort of people who could run off and start up another Apple Computer,' says Mr McCrory. If these two activities are different, perhaps they should be rewarded differently? 'Investors are challenging remuneration structures because increasingly they see the difference between the two,' says Mr Andrew Sells, partner at venture capital managers Nash, Sells and Partners. There is much tinkering with fee structures, but wholesale revisions have yet to occur. Mr Brakell is hopeful: 'If the issue of remuneration gets enough publicity, then I think they will be forced to change it.'</p>

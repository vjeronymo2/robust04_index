			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Slow progress towards Serb withdrawal from besieged capital Western efforts to secure withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces from around the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo before the Nato deadline next Sunday are progressing in fits and starts, Judy Dempsey writes. For most of yesterday, Serb forces stopped handing over their heavy artillery pieces to United Nations military personnel. General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army, said the process had come to a halt. The UN forces had failed to take corresponding measures against the Bosnian forces, he added. But, late yesterday afternoon, UN officials said Serbian co-operation had re-started and they reported that 13 artillery pieces had been handed over. This is a trickle, however. Hundreds of long-range weapons remain to be surrendered if the 22-month siege of Sarajevo is to be lifted peacefully. As a measure of what UN negotiators around Sarajevo might have to face in coming days, Gen Milovanovic said the UN was failing to disarm, or neutralise the Bosnian (Moslem) infantry, which he said outnumbered Serb forces. The Bosnian infantry is lightly armed but increasingly organised. It has succeeded in defending the city, as well as in making territorial gains in central Bosnia. Gen Milovanovic told reporters at Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters: 'The UN was unable to secure control of the Moslem infantry. Therefore, I did not allow the withdrawal or control of the Serbian artillery.' The UN had asked the Serb forces to hand in about 20 heavy artillery pieces. The general had earlier told Politika, the Belgrade daily, his forces would be able to shoot down Nato aircraft. UN officials in Sarajevo are concerned that Bosnian forces might provoke the Serbs into breaking the ceasefire, and thus prevent the delivery of heavy weapons to UN control. Admiral Jeffrey Boorda, Nato's southern European commander, insisted that all heavy weapons should be withdrawn from around Sarajevo, adding that the Nato ultimatum was not directly exclusively at the Serbs. The British general commanding UN peacekeepers in Bosnia, Gen Sir Michael Rose, insisted demilitarisation of Sarajevo was still on track. He also said the Bosnians were trying to provoke the Serbs, implying that forces loyal to the Moslem-led government wanted to precipitate air strikes. Hina, Croatia's state-run news agency, yesterday reported heavy clashes between Bosnian and Croat forces around Vitez in central Bosnia.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NATO AIRCRAFT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aviano 12 F-16C fighters 8 F/A-18D fighters 12 O/A-10 attack aircraft 3 EC-130 EC-130 airborne battlefield control 4 AC-130 gunships Pisa and Sigonelli 10 KC-135 air-to-air refueling aircraft Saratoga (Adriatic Sea) 12 F/A-18C (dual role) 6 A-6C aircraft  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Giola De Colle 8 F-3 Tornadeo fighters 9 Jaguar attack aircraft Malpensa 2 K1 Tristar tankers Ark Royal (Adriatic Sea) 6 Sea Harriers (dual role)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- France  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cervia 10 Mirage 2000 fighters Istrana 5 Mirage F-1 reconnaissance aircraft 8 Jaguar attack aircraft Tapini (Sicily) 1 C-135 tanker 1 E-3F AEW Clemenceau (Adriatic Sea) 6 Super Etendard fighter bombers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The Netherlands  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Villafranca 8 F-16A fighters  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Spain  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Vicenza 1 Casa 212 support aircraft  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Turkey  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ghedi 10 F-16C fighters  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NATO AIR POWER: BASES IN ITALY AND THE ADRIATIC  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNPROFOR  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK: 2,300 Vitez, Tomislavgrad, Split, Gornji Vakuf and Zenica France: 3,200 Sarajevo and Bihac Spain: 1,800 Jablanica and Medugorge Ukraine: 620 Sarajevo and Zepa Egypt: 500 Sarajevo Canada: 880 Visoko and Srebrenica Nordic: 770 Tuzla Malaysia: Konjic and Jablanica  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

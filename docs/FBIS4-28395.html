			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Now, There Is No-Win Situation in the Country"] </F>   [Text] Marut Bunnak, in a last-ditch effort to find a  solution to the current political crisis threatening the  country's fledgling democracy, used his powers yesterday as  parliament president to unilaterally order the formation of an  ad hoc House committee to draft a new constitution and initiate  political reforms.    The 21-member committee, according to Marut, will be made up  of prominent members of society including academics, military  men and people from all walks of life as well as social critic  Prawet Wasi and Chalat Worachat who is currently staging a  fast-to-the-death on Parliament's doorstep.    The parliament president said if a good constitution was  drafted, it may be proposed to the House for deliberation. In  that event, MPs may ask the House to scrap Article 211 of the  Constitution which, although it allows amendments to the  charter, prohibits the drafting of a brand-new constitution.    Marut's intentions are indeed honourable, but as the saying  goes: the road to hell is often paved with good intentions gone  astray. And indeed we are now on that road.    When the parliament president informed Chalat yesterday of  the formation of the new committee, the hunger striker  outrightly rejected it and refused to end his fast. On  Wednesday, close to 5,000 people rallied behind Chalat to demand  a new constitution and speaker after speaker used the  opportunity to lambast the Chuan government for its hardline  stance against their demands.    The fact of the matter is that whatever draft constitution  the ad hoc House committee comes up with, it will not be binding  on any party and will be nothing more than just a draft. The  harsh reality is that the current joint House-Senate  Constitution Scrutinizing Committee, dominated by the  opposition, will not under any circumstances bow to proposals to  have Article 211 amended.    One of Chalat's core demands is that the Senate must be  denied any role whatsoever in drafting the new constitution.    If Article 211 is to be voted upon by Parliament, at the  suggestion of the joint house-senate committee, that would mean  opposition MPs would have to cut their ties with the  military-dominated Senate in their current joint alliance  against the Chuan coalition and vote with government MPs.    In March both the opposition and the Senate joined hands to  defeat the government-sponsored motions to make the Constitution  more democratic.    When Phalang Tham hardliner Chaiwat Sinsuwong said on  Wednesday night "devils are becoming angels and vice versa", he  perhaps should have thought twice. Leopards will never change  their spots no matter what.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai also cannot be absolved from  blame for the current political mess.    Early on Tuesday, the premier agreed that the five parties  in  the government would hammer out details to form a committee to  consider political reforms in the House. Though it wasn't what  Chalat actually demanded, the hunger striker appeared receptive  to the idea and indicated he would end his fast-to-the death  ritual. That seemed to be an amicable end to the conundrum.    But within 24 hours, Chuan did an about-face and retracted  his earlier statements saying a lone hunger striker could not be  allowed to hold the government to ransom and certain  "principles" had to be adhered to even if that meant dissolving  the House and calling a general election.    It now seems the rot has set in for the collapse of Chuan's  moribund government. An open revolt within the Phalang Tham  Party [PTP], a main coalition partner, is threatening to break  the party asunder. Nearly half of the PTP's 47 MPs have refused  to withdraw a motion submitted to the House to form a committee  to draft a new charter despite the Chuan coalition deciding  against the motion. The rebel MPs from the PTP's "temple  faction" are pressuring the party to break away from the  coalition.    Clearly there now seems to be a no-win situation for either  the Chuan coalition or the "Friends of Chalat" who are  threatening another mass rally outside Parliament.    Dissolution of the House is inevitable. Let the ballot box  decide everything.    A society which turns over the reins of government not by  street demonstrations but by the vote, does not allow any  political movement which is outside the electoral process to  gain power.    We want political reforms and stability, but the way things  are going now seems to indicate otherwise. The last thing the  country needs is another bloodbath.</p>

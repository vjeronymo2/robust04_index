			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Technology: A clean sweep for chips - Worth Watching As silicon chips get smaller, particles of dust on their surface can affect their performance. Washing the chips is difficult - traditional methods often leave tiny particles of dust behind. The cleaning process is also bad for the environment as it relies on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). A small company in Bethesda, Maryland, has come up with an alternative way to clean silicon wafers which could solve both problems. The Radiance process uses a laser to excite the particles so that they jump off the wafer's surface. A flow of gas then blows the particles away. Radiance intends to charge a royalty for the use of the process. Radiance: US, 301 654 0309.</p>

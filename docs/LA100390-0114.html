			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ST. GENEVIEVE FOOTBALL COACH CLEARS HIS PLAYERS IN BRAWL  </P> <P> St. Genevieve High Coach Mark Lovett will not take disciplinary action against  his players for their role in a brawl that ended Saturday's nonleague football  game against Salesian at Roosevelt High in East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Game officials stopped the contest with 4 minutes 15 seconds remaining and St.  Genevieve leading, 32-22, after a fight broke out on the St. Genevieve  sidelines.  </P> <P> St. Genevieve was accorded the victory.  </P> <P> According to Lovett and a Times reporter, the brawl began when Salesian  quarterback Carlos Alvarez threw a punch at a Valiant player on the St.  Genevieve sideline after being forced out of bounds short of a first down on  third and five.  </P> <P> Salesian players and spectators rushed toward the St. Genevieve sideline, but  coaches and police officers restored order within five minutes.  </P> <P> "It was more like a wrestling match than a fight," Lovett said. "It could have  turned into a real ugly situation, but nobody seemed to be hurt."  </P> <P> The stands were cleared and Salesian players were led from the field. St.  Genevieve playersremained on the field and were led to their buses 15 minutes  later.  </P> <P> Earlier, spectators threw ice and soda cans at St. Genevieve players going to  the locker room at halftime.  </P> <P> "From what I heard and from people I talked to, it isn't our fault," said  Lovett, in his second season.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, none of our players were the cause of it."  </P> <P> St. Genevieve and Salesian have a two-year contract that expires next year  after the teams meet in the Valley.  </P> <P> Lovett said the contract would not be renewed.  </P> <P> Salesian Coach Jerry Scott could not be reached for comment. St. Genevieve  suspended an assistant coach and two players after the Valiants took part in a  fight with Chaminade during a nonleague game last season.  </P> <P> "We're getting the reputation for being a fighting school," Lovett said. "We  haven't had a kid kicked out of a game this season and we're just trying to get  the program winning."  </P> <P> St. Genevieve, 1-9 last season, is 2-2. Bill Clark, a Southern Section  administrator, said the incident is under review, pending a report from each  school.  </P></p>

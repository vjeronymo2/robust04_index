			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Necker Opposes Excessive Export </F> Controls"]    [Text] Bonn, 6 Apr -- Tyll Necker, president of the  Federal Association of German Industry, has called on the  Federal Government to abandon the special rules concerning  export controls to preserve the competitiveness of German  enterprises. For over four years, Germany has had special rules  applicable to goods that can serve both a civilian and military  purpose (dual use). "Now is the time to adopt a uniform  Europewide control system," wrote Necker in a letter to Federal  Industry Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) [Free Democratic Party].  The Federal Government should display a readiness to reach  compromises on a European scale and abandon its "attitude of  isolation" that even made the adoption of the special rules  difficult. Necker called for uniform controls within the  European Union [EU] and the abolition of internal EU controls  that collide with the single-market principle. The practice of  issuing permits must also be brought into line with this  principle, he said.    Necker was replying to a letter he received from Rexrodt at  the beginning of March in which the FDP politician had suggested  changes to German subsidiary regulations. Rexrodt had said that  goods that do not appear on a control list and are destined for  use in conventional armaments might be made exportable to only a  small nucleus of countries. The same applies to services and  the transfer of sensitive knowledge. Necker described these  proposals as "merely the first step." On the other hand,  Rexrodt's announcement that there should be greater clarity and  faster decisions concerning the issue of export permits for  military goods has been welcomed by industry. During the  administrative removal of obstacles, regaining German  competitiveness and abolition of one-sided disadvantages to  competition must be the primary goal, Rexrodt wrote.</p>

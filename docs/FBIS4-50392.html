			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Xu Furui (6079 4395 3843) and Wu Ping (0702 </F> 1627)]    [Text] Stockholm, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Troedsson, speaker of  the parliament of the Kingdom of Sweden, met with Li Ruihuan,  visiting chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], in the  parliament building this afternoon. In a friendly atmosphere,  the two recalled the traditional friendship between China and  Sweden and expressed their hope that the two countries will  enjoy constantly growing bilateral relations.    Li Ruihuan said: Sino-Swedish exchanges date back to ancient  times, and the Chinese and Swedish people have always had  friendly feelings for each other. Sweden was one of the first  of the group of Western countries which established diplomatic  relations with New China, and the Chinese people have always  spoken highly of this fact. Since the establishment of  diplomatic relations, the two countries have attained remarkable  achievements in exchanges and cooperation in all fields. I hope  that bilateral relations will grow further on the basis of  equality and mutual benefit.    Li Ruihuan said: China has achieved fairly great economic  development over the last decade and more since it started the  policy of reform and opening up. However, it still has a long  way to go before it can truly become prosperous. "We are  striving for sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.  Therefore, we need a peaceful international environment and a  stable political and social order at home. While engaging in  economic construction, we attach great importance to  strengthening socialist democracy and the legal system." The  CPPCC is playing an increasingly important role in this regard.    Li Ruihuan briefed Troedsson on the CPPCC's functions,  status, and role.    Troedsson said: Swedish-Chinese relations have grown  constantly in recent years with a constant expansion of  bilateral cooperation, a constant increase in trade volume and  investment projects, and very active cultural exchanges. The  facts prove that cooperation and exchanges conform to the  fundamental interests of the people of both countries. She  said: Chairman Li Ruihuan is visiting Sweden at a time when the  Swedish people are becoming more and more interested in China.  This fact is no doubt very helpful to the mutual understanding  between the two peoples and to the mutually beneficial  cooperation between the two countries.    Troedsson gave a luncheon for Li Ruihuan.</p>

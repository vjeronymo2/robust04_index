			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sun Hung Kai profits rise 32% Sun Hung Kai Properties, one of Hong Kong's leading property developers and controlled by the Kwok family, yesterday posted a 32 per cent increase in net profits to HKDollars 8.8bn (USDollars 1.1bn) for the year to June 30. This is in line with market expectations and compares with HKDollars 6.7bn for the previous year. Earnings were struck on the back of HKDollars 15.2bn in sales, 48 per cent up on the previous year's HKDollars 10.3bn. Following Henderson Land, the developer which reported on Wednesday, Sun Hung Kai Properties is awarding a special cash bonus to mark the 'very satisfactory' results. Shareholders are to receive a bonus of 38 cents a share on top of the final dividend of HKDollars 1.01 a share. This gives a total annual payout of HKDollars 1.92 a share, 25 per cent up on the previous year (adjusted for a capitalisation issue). Earnings a share rose 24 per cent to HKDollars 3.91 from HKDollars 3.16. Sun Hung Kai Properties is the last of the colony's big developers to report, and its figures confirm the sector's ability to weather the storms of 1994, which have included government measures to cool property prices and rising interest rates. Mr Walter Kwok, chairman and chief executive, said that while residential property prices had tumbled between 15 per cent and 20 per cent from the highs in the first quarter of the year, end-users were gradually returning to the market and prices were stabil-ising. 'Strong demand for housing is expected to continue as a result of sustainable growth in household income. The fundamental factors underpinning the residential market remain unchanged, though interest rate movements need to be monitored,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statements to the press by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, </F> True Path Party leader, and by Deputy Prime Minister Murat  Karayalcin, Social Democratic Populist Party leader, at the  residence of the prime minister in Ankara on 3 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Ciller] As you all know, elections were held a  week ago. They were local elections, not general elections.  However, as we, the coalition partners, have stated before,  they were peaceful elections where everyone was able to express  his free will everywhere. We are very pleased about that.  Contrary to expectations, the elections were held in a peaceful  atmosphere in the west, the east, the north, and the south.    The largest party of the Right and the largest party of the  Left emerged as just that from these elections. The two parties  have assessed the results and decided on what to do in the  future. We said that the True Path Party [TPP], the major  partner of the coalition, would not disband the coalition.  Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] has  authorized Mr. Karayalcin to decide on the future of the  coalition. The appropriate bodies of the TPP authorized me  today in the same way. With this authority vested in us, Mr.  Karayalcin and I have decided to continue with the coalition.  We will convene the Council of Ministers this evening.    The country is faced with very important problems. We will  tackle these problems together. We will tackle them with  confidence and support. We take the responsibility to solve all  the problems facing the country. Whatever these problems are,  the country has a government, a government whose two partners  support each other. This government will continue on its path  with confidence. This is an extremely important development for  the stability of the country. Now is the time to find solutions  to the problems before us. It is not a time to wait. With this  understanding, the Council of Ministers will discuss the most  urgent problems this evening. We will tackle all the issues  together. These issues will be reviewed in accordance with the  needs of the country.    Meanwhile, let me say one thing: Naturally, local  administrations are local administrations. Local  administrations carry out municipal duties such as building  roads, running buses, collecting garbage and so on. Other than  that, we are the guarantee that a state based on law functions  everywhere in the same way. We are the guarantee of the secular  Turkish Republic. We are the guarantee that principles of law  are implemented everywhere in the same way. I ask our people to  be confident and relaxed in this respect.    Meanwhile, we have received reports that certain injustices  occurred, that there were cases of fraud, in the elections. The  concerned authorities are looking into these reports. The  government is not directly responsible for this, but it will  make sure that the decisions of the concerned authorities are  implemented. Voting concerns the honor of the state. We will  follow this issue.    We take responsibility for every problem facing the country.  We will solve them all. We all know that a coalition emerged  from the previous elections, from the 1991 elections. This  coalition will continue and it will solve the country's  problems. I want and ask our people to be relaxed and confident  about this.    [Karayalcin] The honorable prime minister has made the  necessary announcement. I do not have much to add. Keeping in  mind past implementation and assessing results, the government  will tackle the problems facing the country with renewed elan,  with renewed enthusiasm, and with renewed determination. We are  certainly not averse to tackling Turkey's problems. We will  solve them. A new era has now begun. I hope the decisions we  will implement will bring beneficial results for our country,  our nation, and our working people. I sincerely believe that  this will be so.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Rolls-Royce management changes named at bitter AGM SIR RALPH Robins, Rolls-Royce chief executive, is to succeed Lord Tombs at the end of September as executive chairman of the UK aero-engine and industrial power group. The announcement at the company's annual meeting was overshadowed by bitter interventions from former employees and shareholders over the group's handling of its voluntary redundancy scheme. Lord Tombs, 68, also said Mr Terry Harrison, head of the company's industrial power activities and former chairman of Northern Engineering Industries (NEI) which Rolls-Royce took over in 1989, will become the new chief executive. Sir Ralph, who has spent his entire working life with the company, had long been regarded as the natural successor to Lord Tombs. But company directors faced embarrassment yesterday when small shareholders at the meeting voted against a resolution to enable directors to amend the company's executive share option scheme. The proposal, to allow the granting of options at a price 15 per cent below the current market value of Rolls-Royce shares, will now be put to a ballot. The vote against the share option scheme reflected the feeling among many former employees and shareholders over the redundancy scheme and the company's approach to job cuts. Rolls-Royce cut about 5,000 jobs last year and has announced a further 3,000 job reductions this year to reduce costs and counter the slowdown in the commercial engine market and the decline in military business. Employees, who accepted the company's initial voluntary redundancy package last year, said they had lost out because Rolls-Royce introduced a more attractive package last July. Sir Ralph acknowledged the reaction on the job issue yesterday had been stronger than expected but said the company had to cope with the reduction in defence business and the short-term problems in the competitive civil engine sector. He also said most Rolls-Royce directors have not had a pay increase for the past 18 months. Lord Tombs took a pay cut to Pounds 156,000 last year from Pounds 180,000 the year before. Lord Tombs is stepping down after seven years as chairman during which he successfully piloted the company through privatisation in 1987, expanded the range and market share of its commercial aero-engine business, and negotiated the merger with NEI.</p>

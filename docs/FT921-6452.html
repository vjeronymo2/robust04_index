			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Supergun report 'before election' - Trade And Industry Committee LABOUR protested yesterday that the government was blocking a Commons' investigation into the Iraqi supergun affair by telling witnesses they need not answer all MPs questions. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, wrote to the prime minister complaining about the advice given to some witnesses by the office of Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons. Earlier, the cross-party trade and industry committee promised to report its findings on the affair ahead of the general election. Mr Kenneth Warren, Tory chairman of the committee, announced its decision after some members had voiced fears that they would be unable to publish their findings because of a lack of parliamentary time. The committee, which has been investigating the affair for several months, plans to publish a report before the dissolution of parliament. Mr Alan Clark, the defence minister, and Mr Tim Sainsbury, the trade minister are due to give evidence at the committee's final session today. Downing Street Officials rejected Mr Brown's comments, saying some witnesses had asked for guidance but had not been told what to do. The committee accused Customs and Excise yesterday of hiding behind advice by Sir Patrick Mayhew, attorney-general, when it refused to discuss evidence in the supergun case. Sir Patrick told the committee that his endorsement of the decision was made under a convention observed with Customs and Excise although it was not under his jurisdiction. He denied that Customs was hiding behind his advice. Sir Brian Unwin, Customs and Excise chairman, confirmed it was his decision to drop prosecutions in the case after the attorney-general had been consulted. When pressed by MPs he refused to give details about evidence that led to the decision.</p>

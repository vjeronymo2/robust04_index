			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Brixton Estate Yesterday's issue from Brixton Estate is a measure of how, after years of horrendous underperformance, speculative froth is returning to the quoted property market. Shares in the leading companies are above net asset values with investors developing a voracious appetite for new paper. Before yesterday's issue Brixton Estate's shares were trading at a premium of 7 per cent to stated net assets. The deeply-discounted two-for-five rights issue will dilute future net asset values, but the company was rewarded by a 6 per cent rise in its share price. Such a response is only likely to stimulate a string of similar fund-raising exercises. Shareholders should doubt the wisdom of de-gearing at this stage of the cycle. But in Brixton's case its well-regarded management intends to sink the full Pounds 101m proceeds into property. It is gambling that shareholders will be prepared to forgo some of the potential increase in net asset value in return for better prospects for income growth. With gearing of 114 per cent, the company had little flexibility to borrow more itself. Brixton promises to gear up again from its broader equity base if the opportunities emerge. If not, it will certainly be hugely embarrassed. The more money is sunk into property, the more certain the recovery in values becomes. But if investors really do believe the market has turned, there is now far better value in buying property direct.</p>

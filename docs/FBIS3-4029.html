			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By M.J. Tzou and Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Geneva, March 23 (CNA) -- Representatives from  Chile and New Zealand Wednesday [23 March] expressed strong  support for Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    They also hoped that Taiwan's GATT entry would help boost  bilateral trade ties, Huang Yen-chao, director-general of the  Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) told reporters here. Huang is in  Geneva for a series of bilateral tariff negotiations with GATT  members.    Ernesto Tironi Barrios, Chile's chief negotiator, said he  supported early GATT entry for Taiwan based on Taiwan's current  economic and trade situation and its efforts to speed up tariff  and taxation reforms.    Barrios, who asked Taiwan to cut import duties on 27  agricultural and 37 industrial products, reportedly was pleased  as most of his requests met with favorable responses from the  Taiwan delegates.    Chile is a major exporter of apples, pears, peaches and  brass.    Chief New Zealand negotiator Alastair Bisley, who issued a  list of 300 items for tariff reductions, also asked Taiwan to  levy a single tax on imported beef and eliminate its current  multi-tier system.    Both Barrios and Bisley expressed concern that Taiwan is  still protecting its agricultural sector by imposing quantity  controls and area restrictions on farm imports.    Although Taiwan has pledged to adhere to GATT's fair-trade  practices and applied to join GATT as a developed country,  Huang, leader of the Taiwan delegation, noted that some of  Taiwan's industries are not fully developed and still require  some protection.    "We hope that Taiwan's non-tariff trade barriers can be  transferred into tariffication in seven years which complies  with the free trade spirit of the Uruguay Round trade accord,"  Huang told his counterpart negotiators.    Besides Chile and New Zealand, Taiwan officials have  negotiated with representatives from Hungary and South Africa  since Monday.    Both Hungary and South Africa said Taiwan should eliminate  non-tariff trade barriers like regional restrictions and  quantity controls. They added that Taiwan's prohibition on the  import of red beans, green beans and animal internal organs is  not acceptable.    Taiwan negotiators will meet with officials from Turkey and  Australia Thursday and Friday for more bilateral tariff talks.    According to Huang, 21 countries have requested  tariff-reduction negotiations with Taiwan. Results of these  talks will be key to Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based  world trade body.    Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer under the name  of "the Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu"  in September 1992, is expected to become a full member by the  end of this year.</p>

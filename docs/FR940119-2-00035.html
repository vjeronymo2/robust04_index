Northwest used the Mustang Line to transport residue gas from the outlet of the Conoco-Mustang Processing Plant to WNG's 16-inch Cement Line; however, Northwest's gas purchase contracts with Conoco, Inc. and NGL Production Company have expired. Northwest contends that the Mustang Line is located several hundred miles from its mainline transmission system and uneconomical to continue to own and operate. WNG could operate the Mustang Line as part of its system and provide shippers with access at the Conoco-Mustang Plant without incurring the additional expense of contracting with Northwest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Northwest proposes to abandon the Mustang Line by a dividend at its net book value <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to The Williams Companies (TWC), the corporate parent of both Northwest and WNG, and TWC would make an immediate capital contribution to WNG. TWC would not hold title to the Mustang Line other than as necessary to effectuate the transfer. Northwest states that WNG would operate the Mustang Line under its blank certificate authorization pursuant to subpart F of part 157 of the Commission's Regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Northwest states that the net book value of the Mustang Line, as of October 31, 1993, was $732,844 with an associated deferred tax liability of $223,770. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  January 31, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 8.

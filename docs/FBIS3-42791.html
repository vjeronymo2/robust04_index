			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. Rakhmanin, editor of the "13 Tverskaya </F> Street" department, under the rubric "Commentary of the Week":  "One in Three Get Aid From the Mayoralty"]    [Text] I will begin with a rather interesting, in my  opinion, forecast for Muscovites' standard of living in the  coming year. It was issued by the economic policy department of  the Government of Moscow at the budget hearings recently held by  the deputies in the city Duma. According to the latest  estimates, the average monthly wage will increase 6.5-fold. And  prices--sevenfold. At the same time, the amount of money  channeled by the mayoralty into social protection of low-income  residents will increase 14.8-fold, and its share in the city  budget will increase 2.6-2.8-fold. This money will enable the  city to provide aid to 3.6 million Muscovites--one-third of the  capital city's population. No sharp decline in Muscovites'  standard of living is envisaged for 1994.    I personally never counted myself as an optimist. What is  considered a "sharp decline in the standard of living"? And does  it matter anyway whether it drops sharply or gradually but  steadily? All in all, we have had a considerable increase in the  number of skeptics over the past few years. Few now believe in  promising assurances "a la Gorbachev" that in a half a year (a  year, two years...) life will get better. No matter what  forecasts politicians and economists come up with, every month  we determine rather precisely our standard of living by the  amount of cash left in our wallet on the eve of receiving a  long-awaited paycheck or pension. Like the absolute majority of  Muscovites, I am not terribly confident in tomorrow. What I do  not doubt, however, is that no matter what comes, Luzhkov will  keep his word and will find the money for social needs.    I have seen more than once at city government meetings how,  in response to eternal laments of the capital city's Minister of  Finance Yu. Korostelev that there is no available money in the  budget and no place to get it, the mayor has said unambiguously:  "Money for social aid must be found." Every day I sort out new  mail (and the newspaper is getting increasingly more letters,  for which we are grateful to our readers). Well, there is a lot  of criticism addressed at Luzhkov's team--all sorts of  criticism, sometimes fair and sometimes not quite. The  government and its local representatives ought to be criticized  for still terrible roads (despite titanic efforts), mud and  trash in the streets, occasional lapses in central heating, and  leaking roofs. But I have never seen a letter in which  Muscovites berate the mayor for lack of attention to social  programs.    In this respect Moscow is far ahead of the rest of Russia. I  have in front of me a document signed by Yu. Luzhkov on 28  December--a comprehensive program of social protection measures  for certain categories of Moscow residents in 1994 and a report  on the results of the analogous program in 1993, which  considerably expanded and strengthened social guarantees set at  the federal level.    Last year, 61.7 billion rubles [R] was spent on financing  the  city's social program from the budget fund for social  protection. The 1994 budget envisages financing of expenditures  on the implementation of measures of social protection of the  population taking into account their indexation. The Moscow City  Statistics Administration will now conduct a monthly calculation  of the subsistence minimum in keeping with the decision of the  trilateral commission of the Government of Moscow, the  Confederation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the  Moscow Trade Unions Federation. In the near future, proposals  will be finalized on improvements in the system of supplements  to pensions of nonworking pensioners and child allowances. The  prefectures have been instructed to adopt within a month  regional programs of social protection of the population using  the districts' financial resources.    In keeping with the program signed by the mayor, the Moscow  Government is increasing subsidies for school lunches and food  for low-income pensioners, the mayoralty's personal stipends to  students, and subsidies to students in acute need. Subsidies for  children who do not attend preschool facilities are being  increased to 25 percent of minimum wage (which currently amounts  to R3,655); supplemental pay to child allowances for single  mothers, families with many children, and nonworking mothers who  receive benefits from social security organs; and extra pay for  food products for children under the age of three. An newborn  child allowance is being increased to double the minimum wage.  In addition, a number of measures of social protection envisaged  by republic legislation and financed out of the Moscow budget,  naturally, remain in effect. We plan to look at individual parts  and provisions of this comprehensive program in the next few  issues.</p>

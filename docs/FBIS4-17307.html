			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Belousov] </F>   [Text] Murmansk April 21 TASS -- "If Russia loses her naval  power, she will lose her status as a great power as well. Our  navy will, as earlier, serve as the watch-dog of the country",  first deputy commander-in-chief of Russia's Navy Admiral Igor  Kasatonov said on Thursday.    The admiral, who arrived in Murmansk to participate in the  northern fleet's military maneuvers, heads the state commission  on the preparation for the 300-year anniversary of the Russian  fleet. He emphasised that the Russian fleet was created by the  whole country, and so the celebration of its anniversary will be  not a departmental, but a nation-wide event.    Speaking about the military readiness of the country's naval  forces, Admiral Kasatonov said, "the results of the first stage  of battle training are now being analyzed on all the fleets. On  the whole, I am satisfied with them. But there are some things  which need to be worked upon. In particular, we need to give  our sailors more time on the open sea. I think we will be able  to correct that problem during the summer", he said.</p>

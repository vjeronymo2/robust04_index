			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clinton invites Major to visit US MR JOHN Major will have an early chance to air any differences between the UK and the new US administration when later this month he becomes the first European leader to visit President Bill Clinton, Ralph Atkins writes. The prime minister will be in Washington on February 24 and is expected to talk about a range of international issues, although no agenda has yet been drafted. Areas of contention could include: Bosnia, where the US has been pushing harder for greater military involvement; world trade; and general relations between the two countries. Mr Major will be anxious for his relationship with President Clinton to be seen as friendly and the White House's decision to invite him ahead of other European Community leader is a boost. Conservative party links with the Republican party have threatened to sour relations. Tory central office sent advisers to help President Bush during the US elections and the Home Office searched files to see if President Clinton applied for UK citizenship. More recently, the UK government has also been, at best, lukewarm about suggestions raised in Washington for reform of the United Nations' security council, of which Britain is a member.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / City looks to defend markets LEADING City institutions were yesterday considering making a forthright statement in defence of unrestricted foreign exchange markets, because of concerns that the markets and dealers are being blamed for the inability of the UK government to reduce interest rates. The Bank of England has been approached to join the Corporation of London and leading banks in making a public statement that unrestricted flows of capital in foreign exchange markets are positive for the economy. 'Politicians are representing the free markets as a bad thing', said an executive involved in the discussions. 'We fear that the general public blames the City for the country's economic problems.' The mood among City dealers and executives over the past few weeks of sharp fluctuations in currency markets - prompting huge rises in interest rates in Italy and Sweden - has become very defensive. There are widespread fears that the exchange volatility and the government's inability to cut interest rates could lead to pressure for new regulations to be introduced into foreign exchange markets. City institutions want to make it clear it is not their fault that sterling is under pressure. However, they are unclear how to say this without by implication blaming the government, which they are reluctant to do. The Bank of England has not decided whether it will get involved in making any such defence of free markets. City institutions are also organising a related campaign to reassert the strength of Europe's financial markets. They fear that international financial institutions may reduce their investments in Europe if the French vote against the Maastricht agreement on Sunday. The Corporation of London and UK banks want to stress the City will stay one of the world's three most important financial centres, whatever the vote.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aris R. Ilagan] </F>   [Text] Several armed regulars of the New People's Army  (NPA) who have availed of the government's amnesty program have  questioned the authority of communist leaders Jose Ma. Sison and  Luis Jalandoni, both living in exile in the Netherlands, in  preventing members of the local communist movement from getting  involved in the government's ongoing peace process.    This was disclosed yesterday by Sen. Rodolfo Biazon, a  member  of the government peace panel, who conducted a dialogue with  several rebel returnees in Tuguegarao, Cagayan.    Biazon said that the NPA leaders who attended the dialogue  have criticized Sison and Jalandoni for issuing statements in  behalf of the entire communist movement. They stressed that the  two had lost the moral authority to lead them because of their  prolonged absence in the country.    "We are tired of these leaders (Sison and Jalandoni) who  always speak for us," Biazon quoted the NPA guerrillas in  Tuguegarao as saying.    Biazon said the local NPA group from Naguilian, Isabela, and  Gattaran, Cagayan, had completely detached themselves from the  influence of the Netherlands-based communist leaders.    In their previous pronouncements, Sison and Jalandoni have  rejected President Ramos' Amnesty Proclamation No. 347 for  insurgents as they questioned the government's sincerity in its  reconciliatory moves with various rebel groups.    Biazon said that a big number of local NPA guerrillas in  Cagayan "are very much interested in the peace process but many  are still worried about the pending court cases against them."    Similar dialogues were conducted between government  representatives led by Biazon and NPA surrenderees in Iligan and  Davao City during the past few days.    Meanwhile, Biazon called for an investigation of the alleged  arbitrary arrest of rebel returnee, identified as Domingo  Tagade, in Isabela by local police forces.    Tagade, who surrendered to the government in 1989 and later  applied for amnesty, was charged with rebellion in Isabela.    Biazon requested the Philippine National Police (PNP) to  submit a formal report regarding the arrest which, he claimed,  is not in accordance with the government's peace program with  the communists.    "Any pending court cases against rebel returnees who came  out  and surrendered should be suspended pending the outcome of the  congressional hearings on the amnesty proclamations," he  stressed.</p>

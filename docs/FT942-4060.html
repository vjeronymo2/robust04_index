			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: CU retreats News that Commercial Union was to pay Pounds 1.46bn for French insurer Groupe Victoire came towards the end of the session, although the shares ticked off rapidly in the trading time left, closing 5 off at 533p. Further losses in the region of 20 to 25 are likely when the market opens on Monday, according to sector specialists. There were no doubts about the strategic value of the deal, which had been strongly rumoured all week, but the price was a disappointment; although not excessively expensive, there had been hopes CU would have a free run after other potential bidders dropped out of the race. Analysts were also doubtful about the financing - a combination of debt and around Pounds 500m of equity - particularly after last year's Pounds 430m rights issue. The comment that there would be a dilutive effect on earnings in the first full year did not help. GRE, a possible switch for those looking to move out of CU, was up 8 at 178p. Smith New Court, the securities house, was responsible for a bought deal in Royal Bank of Scotland shares, buying 14m shares, 1.9 per cent of the issued capital, at 402p and placing them with institutions at 406p. RBOS closed a penny off at 414p with turnover at 28m. J Sainsbury, Britain's biggest food retailer, at a presentation at stockbroker SG Warburg, was reportedly giving a reassuring message of improving margin growth, cost squeezing and signs of food price inflation creeping back. Mr Andrew Kasoulis at Warburg said: 'The sector's outperformed since the end of January and I don't think it will stop here. The big superstore operators now have a formidable format.' As in recent sessions, there was evidence of some big institutional buying, with Sainsbury advancing 3 to 395p, Tesco 10 1/2 to 227 1/2 p, Argyll 6 1/2 to 247 1/2 p and Kwik Save 10 to 579p. Good passenger figures excited interest in BAA and its price improved 21 to 950p. P&amp;O retreated 6 to 652p as the chairman of Stena described the effect of the price war between the two ferry operators as 'devastating'. News that British Land had taken a 6.9 per cent stake in Bredero Properties, which is the subject of a recommended buy out by its associate company Slough Estates, sent Bredero shares sharply forward on hopes of a higher offer being solicited. The shares ended up 2 1/2 at 13p, with British Land up 2 at 391p and Slough off a penny at 240p. Indications that there will be an early release for the consultation paper on the rate of return that British Gas will be allowed to earn from its transportation assets fuelled activity in the shares. The price moved up 15 to 293 1/2 p with a hefty 17m shares traded. Demand for Wellcome continued, up 20 1/2 on the day to 594 1/2 p, after Thursday's 22p rise. Volumes were higher than average at 2.5m, with interest from the US on the back of recent buy notes. Granada Group also saw another day's strong performance, bolstered by a buy note from Smith New Court. The broker said that the 'exceptionally strong cash generation throughout the group gives substantial scope for further expansion.' It added that a Pounds 500m valuation of its 13.5 per cent stake in BSkyB was worth an extra 100p a share. Granada shares gained 9 to 525p.</p>

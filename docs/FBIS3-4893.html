			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday played  down Taiwan's threat to halt importing Thai labour, saying  Thailand has been seriously tackling the problems of illegal  Thai workers in that country.    On Sunday the Taiwanese Council of Labour Affairs chairman  accused Bangkok of being insincere on solving the problem of  Thai workers in Taiwan and warned that his country would halt  the labour import from Thailand.    Prasong said the Foreign Ministry was ready to help deal  with  the council's complaints but insisted that the Thai Public and  Social Welfare Ministry was the responsible agency. "I don't  know why it [the issue] has been brought up just now. The  problem has long existed. Why are they talking about it now?''  he said.    Chao Shou-po, chairman of the Council of Labour Affairs,  warned Thailand that Taipei might have to suspend the import of  Thai workers unless Bangkok tackles problems such as exorbitant  commissions charged by Thai job placement agencies. Chao blamed  the Thai government for "lacking application" in curbing such  unfair practices. His attack was released just over a week  after a three day-to Thailand trip by Taiwanese President Lee  Teng-hui.    Prasong said if Thai workers illegally entered Taiwan they  have broken the law and should be penalized accordingly. "We  cannot blame a country which takes legal action against those  who illegally enter its territory," Prasong said.    Job Replacement Department Director Sinchai Riantrakul,  meanwhile, said that Thailand had done its best to solve the  problem. He said the department had issued warnings in early  February to at least 47 employment agencies to strictly comply  wlth Thai law. He added that the department would take legal  action against any company known to have collected exorbitant  fees from Thai workers. "Yesterday was the deadline for job  recruitment agencies to abide by the laws," he said.    Thai workers have to pay Bt80,000 to a job replacement  agency  before they are able to work in Taiwan.    Sinchai denied a report that there were 2,500 Thai workers  illegally working in Taiwan, adding that he thought the flow of  illegal workers to the island state was decreasing. He also said  he did not how many job placement firms had contravened the law.  Commenting on exorbitant fees, he said Taiwanese employment  agencies were also to blame over the practice and Taiwan should  help tackle the problem. "They [Taiwanese brokers] demand  Bt20,000-Bt30,000 for each worker," he said.</p>

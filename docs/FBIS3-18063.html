During the press conference which capped his visit,  Spadolini  observed "there was the aim to reduce the number of parties, but  the decision to leave a twenty-five percent share of seats to be  elected by the proportional system will not simplify the  position of parties, at least in the next parliament."    Nevertheless, the Senate speaker added, the winner-take-all  constituencies will increase contact between the elected and the  electors and a candidate will more likely be judged by his  record, experience and political clout.    Turning his attention to the political kickbacks scandal in  Italy, Spadolini underscored how "this painful affair has shown  how Italian democracy has the strength to cleanse the errors  made over past years."    The moral question, he added, "...has returned to the center  of the political life. I had made it the basis of my government  twelve years ago. I can say now that I was long-sighted and I  am sure that it will mark the political life in the coming  years."</p>

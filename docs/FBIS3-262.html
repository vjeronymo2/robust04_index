NPKF spokesman Capt Johan Loots said on Thursday  members of the TEC Management Council would visit the De Brug  training camp, near Bloemfontein, on Monday to present the  force's commander Maj-Gen Gabriel Ramushwana with a solution to  the problem.    Capt Loots said the majority -- 98 per cent -- of the  trainees who went on strike on Monday had returned to work,  following a visit to the camp by TEC representatives.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Germany Foreign exchange markets had been primed to expect so little from yesterday's German money market repurchase operation that a 7 basis point cut in the rate to 8.5 per cent actually came as something of a relief. Yet it is a sign of the Bundesbank's extraordinary reluctance to relax monetary policy that it has not allowed the money markets to adjust fully even to last week's quarter point cut in the discount rate. On the surface, that looks a singularly hard-hearted reaction to the latest government report, which gloomily forecasts a decline of up to 1 per cent in economic output this year. So what is holding the Bundesbank back? Perhaps it is partly the conviction that the downturn in the economy as a whole is not as bad as the high-profile troubles in manufacturing suggest. Perhaps, too, it believes that only a credible anti-inflation policy will produce the low long-term interest rates needed to finance the budget deficit at reasonable cost. The bank must also be worried that lower short-term interest rates could spark a surge in the dollar, pushing up prices at home. If the Bundesbank is clinging to these beliefs in the face of a such a sharp rise in unemployment, it is difficult to see it letting them fade entirely into oblivion as soon as the money supply numbers improve. There is little ground to believe that rate cuts will be as aggressive as in 1982-83 when the discount rate was cut by 3.5 points in the space of six months. Sooner or later the exchange markets will cease to be distracted by tiny rate cuts and strains in the ERM will reappear with a vengeance. If that leads to the break-up of the system, other European economies will be spared the worst of what promises to be a pretty nasty recession. Either way it hardly bodes well for Germany itself.</p>

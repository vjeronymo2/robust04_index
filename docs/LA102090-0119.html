			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NUTS AND BOLTS;  </P> <P> IS JUNIOR A FUTURE WOLFGANG PUCK?  </P> <P> My first experience with food preparation involved a free-form recipe that  included, among other things, Worcestershire sauce, flour, Tabasco, sugar,  Delaware Punch, ketchup, cracker crumbs, random spices and the entrails of a  couple of halibut that a friend and I had pulled out of Newport Harbor that  morning. We were both 9. We made a vast mess in the kitchen of my friend's  mother and were forced to bury our creation in the back yard so it couldn't  hurt the dog.  </P> <P> From that time until the year I graduated from college -- and decided that  there must be forms of food other than those with a "Mc" in front of them --  the kitchen was the Forbidden Zone and cooking was alchemy. My haute cuisine  was Cocoa Puffs. My preparation for life did not include lessons in pasta, the  all-purpose bachelor chow.  </P> <P> But Pamela Sheldon says it could have. A food writer, teacher and consultant  who lives in Long Beach, Sheldon said it's possible, even easy, to teach a  5-year-old not only how to make pasta from scratch, but how to actually knock  together a decent meal.  </P> <P> "Kids are very natural in the kitchen," said Sheldon, who taught children's  cooking classes at Ma Cuisine when that store was in Fashion Island. "It may  sound scary, but actually it's one of the easiest things to do with a child  because food is so motivating. At the end of the lesson, you get to eat  something really good. And in the long run, it'll save time for you because the  kids can be more responsible and independent. They can fix their own snacks."  </P> <P> The snacks, however, as well as actual entrees, shouldn't involve "cooking  down" to the kids, Sheldon said.  </P> <P> "I like to do real food with kids," she said. "I don't like to make it up.  Taking canned biscuits and spreading tomato paste and cheese on them and  calling it pizza isn't real food. Kids can learn how to handle making real  food. It may not be a pizza recipe from Spago, but you can make a pizza using  real pizza ingredients. That's always one of the kids' favorites."  </P> <P> Even a 5-year-old, she said, can whip up a batch of cookies.  </P> <P> "Cookies are a good place to start," Sheldon advised. "They can do the stirring  and put the ingredients together. And they get to watch what happens when it  all goes into the oven. It also helps them learn math skills when they're  measuring, they can learn about telling time by watching the clock and about  reading when they're looking at recipes. They're developing organizational  skills."  </P> <P> Supervision, of course, is paramount. Otherwise you could end up with fish  entrail gazpacho and a nervous dog or, worse, a cut or burn to treat. Simple  common sense, Sheldon said, can anticipate most problems.  </P> <P> For instance, she said, don't expect a 5-year-old kid to grasp the nuances of  flipping sizzling food in a saute pan. Junior's going to need a few more motor  skills before he can look like a Cordon Bleu grad. So, if you've got a heavy  pot full of hot stew in the oven, you take it out.  </P> <P> But, Sheldon suggests, while you're teaching your child that knives are sharp  and stoves are hot and a big mess is only a flying elbow away, emphasize that  the process can still be a kick.  </P> <P> "Depending on the child's age," she said, "you have to set down some guidelines  on what can be used with and without an adult around. For instance, you can  make a rule that no sharp knives can be used without an adult present. But you  don't want to make it so scary that when the kids turn 21, they're still afraid  to pick up a knife."  </P> <P> One strategy, she said, is division of labor. Highlight the steps in the  cookbook that your child can do -- stirring, blending, shaping dough, cutting  out cookies -- and you dice and saute the onions and flambe the dessert.  </P> <P> A cookbook for kids can help demystify and simplify things, for both children  and their parents. A good one is Betty Crocker's New Boys and Girls Cookbook.  It costs about $10, it's simply written, includes a brief glossary of common  cooking terms and hints, illustrates how to set a table and how to measure  ingredients, includes a page on "kitchen math" and an illustrated nomenclature  of cooking tools.  </P> <P> (This information alone, believe me, would have been a real boon in my hungry  postgraduate days when I was a culinary moron and the can opener was my primary  cooking tool. Do your kids a favor and get them a cookbook like this when  they're young so they won't face the embarrassment of having to buy a child's  cookbook to learn the basics when they're 22.)  </P> <P> It isn't baby food. A few moppet meals from the Betty Crocker book: nachos,  scrambled eggs, lemon-blueberry muffins, scones, vegetable soup, crunchy  tortellini salad, sloppy joes, oven-fried chicken, peanut chocolate truffles,  strawberry shortcake, baked cheese with apples and, yes, pizza.  </P> <P> Presentation doesn't count.  </P> <P> "Even if it doesn't look good at the end, they're proud of it because they did  it," she said. "There are very few kids that don't get excited about cooking."  </P> <P> But what if the kid turns into Kitchen Ninja? What if he starts carrying around  a Henckel Four Star in a holster like a Navy Colt? What if he pulls down the  Magic Johnson poster and puts up one of Wolfgang Puck? What if he asks for a  duck press for Christmas?  </P> <P> Relax. Scrap the kiddie cookbook, get him a copy of the Larousse Gastronomique  and set the table. Until he heads off to chef's school at La Varenne (on  scholarship), you're going to eat like a sultan.  </P></p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Salvesen pulls out of German distribution CHRISTIAN Salvesen, the distribution, manufacturing and specialist hire group, yesterday reported a small increase to Pounds 67.2m in annual pre-tax profit and announced the closure of most of its German distribution businesses. That operation lost nearly Pounds 1m in the year to March 31, compared with a Pounds 1.4m profit previously. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 19.9m was included for closing warehouses and redundancies to end a contract with Langnese Iglo, a frozen food subsidiary of Unilever. This followed a Pounds 13m write-down of the assets in the previous year's accounts. Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said the German distribution market was the most unsophisticated in Europe. It was highly fragmented and lacked purpose-built distribution centres. The Pounds 67.2m pre-tax profit figure, compared with Pounds 66.6m in 1990-91, followed multiplied interest costs of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 1.2m). Net debt rose to Pounds 80.8m (Pounds 62.5m), gearing of 35 per cent, after Pounds 100m of capital spending and acquisitions - this would fall below Pounds 70m this year, Mr Masters said. Distribution, which accounted for more than half the group's Pounds 484.3m (Pounds 422.7m) turnover, increased trading profit by 20 per cent to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 25.7m). The German distribution operation was separated out as a discontinued activity. Specialist hire, notably the Aggreko generator and air conditioning rental business, also grew strongly to Pounds 27m (Pounds 22.3m) trading profit on sales of Pounds 111.7m (Pounds 82.4m). In manufacturing, a small improvement in food processing, offset by a decline at Salvesen brick left trading profit Pounds 1.5m lower at Pounds 16.6m. Earnings per share rose to 17p (16.6p). A final dividend of 4.1p raises the total to 7p (6.6p). COMMENT Although the German exit has proved expensive - albeit mostly below the line, Salvesen gained credit for grasping what is hopefully the last of its big nettles. None of the businesses that remains should get any worse - not even bricks which has been a good damage limitation exercise - and some should improve. Aggreko, in particular, has made the analysts smile because of the entrepreneurial way the business has been taken from a UK/Netherlands base to the US and Pacific rim. Distribution has great defensive qualities and the French problem seems temporary. Lower capital spending should reduce the flattening effect of interest costs. The one plus unlikely to be repeated is a Pounds 1m exchange rate gain. A pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 73m gives a prospective multiple of 15 to 16. Its switch from food to the higher-rated business services sector may generate some interest, although the near doubling of the share price since August 1990 leaves little scope for improvement.</p>

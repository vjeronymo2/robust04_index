			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own information" report under the "Intrigue" rubric: </F> "Shumeyko's Department Has Decided To Make the Constitutional  Court Really Insignificant. A New Approach to the Constitution  Has Begun"]    [Text] There is no disputing the fact that the new Russian  Constitution, adopted 12 December last year, is far from  perfect. But, while the Fundamental Law has been in force, so  many attempts -- either malicious or out of ignorance -- have  already been made on it that there is nothing left for us but to  put our trust in its defense by the Constitutional Court, which  has virtually been inoperative in Russia for more than six  months now.    If you recall, the Constitutional Court's activity was  suspended by the president's celebrated Edict No. 1400, and its  activity was frozen, while the Constitutional Court itself was  mentioned only occasionally in connection either with a hunger  strike by one of the judges, or with a fire in its building's  turret, or with the possible departure of Valeriy Zorkin in  order to enter politics.    Nevertheless, during this time work was already under way on  a new law on the Constitutional Court. The draft law was sent  to the State Duma, and a conciliation commission was set up  together with the committee under the leadership of V. Isakov.  After several amendments were made, the draft law was adopted  on its first reading, after which it was sent back for  additional work. Amendments from the Federation Council were  expected before 15 June.    The next reading of the law was scheduled for today, and the  draft law was duplicated. Suddenly a 15-page package of  amendments -- 52 in all -- arrived 22 June from the Committee  for Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reform. Some of them are  of a purely formal nature, and some are simply unexpected, such  as, for example, the exclusion of constitutional control from  the Constitutional Court's functions.    Until recently the Constitutional Court comprised 13 judges.  According to the new draft law, it remained to choose six more  (10 candidacies were submitted to the president over a month  ago, but Yeltsin has not yet made a decision in this regard).  But the amendments submitted by the Federation Council provide  for the reelection of all the Constitutional Court judges  (elected for life!) -- which will still further delay both the  adoption of the law on the Constitutional Court and the start of  its work. The amendments submitted by the Federation Council  include proposals for the court chairman to be appointed by the  Federation Council itself, not by the already elected  composition.    There are grounds for fearing that there will very soon  arise  a further serious cause for discussion by the Constitutional  Court. Which does not exist in Russia.</p>

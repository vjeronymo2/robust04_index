			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MY BEST RECIPE: A SWEET FAMILY TREAT IS A CROSS BETWEEN A LIGHT BREAD AND CAKE  </P> <P> "This recipe has been in my family for some 60 years," Carole Foran writes.  "It's a cross between a cake and a light bread and needs no icing, other than a  sprinkling of powdered sugar, which is optional. The cake freezes very well."  </P> <P> BANANA-NUT CAKE  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups sifted cake flour  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking powder  </P> <P> 1/4 pound butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups sugar  </P> <P> 3 eggs, well beaten  </P> <P> 3 very soft bananas, mashed  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped walnuts  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> Sift together cake flour, baking soda and baking powder. Set aside.  </P> <P> Cream butter with sugar until smooth. Add well-beaten eggs, beating until  blended. Beat in bananas, then walnuts and vanilla. Fold sifted dry ingredients  into banana mixture. Turn batter into greased and floured 9-inch-square baking  pan.  </P> <P> Bake at 350 degrees 40 to 50 minutes or until cake tests done in center. Serve  plain, or, if desired, sprinkle with powdered sugar or dollop with whipped  cream. Cut into bars or squares. Makes about 9 servings.  </P> <P>  -- CAROLE FORAN  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P> <P>  The Times pays $10 for readers' recipes published.

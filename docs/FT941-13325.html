			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Observer: Coffee house blues Lloyd's has been going through difficult times - more than Pounds 5bn of losses, to be precise - but does its future really lie in being an upmarket site for cheeseburgers and rowing machines? The insurance market which started life as a coffee shop has formed a joint-venture with Pret a Manger, a chain of sandwich bars and cafes, and a sports club could open in the basement. Lloyd's let part of the floor space at its former HQ on Lime Street to Pret a Manger, receiving a percentage of the bar's turnover. Stephen Hall, Lloyd's finance director, says 'the name of the game is reducing costs and jacking up revenue'. Nick Phillips, Lloyd's property manager, wants to do a deal with a leisure company to open a sports club in the basement. The returns will not be massive; security considerations mean that only employees of the corporation or of the agents and brokers may use either facility. Now that could be a really a exclusive club.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour Euro committee chairman unseated MR Nigel Spearing, Labour MP for Newham South, was yesterday voted out of the key post of chairman of the all-party select committee on European legislation, though he remains a member. The committee, which sifts EC legislation and recommends the most important measures for debate either in committee or in the Commons itself, is a key part of Westminster's mechanism for scrutinising proposals from Brussels. Mr Spearing, who has held the post since 1983, was defeated by Mr Jimmy Hood, Labour MP for Clydesdale.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> OPPOSITION SLOWS FREEWAY WIDENING  </P> <P> Plans for widening the Santa Ana Freeway north of the Riverside Freeway are  moving slowly because of opposition to the project by officials in Los Angeles  County, according to a new report.  </P> <P> Seven miles of the nine-mile project are in Los Angeles County, and neither the  cities along the route there nor the Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission favor the widening, according to a project status report released by  the Orange County Transportation Commission on Monday.  </P> <P> As a result, commission officials said, Caltrans is examining other options for  improving the freeway. No details, however, were available.  </P> <P> Current plans call for doubling the freeway's width from six lanes to 12, at  least as far as the San Gabriel River Freeway. But Caltrans officials have  warned of serious bottlenecks if the freeway were to suddenly narrow from 12  lanes to six at the Los Angeles County line.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, reconstruction of the Newport Boulevard bridge between Pacific Coast  Highway and 32nd Street in Newport Beach has fallen several months behind  schedule, according to the commission's report. So, too, has the widening of  Pacific Coast Highway between Golden West Street and Beach Boulevard in  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> The bridge project has slipped by five months, until April, because of delays  in getting Coast Guard approval, the report stated. The PCH project is slowed  by a design consultant's delays.  </P> <P> The report showed that five other projects have gone out to bid. They involve  extending the Costa Mesa Freeway from 19th Street to Wilson Street, widening  the Santa Ana Freeway between Jeffrey Road and Jamboree Road and between Tustin  Ranch Road and Newport Avenue, and reconstruction of the Santa Ana-Costa Mesa  freeways interchange as well as construction of new Santa Ana Freeway ramps at  Beach Boulevard.

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Bosnia still ON AUGUST 2 the North Atlantic Council announced that it regarded 'the dire humanitarian situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and particularly in Sarajevo' as unacceptable. It decided 'to make immediate preparations for undertaking, in the event that the strangulation of Sarajevo and other areas continues . . . stronger measures including air strikes against those responsible'. Eleven weeks have passed, and the FT's correspondent reports (in Wednesday's paper): 'Bombarding the city with artillery and mortars as well as targeting civilian areas with anti-aircraft guns, Serb chieftains, bolstered by their Croat counterparts and western indifference, are killing whatever spirit remains in the Bosnian capital.' Sarajevo is still under siege. Most of its inhabitants are getting half or less of the 600 grammes of food which the UN regards as minimum daily rations. There is no gas, electricity or running water, and most families have already burnt their domestic furniture. Cold is expected to be the biggest killer this winter, yet by last week supplies of plastic sheeting and other materials for shelter had not begun to arrive. In other supposedly UN-protected 'safe areas' the situation is even worse. If this is not 'strangulation' it is hard to imagine what would be. Yet Nato defence ministers have just been meeting, not to authorise air strikes but to discuss agreements with former Warsaw Pact members who look (one wonders why) to the alliance for protection. They did find time to agree to stop blaming each other for their failure to end the war in Bosnia, and the US defence secretary promised a 'substantial' contribution to a Nato force that would be deployed there if a peace agreement is reached. Few of his colleagues believe Congress would authorise such a deployment, after the Somalia debacle, but then none of them any longer believes peace will be reached before the winter. More to the point was his offer of increased air drops of humanitarian aid. The priority now must be to help the inhabitants of Sarajevo and other enclaves to survive. But air drops will not be enough. What is required is an airlift. In 1948-49 over 2m tons of aid were flown in to Berlin in 10 1/2 months. The blockade of Sarajevo has lasted longer, yet just over 60,000 tons have arrived so far. The difference lies in the availability of supplies, of transport capacity and of secure airfields. All three depend on the political will of western governments. They have the food, they have the aircraft and they have the capacity to strike back if the Serbs or anyone else attempts to shoot those aircraft down. Similarly, the smaller enclaves can and should be relieved by road, if UN troops are ordered to force their way through roadblocks, as Security Council resolutions already authorise them to do. It may be too late to save Bosnia. It is not too late  - but it soon will be  - to save thousands of individual Bosnians.</p>

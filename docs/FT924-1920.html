			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Franco launches war over medicines EVER since Brazil's President Itamar Franco found the cost of his mouth-ulcer ointment had gone up again, the price of medicines has been the most prominent issue of his government, and a symbol of his populist style. Barely a day goes by without Mr Franco complaining about so-called 'abusive price increases' by the pharmaceutical industry, which claims to be simply keeping up with 25 per cent a month inflation. Yesterday, Mr Franco formally declared war, announcing he would take legal action against all companies raising prices above inflation, and ordering the Inland Revenue to investigate their tax position. He also authorised a Dollars 1.1bn donation to state- and army-owned laboratories to make drugs at lower prices. The drugs companies are the latest target in a long-running battle between successive Brazilian governments and oligopolies that characterise much of the country's industry. The fact that the main pharmaceutical companies are foreign has brought nationalist sentiment behind Mr Franco's crusade. Mr Pedro Motta Veiga, director of the Foreign Trade Foundation, says: 'If anyone was thinking of investing in Brazil this would be very off-putting. Itamar goes after the drugs companies, Collor the car manufacturers. Who knows what the next president will target?' Until October 1991, medicine prices were government-controlled and kept so low that 13 foreign companies left Brazil and 34 national companies closed. After liberation, an accord was reached to allow companies to raise prices by monthly inflation plus a real 6 per cent increment to compensate for past losses. The current row was sparked last month when the industry announced a 25 per cent price rise agreed in its monthly meeting with economy ministry officials, to compensate for October inflation of 26.5 per cent. After a furious Mr Franco suspended the accord, the companies agreed to cut the increase to 23.38 per cent and grant a 10 per cent discount on 76 medicines in frequent use. This month, the industry announced increases of 21-26 per cent, prompting an angry protest note from the Presidency accusing the companies of 'civil disobedience'. Mr Jose Eduardo Bandeira de Mello, vice-president of the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (Abifarma), says he had advised the health ministry of the increases, and protests: 'All sectors of economy are readjusting prices according to inflation. Why can't we do the same?' But according to figures released yesterday by the Department of Economic Defence, medicines have increased by an average 3,770.5 per cent in the past year, against inflation of 1,483 per cent. Some drugs have gone up by as much as 16,128 per cent. Abifarma retorts that since 1982 their prices have gone up 397,831 per cent, against inflation of 616,985.20 per cent. Businessmen fear Mr Franco's concern with medicine prices may be the first step to reintroduction of price controls or a new price freeze, arguing that if he was really concerned about people's ability to afford medicines, he would cut sales tax, or offer medicine vouchers, rather than give money to state laboratories.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists ahead 40% - Advance to Pounds 49.7m helped by full-year contribution from Macarthy ACQUISITIONS helped boost annual profits and sales at Lloyds Chemists, the acquisitive retailer and healthcare wholesaler which yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in the pre-tax result to Pounds 49.7m. The shares closed 15p up at 284p. Sales were 58 per cent higher at Pounds 802m for the year to June 30. This was mainly because of the inclusion for the first full year of Macarthy, the drugs wholesaler acquired in March 1992 for Pounds 92.5m, and other pharmaceutical and veterinary drugs supply companies. Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman, said the year had been 'very successful', with progress in all divisions. He stressed the organic growth achieved by Lloyds, particularly in the wholesale distribution division. The profits increase had been achieved, he said, after a Pounds 6.3m government clawback on the discounts given on generic drugs, and amid the 'most difficult trading conditions in the company's history'. While optimistic about growth in the current year, Mr Lloyd stressed that the group would move ahead at a slower rate. Like-for-like sales in the first 13 weeks were 6 per cent up in the chemists division, 3 per cent ahead in drugstores, and flat in the healthcare chain Holland and Barrett. Barclay Pharmaceuticals increased turnover by 49 per cent to Pounds 503m and overall, the pharmaceutical division increased sales by 63 per cent to Pounds 583m. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 8.4m higher at Pounds 11.4m. The retail division, which includes the core chemists chain, the Holland &amp; Barrett shops and Supersaver drug stores, showed a 14.5 per cent profit rise to Pounds 44.9m. Sales were up 33.5 per cent at Pounds 569m. Veterinary sales rose by Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 49.2m and profits from Pounds 364,000 to Pounds 2.1m. The interim dividend was increased from 4p to 5.25p for a total of 7.25p (5.55p). Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 13 per cent to 26.84p. COMMENT Focus on the short term and Lloyds looks like a winner. There is more margin improvement to come from acquisitions and the wholesale division is growing impressively. Further out, however, one has to question the potential for Lloyds' core chemists business, with little prospect of price improvements, and a significant number of mature stores. Government restrictions will cramp outlet expansion and the group seems to have snapped up most of the attractive chains. Lloyds will also have to watch out for the inevitable counter-attack in wholesaling from giants AAH and UniChem. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of Pounds 56m, leaving a prospective p/e of 9.6 times. While there is likely to be room for improvement in the short term, the attraction may fade in the longer term.</p>

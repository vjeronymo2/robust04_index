			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Japan Leasing in transfer accord JAPAN Leasing has become the country's largest leasing company after absorbing the domestic business division of LTCB International Leasing, an affiliate of Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB). The transfer agreement is a result of the already close links among the three companies - Japan Leasing has a 30 per cent stake in LTCB International Leasing, and LTCB holds 4.8 per cent of Japan Leasing and 4.9 per cent of LTCB International Leasing. The bank said the transfer of outstanding leasing claims of about Y80bn (Dollars 601.5m) to Japan Leasing 'is in the interests of all the companies'. The transfer price was not disclosed. It said LTCB International would be able to concentrate on international business, while Japan Leasing would have extra influence in the domestic market after having surpassed Orix. Japan Leasing now has an estimated Y870bn in leasing assets, while Orix has about Y850bn, although both companies have been under pressure following the collapse of the Japanese 'financial bubble', which has increased their exposure to bad debts and led to a slowdown in corporate leasing. LTCB International said the transfer of assets would reduce its expenses and make it more competitive in international leasing business. About a quarter of the company's 107 workers have been sent to Japan Leasing, while contracts with 700 clients have been absorbed.</p>

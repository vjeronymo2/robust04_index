			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Letter: Manufacturing is the key to improving standard of living Sir, Samuel Brittan (and Sir James Ball and Donald Robertson), far from exposing 'that manufacturing fallacy again' (June 28), have highlighted an economic fallacy. Most economic commentators are undoubtedly technically correct but, in practical terms, are wrong to dismiss the importance of manufacturing in our trade balance. Britain has to balance its books better on international trade and manufactured goods if it wishes to achieve a viable economy and standard of living. Manufactured goods account for nearly half of UK consumer spending, and three quarters of UK exports. These are produced mainly by world-class companies. Without them, much of the income from invisibles, whether royalties, dividends or profit repatriation, would not be achievable. UK manufacturing industry provides employment for about 4.5m people, and an equal number indirectly in related services. Without this employment, the public sector borrowing requirement would escalate even further. In any event, it is unrealistic to transfer all the skills to the service industries overnight even if there was a market for them. The high level of imports is a matter of great concern. That is why the CBI National Manufacturing Council has launched an initiative to rebuild the UK's supply base so as to meet both home and overseas demand more effectively. Overseas investors can finance the deficit by lending or investing in the UK. Overseas countries currently own about a quarter of Britain's manufacturing industry. But if we fail to develop our manufacturing base we risk losing that as well. Manufacturing industry is the real key to wealth creation. Let us encourage it to compete internationally rather than undermine it with fallacious economic arguments. Mark H J Radcliffe, CBI National Manufacturing Council, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU</p>

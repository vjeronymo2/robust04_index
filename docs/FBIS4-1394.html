			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Newsbrief" program] </F>   [Text] State President F.W. de Klerk says the answer to  this morning's bomb blast is a peaceful, well-supported  election. During a visit to a polling station in Soweto, he  told Sontie Maseko that strong action was being taken to prevent  bombings.    [Begin recording] [De Klerk] The police will act very  firmly.  They have taken all the precautions to assure that this spate of  bombs will be limited, and that the people behind it will be  apprehended. Some progress is being made, we must not interfere  with the investigation, but you have our assurance that the  investigation is carrying on full blast and that they have a  very, very good strong team on this, and I'm sure we will have  success.    [Maseko] All eyes are on South Africa. Now what does this do  to our international image?    [De Klerk] Well, obviously it's bad to our international  image, but a good turnout, with a very high percentage poll,  which is already apparent we will get, and the peaceful election  will far outweigh the negative image. It will prove that we are  dealing here with a small lunatic radical fringe, and that the  overwhelming majority of all South Africans are committed to  peace, and that this country is now departing on a new voyage  towards prosperity and peace for all its people.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] "If Russia has declared a psychological war against  Estonia, the whole nation has to be included in a fight against  Russia that has violated international agreements," MP [member  of parliament] Vardo Rumessen told the parliament on Monday [9  May]. Rumessen said that Russia was deliberately dragging on  the inter-state negotiations to gain time. He said that  Riigikogu [parliament] foreign committee should initiate a bill  in connection with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's  threat to bring more troops to Estonia, in which Riigikogu  should present a categorical demand to withdraw Russian troops  from Estonia by 31 August 1994. Rumessen, a representative of  Estonian National Independence Party, also called for all people  who cared about the future of their homeland to organise protest  actions against the continued presence of Russian troops in  Estonia.</p>

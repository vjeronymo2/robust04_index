			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Tsongas endorses Clinton GOVERNOR Bill Clinton took another step towards uniting the Democratic party behind his run for the White House yesterday by winning the endorsement of Mr Paul Tsongas, his strongest challenger during the primaries in the spring, George Graham reports from Washington. Mr Tsongas last night announced his endorsement in Boston after securing an opportunity to speak to the Democratic convention in New York next week. 'Bill Clinton won the nomination and I did not. Were I the victor, I would expect him to endorse me,' said the former senator from Massachusetts. The Arkansas governor yesterday hinted that he might offer more than a speaking slot to Mr Tsongas, if he were to win the presidency. 'I'd like to see him be part of the campaign and part of the next administration,' he said. During the primary contests, Mr Tsongas sought to convert the Democratic party to a more business-oriented economic policy.</p>

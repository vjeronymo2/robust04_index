			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Provisions continue to curb NatWest's growth NATIONAL Westminster Bank's full-year results for 1992 show the continuing drag exerted on British high street banks by provisions for possible bad debts. They also indicate why there has been market speculation that at least one bank may seek to strengthen its capital through a rights issue. Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, yesterday emphasised how much the bank would prefer that its home economy was a low inflationary one, in which 'extreme economic cycles' were avoided. Given the effect of the cycle from the late 1980s to today on his bank, he has good reason to want stability. The bank achieved a healthy 16 per cent rise in profits before provisions, after ignoring the 'fifth quarter' from its Lombard credit finance business's adjustment of year-end. It achieved a 15 per cent increase in non-interest income, raising the proportion to 43 per cent of total income. However, the uncomfortable surprise in the results was the degree to which the bank's burden of provisions is continuing to hold back its pre-tax profits. This in turn contributed to the bank having to pay an uncovered divided, and weakening its tier 1 ratio of core capital to assets to 5.2 per cent. Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive, emphasised that it was 'the length and depth of the recession' rather than poor lending decisions in the late 1980s that was to blame. A rise in non-performing loans to Pounds 5.1bn (Pounds 3.7bn) indicates that this year may also be tough. Last year's recession brought down many of the small and medium-sized businesses to which NatWest is one of the main two bank lenders. Mr Wanless said 47.6 per cent of UK provisions were on lending to businesses which had borrowed less than Pounds 50,000, and 77 per cent were in the south. The provisions were directly charged to the profit and loss account - taking the UK branch business into a Pounds 140m loss. But non-performing loans also had a depressing effect on net interest income, costing the bank Pounds 600m to fund compared with only Pounds 400m in 1991. As a result, NatWest faced a weakening of tier 1 capital to levels which could have raised eyebrows. After paying a dividend with 0.7 times cover, the ratio fell to 5.2 per cent. This ratio could have approached 5 per cent if the bank had accepted the full effect of a property revaluation. While 5 per cent is still a percentage point above the 4 per cent required by the Bank for International Settlements, it is regarded as the comfort limit preferred by the Bank of England. Lord Alexander insisted yesterday that the bank could meet a Pounds 17bn rise in assets on current capital. But without any adjustments, that would push tier 1 capital below 4.5 per cent. This is the stimulus for speculation about rights issues, although Lord Alexander quashed such talk. The bank has other solutions if things started looking tight. It made an issue of Pounds 200m in undated subordinated notes last year, which it can convert into cumulative preference shares at 30 days' notice. Such a move would add 0.2 percentage points to its tier 1 ratio. NatWest could make another such issue, either in Britain or in the US. It could also remove Pounds 5bn in liquid assets, and a further Pounds 5bn in market placings dated over one month from its balance sheet if there was strong loan demand. Nonetheless, the weakening of tier 1 capital indicates the sort of problems other banks could face in lending into a strong recovery. No matter how strong are rises in fees and other non-interest income, it shows how heavy the weight of provisions and non-performing loans remains. The questions raised by NatWest apply strongly to Barclays, which is due to report its 1992 results next week. Barclays is NatWest's main rival in the small and medium-sized lending that has caused trouble. It too could face questions about its capital strength if it has had a similar experience.</p>

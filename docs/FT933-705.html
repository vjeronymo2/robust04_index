			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Pragmatism taxes even the loyal masses MR Gordon Brown's comments earlier this week that he intended to reverse the 'unacceptable' gap between rich and poor were met with disbelief by journalists and commentators. His words suggested he had rejected the widely-accepted wisdom that the prospect of higher taxes was what lost Labour the last election. A large number of delegates at this week's conference would share that view. It was to them, said Mr Brown's defenders, that he was directing his comments. Mr Brown may well distance himself from his comments once conference is over, but a scan of grass roots opinion reveals why, at least for this week, he felt the need to tread carefully. A delegate from Blaby summed up the feeling of many Labour activists at a meeting of the shadow treasury team yesterday: 'We have got the impression from Gordon Brown that the very rich in this country will be allowed to keep all those ill-gotten gains of the past decade.' Like other delegates, she urged Labour to stick to a policy of raising the income taxes of the better-off in Britain. Agreeing on higher taxes for the rich is one thing, but agreeing on who is rich is another. One woman from the south-west suggested salaries of over Pounds 100,000 would be a good starting point for higher taxation. A delegate from Maidstone suggested Pounds 50,000 while a visitor from Scotland said Pounds 36,000 - the point at which Mr Smith's proposals would have started to bite  -was considered wealthy in Scotland. Among activists, Labour's now abandoned tax-raising proposals do not feature highly as a reason for why Labour lost the 1992 election. 'I would campaign tomorrow for higher taxes,' said the Maidstone delegate. 'People would accept them if they knew they were going to pay for better services.' 'It wasn't the tax. We just didn't get the message across in the South East,' said another Scottish visitor. 'John Smith's tax proposals didn't lose us the election in Scotland.' The mood was reflected in yesterday's economic debate. As one delegate commented: 'People are not stupid. They know the money has to be found.' Another pointed out that progressive taxation meant only one thing - income tax. If delegates had their way, Labour would march into the next election with last year's tax proposals intact and more. But their thinking is strongly out of line with a pragmatic Labour Treasury team.</p>

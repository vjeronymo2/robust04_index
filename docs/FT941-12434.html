			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / As They Say in Europe: Remembrance of things to come The concept of the Fresh Start rarely makes an impact these days. Indeed, if politicians want to propose anything along these lines, they usually come up with something like 'back to basics', as in Britain. That phrase was coined by John Major, the prime minister, at last year's Conservative party conference to justify the continued existence of a government which had been doing 'new' things for 14 years. I thought it was a jolly good idea until I saw it translated for the benefit of foreign newspaper readers. 'Retour aux valeurs fondamentales' and 'Zuruck zu den Grundwerten' gave me a better idea as to why the whole project had collapsed in a welter of moral and theological dispute, political scandal and semantic obfuscation. In English, the phrase lacks the clarity it gains in translation. And yet, in other languages it raises far more questions than it answers. None of this, though, detracts from the proposition that turning back the clock is the best way of tackling the future. After all, it became the basis of the Republican presidential campaign in the United States in 1992. This preamble is needed to illustrate the dilemma facing Italy, where an election will be held on March 27. It will take place without the participation of all those old favourites, Christian Democrats and so on, who have decorated the political scene since the second world war. And electors will use a simplified voting system, which should give a clear result. An editorial this week in Milan's Corriere della Sera heralded the occasion as an opportunity to realise old, universally-held, values. 'There is now a great opportunity in Italy,' it told readers. 'An opportunity to finally construct a democracy based on two competing blocs, each legitimately qualified to govern.' The article was profoundly in favour of alternanza, or elections which provide the opportunity of chucking out one governing party and voting in another. My hopes that Italy could provide a beacon for Britain were dashed, however, when I remembered what the same newspaper had said a week earlier: 'It is very likely that Italy will not have a 'civilised' election but a very tiring competition, just like the election of 1948. It will be a race between one side, communism, and the other, the far right wing. All this is wrong - instead of bringing progress, it will slow reform.' So it is hard to grasp what Milan's leading daily really thinks. Is Italy facing a choice between two evils, or is it on the verge of a better democratic society where responsible parties alternate in holding power? This latter option would be Back to the Future with a vengeance. It was once the very basis of electoral democracy, but has become nearly as unfamiliar in the rest of western Europe as it is in Italy. We have progressed beyond the system of alternating power. In general, the European Union these days follows the pattern once confined to the Benelux nations: you can have any government you like so long as it is the same as the last one. If Corriere is right, though, Italy does have the chance of being different. It can provide a democracy of alternating governments, or an enervating series of communist versus fascist battles. The former is unfashionable and the latter is popular only in central and eastern Europe, so it is not surprising that some outsiders believe the Italians should think again before embarking on a process of total political reconstruction. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung provides a nostalgic corrective, the kind of conservative view that lays the ground-work for a resurrection of the old regime. 'What the Christian Democrats delivered on the political front in the last five decades . . . in achieving the stable restructuring of Italy as an industrial state, might be praised by future historians.' Italy is not only creating a new political system but also waging a war on the old one. It is probably going further than any other country in seeking a ritorno ai valori fondamentali. The curious thing is that, within a single Milanese mind, there can be an argument as to what that ritorno will mean. That is the trouble with going back to basic values: they can be as unpredictable as the future itself. And, of course, as Italians are the first to admit, they never existed in their country, anyway. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

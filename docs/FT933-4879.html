			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Modest fall in offshore oil spending forecast SPENDING BY the offshore oil industry in the UK sector of the North Sea is expected to fall only modestly in the next four years. This is in spite of the UK continental shelf now being a mature area for oil and gas production. Between this year and 1997 annual spending on existing and new fields should fall by less than Pounds 1bn from this year's level of Pounds 8.5bn, says Scottish Enterprise, the development body, which yesterday published its biennial forecasts for UK and worldwide petroleum activity. The forecasts contrast with those Scottish Enterprise made in 1991, which suggested a rather steeper decline in spending on exploration, development and operations from an all-time peak in 1991. In that year spending in the UK continental shelf was Pounds 9.3bn. The continued high level of development spending, measured in 1993 prices, follows the record levels of exploration and appraisal reached in 1990, when 214 wells were drilled. Only 137 exploration and appraisal wells were started last year and Scottish Enterprise does not expect more than 105 to be drilled each year up to 1997. The study suggests this is partly due to the removal in the March Budget of petroleum revenue tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. About 41 new oil or gas fields are expected to come on stream in the northern North Sea and 29 in the southern sector between 1993 and 1997. But many new fields will use lower-cost subsea technology rather than platforms, while gas will make up an increasing proportion of the new fields coming into production. Oil output is expected to reach almost 2.5m barrels of oil a day in 1995, compared with 2m a day this year. After 1995 output will fall back slightly. About 20 per cent of future commercial fields in the North Sea have been delayed by more than a year because of an abundance of new supplies and weak oil prices, according to Arthur Andersen Petroleum Services.

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Letter: Right way out of a fiscal hole Sir, Fiscal hole or fiscal panic? In your editorial ('Filling the fiscal hole', February 9) you join forces with the OECD and Institute of Fiscal Studies in calling for a tax increase to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement. The reasons you give are, first, that the government's anti-inflationary promise needs a tax increase if it is to be believed, and, second, that a tax increase is required to prevent a spiralling rise in the ratio of national debt to income. On the first of these arguments you must be right, since almost any fall in demand in the economy is likely to reduce inflation. Inflation, however, is hardly a pressing problem at the moment, whereas mass unemployment and the collapse of companies - which you do not even mention - most certainly are. On the problem of the spiralling national debt, may I suggest that it should not, and would not, arise if the Treasury knew how to manage its finances. It is absurd, in a recession, that it should be thought necessary to add to the interest-bearing national debt in order to find the funds for public expenditure. There is no reason in principle why the Treasury should not borrow directly, and free of interest payments, from the Bank of England. In practice, the Bank and Treasury have put their own obstacles in the way of such a simple act of credit creation. But this means that it is the authorities' own act of self denial, not the PSBR, which must be held responsible for adding to the interest-bearing debt - and also for the taxes needed to pay the interest. To be blunt, it is Treasury folklore which threatens to raise the tax burden, and taxpayers should object. Naturally, one would not advocate direct credit creation when the economy is fully stretched - as, for example, in wartime. But in times like the present it is the clearest way out of what you call the 'fiscal hole'. M C Kennedy, faculty of economic and social studies, University of Manchester</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani complained yesterday  that U.S. newspapers only publish "unilateral reports" that  adversely affect ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance], but  they do not publish reports "on the thousands of murders  committed" by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front  (FMLN) during the war.    The president thus rejected reports published in Washington  on alleged U.S. pressure exerted on the late ARENA leader  Roberto d'Aubuisson in 1984 to prevent an attack on Thomas  Pickering, who was serving as U.S. ambassador at the time.  Cristiani added that a report appearing in the U.S. newspaper  THE WASHINGTON POST, which cited official documents on the  recent Salvadoran war that had been kept secret until recently,  are based on "unconfirmed" information.    President Cristiani admitted that General Vernon Walters  visited his country in 1984. He added, however, this was  related to the selection of an acting president, who turned out  to be Alvaro Magana, in view of the political crisis facing the  country at that time.    He added that the U.S. soldier met with Major d'Aubuisson,  who died in 1992, because he was among the most prominent local  politicians in his capacity as president of the Constituent  Assembly, and he added that "they were searching for a consensus  person to occupy the Presidency while the Constitution was being  drafted."    Cristiani said he has all the documents that the United  States declassified, adding that he could list thousands of  murders involving the FMLN, including that of Presidency  Minister Dr. Antonio Rodriguez Porth in June 1989.    The president criticized an alleged propaganda campaign  unleashed against his party. He said that all those documents  bear a headline stating that the Department of State does not  guarantee the veracity of the information and that this is  simply information collected by chance.    U.S. President Bill Clinton made public in November 1993 a  large amount of secret information on the Salvadoran war  (1980-92). Publication of this information in U.S. newspapers  has already unleashed several polemics in El Salvador.</p>

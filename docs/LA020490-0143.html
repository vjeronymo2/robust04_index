			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> IT'S NOT PRETTY, BUT KANSAS GETS 85-74 WIN OVER OKLAHOMA  </P> <P> After helping No. 2 Kansas to a sloppily played, 85-74 victory over  ninth-ranked Oklahoma at Lawrence, Kan., Kevin Pritchard glanced at a score  sheet and shook his head in disbelief.  </P> <P> "We shot 38%," he said. "That's kind of mind-boggling."  </P> <P> Coming into the rematch of the 1988 NCAA finalists, the Jayhawks (22-1, 5-1 in  the Big Eight) led the nation with a field goal percentage of 54.3%.  </P> <P> "I didn't think this team could shoot that bad," Pritchard said.  </P> <P> But the Sooners (15-3, 4-2) were held almost 40 points below their season  average of 112.5 points by a Kansas defense that kept switching and  experimenting throughout the game.  </P> <P> In addition, Oklahoma was without its No. 2 scorer and No. 1 rebounder, William  Davis, who did not make the trip because of disciplinary action.  </P> <P> There were 55 fouls in the game.  </P> <P> Pritchard and Rick Calloway led a Kansas run that halted Oklahoma's lone rally  in the second half and assured the Jayhawks of their 14th consecutive win at  home.  </P> <P> The Sooners cut Kansas' lead to 53-48 with about eight minutes left, but  Pritchard's two free throws ignited a 15-6 run that put the game out of reach.  Calloway, who led the Jayhawks with 20 points, scored eight in that stretch and  Pritchard had four.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS  </P> <P> No. 4 Michigan 77, Wisconsin 63 -- Both teams were missing key players, but the  Wolverines' superior depth enabled them to win the Big Ten game at Madison,  Wis.  </P> <P> Michigan (16-4, 6-3) was without third-leading scorer Sean Higgins, who  sustained a stress fracture in his left foot in a 91-72 loss to Purdue last  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Badgers were without second-leading scorer Willie Simms, who was declared  academically ineligible by the NCAA Friday. Simms dropped a class during the  week, which put him below the NCAA minimum of 12 credits. He later added a  class, making him eligible for Thursday's game at Michigan State.  </P> <P> Terry Mills scored 20 points for the Wolverines and Loy Vaught added 18.  Wisconsin's Danny Jones had 25 points.  </P> <P> No. 6 Georgetown 74, No. 18 St. John's 67 -- The Redmen lost their third game  in a row, but they also lost power forward Jayson Williams, who reinjured his  right foot three minutes into the Big East Conference game at Madison Square  Garden.  </P> <P> Williams, St. John's second-leading scorer and leading rebounder, missed the  first 10 games of the season because of a fracture in his right foot suffered  in the first week of practice. He averaged 15.7 points and 8.3 rebounds since  returning from the injury in October.  </P> <P> Georgetown (17-2, 7-2), remained tied for the Big East lead, took advantage of  Williams' absence, fouling out starting center Rob Werdann and his backup, Sean  Muto, with more than six minutes to play.  </P> <P> Georgetown made just four baskets in the final eight minutes, but the Hoyas  made 11 of 16 free throws, three of the misses coming in the last two minutes  when the outcome was apparent. St. John's (17-6, 6-4) led, 37-32, at halftime  after closing the half with a 10-1 run.  </P> <P> No. 7 Syracuse 90, Florida State 69 -- Billy Owens scored 23 points, including  12 during a decisive 10-minute stretch in the first half, as the Orangemen  routed the Seminoles at Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> The Orangemen (16-3) have won four in a row, three on the road. Florida State  (13-10) has lost six of its last eight games.  </P> <P> Owens sparked a 24-11 run that gave Syracuse a 42-27 halftime lead. Derrick  Coleman scored nine points in the first four minutes of the second half as the  Orangemen extended the lead to 55-32.  </P> <P> Michigan State 64, No. 8 Purdue 53 -- Steve Smith made seven free throws in the  final two minutes at West Lafayette, Ind., to help the Spartans deal the  Boilermakers their first Big Ten loss of the season.  </P> <P> Purdue (16-3, 8-1), made only 29% of its shots, but rallied from a 14-point  deficit to pull to within four points on Woody Austin's three-point shot with  1:33 left. Smith, who had 22 points, then made two free throws. After Austin  missed a three-point shot, the Spartans (17-5, 6-3) got the rebound and Smith  made two more foul shots with 1:09 left to make it 61-53.  </P> <P> No. 13 Connecticut 92, Providence 77 -- The Huskies extended their winning  streak to nine games with an easy Big East victory at Providence, R.I.  </P> <P> Chris Smith, who led Connecticut with 21 points, and John Gwynn helped the  Huskies (19-3, 7-2) take a 21-point lead with 9:55 left. The Friars (12-7, 5-5)  could get no closer than 13 the rest of the game.  </P> <P> No. 15 La Salle 89, Iona 73 -- The Explorers, led by Doug Overton, scored 24 of  the game's final 32 points to win the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference game  at New Rochelle, N.Y.  </P> <P> La Salle (16-1, 7-0) led at halftime, 47-37, but Iona (8-12, 3-6) fought back  and took its first lead at 59-58 on a steal and dunk by Joey Johnson with 12:28  left. Kevin Cooper's tip-in extended the Gaels' margin to 61-58.  </P> <P> Overton ended a 3:52 scoring drought for La Salle with a basket that cut Iona's  lead to 61-60 with 9:20 left. With the score tied at 65, he keyed a 13-2 run  with seven points. He made two free throws, a three-point shot and made both  ends of a one-and-one, giving the Explorers a 78-67 lead with 2:59 remaining.  </P> <P> No. 17 Georgia Tech 90, Maryland 84 -- Dennis Scott scored 17 of his 26 points  in the second half and the Yellow Jackets twice rallied from 11-point deficits  in the Atlantic Coast Conference game at College Park, Md.  </P> <P> The Yellow Jackets (14-4, 4-4) trailed, 41-30, in the first half and 55-44 with  17:56 remaining before winning their second consecutive ACC game.  </P> <P> Scott scored eight points, including two three-point shots, in the second-half  run. Maryland (13-8, 3-4) got to within 82-78 with 1:39 left, but Georgia Tech  made its final eight free throws.  </P> <P> No. 23 Xavier (Ohio) 88, Dayton 81 -- Jamal Walker made six free throws in the  final 75 seconds to give the Musketeers a Midwestern Collegiate Conference win  at Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Xavier (17-2, 6-1) trailed, 44-40, at halftime as Dayton (11-8, 4-3) shot 56%  and Walker made just one of five shots and committed five of 14 Xavier  turnovers. But Walker made two layups early in the second half to put the  Musketeers ahead to stay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EAST  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 94, Villanova 82 -- Darelle Porter and Brian Shorter led a pair of  second-half runs that carried the hot-shooting Panthers to their third  consecutive victory in a Big East game at Pittsburgh, despite a Big East record  15 three-point baskets by Villanova.  </P> <P> Porter, who finished with 21 points, scored four points and had three assists  during a 10-2 run early in the second half that saw Pitt turn a 45-44 deficit  into a 54-47 lead with 14:33 to play.  </P> <P> Shorter, who had 24 points, scored seven of those during a 17-5 run that gave  Pitt (9-10) a 77-63 lead after Villanova (12-11) rallied to within 60-58.  </P> <P> Pitt shot 60.7%, including 68.9% in the second half, against a Villanova  defense that was limiting its opponents to 38.9% shooting, third-best in NCAA  Division I.  </P> <P> Boston College 78, Seton Hall 65 -- The Eagles rallied in the second half at  Boston to win their first Big East game of the season.  </P> <P> Boston College (7-12, 1-8) made 49% of its shots and had balanced scoring.  Junior Bobby Moran led the Eagles with 15 points.  </P> <P> Rhode Island 86, Temple 70 -- Jeff Kent scored 24 points, Kenny Green had 23  and Eric Leslie added 22 to lead the Rams to an upset win at Kingston, R.I.  </P> <P> Rhode Island (8-11, 7-3), outrebounded Temple, 54-31, led by Green, who had 16  rebounds.  </P> <P> Temple (11-8, 9-2) led only twice early in the game. Rhode Island led, 84-65,  with 1:27 left. Mark Macon had 27 points for Temple.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOUTH  </P> <P> Kentucky 88, Georgia 77 -- A swarming defense that forced the Bulldogs into  committing a season-high 33 turnovers, and two free throws by John Pelphrey  with 1:11 left gave the Wildcats the Southeastern Conference win at Lexington,  Ky.  </P> <P> Georgia (13-6, 6-4) rallied from a 75-65 deficit to within 79-75 on Jody  Patton's two free throws with 1:36 remaining. But Kentucky (10-10, 6-5)  countered with Derrick Miller's three-point play and Pelphrey's free throws to  take a 84-75 lead.  </P> <P> Auburn 89, Tennessee 83 -- Chris Brandt scored a career-high 28 points at  Auburn, Ala., to help the Tigers knock the Volunteers out of a four-way tie for  the SEC lead.  </P> <P> Auburn (7-13, 4-6) opened the second half with a 20-8 run that put the Tigers  ahead, 50-36, and they never trailed after that. Tennessee (11-8, 6-4) could  come no closer than eight points until 1:35, when they cut the lead to six.  </P> <P> Alabama 65, Vanderbilt 56 -- Robert Horry scored 23 points and Melvin Cheatum  added 17 at Nashville as the Crimson Tide took over sole possession of first  place in the SEC.  </P> <P> The victory gave Alabama (16-5, 7-3) a half-game lead over LSU and a one-game  lead over Georgia and Tennessee.  </P> <P> Vanderbilt (13-6, 5-5) cut the lead to 54-47 with 4:49 to play, but the Tide  went on a 7-1 run to take a 61-48 lead with 1:03 remaining.  </P> <P> Mississippi 83, Florida 63 -- Forward Gerald Glass scored 26 points at  Gainesville, Fla., as the Rebels handed the Gators their worst home defeat in  10 years.  </P> <P> The SEC loss was the worst for Florida (6-11, 2-8) since a 21-point setback to  Mississippi State. The Gators have lost six in a row for the first time since  1981-82.  </P> <P> Mississippi (7-12, 4-6) took a 10-1 lead three minutes into the game as the  Gators missed their first seven shots.

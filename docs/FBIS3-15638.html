But </F> When?"]    [Text] Many politicians think that our democrats will  unite only five minutes before their execution. However, "the  roundtable" organized at the VECHERNIY KYYIV editorial office  has given reasons for believing that such a prognosis is not  quite true. At least, neither Levko Lukyanenko, nor Kostyantyn  Morozov, nor Vitaliy Karpenko, nor Yuriy Hnatkevich, nor other  participants in the discussion cast even a doubt regarding the  possibility for unifying dispersed national democratic forces.  On the contrary, a number of principal propositions was put  forward, which can underlie the creation of a political force  embracing the Ukrainian Republican Party, Rukh, the Democratic  Party of Ukraine, the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine, the  national wing of the Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine,  and those remaining for the time being outside political  parties. These propositions include the independence of  Ukraine, the safeguarding of personal freedom, as well as  political and economic reforms, much discussed, but not  initiated.    Such a consolidation is especially necessary in view of the  presidential elections planned for this year. In order to  prevent a repetition of the previous elections, national  democrats have to appoint a single candidate and secure his  victory. Can this be done? Yes, if party leaders cast off  their ambitions and give priority to a real candidate. They  will have to set aside their ambitions. Naturally, if Ukraine  is really dearer to them than their ego.</p>

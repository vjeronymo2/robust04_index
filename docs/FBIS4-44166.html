			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Parliamentary Staff, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] This is the full text of the Prime Minister's  Commons statement on the Corfu EU [European Union] summit:    ``I will make a statement about the meeting of the European  Council which I attended with the Foreign Secretary and  Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Corfu Council put another  three building blocks in place in constructing post-Communist  Europe.    ``First, the Treaties of Accession signed with Austria,  Finland, Norway and Sweden will help create the wider Europe  that we seek: a European Union [EU] that extends from the  Atlantic to the Arctic. I warmly welcome the positive vote on  accession in the recent Austrian referendum. I hope referenda  in the other three EFTA countries this autumn will be equally  successful.    ``Second, we agreed in Corfu that the Association Agreements  with our Central and East European partners must be fully and  urgently implemented. So should the UK/Italian initiative to  link these countries more closely with the foreign affairs and  home affairs pillars. This will help them to prepare for full  membership of the EU as soon as possible. Cyprus and Malta,  too, will be involved in the next phase of enlargement.    ``Third, the EU signed a Partnership and Cooperation  Agreement with Russia -- one of the most comprehensive  agreements ever concluded between the community and another  country. President Yeltsin said the agreement symbolised  Russia's return to the economic life of Europe as an equal  partner. He also pledged the support of his government in  bringing about stability in Central and East Europe and his  willingness to work closely over former Yugoslavia. Russia has  just signed the Partnership for Peace Agreement with Nato and on  July 9 President Yeltsin will play a full part in the political  debate at the Naples summit. I warmly welcome Russia's  increasing integration with Western political institutions.''    Mr Major told the Commons: ``In the discussion of the  problems facing people throughout Europe, I suggested a series  of moves to combat drug trafficking and other international  crime. The drugs problem throughout Europe is growing. Enough  cocaine has been seized in the EU this year to provide 24  million individual doses. I pressed for more effective  cross-border intelligence gathering on drug trafficking. I  urged the community to strengthen the Europol drugs unit and to  set up the full European Police Office quickly, with a wide  remit to tackle organised cross-border crime. I underlined the  importance of action within our own countries. I suggested that  the Union should hold a conference on drugs and organised crime,  and should involve countries in Central and East Europe. I was  glad to receive wide support for these proposals, which were  endorsed in the conclusions of the Council.    ``We made progress on two economic issues high on the  British  agenda.    ``First, we agreed that markets in telecommunications and  energy should be further liberalised, to give Europe's consumers  access to wider, cheaper and more efficient services.    ``Second, we strongly supported the German proposal to set  up  a European Deregulation Task Force with businessmen as members,  precisely as we have done in this country. This was agreed.  The Task Force will help to cut back burdensome community  regulations on business.    ``The Council endorsed the macro-economic guidelines drawn  up  by the Economic and Financial Council on the conditions for  sustainable growth. We agreed that it was essential to continue  cutting public sector deficits and reducing inflation.    ``I reported that the British economy had grown by nearly 3  percent in the year to this Spring, and that unemployment had  fallen here by by over 300,000 since the end of 1992. Britain  remains the fastest-growing of the big economies in the EU.''    Mr Major said: ``The Council approved a first priority list  of 11 trans-European network projects. This includes the second  Channel Tunnel rail link and proposals to improve the rail links  between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Any contribution to  the financing of such projects must come from within existing  community resources. At our insistence, the Council agreed that  there could be no financial guarantee from the community for  trans-European networks. We believe that Europe's taxpayers must  be protected against such open-ended commitments.    ``We heard further evidence that the subsidiarity principle  is being successfully implemented. We expect the number of main  legislative proposals coming out of Brussels this year to be  about half the number in 1993, and a quater of the total four  years ago. This is a very significant improvement.    ``In external policy, the Council discussed Ukraine and  agreed to step up support for economic reform and nuclear safety  there, tied to the closure of Chernobyl. This discussion will  be taken forward with the United States, Japan and Canada at the  Economic Summit in Naples in early July.    ``The Council once again discussed Bosnia. The Contact Group  has done valuable work based on the EU's plan; but there is an  urgent need for the parties to show the will for a negotiated  settlement if the process is to succeed.    ``We agreed that the EU would make every effort with the  United States and Russia to bring the negotiations to a point of  decision.''    Mr Major told the House: ``Let me now turn to the  presidency of the European Commission. The treaty lays down  that the Commission President should be selected by `common  accord' to serve a term of five years. Common accord is vital.  For the President of the Commission to serve the whole  Community effectively, he must enjoy the confidence and support  of all of its members.    ``Before the Corfu Council, we told the presidency and other  partners that we supported Sir Leon Brittan's candidature; and  believed that a genuine consensus of all 12 member states to be  essential. No one disputed the necessity of a genuine  consensus.    ``When we heard that Mr Dehaene was thinking of putting  himself forward at a late stage, we privately informed the  Belgian Government and other partners that we could not support  him. We warned that it would not be possible for him to attract  a consensus of the whole community. We hoped, therefore, that  his candidature would not be pressed.    ``Neither then nor at any later stage did any partner say  that either Sir Leon Brittan or Dr Lubbers, the two  long-standing candidates, was unacceptable. Both, of course, had  outstanding credentials and long experience of the community --  Sir Leon Brittan as a Commissioner for six years and Dr Lubbers  from 12 years on the European Council.    ``At the Corfu Council, four states -- representing nearly  half of the community's EU population -- did not support Mr  Dehaene in the long discussion on the first evening. In several  interventions, I made our strong views very clear to the  Council, as I had in a number of bilateral discussions.    ``On the following morning, Sir Leon Brittan and Dr Lubbers  decided to withdraw their candidatures. Other European  countries indicated that they could accept Mr Dehaene. I  maintained my position that we could not. I said that I had  given the matter careful thought and that our decision would not  change at any stage. I reiterate that position in this House  today. I suggested that consultation should be put in hand to  find a candidate who had the support of all. The German  Chancellor, who takes over the presidency later this week, said  he hoped to resolve the matter quickly, if necessary by  convening a special summit on July 15.''    Mr Major insisted: ``Our position was not a personal  criticism of Mr Dehaene, although in our view Sir Leon and Dr  Lubbers had much stronger qualifications. For the next five  years the Commission needs a President who is in tune with the  times and the mood across Europe, a President whose instincts  are with enterprise and competitiveness. Above all, Europe  needs a President of the Commission selected with the full  approval of all member states.    ``The Corfu Council has highlighted an issue of increasing  concern to many EU members -- that issue is the way in which  decisions are reached. It is an important point of principle  that the key decisions require unanimity and that all member  states should have an equal opportunity to participate in  collective decision-making. The procedures used for this  decision, before and during the Council, were not satisfactory.    ``There was no need for this matter to have come to an open  division at a European Council. It should have been avoided.  Had more comprehensive consultation taken place, as in the  past, and had the views expressed by different states been  heeded, it could have been avoided.    ``I believe that there are a number of well-qualified people  who could take on this post, on the basis of a genuinely common  accord. We stand ready to play our part in consultations on it.  There is no reason why this should not lead to an early and  satisfactory outcome.    ``I want Europe to succeed. I want it to regain the  affections of the people of Europe. I want a Europe with which  all member states -- soon to be 16, then 20 -- can feel  comfortable. Achieving that may mean disputes along the way.  But being a good European does not mean signing up to  everything which our partners propose. At Corfu we fought for  what we believe is in the best interests of this country and of  Europe. That is what we will continue to do.''</p>

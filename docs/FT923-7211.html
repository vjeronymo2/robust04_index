			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sony to set the tone for the sector - Gordon Cramb previews the results season for Japanese electronics SONY of Japan's shareholders will not be the only group waiting for signs of an upturn when it reports its first-quarter results today, after plunging into a Y20.5bn (Dollars 163m) parent operating loss in the year to last March. Keen interest in Sony's fortunes will also be shown by a batch of Japanese electronics companies, which specialise in the consumer audio-visual sector and which look to Sony to set a lead in technological innovation. They will be seeking indications that Sony has products or applications on the horizon which will aid their recovery from the country's protracted downturn in consumer spending. Analysts in Tokyo, however, see a more immediate problem for the dedicated audio companies. Sony and the larger Matsushita Electric Industrial, they say, are increasingly going down-market into cheaper domestic ranges to use surplus production capacity and increase market share. 'This will gradually hurt other competitors,' said an industry watcher. Aiwa, partly because it is a 52.5 per cent Sony subsidiary, occupies a special place among those in the sector. In 1987 it was among the first Japanese electronics companies to undergo a restructuring when half its output was moved overseas, mainly to Singapore, and its product line was pruned. Mr Hajime Ukoni, brought in from Sony and now Aiwa president, said this week he expected others in the audio products industry would probably have to follow a similar route. Some large and diversified electronics makers have already either quit the audio sector in the past year or reduced their manufacturing presence. Toshiba has stopped making cassette and compact disc players. Hitachi is concentrating domestic output at the top end of the audio market, while providing marketing support to its loss-making Nippon Columbia affiliate, maker of the Denon hi-fi brand. Mr Ukoni argued that Aiwa is better placed than specialist audio producers which have not yet shed surplus domestic capacity. However, he added: 'We have turned into a headwind. Unless we handle this wisely, we could end up the same as five years ago. It's a tough year for me.' Aiwa's strategy has been to focus on familiar products slightly differentiated from those of its competitors, and then price them keenly. Its best line is a compact stereo system including television and video. The unit is being sold as a household's second system in an otherwise saturated market. Along with Sony, the usually slower-moving Matsushita remains a potent force at the head of the industry because of its size and its strong brand names, such as Panasonic and Technics. Against Matsushita's digital compact cassette, Sony places its next-generation audio hopes on the minidisc, a recordable format intended to replace compact discs. The company has been attempting to allay fears that this fight  - which it could lose to Matsushita, as it did with its Betamax video format versus its rival's VHS  - is inhibiting investment in other potentially promising directions. Mr Norio Ohga, Sony president, said earlier this month that 'the burden from investments in 8mm camcorders and minidiscs has been heavy. To recover profits on our previous investments we have to lower new investment'. To counter the domestic downturn, audio producers are stepping up sales in overseas markets, which already account for around two thirds of all revenues for companies in the sector. Many groups are battling at home to contain production costs and swollen inventories  - cutting overtime and shifting staff to product areas which are performing better. Recruitment of engineers and skilled workers is generally being maintained but advertising budgets have been pared. But in some respects the approaches of the companies differ markedly. Pioneer, also due to report quarterly results today, agrees with Aiwa in principle. 'In Japan there are 42m households. In the past we thought in terms of one system, one household. Now we are targeting family members separately,' an official said. But Pioneer has gone a different route, trying to draw consumers to new products. It is stressing higher price-tag items aimed at those in their 30s and 40s. Pioneer lists laser home karaoke systems and big-screen projection televisions as growth products. Through its car audio side it has launched a satellite navigation system and a satellite link which shows a vehicle's position on an in-car screen. Kenwood, also aiming for the upper end of the market, said it has maintained market share partly because it has been generous in its dealer margins. But both companies, along with others, face increasing volume competition from Sony. Non-operating income kept Sony in the black at the parent pre-tax level last year, while its worldwide entertainment interests held the overall group comfortably in profit. Today's figures may indicate how it has fared in rebuilding its domestic earnings base in the face of an increasingly dull consumer climate. The tougher its actions in doing so, however, the more other Japanese audio companies are likely to suffer.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 JAPANESE AUDIO PRODUCTS MAKERS               1992 parent company forecasts (Ybn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Sales    Per cent    Pre-tax     Per cent                                      change    profits       change  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Matsushita                5,050        +1.1        197         +0.3 Sony                      2,020        +2.1         50       +107.5 JVC                         580        -4.4        1.0           * Pioneer                     433        +4.1       26.5        -19.9 Kenwood                     220        +6.4        6.5         +7.1 Aiwa                        160        +5.7        3.4        -22.7 Nippon Columbia             102        +0.4       -1.2           *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * 1991 losses: JVC Y2.3bn, Nippon Columbia Y2.2bn Source: Toyo Keizai  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Low rates buoy US housing starts HOUSING starts in the US rose 7.8 per cent between July and August, indicating that the lowest mortgage interest rates for 20 years are providing a powerful stimulus. The increase was larger than analysts expected and took the level of starts to an annual rate of 1.32m, the highest in more than three years. The figures, published yesterday by the Commerce Department, came as Federal Reserve governors and regional presidents met in Washington to review monetary policy. The Fed faces conflicting pressures on interest rates. Some economists are pressing for an early tightening of policy to curb rapid growth of bank reserves and head off a speculative bubble in share and bond prices. Senior administration officials, however, say that interest rates must remain low in order to stimulate economic growth and job creation. The Fed is not expected to signal an early change in short-term rates, which have stood at 3 per cent (zero after allowing for inflation) for more than a year. However, several senior officials, including Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman, have indicated real rates are well below 'equilibrium' levels. Housing starts rose in all regions except the north-east. The strongest sector of the market was starts of single-family homes, which rose 11 per cent nationally to an annual rate of 1.18m, the highest in six years. The surge last month followed disappointing figures earlier this year when bad weather affected building in many regions. For the first eight months starts were up only 3 per cent from the same period last year. However, building permits - a guide to future construction - rose 16 per cent in the year to August, suggesting continued market buoyancy.</p>

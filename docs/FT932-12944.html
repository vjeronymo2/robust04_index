			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Miracles beyond the free market: Whether east Asia's economic success can be repeated The biggest challenge for economists today is understanding the extraordinary success of east Asia. The region has nearly quadrupled per capita incomes in the past quarter of a century - a record unparalleled in economic history. On present trends it may begin to overtake much of the industrialised west early in the 21st century. If its startling success could be replicated elsewhere, billions of people in developing and formerly communist countries could look forward to improved living standards. And the hope, eventually, of eliminating the scourge of grinding poverty would seem less quixotic. Yet the region is as puzzling as three-dimensional chess. It has done far better than conventional theories predict, even allowing for such quantifiable pluses as macroeconomic stability, high rates of investment and a focus on exports. There is just no generally accepted explanation for its main distinguishing feature - supercharged rates of productivity growth (see chart). The puzzle is deepened by the region's lack of homogeneity. The high-fliers are far from being carbon copies. At one extreme, Hong Kong has pursued a broadly free market approach; at the other, South Korea has intervened in just about every way conceivable. And the magic formula for growth has entirely eluded some countries in the region, such as the Philippines. At the World Bank in Washington, an exhaustive analysis of the 'Asia miracle' is nearing completion. Bank staff are distilling lessons from Japan, the four 'tigers' - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore - and the so-called 'cubs' - Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. They have also taken a look at the recent explosive growth in parts of southern China. The study was undertaken partly at the instigation of Japan, the bank's second-largest shareholder, which has long wanted to play a bigger role in policy design. Japan has been critical of aspects of conventional World Bank/International Monetary Fund prescriptions and, justifiably, believes more attention should be paid to its own outstandingly successful development strategies - which formed a model for much of east Asia. In 1991, Japan's Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund told the bank it was putting too much emphasis on deregulation and privatisation and made a case for selective import protection in developing countries and for the use of subsidised credits as a tool in industrial policy. Mr John Page, a senior member of the bank's Asia miracle team, says the Japanese criticism struck a chord because the results of market-oriented reforms had often proved disappointing in developing economies. By cutting budget deficits, eliminating market distortions and shrinking government, client countries had stabilised their economies. But too often they had not achieved a virtuous cycle of rapid growth; they still lay 'at the bottom of the league table relative to east Asia'. The question became: 'What now?' The bank's benchmark for judging Asian policies is not an extreme free market philosophy, which would have the public sector shun responsibility for just about everything bar national defence. It is rather the less controversial 'market friendly' strategy set out at length in the bank's 1991 World Development Report. This clearly delineates the role of markets and the state. Development would be fastest, it claimed, when government concentrated on two jobs: maintaining macroeconomic stability through conservative fiscal and monetary policies; and investing in people through public education, training and healthcare programmes. Beyond this, developing countries should rely on market forces. They should create as competitive as possible a regime in industry, commerce and the financial sector. And they should eliminate all barriers to trade and foreign investment. The core idea is that governments should focus on the things only they can do and leave everything else to markets. It turns out that most of the Asian high-fliers have adopted a more permissive attitude to the role of government. Indeed, Mr Page argues that the success of the region can best be understood in terms of a 'strategic growth' model that focuses more on what has to be done to achieve rapid growth than on who should do what. On the strategic theory, development will be rapid provided countries find a way of: accumulating capital rapidly; allocating resources efficiently; and catching up technologically. But there is no presumption that any of these functions should be reserved exclusively for the private sector. The miracle economies appear to have used a mixture of market incentives and state intervention in each of these areas: Accumulation. Gross domestic investment averages a startling 37 per cent of GDP in east Asia against an average of 26 per cent in developing countries as a whole. Yet this advantage was not won purely by adhering to the market-friendly approach. The region has admittedly created a positive climate for business investment by pursuing conservative fiscal and monetary policies - inflation has averaged 9 per cent over the past 30 years, less than half the rate in other developing countries. The public sector has also invested effectively in people (enrolment in primary education far exceeds levels elsewhere, as does attention to vocational education), although it has not spent an atypical proportion of national income on social services. But most of the Asian high-fliers have also interfered with market mechanisms. They have limited the personal sector's ability to consume and heavily regulated the financial sector so as to ensure a predictable supply of low-cost capital for industry. Mechanisms for forcibly shifting resources from consumption to investment vary - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, for example, have maintained stringent controls on consumption and housing. The net effect, however, is the same everywhere: an abnormally high rate of savings. Efficient allocation of resources. Governments have striven to ensure that the most important market of all - that for labour - is flexible, if not fully competitive. Wages have largely reflected market supply and demand, partly because trade unions have been suppressed. Focusing hard on success in export markets has also imposed crucial competitive discipline and prevented domestic prices for industrial inputs moving far out of line with world markets. Yet bank research indicates governments have also intervened vigorously. While less protectionist than the third world as a whole, few accepted western free-trade principles. Many have used import controls to protect strategic sectors (for example, quotas in South Korea, high tariffs in Thailand) and showered offsetting subsidies on export industries. At one time or another state-owned industries have played an important role in many of the economies, including South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. Many have not hesitated to direct the supply of credit to particular sectors. Both South Korea and Taiwan provided automatic credit for exporters in the early stages of development. Technological catch-up. The lesson again is that remarkable productivity growth only partly reflects market-oriented policies. Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and, to some degree, Taiwan, have welcomed foreign investment. Early developers such as Japan and South Korea used other devices, such as licences letting them copy foreign technology. But unlike many other developing countries none tried to rely on home-grown technology. However, all high-fliers intervened selectively to promote particular industries, with varying intensity and success. The process of trying to shift industrial output towards high-valued-added sectors is described by enthusiasts as 'getting prices wrong in order to create dynamic comparative advantage'. South Korea provides a wealth of examples of aggressive and successful intervention. The government's most audacious move was perhaps to create from scratch a domestic steel industry despite foreign donor opposition and lack of private-sector enthusiasm. The state-run business went on to become the world's most efficient steel producer. An internal bank memo sums up South Korea's record: 'From the early 1960s, the government carefully planned and orchestrated the country's development. . . . (It) used the financial sector to steer credits to preferred sectors and promoted individual firms to achieve national objectives. . . . (It) socialised risk, created large conglomerates (chaebols), created state enterprises when necessary, and moulded a public-private partnership that rivalled Japan's' Singapore provides another classic example of directed growth. When private sector companies failed to respond to opportunities identified by bureaucrats, state-owned or controlled groups were often pushed to the fore, the memo says. The bank has documented selective interventions throughout the region, even in supposedly free market Hong Kong. The Asian example poses a dilemma for bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank, especially in former communist countries. Does it still make sense to advocate a form of 'shock therapy' - the doctrine that deregulating and privatising everything as fast as possible is the optimum policy? Or should they recommend east Asia's slower, more interventionist path to economic maturity? It all depends on whether east Asia's deviations from orthodoxy can be replicated. There are some grounds for caution. Mr Vinod Thomas, the bank's chief economist for east Asia and an architect of the market-friendly strategy, points out that government activism outside east Asia has produced dismal results. A distinction should also be drawn between the earlier 'northern tier' of Asian high-fliers - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - and the later 'southern tier' of Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. Until the 1980s, countries such as South Korea were able to promote exports and protect imports without provoking much criticism. But pressure for a more level playing field has since grown intense. Broadly speaking, the southern tier of later developers has pursued more market-oriented policies than the first wave of Asian stars. Industrial interventions have also tended to be less successful. A bank memo describes Malaysia's efforts as 'by and large a costly failure' and Thailand's as 'largely ineffective'. Less tangible political and cultural factors may also be crucial. Most Asian high-fliers benefited from long periods of stable (if authoritarian) political rule. This encouraged long-term horizons. Public-sector bureaucracies have also tended to be more able and less corrupt than in most other third world countries. Governments were thus unusually well placed to implement development strategies. Policymakers were also remarkably pragmatic; if a policy did not work it was rapidly dropped. South Korea, for example, went through several phases. It was relatively market-oriented in the early 1960s, became highly interventionist during the 'heavy and chemical industries' drive of the 1970s, and then reverted to greater reliance on market forces in the mid-1980s. No region, it seems, has been less weighed down by ideology or more willing to seek advice from abroad. The bank has only just begun the politically charged process of drawing conclusions from mountains of research papers. But senior officials believe the study may lead to a new paradigm for development in the 1990s. The evidence confirms that the miracle economies did indeed 'do things differently'. In many instances, 'government played a big role, trade was not open and financial markets were repressed', concedes Mr Thomas. 'If we're right,' says Mr Page, 'the economic policy arsenal has many more weapons than we suspected.' Mr Thomas agrees: the lesson from east Asia is that 'you need a government guiding hand; you cannot just abdicate development to the private sector'. He predicts that the bank will pay more attention to the role of institutions and to the potential for partnerships between the public and private sectors. The most encouraging aspect of the Asian story, officials say, is that habits and institutions crucial for economic success were created rather than inherited. To raise the social standing of entrepreneurs, for example, South Korea had to overcome its Confucian traditions, which had glorified the scholar-bureaucrat. Singapore raised its savings rate from 1 per cent in 1965 to more than 40 per cent today. The implication is that sufficiently determined governments can work similar miracles in other places.</p>

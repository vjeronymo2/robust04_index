They have also proposed the  insertion of a constitutional principle on self-determination  which, along with the 33 other principles in the interim  constitution, will underpin the final constitution to be drafted  after the election.    "The constitution may give expression to any particular form  of self-determination provided there is substantial proven  support within the community concerned for such a form of  self-determination," the proposed principle states.    Government and ANC negotiators said at the weekend that the  proposal should meet the compromise demands of Afrikaner  Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] co-leader Gen  Constand Viljoen and it was now up to Viljoen to sell the  package to his constituency. However, some negotiators do not  expect the CP [Conservative Party] and AWB [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement] to accept the deal, but are hoping Viljoen will lead  the rest of the Volksfront into the elections to prove his  claims that 75 percent of Afrikaners support the demand for a  volkstaat.    A previous compromise deal on a volkstaat made between the  ANC and Viljoen was rejected at a mass meeting of the Volksfront  in Pretoria earlier this month.    Today's meeting of the negotiating council at Kempton Park  will discuss these and other government/ANC proposals aimed at  securing the Freedom Alliance's participation in the transition  process. The proposal for a volkstaat council forms part of a  new section to be inserted in the chapter of the interim  constitution dealing with traditional authorities. "There is  hereby established a volkstaat council consisting of 20 members  elected by members of Parliament who support the establishment  of an Afrikaner volkstaat," the proposal states.    The council will conduct its affairs "according to rules  made  by the council" and will service as a "constitutional mechanism"  to enable proponents of a volkstaat to pursue its establishment  constitutionally. It will, for this purpose, be permitted to:     -  Gather, process and make available information regarding  proposed boundaries, powers and functions and legislative,  executive and other structures of such a volkstaat, its proposed  relationship with government at national and provincial level  "and any other matter directly relevant to the establishment" of  the volkstaat;    -  Make feasibility and "other relevant" studies;    -  Submit representations to and advise the constitution-making  body, or constituent assembly, and the Commission on Provincial  Government "with regard to the possible establishment of a  volkstaat and any matter in connection therewith", and    -  Perform other functions as may be prescribed by an Act of  Parliament.       The proposal adds the procedures to be followed by the  volkstaat council in performing its functions will be prescribed  by Parliament. It further adds: "The procedures provided in  this constitution with regard to the finalisation of provincial  boundaries shall not be construed as preventing the  establishment of such a volkstaat, and in the event of the  acceptance of a volkstaat alternative provision shall be made by  an Act of Parliament for the finalisation of the boundaries of  any affected province or provinces."</p>

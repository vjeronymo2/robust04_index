			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK banks Amid the welter of information produced by the clearing banks this week, some trends are clear. UK bad debt provisions are on a downward trend: taking the four large clearers together they fell by 23 per cent in the first half of this year compared with the same period of 1992. The other good news was that the four managed to push up dealing profits by a collective 85 per cent. Strip this out, though, and the trend in operating income looks weak. The increase in dealing profits accounts for nearly half the gain in gross operating income. Net operating income rose by a modest 20 per cent. The stock market must now decide whether this warrants a recent sectoral outperformance far greater than at the end of the last recession. On the income side there must be doubts. Loan demand is weak and net interest receipts could be further squeezed by lower base rates. Dealing profits may hold up reasonably well, despite the general perception that they are unreliable. The prospect of exchange rate volatility combines with a positive outlook for European bond and equity markets. In such an environment, Lloyds starts to look less clever for turning its back on securities after big bang. Since interest rates look set to stay low, provisions could fall faster than in past recessions. That would compensate for slower operating profit growth than hitherto assumed. But what the banking sector badly lacks is a revival in loan demand. The kind of economic background in which that emerged would also bring higher recoveries on bad property loans. There is no sign of it yet.</p>

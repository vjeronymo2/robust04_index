			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / World Trade News: British Gas wins Indian venture BRITISH GAS has beaten competition from Europe and Asia to win exclusive rights from the Gas Authority of India to negotiate on establishing a Dollars 70m (Pounds 35.4m) joint venture to supply natural gas to Bombay. The project will use gas from the Bombay High and other offshore fields, and involves building a gas network to 600,000 businesses and households. British Gas will have a 35 per cent stake. It will also provide technical support. The deal is a boost to India's policy of encouraging joint ventures with foreign companies. For British Gas, which is being forced to cut its market share to increase competition in the UK market, the deal will help fulfil its target of improving income from its Global Gas supply business to account for 20 per cent of group earnings by the end of the decade.</p>

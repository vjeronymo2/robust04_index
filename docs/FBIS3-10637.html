			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carolina Lavoe in Caracas; from the "24 Hours" </F> newscast]    [Text] Selling the Colombian Banco Latino branch could  partially help solve the scandal caused by the embezzlement of  more than $2 billion by the bank's main branch in Venezuela.  Despite the fact that an investigation by the Venezuelan  Congress shows the Colombian Banco Latino branch operating  normally, most of its shareholders are the same people  responsible for the bank's bankruptcy in Venezuela.    [Begin Orlando Fernandez, president of the Venezuelan  Congress Banco Latino investigating commission, recording] The  Colombian Banco Latino branch shareholders are all practically  the same people who robbed the bank here in Caracas, with the  exception of certain shareholders who are front men for former  president Carlos Andres Perez. [end recording]    While the woman judge investigating the case in Venezuela is  about to issue 50 new arrest warrants, some of the alleged  culprits are in Colombian territory.    [Begin Fernandez recording] Several are in Colombia. The  wife and genius connected to all the legal machinations in  obtaining unsecured loans, loans with false documents, all the  operations carried out by front men, were made by a citizen  called Lermi Mendoza, who is in Colombia. [end recording]    On behalf of the Colombian colony of immigrants affected by  the financial catastrophe, Venezuelan Deputy Walter Marquez  pointed out the principles of reciprocity that Venezuela and  Colombia uphold.    [Begin Marquez recording] Many Colombians have been affected  by this situation. We consider this serious. Colombia must act  in reciprocity with Venezuela and deport all Banco Latino  executives under arrest in Colombia to Venezuela as part of the  principles of international cooperation. [end recording]    The Venezuelan Judicial Technical Police have executed more  than 400 raids in connection with the Banco Latino case despite  the fact that it is well-known and has been published in all the  country's media that the people who are mainly responsible for  this embezzlement are not in Venezuela.</p>

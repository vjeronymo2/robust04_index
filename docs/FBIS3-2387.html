			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, March 8 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang  Province, the country's leading silk producer and exporter, has  recovered from a slump by updating its technologies and  retooling equipment.    The silk industry, like other traditional manufacturing  sectors in Zhejiang and elsewhere in China, has been enlivened  through input of new and high technology.    Since the beginning of the 1990s, Zhejiang has focused on  the  development of industries that concentrate on high technology  and are capital intensive, and yield high added value.    High-tech development zones have been set up in this  provincial capital, the port city of Ningbo and Wenzhou, where  private enterprise thrives.    The machinery, chemicals, construction materials, textiles  and light industry sectors have achieved better product quality  and lower costs through the introduction of advanced technology.    According to Chang Jinming, deputy director of the  provincial  science and technology commission, as a province rich in labor  but short on energy, resources and transportation, the only way  for Zhejiang to gain a competitive edge in a market economy is  to bring labor resources and technology into full play.</p>

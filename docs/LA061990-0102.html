			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> REALTORS TRY HARDER AS THE SELLING LIFE GETS A LOT TOUGHER  </P> <P> Real estate agent Therese Marcus is in an enviable position. The top sales  agent in the Studio City office of Prudential California Realty last year,  Marcus will likely match her 1989 volume this year, even though the home sales  rate in the San Fernando Valley and most of the Los Angeles area has plunged  about 30%.  </P> <P> But Marcus' success won't come without a price. She's working longer hours.  She's fighting more with clients who refuse to lower their asking prices when  their homes have been on the market for months. And she won't make as much  money because she has to spend more to get the sales.  </P> <P> That's a sharp contrast to a year or two ago, when the Southern California  housing market was soaring and homes sold so fast that agents didn't have to  bother with the kinds of marketing activities typical in a "normal" market. By  the time a promotional flyer could be printed, a home was already in escrow.  </P> <P> "Now you have to do flyers, more ads, magazines, cable TV shows. I've already  spent more money, more time than last year," Marcus said.  </P> <P> Throughout the Southland, real estate agents such as Marcus are feeling the  pressures of the area's housing market slowdown.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most jarring indication that times have become tough for agents was  the recent failure of the San Fernando Valley's largest residential brokerage,  Mike Glickman Realty Inc. On June 6, Glickman closed its five offices, laid off  more than 1,200 agents and filed for bankruptcy liquidation.  </P> <P> Glickman's downfall has been largely blamed on overly rapid expansion and a  failure to change course when the market headed south. Glickman spent  extravagantly on perks for its agents and continued to give them a  larger-than-average share of commissions. That strategy became unmanageable  when the market slowed, observers say.  </P> <P> Brokerages and their agents say Glickman's failure serves as a reminder that  they must adjust to a new market reality. Now that prices have flattened,  buyers are becoming choosier and more demanding, more likely to ask sellers to  make repairs or help them obtain financing. And homes take several months to  sell -- rather than a few days or even hours. Accordingly, brokerages and  agents say basic marketing techniques and sound business practices are again  the priority.  </P> <P> "In a hot market, anybody can make money," said Marcus. But now, she said, a  good sales agent will work twice as hard to find that elusive buyer. Many  agents say they're going back to their old bag of tricks to drum up business,  including holding more open houses for prospective buyers, hosting lunches for  buyers' agents to get more exposure for their homes, and cutting their own  commissions.  </P> <P> Sellers and their agents are even offering incentives to buyers' agents, such  as free trips and cash bonuses. One listing agent offered a seven-day trip for  two to Hawaii to any agent successful in finding a buyer for a house in Encino  Park.  </P> <P> Brokerage firms say they're re-evaluating basic business practices, with an eye  toward keeping costs down and sales volume up. At Prudential California, for  example, corporate overhead is being cut in non-sales-generating areas -- by  consolidating accounting offices, for example.  </P> <P> However, Prudential is spending more on advertising and promotions. For  instance, the firm will spend $750,000 this year on a slick new magazine that  shows off its ritziest properties. It has also stepped up training for its  agents in negotiation skills.  </P> <P> The biggest firms in the Southland -- Fred Sands Realtors, Jon Douglas Co. and  Prudential -- say they're looking to lure more foreign buyers and have recently  aligned themselves with brokerages in Japan, Taiwan and Korea.  </P> <P> Some agents have also turned to foreign buyers to compensate for the lack of  local buyers. Ronald Chang, a Coldwell Banker agent in Arcadia who moved here  from Taiwan 12 years ago, specializes in marketing homes to other Asian  immigrants. He has become particularly adept at finding houses that conform to  his clients' wishes to have good fung shui, a Chinese superstition that  dictates everything from the direction a house should face to its proximity to  water.  </P> <P> But Bob LeFever, president of Prudential California Realty's Orange and San  Bernardino counties region, said these tactics still won't result in the amount  of profit that brokerages made a year or two ago. "If anyone is telling you  anything different, they're lying," he said.  </P> <P> There is evidence that an industry consolidation is already under way. Jon  Douglas, which has hired nearly half of Glickman's former agents and is  negotiating to take over the leases at some or all of Glickman's former  offices, recently acquired a small Manhattan Beach brokerage, Thomas &amp;  Associates, as well.  </P> <P> George Rathman, Prudential California's chairman, said in the past several  months he has received several calls from other real estate companies  interested in entering into joint ventures or selling out. Dana Potter, owner  of Pinnacle Estate Properties in Northridge, said he too has received calls  recently from three brokerages asking if he would be interested in acquiring  them. Roger Hance, president of the R. R. Gable Inc. brokerage firm in  Northridge, said he recently acquired a small Simi Valley brokerage and is  mulling the purchase of two other firms.  </P> <P> "It will basically be a game of who has the most wherewithal," Hance said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, many in the industry believe that if the market continues to slow in  the next several months, the dropout rate among agents will start to climb --  particularly among those who entered the business during the past few years  when the market was booming.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of people jump on the bandwagon last year and they're all crying  the blues right now," said Tara Conley, a Coldwell Banker agent in Laguna  Beach.  </P> <P> But signs of a mass exodus aren't yet evident. Both the Los Angeles Board of  Realtors and the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors say their ranks have not  declined so far this year. That's partly because many "part-time" agents keep  their licenses in weaker markets even though they might not be working. But it  is also because many companies report that they're enlarging their agent work  forces in order to keep sales volume up.  </P> <P> Brokerages "need to keep their body count up to get those listings," said Erny  Pickert Jr., president of Norton Realtors in Brentwood. Some offices are  stacking three or four agents at a desk, Pickert said. These extra agents cost  brokerages little in overhead, since most agents work as independent  contractors and are paid only their share of commissions.  </P> <P> But most agents say they're just working harder and spending more time with  sellers, trying to persuade them to lower their prices.  </P> <P> "I had an agent three years ago tell me how easy this business was," said  Bobbie Ross of Jon Douglas' Beverly Hills office. "I've been in this business  for 18 years, so I just smiled. I wonder if that agent is still working."  </P></p>

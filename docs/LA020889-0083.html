			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Financial planner Henry Gherman, who fled to the Far East last summer with  nearly $10 million in investors' money, pleaded guilty in Miami to federal  embezzlement and mail fraud charges. Under a plea bargain agreement negotiated  by federal officials and Gherman's attorney, he faces a maximum penalty of 35  years in prison. Gherman, 52, also could be fined $1.75 million. The issue of  restitution depends on bankruptcy court proceedings, according to U.S. Atty.  Jeffrey Crockett. Gherman was arrested in Tokyo in October, 1988, and was  returned to Miami last December. Court documents charged that Gherman  "willfully and unlawfully devised a scheme to defraud, obtain money and  property from clients" of Financial &amp; Investment Planning Inc. in North  Miami Beach.  </P></p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Panic could lose vote of confidence MR Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, could lose a no-confidence vote in the federal parliament today, report Laura Silber in Belgrade and Reuter in Sarajevo. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, has orchestrated a campaign to undermine the Belgrade-born California businessman since he was designated prime minister in July. The presidents of Bosnia and Croatia, allies against the Serbs, promised yesterday to halt fighting between their own troops which has turned the war in central Bosnia into a three-way fight, Reuter reports from Zagreb. Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic arrived in the Croatian capital Zagreb for an unannounced meeting with President Franjo Tudjman to discuss the Moslem-Croat fighting around the towns of Travnik, Vitez and Prozor. Near Travnik yesterday, a Croatian cameraman working for the BBC was killed when his car was hit by a mortar bomb, according to Croatian Defence Council officers. They said Mr Tihomir Tunukovic's vehicle was apparently hit by Serbian fire.</p>

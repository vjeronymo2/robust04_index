			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao  Barroso has called on the international community not to abandon  Mozambique in the current phase of the peace process. Durao  Barroso met Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] leader  Afonso Dhlakama earlier this afternoon. The former is concerned  about the withdrawal of a number of countries from the UN  contingent in Mozambique. It should be recalled that Italy  recently withdrew half of its men.    [Begin recording] [Barroso] We must draw attention to what  is  happening in Mozambique, because unfortunately there are cases  where it is only when things go wrong that people remember.  Recently we have seen tragic cases in Africa. The case now of  Rwanda is a tragic case -- tens of thousands of deaths.  Therefore, we think it is better to try to prevent things  rather than to act a posteriori. Indeed, a contribution to the  formation of the armed forces, and not just the armed forces but  also the demobilized men, a contribution to social  reintegration, even emergency aid in some areas, would be a way  of consolidating this process. [end recording]    [Announcer] Durao Barroso also presented a list of support  measures Portugal is taking to help the Mozambican electoral  process. The cost of maintaining the 4th Army battalion alone  is estimated at nearly 7 billion escudos. Afonso Dhlakama will  take back to Renamo about 50 million escudos for the electoral  campaign, from the Lisbon government.</p>

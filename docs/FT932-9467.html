			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Australian wool market started rising last week, with the market indicator rising above 407 cents following a low point the week before of 381. This week the rise accelerated, and by yesterday (May 12) 442 had been reached, with the day's increase at 25 cents. Demand has been relatively greater for Merino categories. At this stage of the season, and with stockpile wools not at present in the equation, the need to cover anything oversold has become pronounced. There is a corresponding improvement in market activity in wool processing and consuming countries.</p>

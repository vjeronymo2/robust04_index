			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--The Higher Military Court  today held a hearing in the case involving the attempt to  assassinate Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. Fifteen defendants,  including six who are still at large, face charges.    At the beginning of the hearing, the defense asked that the  case be adjourned until the investigation of the murder of the  major prosecution witness in the case, car dealer al-Sayyid  Yahya, is completed. The defense also asked that Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi appear in court to give evidence.    The presiding judge turned down the request for an  adjournment, saying that the reasons the witness was killed have  no bearing on the case. The court then heard the prosecution  attorney, who defended the constitutionality of the trial in a  military court, saying that the court is independent and  unbiased.    The prosecution attorney said the group that mounted the  attack recruited young people with the aim of sending them to  Afghanistan via Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Yemen so as to fight  communism. The young men were trained to use various weapons,  particularly explosives. After the Afghanistan war, the group's  leaders instructed members to return to their country and mount  a jihad campaign against what they claim to be an ungodly  society.    The military prosecution attorney said the group's leaders  travel to and from Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan and send  their instructions by telephone and by mail to the group's  members in Egypt.    The attorney said the centerpiece of the group's thinking is  the assertion that society and its ruler are atheist. The  group, he added, sanctions murder as a way to achieve its ends.    The prosecution attorney said the group's thinking is not on  trial; the defendants are. The defendants joined a group formed  on an unconstitutional basis, collaborated in crime, committed  first-degree murder, owned unlicensed weapons and ammunition,  and abetted fugitive criminals, he stated.    The attorney added that the defendants came to Egypt via  Libya, Jordan, and Yemen, using forged passports and  identification. They were instructed by their leadership abroad  to attack public figures including the prime minister. Acting  upon these instructions, they bought a car and blew it up as the  prime minister's motorcade was passing but failed to meet their  objective of killing the prime minister. The attorney said an  innocent child was killed in the blast, other individuals were  hurt, and several cars and buildings suffered damage.    Private citizens, including the owner of the car agency,  chased the fifth defendant, Salah al-Sayyid Sulayman, and  apprehended him. Sulayman's suspicious behavior and failure to  pay the rest of the money due for the car led to his arrest, the  attorney pointed out. The other defendants were arrested later,  the attorney said. He then described the part played by each  defendant in the case.    The attorney pointed out that Islam calls for criminals to  be  punished. Recalling the death of the innocent student in the  blast, he requested that the most rigorous sentence, the death  penalty, be passed on the defendants.    The court will hold another hearing on 26 February in which  defense lawyers will present their case.</p>

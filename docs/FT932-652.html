			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Kantor will need tact and firepower in Tokyo: Time is running out for pact on Japan-US trade, according to Michiyo Nakamoto MR Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, is known to be a fighter as well as 'a man who can bring people together in a crisis', according to an official profile. These qualities will be drawn upon this week. The US and Japan are committed to agree a broad framework for bilateral trade and economic issues before the second meeting between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on July 5. Officials from both sides locked horns in negotiation yesterday, the second set of meetings this month. In spite of recent signs of some moderation on the US side, the two countries remain wide apart on a number of issues and the chances for such a framework to be agreed in the time left look increasingly slim. The most problematic remains the US insistence that benchmarks should be set to measure progress in opening Japan's markets to imports and reducing its trade surplus. The US is urging Japan to reduce its current account surplus from 3 per cent of GNP (it is expected to reach Dollars 150bn this year) to between 1 and 2 per cent of GNP within three years. US pressure on Japan to set measurable results has raised the temperature in Tokyo as has Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's trade commissioner, who last week backed the US demand for Japan to cut its trade surplus. A young Japanese television reporter reflected the antagonism felt towards US insistence on targets in a question put to Mr Kantor when he visited Tokyo last week: 'Would it be acceptable to you,' the reporter asked, 'if Japan or any other country sets targets for reducing the US budget deficit and threatens to retaliate against you?' The question is moot, since the US budget deficit, and the need for US citizens to save more and consume less, have also been identified as important contributors to international trade tensions. The Japanese argue that measuring results is unrealistic since Japan is a free-market economy in which the government can do little to influence the course of trade. 'Will the US tell its consumers not to buy so much foreign goods?' asks a Foreign Ministry official close to the bilateral talks. 'Just as it cannot do that, so we cannot influence our economic activity to that extent.' The problem with this argument is that for many in the US it lacks credibility, since there is widespread evidence in Japan of an unusually high level of government management of the economy: 'There isn't a grain of rice in Japan that isn't managed,' says one US businessman with extensive experience in Tokyo. The recent history of US-Japan trade relations suggests that foreign pressure - called 'gaiatsu' in Japanese - and the setting of targets do produce results. In the US-Japan semiconductor agreement, a 20 per cent market share for foreign makers was achieved after a concerted effort by trade officials, and private Japanese and US companies alike, despite Japanese insistence that they were never committed to attaining that goal. In the auto parts industry, Japanese authorities have rejected US assertions that Japan promised to buy Dollars 19bn worth of US auto parts by 1994. But as the US increased the pressure, Japanese car makers have been stepping up their procurement of US-made auto parts. Japanese officials protest that trade should not be managed in that way but left to market forces. Other trading partners protest that as Japan has bowed to US pressure, so trade has been diverted at their cost. But many foreigners doing business in Tokyo see a strong need for government intervention to overcome ingrained business practices which tend to favour domestic producers: 'In Japan, there are very close links between companies that do business together,' says Mr Yoshikazu Hori, president of Cray Research Japan, the supercomputer company. Cray received orders from private Japanese companies after government pressure was applied. The Japanese authorities also accept that more needs to be done to improve transparency in the country's market and open the country further to imports. They would prefer to do so in a constructive manner, without the threat of retaliation. Discussions would be a two-way process and disputes would be put before multilateral forums such as the Gatt. So far, Japan has colonised the moral high ground by insisting that any proposals with a whiff of managed trade are unacceptable. In this, they will win the support of other trading partners, and most serious trade economists. But if they are determined to resist US demands for measurable results on the grounds that Japan is a free market economy, the country's bureaucrats will have to do much more than say so.</p>

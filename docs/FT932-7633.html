			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Tendering change planned to facilitate cost savings THE GOVERNMENT is considering proposals to change the rules on competitive tendering after a warning from contractors that confusion over the rights of employees is reducing the scope for cost saving through market testing and contracting out. The proposals, which include increasing the length of public sector contracts, have been drawn up by the Cleaning and Support Services Association, which represents public sector contractors. In a recent letter to the prime minister the association says that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, known as Tupe, have made it 'very difficult' for contractors to bid for public sector work. Where the Tupe regulations apply a contractor must take over the existing workforce at their current terms and conditions. This makes it hard to reduce labour costs, often the main source of cost savings for contractors. The prime minister has asked government departments for information about how the Tupe regulations are affecting market testing and contracting out and has promised a co-ordinated reply. The association says that if the Tupe regulations apply it is hard for the contractor to achieve cost savings in the three years which contracts commonly last. It argues that longer contracts would allow labour costs to be gradually reduced through natural wastage or negotiated reorganisation. The association says: 'The longer the contract term the greater the opportunity there is for a more competitive approach.' The association recommends a minimum of five years for contracts, with an option to extend them for a further two years before re-tendering. Other proposals from the association include amendments to the Tupe regulations to make it easier for contractors to reorganise their workforces.</p>

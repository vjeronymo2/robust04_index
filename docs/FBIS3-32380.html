			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa -- The Honduran Journalists Association  (CPH) yesterday ordered accredited professional journalists to  abandon the Presidency as a new way to show President Reina that  they deserve respect.    This resolution, which EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS will honor  and support, is a result of the very bad treatment journalists  have received not only from [Presidential Private Secretary]  Lucio Izaguirre, but also from President Reina, who labeled us  as "money changers." The following is the official communique  issued by the CPH Board of Directors.  <H5>  Communique No. 1 </H5>   The CPH Board of Directors orders all affiliates, members,  and licensed students who cover the Presidency to immediately  cease all news coverage related to Presidential House activities.    This measure will be in effect until the corresponding  authorities negotiate with the CPH to allow journalists who  cover the Presidential House to return within a framework of  dignity and responsibility. The problem will not be solved in  an atmosphere of luncheons and dinners as has been irresponsibly  suggested.    [Signed] The Board of Directors</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARKING TICKET REVENUE IN L.A.  </P> <P> I have a new proposal and idea for the parking tickets mess -- from the matter  of unpaid tickets to the ruthless enforcement of such violations -- on which  local cities depend for revenue.  </P> <P> I call it parking ticket prepayments.  </P> <P> I propose a prepayment by drivers of a sum of let's say $25 per year for any  possible violation; such drivers would be entitled to two parking violations  without having to appear in court.  </P> <P> Why not computerize such pre-payers according to their car license numbers, and  when a parking violation occurs such car owners would be notified that a ticket  was charged to their account.  </P> <P> And why not provide such pre-payers with a sticker, so that the parking ticket  enforcers would be cognizant of the pre-payer who would be given only an  account notice.  </P> <P> The point is that cities or counties would immediately reap income of millions  in prepaid revenue, and would be able to hire parking attendants and handle the  entire matter of such violations in a civilized and businesslike manner.  </P> <P> SHERMAN S. WEBER  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 7 (XINHUA) -- The issue of so-called  human rights violations in China has been fabricated for  political motives and China resolutely opposes this kind of  slander and libel on a sovereign state by others using the  pretext of human rights as a justification.    This was emphasized here today by Wang Guangya, vice deputy  of the Chinese delegation attending the fifth session of the UN  Commission on Human Rights.    "In recent years, a few Western countries and some  non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have attacked China for  what they allege are human rights violations and have frequently  tabled anti-China draft resolutions on this issue. They either  purposefully ignored the truth or know little about the real  situation in China," said Wang.    "China is the biggest developing country in the world, with  a  population approaching 1.2 billion, and is now dedicated to  economic construction to achieve a modern state. The Chinese  Government is profoundly conscious of the fact that there is an  imperative need for a stable and harmonious social environment  in order to reach this goal," he said.    He pointed out that a tumultuous China would not only mean  disaster to the Chinese people, but would also have grave  repercussions for Asia's stability, as well as the whole world.    "It is precisely because of this responsible attitude to the  Chinese people, and the world, and based on the actual  conditions within the country that the Chinese Government has  formulated, and is in the process of implementing, a policy that  has economic construction as its center-piece, stresses reform  and opening to the outside world and aims at building socialism  with Chinese characteristics.    "Facts have shown that this was the right choice and it is  now bearing fruit," he added.    "China today is experiencing rapid economic development,  political stability, harmony among nationalities, and social  advances. We are in the process of perfecting our democratic  and legal institutions, and the living standards of the people  of all our nationalities are constantly on the rise. All these  are facts which are as clear as daylight," he said.    However, he stressed, some countries and ngos turn a blind  eye to these facts and have tried to kick up a rumpus about the  so-called "human rights questions in China". This is simply to  put political pressure on China with the hope that the Chinese  people will be forced to deviate from the path of development  that they have chosen for themselves based on their own national  conditions. The Chinese people and the Chinese Government will  never accept this kind of pressure.    Speaking about the issue of so-called "human rights in  Tibet", the Chinese vice deputy emphasized that more than a  million of the Tibetan people only rid themselves of the yoke of  serfdom to become their own masters and enjoy democratic rights,  including the freedom of religious belief, after 1959, when the  Chinese Government abolished the serf system and carried out  democratic reforms in tibet.    Since then the Tibetan economy has enjoyed rapid growth, its  distinct culture given full respect and the opportunity to  develop. There has also been a marked improvement in the  livelihood of the people.    He said that the reason why some people with ulterior  motives  still ignore these facts and continue to repeat the lies that  the Chinese Government is violating human rights in Tibet is  because they are trying to use the human rights issue as the  pretext to instigate and support a handful of tibetan  separatists engaged in splitting Tibet from China.    Wang said the fact that some NGOs openly advocate an  "independent Tibet" in their public statements demonstrates  their political motive.    "That sort of activity, inciting national hatred and the  dismembering of sovereign states, has already caused turmoil,  conflict and wars in many parts of the world, constituting a  threat to regional as well as global stability and also  endangering the human rights and fundamental freedoms of  millions and millions of people. This runs totally counter to  the purpose of this commission which is the promotion and  protection of human rights." he went on.    "Safeguarding the territorial integrity and the unity of all  the nationalities in China, and rejecting any acts to foment  hatred and splits amongst them are principles embodied in the  Chinese Constitution.    "They reflect the fundamental interests of the Chinese  people  of all nationalities, including Tibetans. No attempts to break  Tibet away from the rest of China will succeed," he said.</p>

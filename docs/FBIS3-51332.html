The special measure, which is published in the official  gazette EL PERUANO, covers several provinces of the Departments  of Lima, Callao, Ancash (Andean northeast), Ucayali, Huanuco  (central jungle), and Loreto (eastern Amazon). The  corresponding decrees establish the suspension of constitutional  rights and indicate that the Armed Forces will continue to  maintain control over the previously mentioned areas.    Since the beginning of the "fratricidal war" in Ayacucho in  1980, more than 60 percent of the country has been under a state  of emergency. According to official figures, the conflict has  killed more than 26,000 people and caused more than $24 billion  in economic damage, which is equivalent to the country's foreign  debt.</p>

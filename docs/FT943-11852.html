			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Technology: Salesforce put on the record - Computers changed the way Sun Alliance International staff use information / Software at Work Salespeople are hard-working, self-motivated, gregarious and creative rather than disciplined, according to the stereotype. It follows that the typical salesperson dislikes the idea of a computerised Big Brother sales and marketing system, and would hate to record in detail every call and action. Nor would he enjoy the discipline of working from home. Not so, according to Sun Alliance International, which now has two years' experience of its sales and marketing system, known as Adam - Agency Development and Management. In the past weeks, Adam has been rolled out to the entire 170-strong salesforce, having started with 26 home workers, known as OTRs - On The Road sales staff. Although the idea of a PC-based sales system had germinated in SAI in the late 1980s, the prompt to develop Adam was an economy drive that closed 20 regional offices, and left 26 salespeople 'rootless'. According to Peter Burrows, manager of the marketing and sales department at SAI, there was a strong drive to cut expenses in 1991. 'We had a working party to examine the way we did business. What we found was a cumbersome organisational structure that had to be adjusted.' Sun Alliance International is a commercial insurance company, responsible for professional indemnity, shipping, or any insurance required by a company. Its parent Sun Alliance was founded in London in 1710, and now comprises four operating companies focused on overseas, life, UK, and international business. Much of SAI's business comes to the UK from international customers. More than 80 per cent of its business comes from a network of agents, supported by a salesforce of 140 across the UK. Their job is a long-term one of building relationships with the brokers and other intermediaries (agencies). An analysis of the business written in various small offices, such as Carlisle and Lincoln, showed that SAI could not justify the overheads. SAI kept its 10 regional centres in cities such as Glasgow, Leeds and Manchester but closed the smaller offices, and pulled out of premises shared with other Sun Alliance operations. The office closures gave SAI a timely opportunity to introduce computerised support for its sales staff. Paper-based systems were sketchy. 'The sales executive's natural instinct is not to complete records. Too often the paperwork would be incomplete, or didn't tell the whole story,' says Burrows. The mainframe will always be needed at SAI to store policy records but a PC-based system was more appropriate to people whose job means they are often on the road. For the 26 staff who suddenly had no office, the system had to make it easy to communicate and share information, and also had to be easy to monitor. Other requirements included managing large volumes of data, connecting easily with the mainframe and allowing easy updates. John Gimson, a marketing and sales manager responsible for the Adam development and implementation, looked at dozens of demonstrations. He found that few met the technical specification, and made a daring choice. Adam is an in-house adaptation of a sales system called Oxygen, developed by Integrated Sales Systems of London. At the time, ISS was new and had no comparable customers. SAI turned this to its advantage, working closely with ISS to evolve Oxygen into Adam within the seven-month deadline. Three years later, the contract has been worth Pounds 450,000 to ISS for software and consultancy. Oxygen differed from other sales packages in that it was developed from the view of field-based sales staff who need to share data with office-based colleagues. Although based on the Sybase database, widely used as a core system for building applications, ISS had built its own distributed database facilities which enable it to be adapted to large organisations with complex data distribution. Customer information is accessible by anyone: all view the same record, synchronised in an overnight update. According to Burrows: 'The beauty of a distributed database is that you can share the information across a wide range of people. Gone are the days of relying on a dusty set of papers in someone's car 100 miles away. Adam forces a discipline on people using the system: plan, action, monitor.' A series of workshops, training and planning meetings meant that the project evolved as needs became apparent. 'It was a constant learning process,' says Gimson. 'The sad thing is that, because they are nomadic, the sales person is the one most remote from changes in office technology such as the fax or the photocopier.' A large database of 4,000 agencies and 140 salespeople brought some technical problems. New methods, such as doing mass updates by modem, had to be tried out. 'We worked it through,' says Gimson. 'We believed in the system enough to resolve them en route. It was a three-way partnership - us, ISS, the IT department. If you don't get IT and users working together you will never get a working system.' Steve Ginn, the sales development manager based in East Anglia, is one of the users whose working pattern has changed. He has been using his Toshiba T1900 laptop since December: 'It has been a process of trial and error, exploring the 'safe play area' of replicated data. The system is functionally very rich.' His menu shows a task organiser, in-tray, electronic mail and standard user reports and inquiries. 'I had no idea about computers, none at home. Any approach to 'the computer' was made through others. We could all see the quality this offered straight away.' When Ginn trained, the emphasis was on sales techniques, not management. 'In 17 years with SAI, I have had various paper systems such as the Agency Record Book, but it was difficult to analyse the information. This has given me a far more structured approach, with full analysis and summaries - you couldn't do that with a card index.' He can analyse work on current campaigns and see instantly how long it is since he contacted clients. Currently seconded elsewhere for three months, Ginn has used Adam to append notes to the agency records for his account 'care-takers'. SAI's three-year budget for the project of Pounds 200,000 a year has been financed from the savings made by closing offices. Every user now has a PC containing the Adam database. Some were implemented on existing PCs, but SAI had to spend around Pounds 250,000 on 100 laptops, 80 modems and the central server. There have already been two hardware upgrades: one to an IBM RS/6000, another to 486-based laptops with faster communications. The initial software cost Pounds 270,000, but has been upgraded twice with Pounds 50,000 worth of extensions to store further marketing information, including industry coding for market sectors. 'One of the fundamentals of selling is an understanding of the customers' needs,' says Ginn. 'Once we know the customer sectors, we can start working more closely in partnership with brokers: the customer sees a far more professional approach.' Because of the office closures, SAI was not in a position to pick and choose the subjects of its first pilot scheme in April 1992. Now, two years later, and a few weeks after rolling out its system to the rest of its 170 staff, Gimson and Burrows see it as an advantage that it could not hand pick its guinea pigs. The challenge of winning round disaffected staff was invaluable in preparing them for the wider challenge to come. They trained total novices on the keyboard, and worked to put at rest the fears of those who felt they were 'expelled' from the cosy support of their office. The system has had its success stories: one user whose performance once gave cause for concern has become a home-worker and an enthusiastic and effective Adam user. 'You've got to open people's eyes to what the technology can do for them, and you can't do that overnight,' says Burrows. 'The vast majority, now they have seen it in action, see myriad advantages. Adam converts task response into customer care, and that is what the technology can help us do.'</p>

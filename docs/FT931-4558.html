			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India opens door to private mining investors IN A dramatic policy U-turn, the Indian federal government has decided to allow private sector participation in the exploration for and mining of 13 minerals hitherto reserved to public sector operations. The minerals are iron ore, manganese, chrome, sulphur, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel and the platinum group. Under the new order, Indian public and private sector mining companies will be allowed 50 per cent foreign equity participation on an automatic basis. But the government will be ready to sanction higher foreign capital participation depending on the merits of each case. However, mineral and metal processing units with any level of foreign equity will now be allowed to develop captive mines (mines tied to metal processors). While the new national mineral policy is part of India's economic reform programme, it is also a response to the need to introduce foreign technology and funds to develop 'world grade mines to produce minerals at internationally competitive rates'. India has had success in recent years in discovering new mineral deposits through modern exploration techniques, but the public sector, in many cases, could not mobilise resources to develop mines. For example, Hindustan Copper, India's only copper producer, was forced to postpone the development of Malanjkhand underground copper ore mine with estimated reserve of 275m tonnes because of lack of finance. Things may now look up for Hindustan Copper and other public sector undertakings. According to Mr Balram Singh Yadav, minister of state for mines, the government has received a good number of enquiries for mineral exploration from leading mining companies in the US, Australia, South Africa and Canada. The government is hoping that joint ventures with foreign companies as partners will focus on the exploitation of those minerals in which the country is deficient or does not have exportable surpluses. An objective of the new policy is to promote the export of Indian minerals with as much value added as possible.</p>

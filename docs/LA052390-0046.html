			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GALLEGLY TAKES TO THE AIR TO REBUT TV ADS;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGNS: NEITHER THE CONGRESSMAN NOR HIS OPPONENT, SANG KORMAN, ADVERTISED ON  TELEVISION WHEN THEY FACED EACH OTHER IN 1988.  </P> <P> In an unusual switch in campaign tactics, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley)  is planning an 11th-hour barrage of cable television commercials intended to  rebut TV ads he says are vicious run by his primary-election opponent, Sang R.  Korman.  </P> <P> Gallegly declined Tuesday to disclose most details of the commercials,  including how much they will cost. But station officials said he has paid at  least $14,800 for time on four cable systems in the 21st Congressional  District, which spreads from northern and western portions of the San Fernando  Valley into southern and central Ventura County.  </P> <P> Korman, a wealthy Korean-American developer, recently began airing a $120,000  series of three commercials -- on cable and local network TV channels -- that  attack Gallegly's voting record. Korman plans two more spots before the June 5  election, including one that criticizes Gallegly for his role in an internal  FBI investigation of four Los Angeles-based agents, a campaign spokesman said.  </P> <P> Television ads are a new tactic for both candidates, neither of whom used them  when they faced each other in the 1988 primary. Korman captured less than 14%  of the vote in that race, despite spending $350,000, including $245,000 of his  own money.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-area congressional candidates typically frown on commercials,  especially on network TV channels, because of their high cost and scattershot  impact. They normally prefer cheaper methods, such as direct-mail brochures,  that can be targeted at individual voters.  </P> <P> Gallegly said his commercials will be financed primarily from donations brought  in by an urgent fund-raising letter his campaign mailed to supporters last  week. He has purchased enough air time between Tuesday and the primary for more  than 800 spots.  </P> <P> "When someone is doing a vicious attack on you, the idea is to try to mitigate  those untruths with some truths," he said.  </P> <P> Korman angrily responded that his spots "totally disclose the truth of his  voting record."  </P> <P> In one Korman ad, Gallegly is criticized for voting to "give savings and loan  associations free hand in their junk bond schemes" -- a reference to Gallegly's  1989 vote against legislation that would have prohibited federally insured  S&amp;Ls from investing in bonds rated below investment grade.  </P> <P> A Gallegly spokesman said the congressman voted against the bill because he  believed it "unfairly penalized solvent S&amp;Ls for making investments."  </P> <P> Korman said he plans to begin airing another commercial attacking Gallegly for  his role in an internal FBI investigation of four Los Angeles-based agents in  1987 and 1988. Korman has accused Gallegly of filing complaints against the  agents that sparked the probe and lying to cover up his instigation of it.  Gallegly denies filing any complaints.  </P> <P> GOP political consultant Paul Clarke said that although Korman's attacks have  hurt Gallegly politically, the damage isn't severe enough for Korman to win.  Clarke said Gallegly's commercials were a prudent response to Korman's attacks  and may actually help him raise more money than he would have been able to had  the race been less heated.  </P> <P> "I don't want to sound cynical and say it's manna from heaven, but from a  fund-raising perspective, it gives Elton a reason to raise funds," Clarke said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, 26 Jun (PANA) -- Mr. Christian Sendegeya,  deputy speaker of the National Assembly, has resigned from his  post, it was learned here today from an official source. The  announcement of this resignation, which observers say is a  surprise, was made by Interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya  during a news conference held to mainly brief the press on the  presidential investiture expected to take place before 12 July  -- date on which interim period expires -- in conformity with  the Constitution.    Mr. Sendegaya is the deputy of Kayanza Province -- located  in  northern Burundi -- which recently was the scene of armed  clashes that left dozens of civilians dead. He is also the  author of the cassette: "Inciting Ethnic Hatred," according to  the terms of a suit filed in court by Mr. Charles Mukasi,  chairman of the former sole party, the Unity and National  Progress Party [Uprona], which is now the parliamentary  opposition.    This unprecedented gesture in Burundian political practices  will bring back into parliament the 16 Uprona deputies who had  been boycotting the Assembly's sessions to protest the  statements made by Christian Sendegeya on his tape, according to  observers. The Uprona representatives had said they would  return to parliament on condition that Sendegeya withdraws his  statements.    The National Assembly comprises 81 members, 65 of whom are  members of the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU). It is  expected to appoint by consensus a head of state -- following  discussions between the opposition and the ruling power -- to  replace President Cyprien Ntaryamira who was killed on 6 April  in a plane crash in Kigali. Rwandan President Juvenal  Habyarimana was also killed in that plane crash.    Mr Ntaryamira's predecessor, Melchior Ndadaye, first  democratically elected Burundian president, was killed on 21  October 1993 in an unsuccessful military coup attempt.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mia Doornaert: "Russia and NATO"] </F>   [Text] On Wednesday [22 June], Russia, unless it has any  further surprises in store, is to sign the PFP [Partnership for  Peace] with NATO. The alliance is pleased at this development.  At the same time, Russia's membership in this cooperation  project, to which 20 Central and East European countries have  already signed up, does not mean an end to a dilemma for NATO  and now also for the European Union (EU): How to reconcile the  legitimate endeavors by the countries of Central and East Europe  to join the West with a relationship with Russia that  acknowledges that country's specific and special importance?    This is a very real dilemma, one that is papered over but  not  solved by the PFP. The PFP gives the impression that the United  States, West Europe, Central and East Europe, and Russia share  the same interest in a new political and security order in  Europe. In fact that is most certainly not the case.    To start with, the countries of Central and East Europe want  to join NATO and the EU as soon as possible. Russia, on the  other hand, wants to retain the old dividing line of the Cold  War era for as long as possible, and continues to claim a sphere  of influence in East Europe.    With respect to a balance of power, it is perfectly  understandable that Russia is seeking to maintain the earlier  status quo for as long as possible, until it is again  economically, politically, and militarily stronger. But NATO  and the EU have no interest at all in keeping Central and East  Europe in a kind of no man's land for an indefinite period as  this would then threaten to once again become an area of  conflict between the Russian sphere of influence on the one hand  and Germany as the major Central European power on the other.  The consequences of that could again prove disastrous.    Russia is perhaps trying to play Germany off against its  NATO  and EU partners. But such a power play, totally rejected by the  German leaders, would not only be damaging for NATO and the EU,  but also for stability throughout the continent.    Russian membership in the PFP does not solve this dilemma.  And the PFP will in fact be counterproductive if it continues  to keep alive the illusion that NATO's and Russia's interests  are one and the same.    A clear formulation of differences in approach, aims, and  interests would not amount to a "lack of respect" for Russia,  something that Russia is always so quick to claim. On the  contrary, a realistic approach would provide the basis for a  mature cooperation, the limits to which would be clearly set.  One of these limits must be that Russia should no longer be  entitled to use a veto against countries that are still  wrestling with the legacy of 40 years of Soviet occupation.    It is good that the West is not giving the weakened Russia a  free ride. But massaging the bruised Russian ego, and this is  largely what the "special status" recently awarded to Russia  among the G-7 is all about, does not boil down to policy-making.  The same criticism applies to NATO and its PFP. It also  applies to the EU which is to hold a summit in Corfu next week.  With EU enlargement, Russia's so-called near abroad is also  increasingly the EU's near abroad. And that calls for an EU  policy that is more than the wishful thinking of which the PFP  is indicative.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- The first round of the  debate by the State Duma (lower house of the Russian parliament)  of the Russian president's draft decision on amnesty in  connection with the adoption of the Russian Constitution ended  in a deadlock.    Several votes on various draft decisions by the Duma showed  that the overwhelming majority of legislators rejected the  president's draft in the form it was submitted.    Quite a number of critical remarks were levelled at the  presidential document during the debate. Some deputies claimed  that the amnesty in question will aggravate the situation in the  country, although data from Interior Ministry specialists  refuted these claims.    However, the prevailing demand was to divide amnesty into  criminal and politico-economic and to adopt two documents: the  presidential draft concerning criminal wrong-doings and the  Duma's draft on political amnesty as well as amnesty to people  convicted for economic crimes.    "It was clear from the very beginning for the legislation  committee that the president's initiative would not pass as it  is," its Chairman Vladimir Isakov said at the end of the morning  session.    In Isakov's opinion, "lawmakers are now facing an  alternative  of whether to reject the presidential draft completely or amend  it, taking two decisions: on criminal and political amnesties,"  he added.    A two-hour interval has been announced in the Duma sessions.  Factions will hold consultations to hammer out new draft  decisions of the lower chamber. These drafts will be put to  vote at the evening session.    Under a political amnesty for the sake of national  reconciliation, lawmakers understand, above all, an amnesty to  people involved in the events of August 19 and 21, 1991, May 1  and October 3-4, 1993.    Some claim that the question on amnesty to participants in  the October events may be raised only after the parliamentary  commission on their investigation completes its work.    The presidential draft decision has already been published  in  the press. In the opinion of many deputies this fact makes them  hostages of the present situation.    "If we adopt the document, we'll be accused of rampant  crime.  If we reject the document, mass riots will take place in  penitentiaries. The blame will be again laid at the Duma's  door," said legislator Vassiliy Lipitsky.</p>

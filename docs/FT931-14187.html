			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US 'lacks systematic strategy on exports' THE US lacks a systematic government-wide export strategy, which leads to poor co-ordination between export promotion agencies. The US general accounting office, the investigative arm of Congress, has concluded this in a new report. The report, on the role of the US Eximbank, which supported Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 7.9bn) of US exports in 1991, adds that while the bank has made 'significant efforts' to improve delivery of its services, the fragmentation of export promotion services among 10 separate agencies results in overlaps and gaps, and 'tends to be confusing to the US business community', especially smaller companies. The report makes no specific recommendations, but follows hard on a GAO report highly critical of the management of US agricultural loan guarantee programmes, which it says are costly, and cannot prove productive. 'The US government does not have reasonable assurances in today's tight budget environment that its export promotion funds and staff are most effectively used to emphasise sectors, regions and programmes with the greatest potential return,' the report says. It points to the absence of 'one-stop shops' for US exporters. It is however, encouraged by the creation in 1990 of the Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee to 'unify and streamline' export promotion efforts, and in particular the formalisation of the TPCC by last year's Export Enhancement Act, which calls on the government to develop government-wide plans for federal trade promotion. The report calls for specific efforts by Eximbank to 'ferret out where demand for additional financing exists'. It also calls for Eximbank to consult exporters systematically on the use by foreign competitors of tied aid, which the US government is active in trying to discourage. The bank has a 'war chest' of up to Dollars 150m a year to aid US exporters facing tied aid-funded competition, but has used the full sum in just one of the past six years.</p>

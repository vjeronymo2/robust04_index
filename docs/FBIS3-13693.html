In a statement it issued today, the NPUG notes with deepest  feelings of resentment that this U.S. statement in support of  the policy of aggression and the annexation of the occupied  territories comes at a time when world public opinion is  unanimously condemning the criminal massacre that Israel  committed at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    The NPUG called on the Arab League and the Islamic  Conference  Organization to adopt a firm stand on this new escalation of the  attacks on the rights and dignities of the Arabs and Muslims.</p>

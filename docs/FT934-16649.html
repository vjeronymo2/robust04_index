			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nintendo reduces profits forecast NINTENDO, the Japanese electronic game maker, has conceded that its decade of growth had ended, as it cut a pre-tax profit forecast to Y121bn (Pounds 759m) from Y170bn for the year to March, down 26 per cent on a year earlier. Super Mario, the company's mascot, was brought down by a strong yen, which undermined sales in foreign markets. Sales for the year are projected at Y500bn, down from the forecast of Y600bn, and 11 per cent lower than last year. The Kyoto-based company had earned more last year than Matsushita, Japan's largest consumer electronics maker, and had been confident that the rapid international growth of video games would continue. Nintendo set successive profit records by keeping the core workforce at 890 employees, contracting out much of the product development and successfully marketing and controlling the flow of software. The company faces increasing competition from Sega Enterprises, another Japanese maker, which has been prepared to cut prices and has surpassed Nintendo in developing game technologies. Nintendo intends to cut its reliance on exports in the second half and launch a sales drive on the domestic market, where it has been hindered by a slowing economy: 'In the first half, our export ratio was 59 per cent of sales, but we expect that it will fall to 42 per cent in the second half.' It is preparing to make equipment in China, but said the positive effect on costs would 'not be seen this year'. Sun goes down, Page 28</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chilean Agriculture Under Secretary Alejandro  Gutierrez said: "Chile is very interested that the Cairns Group  continue to function because we believe its participation in the  GATT Uruguay Round was very successful."    Now that the GATT Uruguay Round has concluded, the Chileans  want to see "how it is applied in the rest of the world, and  this is why the Cairns Group must continue to function as a base  for the dissemination of information and for action for other  countries, especially the industrialized countries."    The special Chilean mission continues in Uruguay to overcome  the problems that have occurred with the export of Uruguayan  meat. These problems pertain to the expiration of the operation  permits for the meat packing plants and not to problems in the  quality of the product, as was mentioned originally.    In this respect, Gutierrez said that in his country "there  is  a new law and this is why the rules and regulations are quite  strict," and this is also why "the same standard [preceding word  in English] that is being applied to those who supply us from  other countries is now being applied to the cattlemen here."    It is the view of Chilean authorities that "different rules  and regulations cannot be applied to the suppliers," and this  why "the Chilean agricultural mission is now working in Uruguay  to draft a report."    He explained that Chile wants "the typifying rules and  regulations to be complied with, and that the political  agreements between the two countries also be observed."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 February (NA) -- The national  government will again seek to convince Cordoba Province Governor  Eduardo Angeloz to sign the fiscal pact. The government will  offer him the possibility of reactivating Cordoba's Military  Aircraft Factory (FMA) through a substantial investment.    Apparently, the idea that Angeloz will finally agree to sign  the pact became of paramount importance at the moment of  defining which enterprise will be chosen within the framework of  the bid opened by the Defense Ministry to modernize the 36  Skyhawk A4M planes.    Although the Smith Industries company had signed a letter of  intent (and already charged $3 million to replace hoses and  repaint the 36 planes that had been idle in the Arizona desert),  the U.S. Lockheed company was chosen.    The government chose this company in view of the financing  it  offered for the payment of the loan, which include two years  grace and the possibility of having Argentine and U.S. experts  repair 18 of the 36 planes at the factory in Cordoba.    As a result of this important investment at the Cordoba  plant, Argentina will have more possibilities of winning the bid  opened by the Vought company in the United States for the  manufacture of the Pampa 2000 planes.    This is not improbable because the Vought lobby [preceding  word in English] in Washington represents the interests of the  U.S. Pratt and Whitney companies, as well as the well-known  Allis Signal company.    AMBITO FINANCIERO published on 14 February that the Bell  company is also interested in manufacturing helicopters in the  facilities of Cordoba's FMA. Thus, a civilian-military  aeronautic center of strategic importance for Latin America  would be created in Cordoba.    The Air Force will not object to the participation of the  Lockheed Aircraft company in the project because it will attract  large benefits for the FMA. Initially, however, the Air Force  favored the Smith Industries company in view of its work in New  Zealand and Kuwait.    Furthermore, this will give the Argentine Government an  excellent tool to convince Angeloz of the "advantages" that  signing the fiscal pact would represent for Cordoba.</p>

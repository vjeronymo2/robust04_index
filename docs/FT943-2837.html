			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market pleased by BP The oil majors continued to attract heavy two-way activity, with British Petroleum, as had been expected, delivering all and more of the good exploration news that the market had been looking for at its meeting with analysts in London, and Shell Transport satisfying all but the super optimists with its interim payment. BP's presentation coincided with news of an exciting gas discovery off the coast of Vietnam, a story which had been circulating in the market for some time, and went down very well with analysts. One of the leading oil sector researchers described the presentation, delivered by Mr John Browne, head of BP's exploration and production, as the best he had ever attended and the first time BP 'has ever demonstrated a credible long term growth plan in exploration; in the past, BP has talked about managing a decline in its exploration business, today it was full of information on its expansion plans'. Another analyst said he was 'well satisfied' with the presentation but added that he would like to see evidence of renewed US support for BP shares. BP will deliver the same message to US investors today. BP ended 3 up at 420 1/2 p on turnover of 9.3m. Shell improved marginally to 722 1/2 p.</p>

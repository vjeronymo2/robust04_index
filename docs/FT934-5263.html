			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (22): Washington's would-be power players THE HOLLOW CORE: PRIVATE INTERESTS IN NATIONAL POLICY MAKING by John Heinz, Edward Laumann, Robert Nelson, Robert Salisbury Harvard University Press, Pounds 31.95 450 pages This book addresses the role of lobbyists in government, and the interaction between business and the governing process, in the US context. The number of registered lobbyists in Washington has increased from 3,000 in 1965 to nearly 25,000 today, and the number of major corporations operating DC offices has risen from 50 in 1961 to almost 1,000 now. This lobbying explosion has produced a rash of academic and journalistic comment, most of which effectively argues that lobbyists are now 'The Third House of Congress', or even the most dominant. Hollow Core is by far the most comprehensive (to the point of overkill) survey yet of the Washington lobbyists' life and work. It is not easy to read. The monumental scale of the research perhaps renders that inevitable, but the authors' decision to place large chunks of their mathematical methodology within the body of the text, rather than in appendixes marked 'for statistics freaks only', is regrettable given that often what the book does is provide confirmation of what intuitive common sense suggests anyway. This means that on those occasions where the methodology provides ground-breaking material, the reader may be too confused to appreciate the significance of the discoveries. If this means that the book is read more in specialist academic circles than the wider corporate community, it would be a pity. The essence of the book is interviews with 776 Washington representatives/lobbyists in four major domestic policy arenas - agriculture, energy, health, and labour - conducted in 1982 and 1983, supplemented by further interviews and questionnaires aimed at the bodies which hire the lobbyists (frequently business) and the government officials (congressional and/or executive) who the lobbyists approach. Added to this is an analysis of policy initiatives in the four domains during the 1977-1982 period. From this admirably deep range a much more complete and credible analysis about the way modern Washington works emerges than in so many previous accounts. Dozens of important observations are made. Many confirm existing assumptions that there is a strong correlation between the number of notable contacts a lobbyist has and the fee they command; and that a specific background in the (especially congressional) body one is lobbying appears related to final success. Other findings test popular wisdom. Most lobbyists are policy specialists, not freelance 'hired guns' who work on any side for a fee. A great deal of their work is not advocacy but simply monitoring and highlighting government activity, and its potential implications, for their clients. The central thesis is that there is 'little evidence to suggest that a powerful role is played by intermediaries - by more or less autonomous actors who are able to use their personal influence to promote compromise or impose settlements.' In other words, it is not true that lobbyists are at the policy-brokering centre of modern Washington politics. That is the good news. The bad news is the finding that nobody else occupies that central position either. The authors portray a governmental system engaged in continual activity but beset by endemic uncertainty and making a fundamentally incrementalist impact on public policy. The authors argue that the absence of such mediating institutions represents 'hollow cores' in American domestic politics which go a long way to explaining the extraordinarily turbulent system of the last two decades. One suspects that many of those who entered the Clinton administration at the beginning of this year might say 'Amen'. The reality of this mass market of uncertainty for business is that more and more corporations may feel obliged to create or build-up their own influence-generating efforts to try and best position themselves. The lobbying industry will be the beneficiary.</p>

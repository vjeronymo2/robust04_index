			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US gold production to rise by 5 per cent US GOLD production will rise by 5 per cent compared with 1992 to 10.3m troy ounces this year, according to Metals Economics Group, the Canadian consultancy concern, which based its forecast on company projections. This follows a 14 per cent or 1.2m ounce jump last year, nearly half of which came from a doubling of production at American Barrick Resources' Goldstrike mine in Nevada. Nevada continued to dominate US gold output last year with 48 mines producing 6.5m ounces or two-thirds of the total. California's 14 mines produced just over 1m ounces.</p>

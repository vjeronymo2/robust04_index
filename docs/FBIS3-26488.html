			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Chao-chi (0151 0340 0679): "High-Level Talks Will Be </F> Held Between the Two Sides of the Strait"]    [Excerpt]  <H3>  There Will Be High-Level Talks Between the Two  Sides of the Strait </H3>   "There is likely to be high-level contact between the  decision-making hierarchies on both sides of the strait later  this year," a senior official told this reporter in Beijing.    "High-level, naturally, means higher than the level of  either  Wang-Koo talks or Chiao-Tang talks. Under the current  situation, playing for time is unfavorable to Taiwan and the  international environment is also unfavorable to it. In recent  months, Sino-U.S. relations have taken a turn for the better,  China and France have normalized their relations, Lesotho has  restored diplomatic relations with China, and South Africa is  deliberating the issue of establishing diplomatic relations  soon. As far as Taiwan is concerned, the closer Hong Kong gets  to 1997, the greater will be the impact on Taiwan. Furthermore,  the drastic increase in contacts between the two sides of the  strait has made it impossible for them not to talk to each  other. The higher the level of talks, the bigger the issues  which can be solved and the easier it will be for Taiwan to  extricate itself from a passive situation." In short, "so long  as we sit down and hold talks, everything can be discussed." The  senior official further said: "Since the reorganization of the  Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs, with Jiang Zemin  taking over from Yang Shangkun as head, Qian Qichen as deputy  head, and Wang Zhaoguo handling routine work, new people have  new work styles. Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping's policy  decision, China's work toward Taiwan will forge ahead more  quickly this year."  <H3>  Before the "Cultural Revolution," Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai  Contacted Taiwan on the Issue of Reunification Through a Certain  Channel </H3>   For many years past, Luo Qingchang was responsible for both  the central investigation department and the work toward Taiwan,  the two sensitive departments of the CPC. He disclosed that,  before the "Cultural Revolution," Mao and Zhou contacted Taiwan  through a certain channel to discuss the issue of reunification.  The contact was later suspended as a result of the "Cultural  Revolution." In 1994, contacts between the two sides of the  strait have increased in every aspect and the level is also  higher. Further talks and consultations at a high level have  become an irresistible trend.    Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations  Across  the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], also looks forward to meeting Koo  Chen-fu again this year to solve differences, consolidate  achievements, widen the scope of consensus, and to make  preparations to hold a joint economic fair. He hopes that, in  marching toward a new century, we should not, due to political  differences, bungle the good opportunity of bringing benefits to  the Chinese nation.  <H5>  "Vacationing Diplomacy" Draws the Attention of the CPC </H5>   As cross-strait exchanges increase in frequency, the level  of  contacts has also higher. Early this year, Zhou Guangzhao,  president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a member of the  CPC Central Committee, and Nan Zhenzhong, deputy president and  editor in chief of XINHUA News Agency, visited Taiwan in turn  leading the delegations, and ARATS and the Straits Exchange  Foundation [SEF] have also started new contacts. Following the  secret meeting between Chang Chien-pang, member of the  Kuomintang [KMT] Central Standing Committee, and Jiang Zemin,  high-level Taiwan personnel are again deliberating on new trips  to the mainland.    In the meantime, however, Taiwan "President" Li Teng-hui,  "Executive Yuan President" Lien Chan, "Economic Planning and  Development Council" Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang, "Information  Bureau" chief Hu Chih-chiang, and others have been, or are  going, to Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia in the name of  "spending their vacations" to "coordinate and adjust policies"  and "pursue pragmatic diplomacy."    Taiwan's recent "vacationing diplomacy" and "south-bound  policy" have drawn the close attention of the CPC. Wang  Zhaoguo, director of the Central Office for Taiwan Affairs and  head of the United Front Work Department, has criticized Taiwan  for attempting to create, under the pretext of solving practical  affairs, the so- called "independent sovereignty" and "equal  judicial jurisdiction" to attain the objective of "two equal  political entities."  <H3>  Deng Xiaoping Reaffirms That Taiwan Will Not Be Allowed To  Become Independent </H3>   Deng Xiaoping said: The problem with Li Teng-hui is that he  practices "two Chinas." "One China, one Taiwan," "one country,  two governments," "independent political entity," and even the  recent "vacationing diplomacy" are all manifestations of overtly  and covertly practicing "two Chinas," which is, naturally,  unworkable.   <H5>    Beijing Works Out Policies in Light of Taiwan's Reality </H5>   China's basic policies regarding Taiwan work are "one  China,"  "peaceful reunification," and "one country, two systems." In  the view of the CPC, there is only one China in the world and  the central government is in Beijing. This is a precondition  for a peaceful solution of the Taiwan issue. The "two systems  coexist" under "one country," with Taiwan and the mainland  preserving their own original system. They should "coexist for  a long time and attain common development, with neither  swallowing the other." Under the present circumstances, however,  the CPC will never renounce the use of force against Taiwan.  Especially if foreign forces interfere in Taiwan's internal  affairs and Taiwan breaks away and becomes independent, it is  even more necessary to be prepared. Now, if the central  authorities renounce the use of force, it would hamper  reunification and the Taiwan independence forces will become  even more dizzy with success.    As the CPC top hierarchy sees it, in light of the latest  developments in Taiwan, it is necessary to realistically  understand changes in Taiwan's situation today. The elderly KMT  party, government, and army leaders, who retreated to Taiwan in  1949, have withdrawn from the political arena one after another.  Those in charge in Taiwan today are from the third and fourth  generations. Many of them are either native Taiwanese or were  born in Taiwan. They are profoundly affected by Western  influence in terms of education, culture, and ideology. This  generation is different from the previous "older-level" figures  and so the Chinese side should approach them differently.  Having a thousand and one links with the mainland, the  "older-level" figures of the KMT have a strong anti- Communist  feeling. The new generation, however, has fewer ties with the  mainland and they hold weaker anti-Communist sentiments. Their  local mentality and their concept of "Taiwan first" are more  conspicuous but they should not on this count be regarded as  engaging in "Taiwan independence."  <H5>  Carry Out Contacts With All Parties and Factions </H5>   According to the CPC top hierarchy, given the party politics  in Taiwan, the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] has a certain  number of supporters. Under this new situation, in its work  toward Taiwan, the CPC should not just have dealings with the  KMT but should have contacts with all parties and factions,  including the DPP and the New Party and, in the process of  contact and work among them, try to quicken the pace of China's  reunification.  <H3>  Make Preparations for Direct Shipping By Setting Up an  Economic and Trade Coordination Group </H3>   Given that China's comprehensive national power and people's  economic life are continuously improving, the cross-strait  business has accelerated, and exchange visits have drastically  increased, the CPC top hierarchy has suggested that the State  Council should speedily set up a Taiwan Economic and Trade  Coordination Group to coordinate business affairs with Taiwan  and create a better investment environment. In light of the  increasingly close cross- strait business contacts, the central  authorities have agreed to the setting up of a joint venture  bank and, in keeping with the latest development in the  situation, to make all preparations for three communications,  further boost peace talks through trade, exchange, and contact,  and strive for the early reunification between the two sides of  the strait.

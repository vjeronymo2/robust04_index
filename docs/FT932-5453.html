			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (10): Perplexing facet of industrial miracle / Profile of Posco The Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Company (Posco) illustrates to perfection the perplexing nature of the Korean industrial miracle. The company was set up by the government in 1968 as part of a hugely ambitious plan to make Korea a global force in heavy industry. It was headed from the outset by a career army officer who ran it - with massive government backing - on strict military lines. Last year, when the new democratic government took over, he abruptly resigned. It sounds a classic story of Third World grandeur gone wrong. The reality is quite different. Posco is the world's third-biggest steel producer, behind Nippon Steel of Japan and Usinor Sacilor of France and ahead of British Steel. The French and British companies have recently announced heavy losses while Nippon Steel has forecast a collapse in profits. Posco, a decently profitable company with a conservative balance sheet, increased its net earnings last year by more than a quarter. Then again, Posco's rivals do not have its domestic market. The Pohang mill is less than an hour's drive away from the world's biggest shipyard and the world's biggest car plant. Demand for steel in Korea is slowing. But according to Mr Chung Tam, a steel analyst with the broking firm BZW in Seoul, it should still grow at about 10 per cent a year for the rest of the decade. 'Demand for steel has always outpaced supply in Korea', he says. 'That's expected to continue.' Posco is not necessarily counting on it. Last October it completed its second steel mill - again, the world's biggest - at Kwangyang on Korea's south coast. But Mr Chung Myung Sik, Posco's chairman, says: 'The phase of rapid steel expansion is already over. We're not going to build any more steel capacity in Korea.' Instead, Posco will continue its recent policy of diversifying into areas as remote as telecommunications, construction and agrochemicals. In this, it is imitating its Japanese rivals. But they are driven to it by the need to employ their redundant steel workers. They are also for the most part losing money in their new activities. Posco is not under the same obligation. There is another paradox. Korea's big conglomerates, the chaebol, are under pressure from the government to focus their activities more closely. Posco, a highly-focused company still largely controlled by the government, is going the other way. 'We believe', says Mr Chung, 'that we should enter areas where we have expertise. Our cash flow is substantial and we have large manpower resources and an extensive R&amp;D capability. We're looking for areas to utilise our capital, our manpower and our technology.' But what does a steel company know about telecoms, for example? Plenty, says Mr Chung. Posco has its own very large and sophisticated communications system. Or construction? 'We have our own highly developed construction and engineering management team. Their capacity far surpasses any other company in Korea. If we don't use them, they'll wither away.' So how far will the balance shift away from steel in the long run? 'We don't have a specific goal or time-frame. But steel is presently 95 per cent of our turnover. It would be quite realistic to see it coming down to 70 per cent by the end of the century.' The other question which looms large for Posco is its relationship with the government. Last October, the founder, Mr Park Tae-Joon, resigned abruptly. His successor as chairman was then voted out at the AGM: and the chief shareholder is the government, which still owns 35 per cent of the shares and controls another 20 per cent or so through the banks. Then the government, in a familiar Korean tactic, sent in the tax authorities for the first extensive tax audit in Posco's history. Is Posco the subject of a witch-hunt? Absolutely not, says Mr Chung. 'That's unfounded speculation, and misleading. Clearly, our former chairman was involved in politics. But if this tax audit is exhaustive, and clears the company, it could be what the company needs. It's only a three-month survey of our tax position. Others have been longer, and we're a big company. I'd urge the tax authorities to take as much time as they need.' Has there been any change in management strategy? 'The long-term policy of not growing in volume steel was already there. There's no basic change in that. But in the way the company is managed, there will be substantial change. The first 25 years saw a continuous expansion of the corporation. The management style was top-down. In the next 25 years, the present management think we need fuller utilisation of the manpower which constitutes the company. We will change away from the military-style leadership of the past. We have reached the stage where that emphasis on leadership is counter-productive. The company needs to be more creative and participative. There has been a feeling among the workforce that creative thinking has been stifled and that participation has been blocked off. We need to use that potential.' All this is put in context back at the Pohang mill. A senior executive criticises the workforce for its insubordinate attitudes. Why, he says, they have even started objecting to wearing off-duty uniforms on their way to and from work. Clearly, if Posco wants to shed its military image, it has some way to go.</p>

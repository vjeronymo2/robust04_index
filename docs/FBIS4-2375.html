			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Tan Jianrong: "Hosokawa's Resignation </F> Deepens Political Turmoil"]    [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's sudden announcement today to resign because of his  alleged financial deals sent shock waves throughout Japan and  further deepened the country's political turbulence, observers  say.    Hosokawa's decision was triggered by further revelations  yesterday of his earlier financial deals and delays in the Diet  (parliament) debate over the country's 1994 fiscal policy, which  has been stalled for over a month.    It could also speed up the polarization of the seven-party  ruling coalition, already on the verge of division.    Public attention is now focused on who will be named to  succeed Hosokawa, who took office last August, whether his  coalition can retain its clamp on power and whether his action  will prompt a major political regrouping.    The coalition is fast polarizing into two groups --  Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito [Clean Government Party] and  their supporters in Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) on the one  hand, and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the United  Socialist Democratic Party (USDP) and their JNP backers on the  other.    Observers say if the division becomes permanent, Hosokawa,  still JNP leader, and Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito co-leader, may  abandon the latter group and seek out opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) members who are critical of the ability  of their party leadership to form a new government.    If this forecast materializes, Japan's political  reorganization would sweep into act 2 of a drama which began  last summer with the ending of the LDP's 38-year-long grip on  power.    The Diet was sent into a spin by Hosokawa's alleged shady  financial deals, which go back to the early 1980's when he was a  House of Councillors member. Suspicions have grown largely  because Hosokawa's own account of the events have kept changing.    In 1982, he borrowed 100 million yen (950,000 U.S. dollars)  from Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-tainted trucking firm. He  claimed the cash was for repairs to his home in Kumamoto  Prefecture and has insisted that the loan was repaid in full.    But the opposition camp has pointed to irregularities in the  papers Hosokawa presented to the Diet, such as entries in Sagawa  account books that list transactions on days when the firm was  closed or on dates that do not show up on the calendar, such as  Sept. 31.    In addition, a document Hosokawa claims is a receipt for  repayment has no company seal or signatures. Such discrepancies  have critics doubting the authenticity of the papers.    Hosokawa has admitted some of the documents are "not in  order", but said they were papers given to him by Sagawa after  his own records of the transaction could not be found.    Hosokawa is also plagued by allegations that he, and not his  late father-in-law as he maintains, purchased 300 shares of  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986.    Of the 300 NTT shares officially registered with the  father-in-law, 199 shares were sold after the stock was listed  in early 1987, while the remaining 101 were passed on to  Hosokawa's wife after her father's death.    Announcing his resignation at a press conference, Hosokawa  said he made the decision after new allegations were revealed  about financial dealings involving his private office.    He said he should take moral and political "responsibility"  for the dealings, even though he was not aware of them.    However, observers say Hosokawa's resignation came after the  former Kumamoto governor failed to dismiss the mounting doubts  over his own financial affairs. As one senior LDP official has  said: "I find it hard to believe that the prime minister  refuses to actively take the necessary steps to dispel the  suspicions surrounding him."    Hosokawa's resignation has ended the continuing rift between  the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over the premier's  dubious deals, thus paving the way for the Diet to start, at  last, deliberations on the budget for fiscal 1994, which began  on April 1.    The row has delayed the start of the budget debate and the  government is currently running on a 50-day stopgap budget.    Analysts says that the Diet faces a number of pressing  issues  that need addressing, including stimulation of the sluggish  economy, reconciliation of the strained Japan-U.S. relationship  caused by the impasse in the bilateral trade framework talks and  handling of growing tension over the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsular.    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata was scheduled to  leave for Marrakech, Morocco, next Tuesday for the signing  ceremony of the new global trade agreement concluded last  December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    It is, however, not known whether Hata, the most powerful  candidate for the premiership, can now actually go to Morocco  amid such political turmoil at home, observers say.    They say the domestic political unrest will in turn affect  Japan's ties with the United States, over which a shadow has  already been cast by the breakdown of the trade talks in  February.</p>

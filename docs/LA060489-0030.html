			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOULDN'T CONFUSE 'SOCIALIZED' MEDICINE WITH 'SOCIALISM' -- THEY ARE NOT THE  SAME THING  </P> <P> Before basking in the glow of Bernstein's vision of "a drastically changed  health-care system," we should look at the facts in major industrialized  countries that have national health-care systems offering citizens health care  not based on their ability to pay.  </P> <P> In fact, such countries as Great Britain and Sweden that have national health  financing programs do not effectively provide a paradise of universal health  care because delays in providing care and arbitrary bureaucratic restrictions  that effectively ration care conspire to exclude a significant number of Brits  and Swedes from receiving medical care.  </P> <P> Trading one bad system of health-care delivery for another is no bargain.  </P> <P> SYLVAIN FRIBOURG, M.D.  </P> <P> Panorama City  </P></p>

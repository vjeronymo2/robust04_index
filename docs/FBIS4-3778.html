			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The total revenue  from land sales this year was estimated to be 18.385 billion  H.K. [Hong Kong] dollars (2.357 billion U.S. dollars), a  government official announced today.    This compared to the actual revenue from last year's land  sales of 17.964 billion H.K. dollars (2.303 billion U.S.  dollars), principal government land agent Jim Hughes said in a  news release.    He said that the government's land sales program for 1994/95  would consist of 28.21 hectares of land involving 40 sites which  are expected to produce between 8,000 and 10,000 flats.    The official announcement was made following the agreement  made by the Sino-British Land Commission earlier this week that  the land disposal program for the 1994/95 financial year should  amount to 117.27 hectares.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, chairman  of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, declaring that North  Korea's nuclear program must be stopped at any cost, said Friday  that a "package solution" and use of "the China card" are the  only way.    "A military confrontation against reckless provocation by  the  North Korean hard-liners has to be avoided," Kim said in a  prepared text for his lecture at Pusan University.    The package solution Kim was referring to has also been  proposed by North Korea. It aims at resolving the nuclear  dispute through an overall package deal with the United States  calling for, among other things, normalization of relations  between Washington and Pyongyang.    South Korea and the United States should not resume their  joint military exercise "Team Spirit" as it would impede  dialogue, Kim said.    Seoul will have to reconsider deploying Patriot missiles or  purchasing other new military weapons, said the former leader of  the opposition Democratic Party.    "Nuclear proliferation has to be stopped not only in North  Korea but also in other countries," Kim said, adding that the  United States, Russia, France, Britain and China must show their  commitment to making the world free of nuclear weapons.    It isn't very persuasive for these big powers to oppose the  possession of relatively cheap but hugely destructive nuclear  bombs by smaller countries while they have their own nuclear  weapons, Kim argued.    South and North Korea, the United States, Russia, Japan and  China must undertake a serious study of security in Northeast  Asia, including the matter of keeping the region nuclear free,  Kim said.    Such a study would provide a means to resolve the North  Korean nuclear issue as well as help maintain peace and  stability in Northeast Asia, he added.</p>

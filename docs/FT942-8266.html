			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Venezuela sale setback The government of President Rafael Caldera received a setback yesterday when it failed to auction off a state-owned airline, Aeropostal, in its first effort at privatisation, Joseph Mann writes from Caracas. Nine international groups had qualified to bid, but only three - American Airlines, Aces of Colombia, and a financial group headed by Venezuela's Progreso Mercado de Capitales - sent repesentatives. Specific offers were not made public, but the three groups told the government the base price of Dollars 62m was too high, and they were concerned about limitations on foreign exchange sales.</p>

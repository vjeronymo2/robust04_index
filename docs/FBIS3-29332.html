Part of them were assigned to  work at the state offices while the rest would be working at the  private ones. For today there are some 730 applications left  concerning labour provision which have been received by this  labour exchange.    For the last month of January the exchange officers arranged  training courses for dozens of people enabling them to get the  qualification of a seamstress and to be enrolled then by such  companies as "Temujin Mench" and "Mongoltex".    According to unofficial datings, the number of the  unemployed  in Mongolia is exceeding one hundred thousand people.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SCANDINAVIAN SMOKERS HUFF AND PUFF AS LEGAL RESTRICTIONS GET TOUGHER TO SWALLOW  </P> <P> Shoved into corners, banned from local flights and excluded from some hotel  floors, smokers in Scandinavia say they have had enough and are beginning to  fight back.  </P> <P> Smokers have banded together in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark to combat  perceived discrimination, to lobby against new anti-smoking laws and to share  tricks to sneak a smoke against the rules.  </P> <P> "We want to protect smokers' rights. We don't want to encourage people to  smoke, especially not young people," said Bengt Oste, chairman of the Swedish  lobby Smokepeace.  </P> <P> "Too many smoking bans were coming from all over the place. It was about time  somebody did something about it," said Tore Dinesen of the Danish smokers'  organization, Henry.  </P> <P> In their latest action, the pro-smoke groups published a pamphlet on how to  avoid the smoking bans on local flights by Finnair and SAS, the Scandinavian  Airlines System. The rule was extended Nov. 1 to any international flight less  than 100 minutes long on these airlines.  </P> <P> The "Smokers' Guide To Smokers' Flights in the Nordic Area" lists flights by  other airlines with smoking sections that have stopovers in the region.  </P> <P> Smokepeace, which adopted the symbol of an Indian in feathered headdress  puffing a peace pipe, says it just wants a fair deal for smokers and  non-smokers.  </P> <P> In 10 months it has drawn 1,500 members. Some are non-smokers offended by  discrimination, Oste said, and 53% are women.  </P> <P> "Smokers have to back down a bit, so as not to harm or irritate non-smokers,"  said Oste, an anchorman for Swedish TV news who says he has been a pipe smoker  for 45 years.  </P> <P> At the same time, fair provision should be made for smokers, he said.  </P> <P> Henry, launched two years ago by a Danish wine and tobacco merchant, enlisted  Denmark's pipe-smoking Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen in an advertising  campaign last spring to plead that "tolerance and consideration are the basis  of living together."  </P> <P> Although it doesn't release financial figures, Henry reportedly gets part of  its finances from the Danish tobacco industry.  </P> <P> Norway has enacted some of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws, which  critics say make lighting a cigarette indoors illegal almost everywhere except  at home.  </P> <P> Sweden's parliament is in the early stage of drafting a comprehensive law,  which many legislators want to fashion on the Norwegian model. Steps toward a  similar bill in Denmark were interrupted by an election and have been dropped  for now.  </P> <P> Among Norway's regulations is a ban on smoking in any office occupied by more  than one person, even if everyone in the room is a smoker.  </P> <P> Smoking was outlawed in schools, hospitals, theater lobbies and public  transportation. Selling tobacco to youths under 18 is illegal.  </P> <P> Many Scandinavian hotels have no-smoking rooms, and some have barred tobacco  from entire floors.  </P> <P> Most workplaces have set aside smoking areas. The Stockholm daily Aftonbladet  banned smoking anywhere in its new nine-story building except in a few  glassed-in rooms by the coffee machines on each floor. They are so poorly  ventilated that workers refer to them as "the gas chambers."  </P> <P> High tobacco taxes also are meant to deter. In Norway cigarettes cost about $4  a pack, slightly more than in the other countries. Roll-your-own tobacco is  becoming more popular in Denmark, where pipe tobacco is taxed less.  </P> <P> One dodge from smoking bans is snuff, a plug of tobacco that many Scandinavians  stick under their upper lip.  </P> <P> The government in Oslo adopted an ambitious and, critics say, unrealistic  target of making Norway smoke-free by the end of the century.  </P> <P> The critics note that although tobacco has not been advertised since 1973, four  out of 10 Norwegians smoke, and consumption is rising by 500 tons of tobacco a  year.  </P></p>

Leading a high-ranking political and economic delegation, he  met and conferred with his Turkish counterpart and also other  officials of that country. [passage omitted]    Since 1985 this was the third visit of the Egyptian  president  to Turkey. The Tuesday visit of the head of the Egyptian regime  to Ankara, besides confirming contacts and ties between Cairo  and Ankara, was aimed at further expanding political, economic,  cultural, and military cooperation and also at boosting ties.    This cooperation can assume special significance in view of  the position of Turkey and Egypt in the region on the top of  their ties with Israel.    Last week, Ezer Weizman, head of the Zionist regime, had  paid  a four-day visit to Turkey. Weizman, in connection with his  Ankara visit, had commented that the destiny of the Middle East  would be framed with the collaboration of Israel, Turkey, and  Egypt.    Some political experts assess these contacts in line with  the  efforts to conclude a regional treaty through which the leaders  of Egypt, Turkey, and the Zionist regime could counter the  threats posed to them by uniting and also forging necessary  coordination. Thus, they can execute their desired policy, which  undoubtedly enjoyed the U.S. backing.    In this connection, Islamism and escalation of Islamic  groups' operations are among the most important problems which  are faced by Turkey, Israel, and Egypt. Also the ties of Turkey  and Egypt with the Zionist regime can be examined from the angle  that they can pave the way for normalization of Tel Aviv's  relations with Arab states and also lead to the lifting of  economic sanctions against Israel.    Hence, political experts analyze the strengthening of ties  among Egypt, Turkey, and Israel within the framework of  restricting independent and non-aligned policy and also  jeopardizing the Islamic tendency in the region.</p>

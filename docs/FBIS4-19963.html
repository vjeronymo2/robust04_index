			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Thomas Chorherr: "Balance Sheet of a Visit"] </F>   [Text] Chancellor Vranitzky's visit to the United States  may not have taken place at the best of times. The world  political events may have stolen his show and developments at  home may have ruined his mood. The fact that CNN switched from  a photograph of Bill Clinton and the Austrian chancellor to the  president's news conference is only a weak consolation, or is it  not? In fact, Bosnia was discussed during Vranitzky's visit to  the White House, which was also the topic if Clinton's  subsequent news conference.    However, the way Clinton commented on Bosnia and what has  happened since then shows in an impressive manner that he still  has not realized what is happening in the Balkans. When asked,  Vranitzky gave a diplomatic reply, as is right and proper for a  visitor. However, there is no need for us to be diplomatic.  The President tried to convince his compatriots via the media  and the world via CNN that a civil war is going on in Bosnia.  He repeatedly stressed that a "civil war" is taking place  there. Yet this is not true. We are not witnessing a civil war  among members of the same nation. It is a war between different  ethnic groups, states, and religions.    If Clinton wrongly speaks of a civil war, he is evoking a  trauma that the Americans have not overcome since 1865 -- for  good reason. At the same time, he also asked for understanding  for Washington's hesitant attitude. "Not interfering" is the  motto, which would be justified if a civil war were really  involved. What Clinton had to offer was a stalling policy. An  international conference on Bosnia is to be held -- as early as  in four weeks -- according to Yeltsin's wishes. A state will no  longer exist by that time, but there will be a winner who can  rightly claim that he won against the whole world.    If Vranitzky tried to explain this, his visit was a failure  in this respect. If he failed to do so, he should have stayed  at home.</p>

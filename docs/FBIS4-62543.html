			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Interior Minister Romasis </F> Vaitekunas by Ceslovas Skarzinskas; place and date not given:  "Criminals Are Becoming More Impertinent, But the Police Are Not  Idling Around"]    [Excerpts] [Skarzinskas] Mr. Minister, you expressed your  joy at the enlarged Interior Ministry collegium meeting that you  managed to stabilize the criminal situation in Lithuania over  the first quarter of this year. Unfortunately, a new wave of  killing and plundering has recently engulfed the country. Why  has this happened?    [Vaitekunas] The Interior Ministry collegium meeting only  provided criminal statistics pertaining to the first quarter of  this year. They partially reflect the general decline in crime.  On the other hand, the exposure of crimes has improved. This  indicator is the key one in assessing the work of criminal  police.    The increasing number of grave crimes, particularly of  premeditated murders, is cause for concern. [passage omitted]    [Skarzinskas] President A. Brazauskas recently issued a  decree establishing the Coordination Committee for Crime  Prevention, to which you also belong. I wonder what joint  action you have taken against offenders?    [Vaitekunas] This is not a new institution. Back in 1993, a  decree of the Lithuanian president established a working group  for combating organized crime and corruption. This group was  very active in proposing draft laws. It also assisted in  preparing the Penal Code and the Criminal Proceedings Code, and  revisions and amendments to the law on operative actions.  Enlarged meetings of this group, which are also attended by the  president of the Republic, address the most pressing issues of  crime, the activities of law enforcement and other institutions,  and grant specific obligations to officials and offices. In my  opinion, this helps concentrate and coordinate actions.    [Skarzinskas] You said at the ministry collegium meeting  that  you succeeded in striking a blow to criminal groups and  splitting their ranks. However, your opponents, including  Seimas [parliament] Deputy Chairman E. Bickauskas, are rather  skeptical about the criminal situation in Lithuania. How could  you comment on your opponents' arguments?    [Vaitekunas] We do not work for single reports. There is the  sole desire to stabilize crime, which is manifesting itself in  increasingly new forms. I would say that it is incorrect to  ignore any positive changes in our work. No one argues that we  want to accomplish more by prompt actions. However, this is not  production. [passage omitted]    [Skarzinskas] The Interior Ministry is planning to establish  additional economic police subunits. What will be their  specific duties?    [Vaitekunas] The Government of the Republic of Lithuania has  adopted a decision to create an additional 100 jobs at the  Interior Ministry Department for Investigating Economic Crime  and its subdivisions in all towns and regions. Officials of  these new subunits will specialize in the financial system and  closely cooperate with tax inspections so as to better expose  these crimes. The number of such crimes has increased recently.  Our task is to enlarge the state budget through operative means.    [Skarzinskas] Will the legalization of firearms for  self-defense as of 1 April really help people protect themselves  against criminals in the slightest manner?    [Vaitekunas] One can only predict this. The position of the  Interior Ministry is that we do not intend to issue mass permits  for acquiring firearms. Life will show how much this law affects  crime. Thus far, the number of crimes committed with firearms  has not dropped. We draw on the experience of foreign countries  in our activities, and we do not want to commit any grievous  mistakes.    [Skarzinskas] Most of our readers are interested in the  current number of political prisoners in Lithuania.    [Vaitekunas] There are three persons imprisoned for crimes  against the state. [passage omitted]    [Skarzinskas] The popularity ratings of the police are the  lowest among legal institutions. Why is the community's trust  in the police so moderate?    [Vaitekunas] First of all, you are slightly incorrect. Out  of the 10 most often rated institutions in Lithuania, the police  occupy eighth place. These ratings also include courts, which  rank close to us in the opinion polls. The police is trusted by  30 percent of those polled. Why this percentage? There are  many reasons. Our strategic goal is to seek greater trust among  the people. This is necessary not only for us, but also for  those who are in trouble. The police ratings primarily depend on  the results of our work. [passage omitted]</p>

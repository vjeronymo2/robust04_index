			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Defence founded on sound management - Steetley's attempts to defeat the hostile offer from Redland THIS HOLIDAY season has not been one of festive fun for Mr Richard Miles, group managing director of Steetley, the building materials group facing a Pounds 595m hostile bid from Redland, one of its competitors. As Steetley's chief operating officer, Mr Miles has been working long hours to meet the deadline for the first defence document, which is being sent to shareholders today. The offer of 85 Redland shares for 100 Steetley, with a partial cash alternative, has not only ruined Mr Miles's Christmas, it has jeopardised a deal with Tarmac of which he is mightily proud. Indeed, the pooling of the Steetley-Tarmac brick interests was welcomed by the City as ushering in a much-needed restructuring of the UK bricks industry. But instead of cementing this deal, he now has to fight off Redland's charges that the Steetley management has let profits slide and allowed the balance sheet to deteriorate. The predator's view of the Tarmac joint venture solution is that it brings few benefits and dilutes assets, Steetley will have to convince shareholders that the Redland offer, which would create a building materials group with a much wider geographic spread, is not as attractive as staying with Steetley's gradually evolving continental strategy. The short-term picture is also clouded by gearing, which is a little high for comfort, and by low dividend cover. Although Steetley's chances of remaining independent have already been pronounced 'sadly limited' by at least one City analyst, Mr Miles shows little sign of being cowed by the task. He believes the group has a proven track record, having produced more than 20 per cent compound annual growth over the past five years. He points to the management's early response to problems in the industry as evidence of tight management. 'Steetley is a company that has a focused business, that is at the bottom of the cycle and that has assets that will outperform in the future,' he says. 'We've demonstrated that we've done a good job.' His stress on recovery prospects follows a sharp fall in profits. The pre-tax figure for the first half of 1991 fell by more than 70 per cent to Pounds 13.5m, which was at the lower end of City expectations. Earnings per share plummeted to 5p but the interim dividend was maintained at 5p. With the UK construction industry still deep in recession and the French market, where it derives a substantial amount of its profits, coming under increasing pressure, the short-term outlook is hardly promising. Yet Mr Miles maintains that despite the recent setback, Steetley is on the right track and that the strategy will bear fruit in the long term. The best evidence for this lies in the group's success on the continent and its quick response to the downturn in the UK bricks industry through the proposed deal with Tarmac. Steetley's mode of geographic expansion has been to marry local knowledge to tight management control from the UK. It is already a leading producer in France and is strengthening its position in Spain. While its moves overseas have limited the damage of the UK recession, Mr Miles places more stress on the soundness of the business strategy. 'The point is that the position (in France) has been built up logically and has a value immensely greater than the actual underlying asset value,' he says. The strength of management, as Mr Miles sees it, is also evident in the concentration of Steetley's businesses on quarry products for the construction industry. 'Hanson would say everything is up for sale, that is not true of us,' says Mr Miles. For the purposes of a bid defence, this focus appears to leave little room for future disposals. However, for Mr Miles, making disposals or management changes after a bid has been launched is only proof of previous ineffectual management. 'Hawker Siddeley has demonstrated that that is not the way to fend off a bid.' He says it is more important that Steetley's management has been quick to respond to overcapacity in the industry by making cuts and by coming up with the joint venture proposal with Tarmac. 'The Tarmac deal is on the table. That's management. It's a shrewd, live, seasoned, competent management who know what they're at.' He defends the deal as offering a far more effective way of dealing with the industry's overcapacity because it gives much greater scope for rationalisation than the Redland alternative. Before settling on a deal with Tarmac, Steetley did look at possible links with several other groups, including Redland, whose bid Mr Miles dismisses as a 'knee-jerk reaction'. He is confident that shareholders will share this view. 'We've demonstrated that we've done a good job. I think they (the institutions) are learning from other countries that churning is not necessarily the way to make profits.'</p>

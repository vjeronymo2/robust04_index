			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARSON &amp; COMPANY: THE NIGHT FIGHT  </P> <P> I enjoyed Weinstein's article, but, like many other writers, he doesn't seem to  know what to make of Arsenio Hall.  </P> <P> Everyone seems to agree that Hall is a talented comedian; what no one points  out is that he is also a very good reporter.  </P> <P> Unlike the hosts of other talk shows, where the troublesome ghosts of Merv  Griffin and Joan Rivers linger and guests are allowed to promote themselves  endlessly, Hall asks questions.  </P> <P> Nowhere else will you hear Lisa Bonet explain her professional relationship  with Bill Cosby and comment on her dismissal from "A Different World." Nowhere  else will you see boxing champ Mike Tyson questioned in depth about his  high-profile divorce and troubled youth.  </P> <P> JAMES BRACHMAN  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Phoenix Suns said they will offer first-round draft choice Jayson Williams  a one-year contract for the minimum $170,000, and he probably won't be on their  NBA roster this season.  </P> <P> Jerry Colangelo, the Suns' president, said he had a verbal agreement with  Williams, a 6-foot-10 forward from St. John's, and his agent, Bob Woolf, on a  contract Aug. 5, but Woolf then informed Colangelo that his client was  considering signing a one-year, $1.5-million contract with the Italian team, Il  Messaggero.  </P> <P> That deal never materialized, and Williams joined the Suns for informal  workouts on Sept. 13. However, Colangelo withdrew his original offer of about  $600,000 a season for five years.  </P></p>

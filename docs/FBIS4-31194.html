			<p>CSO     [Text] In Budapest and in Heves, Fejer, Gyor-Moson-Sopron  and Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok counties, bids will be invited for the  privatization of approximately 50 pharmacies by 6 May, as  announced at the press briefing following the meeting of the  State Property Agency [AVU] Board of Directors.    Bids will be invited soon for the privatization of the  HungarHotels Corporation. HungarHotels is the only hotel chain  the privatization of which has not yet begun, although several  units were separated from the firm earlier. The make-up of the  corporation will be further modified on the basis of the latest  decision in February. Bids will be invited for 15 Hungarian and  two German hotels, as well as for four Budapest hotels in the  near future. The corporation currently has a capital of 9  billion forints [Ft], from which a business share worth Ft1.5  billion will be separated. The AVU is hoping for a professional  investor who is also expected to underwrite a credit guarantee  of Ft1.1 billion. HungarHotels used to underwrite this guarantee  as the former owner of the Club Tihany Corporation.    The AVU wants to invite bids for Club Tihany after the  future  of HungarHotels has been decided. The resort at lake Balaton was  built from a Ft1.2-billion Austrian loan, and though it is  profitable, the repayment of the loan is too great a task for  the firm.    A decision was made about the dividend policy of the firms  belonging to the AVU. Although the budget expects a dividend  payment of Ft4 billion, the AVU would only take as much from the  firms as would not hamper the functioning of the corporations,  and is even willing to pay the budget less than the projected  amount.    The first one of the firms owned by the Employee Stock  Ownership Program, Aranypok [Golden Spider] Corporation, will  appear on the stock exchange. The AVU still has a 10-percent  share in the corporation which they are offering one-to-one for  compensation vouchers. The underwriting can take place between 9  and 13 May.</p>

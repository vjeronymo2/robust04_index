			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Euromobiliare chief to step down MR Guido Roberto Vitale, the managing director of Euromobiliare, the Italian merchant bank now controlled by Midland Bank of the UK, is to step down at the end of September. No direct successor has been named. However, Mr Sencar Toker, European managing director of Midland Montagu, the UK bank's investment banking arm, is to become chairman of Euromobiliare's executive committee, which effectively runs the company. Euromobiliare also announced yesterday that it is spending L30bn (Dollars 25.3m) to buy Cofimedit, an investment management subsidiary of the Fondiaria insurance group, which currently has around L1,000bn in funds under management. Mr Vitale, one of the founders of Euromobiliare in 1973, was one of the leading figures in the liberalisation of Italian merchant banking in the mid-1980s. Under his guidance, the bank conducted a series of daring deals which challenged the monopoly of the country's most established financial institutions. However, Euromobiliare has suffered badly from the more difficult trading conditions of the past two years. Mergers and acquisitions have declined, while profits from equity activities have slumped. Those factors, plus heavy write-downs on a stake in the VM motors company in which Euromobiliare led a management buy-out in 1989, contributed to a L976m group loss last year against net profits of L9.5bn in 1990. The figures, along with Midland's assumption of a majority stake and suggestions that Mr Vitale himself was tiring, may have prompted yesterday's decision. However, Mr Vitale will remain on the board as a director. Euromobiliare said acquiring Cofimedit would substantially reinforce its existing fund management activities. The company has three regional offices apart from its Florence base, and it should allow the bank substantially to improve its coverage in retail fund management. According to Euromobiliare, the acquisition marked one of a number of initiatives now being taken to 'relaunch' the bank, which would seek to concentrate on its core businesses of fund management, investment banking and corporate finance and securities trading.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: DSM passes payout as profits plummet DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, posted a sharp drop in second-quarter profits and warned that it expected a 'clearly negative' result in the third quarter. The company, which has been hit by the recession in Europe, omitted its interim dividend but refused to be drawn on whether it would pay a dividend for the full year. Net profit in the second quarter dwindled to Fl 4m (Dollars 2.1m) from Fl 110m a year earlier, repeating a pattern set in the first quarter when profit slumped to Fl 6m from Fl 100m. It blamed the downturn on lower gross margins for ethylene derivatives, captrolactum, melamine and fertilisers, as well as on lower sales volumes. Turnover fell by 14 per cent to Fl 4.2bn. Recession has hit demand from leading customers such as Germany's carmakers, which account for nearly 15 per cent of DSM's annual turnover through their purchases of engineering plastics and elastomers. Mr Ad Timmermans, a DSM board member, said the weakness of the economy in Europe and the traditional summer lull meant the company would fall into a loss for the July-September period. But Mr Timmermans said the company could make no prediction for the second half or for the 1993 dividend. He said the omission of the interim dividend 'provided no indication for the final dividend,' which would be decided in February, partly on the basis of the outlook for 1994. In 1992, DSM cut its dividend by half after suffering a 57 per cent decline in annual profits. DSM's shares fell by 8 per cent at the opening in Amsterdam, but recovered during the day to close at Fl 95.40, up slightly from Wednesday's finish of Fl 94.50.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> LENDL AND CONNORS ADVANCE; MECIR FORCED TO WITHDRAW  </P> <P> Top-ranked Ivan Lendl lost his concentration but still won his second-round  match in straight sets Wednesday at the International Players Championships.  </P> <P> Lendl said his mind wandered as he swept Jim Pugh, 6-3, 6-1, 6-1.  </P> <P> "That was my biggest problem -- concentration," Lendl said. "I was letting it  slip and I was trying crazy shots. But I was able to recover and get out of  trouble when I was in a little bit of it."  </P> <P> In a later match at the International Tennis Center, fourth-seeded Jimmy  Connors beat Arnaud Boetsch of France, 7-6, 6-1, 6-1. Connors won the  tiebreaker, 7-3.  </P> <P> Many of the highest-seeded players in the two-week, $2.1-million tournament had  the day off. Miloslav Mecir, the 1987 champion, withdrew because of a back  injury suffered last week at Indian Wells.  </P> <P> Mecir, who won Tuesday despite his bad back, decided against trying to play his  second-round match. He planned to return home to see a doctor and said he  didn't know whether the injury would force him to miss Davis Cup competition.  </P> <P> Mary Joe Fernandez, the women's ninth-seeded player, also won a night match at  the International Tennis Center, beating Cathy Caverzasio of Switzerland, 6-2,  7-5.  </P> <P> Beth Herr upset No. 14-seeded Catarina Lindqvist of Sweden, 6-7, 6-4, 6-3.  </P> <P> Manuela Maleeva hurt her right ankle early in the second set but still beat  Gigi Fernandez of Miami, 6-2, 6-2.  </P></p>

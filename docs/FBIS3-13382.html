			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] 'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah believes  that the Sayyidat al-Najat explosion was meant to be a mine  undercutting the Lebanese people, because what was required was  to create a limited security threat that would then be turned  into a political earthquake to divert the attention of the  people from economic issues to concentrate on security matters.    He said violating security harms both Christians and  Muslims.  He noted that whoever throws a bomb at a church will also do  the same to a mosque. Whoever places a bomb near a cultural  center somewhere will also place it in a cultural center here.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: ROSE GETS GOOD REPORTS IN PRISON  </P> <P> Pete Rose is earning 11 cents an hour working in a prison machine shop and  isn't playing for the inmates' softball team yet, the assistant warden said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Rose, serving a five-month sentence at the Federal Work Camp in Marion, Ill.,  spends eight hours a day welding and fabricating metal with 70 other prisoners.  </P> <P> "His work supervisor says he has been getting good reports; he gets in there  and works just as hard as the rest of them," assistant warden Randy Davis said.  </P> <P> Baseball's all-time hit leader has also been watching the inmate softball  teams, but hasn't been able to play because his knee is healing from surgery  July 20, Davis said.  </P> <P> Davis said Rose is treated like any other inmate -- doing basic chores eight  hours a day and sharing a dormitory cubicle with another prisoner. Rose is  scheduled to be released Jan. 7, then spend three months at a halfway house in  Cincinnati.  </P></p>

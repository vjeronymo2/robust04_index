			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 47 (537): </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] President Mircea Snegur is convinced that "most  people want to take part in building an independent and  sovereign state" as indicated by last Sunday's poll results.    IF Note: More than 95 percent of Moldovans voted in favor of  the country's statehood and sovereignty in the Sunday poll as  compared to a mere 2 percent who were against. 2.6 percent of  ballot papers were invalidated. 1.8 Mn people or 75.1 percent  of those eligible to vote were involved in the poll to answer a  single question: "Do you agree that Moldova should develop as an  independent, integral and indivisible state within the borders  that existed on June 23, 1990 (the day it proclaimed  independence from Moscow) and pursuing neutral policies,  maintaining cooperation with all other countries and  guaranteeing its citizens equal rights in keeping with  international law".    Leader of the Agrarian Democratic Party [ADP] Aurel  Tolmatskiy believes the poll results create a solid basis for  the new parliament's activity.    In an interview with Interfax, he said "the need to consult  the nation on key issues of the republic's development so as to  put an end to the manipulation of public opinion is long  overdue". Tolmatsky said the poll results were an indication  that most people were supportive of the policy aimed at  consolidating the republic's statehood, independence and  integrity.    He stressed that this was completely in line with the  position taken by his party which won 55 out of 104 seats in the  new parliament in last month's election, while the Sunday poll  reaffirmed support to ADP policies.    On Snegur's suggestion on giving the poll the status of a  referendum, Tolmatskiy said the new legislature might well adopt  such a resolution. However, he said that this in itself was  less important than learning the real mood on the ground so as  to get on with the work in hand by leaning upon the nation's  support.</p>

The People's Front  Governing Council considers this contradicts the law due to the  following:    1. The act on the restoration of Georgian state independence  adopted unanimously by the legally elected Georgian Supreme  Council on 9 April 1991 was based on a nationwide referendum  held on 31 March 1991, during which 98 percent of the population  of Georgia voted for Georgia's independence. It is unlawful to  make decisions on a complete or partial cancellation  (limitation) [agency parentheses] of Georgia's independence by  the way other than a referendum;    2. Georgia's joining the CIS contradicts the law of the  Republic of Georgia on defense that recognizes Georgia's active  neutrality and nonalignment with military blocs;    3. More than a half of the total number of members of the  Supreme Council voted for Georgia's joining the CIS. However,  such a decision can only be taken by a qualified majority.</p>

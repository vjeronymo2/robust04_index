			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Lautro imposes Pounds 130,000 fine Fines amounting to Pounds 130,000 and costs of Pounds 20,000 have been imposed by Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life insurance industry, on Crown Financial Management, the life insurance and pensions subsidiary of Crown Life in Canada. The fines, among the highest imposed by Lautro, are for Crown's failure to maintain responsible control of its internal affairs, and its employment of Mr Alan Joyner as a sales agent. Mr Joyner, who worked for the company for six months in 1991, was convicted of activities associated with illegal deposit-taking - a business Crown allowed him to continue to operate - and is serving a custodial sentence of three years. Breaches of Lautro rules, accounting for Pounds 80,000 of the fine, were discovered in a Lautro inspection in 1992. The charges included failure to ensure sales representatives were proficient, and helping them to cheat in examinations. Lautro also highlighted Crown's failure to ensure that its sales representatives followed 'best advice' in activities such as transfers out of occupational pension schemes. Mr Malcolm Berryman, who became Crown's chief executive after the period of the offences, emphasised yesterday that Lautro had paid a further visit last May and was satisfied with the internal systems. He said Lautro agreed that in the 180 or so cases it had examined the problem was poor record-keeping and that there had been no disadvantage to clients. Crown has carried out its own investigation into more than 1,000 other cases, and found four cases of potential client disadvantage, in which they offered compensation. Mr Berryman said there had been a change of management at Crown, but this was coincidental rather than caused by the compliance problems.</p>

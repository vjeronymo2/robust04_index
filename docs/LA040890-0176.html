			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEACHES CAN MAKE GREAT SIDE DISHES  </P> <P> Add canned cling peaches to your repertory of side dishes for pretty and  nutritious accompaniments to your favorite roasted meats. Hot stuffed cling  peach halves are a pretty and delicious garnish for a roast.  </P> <P> Simply drain the peaches, reserving the liquid for another use, and place in a  shallow baking pan. Fill each peach with cranberry sauce and sprinkle with  cinnamon sugar. Heat under the broiler until bubbly.  </P> <P> Or stuff peach halves with chutney if the dinner menu calls for roast pork,  with creamy horseradish for roast beef or with mint jelly for roast lamb.  </P> <P> To brighten up frozen peas when served with meat loaf, chicken or pork, heat  them with canned cling peach slices and 1/2 teaspoon crushed dried mint leaves.  Drain and stir in 1 tablespoon butter or margarine before serving.  </P> <P> Or warm turkey slices in liquid drained from canned cling peach slices. Stir in  3 to 4 tablespoons butter or margarine, 2 tablespoons capers and 2 tablespoons  lemon juice. Heat until bubbly. Add peach slices and heat through. Serve over  parsley rice for an inviting dinner entree.  </P></p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Code for 'green' advisers launched THE FIRST registration scheme and code of practice to ensure that environmental consultants achieve a minimum quality standard was launched by the sector's leading trade body yesterday. The Association of Environmental Consultancies has approved a code of practice and a system to register and monitor its members. The scheme has been introduced partly in response to concerns over the quality of advice provided by a growing number of consultants. There are more than 300 companies calling themselves environmental consultants, yet there has been no system for assessing the quality of advice that they provide. The registration scheme comes at a time when businesses are under growing pressure to hire consultants to help comply with regulations and guidelines. These include the 1990 Environmental Protection Act; BS7750, the standard on environmental management systems; and Emas, the European Community's ecological auditing and management scheme. Consultants wishing to become 'AEC registered environmental audit practices' will be subject to an initial audit, a second visit within a year and then additional audits at least every two years. The audits will be carried out by other registered firms and with supervision from an independent team at Imperial College, London.</p>

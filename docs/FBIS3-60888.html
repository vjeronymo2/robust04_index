			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Iraqi Ambassador to Turkey Raf i'Dahham </F> Mujjawil al-Tikriti by Erturk Yondem in the "Behind the Scenes"  program; date and place not given --recorded, al-Tikriti speaks  in Arabic with superimposed Turkish translation]    [Text] [Yondem] Honorable Ambassador, are you closely  following the terrorism perpetrated in Turkey by the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan]? How do you describe this form of  terrorism?    [Al-Tikriti] Terrorism is the worst thing in the world and  we hate terrorism. The aim of terrorism is to hurt people and  for this reason we strongly condemn terrorism. We, as a state,  are against all kinds of terrorism because terrorism is an act  against humanity and religion. We are greatly distressed by the  situation in which friendly Turkey finds itself. The security  of Turkey has great importance for us. In my opinion, I think  terrorist activities are ongoing in northern Iraq and we are  aware of this. It is definite that there is cooperation between  Abdullah Ocalan and Jalal Talabani and that their aim is to  establish a Kurdish state. I would like to point out that our  people and our government want to cooperate with Turkey on the  issue of terrorism and we are always ready to cooperate in  preventing initiatives that aim to divide Turkey.    [Yondem] Which countries, do you think, support the PKK?  What do you know about this issue?    [Al-Tikriti] Terrorist activities exacerbated in recent  years because Apo [Ocalan's nom de guerre] and the Iraqi Kurds  are trying to achieve their dreams. Apo and Talabani could not  be so courageous if they had only themselves to depend on. This  proves the point that foreign forces support these  organizations, primarily the United States and the Western  countries. The most important proof of this support are the  Poised Hammer units in the region. The real help comes from  those units. The United States and the Western countries are  implementing their plan very well. On the issue of neighboring  countries supporting the PKK, I cannot evaluate this issue but I  can definitely say that the United States and Western countries  are extending their support. Do you know why PKK terrorism  exacerbated over the past three years? The reason is that the  empty territory in northern Iraq is being used for terrorist  bases since Iraq was struck down. This is the reason why  attacks on Turkey are being perpetrated from that area. We  think that we cannot solve this problem without cooperating with  neighboring countries, especially with Turkey. I want to stress  a point by using you and the TRT representatives as  intermediaries, and I am stating as the State of Iraq that we  have never had and will never have any adverse intentions  regarding Turkey. The Turks are our brothers and we have great  affection for Turkey. We want to stress the fact that we can be  the best fraternal country for Turkey and we want to point out  that we are ready to do everything for Turkey, not only today  but tomorrow also. We can never forget Turkey's stand during  the Gulf War. All of Iraq, especially our Honorable President  Saddam Husayn, appreciate the recent statements issued by the  Honorable Ciller and the efforts she exerted to lift the embargo  imposed on Iraq. There is a need for close cooperation in order  to eradicate terrorism. If Turkey is ready to cooperate on this  issue, we are ready to cooperate in all areas.</p>

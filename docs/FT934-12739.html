			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (14): Managers to blame / Interview with Ferdinand Piech of Volkswagen FERDINAND PIECH, chairman of the loss-making Volkswagen group, has disturbed many within the conservative German corporate establishment by his manners and way of doing business. But one habit of his in particular sets teeth on edge from Hamburg to Munich. He insists on saying repeatedly that only 20 per cent of industry's problems stem from the labour force and that the rest is down to management. He claims that VW is in a mess because the group's previous management 'failed to do its homework'. The inference is that the same applies elsewhere in Germany. Piech's beliefs have led him to see himself as 'a coach for the protagonists on the shopfloor'. He argues that management should encourage labour to play its part in the restructuring of Standort Deutschland by transforming the way ordinary workers look at their jobs. At VW the process is under way partly through the application of the established Japanese-based continuous improvement process, generally known as CIP, but known at VW headquarters in Wolfsburg as KVP-squared. The squared element in the formulation reflects the sense of urgency which Piech wants to instil in his labour force. He says that the company, which lost DM1.6bn in the first six months of this year alone, has two or three years to match Japanese quality and productivity. He brims with missionary zeal. 'I am very little in my office. Most of the time I'm out in the plant. I am not there as an engineer. I'm looking on, seeing what's going right and what's wrong,' he says. Piech is quite open about his relationship with labour. His biggest shareholder is the Social Democrat/Green coalition government of Lower Saxony. The VW supervisory board which gave him the job is dominated by trade union and Social Democrat interests. 'If I have to reduce labour costs I cannot do it without their co-operation. I have to do it in a way in which they can survive, I can survive, the company can survive,' he says. He puts his fingertips together: 'It's a pyramid. If the lower level doesn't believe in me, the higher level cannot trust me.' Pyramid-building started on a trip to Japan in company with Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony, and a member of the supervisory board. 'I showed him Toyota's Lexus plant - you don't need to be a technician to understand when something is wrong. I asked him to count how many people he could see working.' Out of around 200, Schroder saw one idle man. 'Go through any one of our European plants and you will see between a half and a third of the labour standing around. And I can explain it]' Piech wriggles with agitation. 'It's not the fault of the workforce: it's our western organisation that's wrong. These people are not supplied with the things and the means to work efficiently. 'It's disorganisation - macro-computerisation of things that don't work.' He has not been impressed by preceding VW boards' investment in automation. 'It is wrong for management to believe so deeply that automation, computers and systems can help you overcome lack of competitiveness,' he declares. 'You have to organise and allow small groups of people to organise themselves, their logistics  .. everything.' At Honda, he adds, logistics costs amount to 0.5 per cent of group sales. At Audi, where he was boss until last January, the proportion was 5.5 per cent. Given the chance, he says, he could convince even Chancellor Kohl, who 'talks as though German labour does not work'. He could show him places where for every four persons 'working' another one is running around keeping them supplied with parts. He moves swiftly on to deal with another of German industry's betes noires: absenteeism. The standard Japanese rate is 2 to 3 per cent compared with around 9 per cent at VW in normal circumstances. (It has fallen to 4 per cent now as concern about unemployment has swept the labour force). Once again, the fault lies with management, which forgets that factory workers are human beings. As a result, motivation goes haywire. 'They think we treat them like electrical appliances - plugging them in and unplugging them as and where we like,' he says. A man or a woman ordered to a new, unfamiliar place on the line will tend to feel stressed. 'Six hours later they'll have disappeared.' Now, he says, people fearful for their jobs are coming to work even though they are clearly unwell. 'We have to find a way to restore normal motivation so they stay at home if they are sick and come in if they are not,' he adds. Piech, an engineer confronting the toughest turn-round challenge in Germany, promulgates his philosophies with the fervour of the newly-converted. Company officials say the new approach has already led to DM700m in real savings. But it will be some time before these show up on the bottom line. A loss of DM1.25bn at the group's Spanish subsidiary, Seat, has crushed all hopes of break-even this year. And now management is in talks with the German workers' councils to prepare for possible production cuts for next. The favoured means is by introducing short-time working - a euphemism for stopping production for as long as it takes to restore balance between output, stocks and demand for cars. Current plans, approved by Piech's political and union partners, allow for a reduction of around 13 per cent in the German workforce in the two years to the end of 1994. The jobs are being shed by natural wastage and early retirement schemes. Management proposals for more radical measures are unlikely to be welcomed by the supervisory board or the workforce, on whom Piech so much depends for success.</p>

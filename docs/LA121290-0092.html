			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> CITY PLANS NEW WATER-USE STRATEGY  </P> <P> After six months of efforts to encourage voluntary water conservation in  Anaheim resulted in just a 1% reduction in water use, the city Utility  Department next month will begin an aggressive new water-saving program with  possible financial rebates for residents.  </P> <P> The city hopes to cut water waste in the city by 10% in the next two years  under the plan, saving the city up to $1 million, some of which may be passed  on to water users.  </P> <P> "People start out with very good intentions, but the little good habits we  build seem to go out the window when the extreme conditions come along," said  Ray Merchant, a spokesman for the city utility department.  </P> <P> Plans call for residents to install low-flush toilets and high-efficiency  shower heads, which combined can save at least 30 gallons of water per person  each day.  </P> <P> Incentives, such as a possible $75 to $100 rebate for installing the  water-saving toilet, would also be offered to encourage residents'  participation.  </P> <P> The Utility Department also hopes to encourage businesses to participate by  using recycled water when possible in commercial and industrial operations, and  by reducing the amount of water used for landscaping.  </P> <P> Two new Utility Department staff members will be hired to administer the  program, which will be jointly funded by the city, the Metropolitan Water  District and the county Sanitation District of Orange County, with each entity  paying $120,000 toward the plan.  </P> <P> Cutting water use could result in savings of up to $1 million in fees from the  Metropolitan Water District and the county Sanitation District. However, the  Metropolitan Water District can fine the city up to $550,000 if it fails to cut  water use by 5%.  </P> <P> "Our hope is that these programs -- though they will have short-term effects --  will be long-term programs," said Merchant. "We're still not talking about  mandatory conservation. But we're talking about doing what we can now so that  if it becomes mandatory, it won't be severe." LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

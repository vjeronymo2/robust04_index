Of this land, 58,000  square miles are under India's control and have been, since  1948, when India forcibly occupied it. India has made the people  there its slaves. But they are not willing to accept Indian  slavery at any cost, and they have proved this from India's  partition through India's conspiracy (1971). In every war, the  people here helped the Pakistani military against India. In  every war, India faces awful embarrassment here. Still, after  its military successes, the Kashmiris were unsuccessful. Be it  the Gurdaspura crisis of 1947, the UN interference drama of  1948, the Tashkent Pact after the 1965 war, or the Shimla Pact  after the 1971 war, whenever the Kashmiris were at the door of  independence, they were forced again to wear the shackles of  slavery for one reason or another. This time around, they took  advantage of the Afghanistan jihad and started a similar  struggle with similar feelings and zeal. It seems that, along  with winning their freedom, they will also succeed in the  disintegration of India, in the same way the Soviet Union was  disintegrated.    The freedom struggle of the Kashmiris is very old. Many  times  the harvest of their freedom struggle was ready; however, the  "farmers who lacked strategy" were unable to reap this harvest  appropriately, and they ruined it severely. After the fall of  the Moguls in 1846, the region of Kashmir was sold to an  atrocious Dogra king, Ghulab Singh, for 7.5 million rupees. The  Kashmiri Muslims, fed up with Ghulab Singh's atrocities, began a  struggle for independence in the beginning of the 20th century,  one that is still going on. It has arrived at a point where  hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris have been martyred and the  perfume emanating from their sacrifice is spread all over the  world. The mutilated bodies of the martyrs traveled through the  River Jhelum and the Sindh and shook up the people living on the  shores of the Arabian Sea. These scenes were broadcast on  satellite TV to the whole world, exposing the wicked, scary face  of India. The whole world has heard the echoes of the slogans of  the Kashmiri people and understands the relationship of the  Kashmiri people with Pakistan.    May Allah grant the Kashmiri people freedom from India this  time, so they do not become the victims of another devilish  decision. Amin! It appears that as Kashmir's struggle for  freedom gains momentum, "political harvest quails," which  actually are instrumental in the hands of enemies of Islam, are  suggesting all kinds of solutions to the Kashmir problem. They  will never benefit Pakistan, Kashmiris, or the Islamic world.    What do the Kashmiris want? One may learn by seeing  documentary films about Kashmir. The open eyes of the martyred  people, the green flag in the hands of the martyrs, and the  slogans of joining Pakistan that are on their lips all appear to  be waiting for a victor coming from Pakistan.  *</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Bart's will hold talks on merger MANAGERS at St Bartholomew's hospital in the City of London yesterday agreed to take part in talks on a merger with the Royal London hospital. The move came only 24-hours after an announcement on the future of healthcare in London by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, had left Bart's in a seriously exposed position. Professor Michael Besser, Bart's chief executive, met officials of the North East Thames Regional Health Authority yesterday and told them the hospital was prepared to discuss arrangements for a new National Health Service trust merging the management of Bart's and the Royal London. Bart's will explain its decision in a statement today. Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report on London healthcare concluded that the health needs of the City and east London would be best served by a merged Bart's-Royal London hospital on the latter's site in the East End. Bart's fought to retain its independence in the most high-profile of all the campaigns against the Tomlinson recommendations. Although Mrs Bottomley's announcement on Tuesday presented three options for Bart's - closure, merger with the Royal London or continuation as a much smaller, specialist hospital - it was immediately clear that its chances of independent survival in the NHS market were slim. Prof Besser said last night that Bart's would enter discussions on merged management with the Royal London on equal terms. Bart's had rejected the option of continuing as a scaled-down specialist hospital because the proposed unit would have been so small the market could have been manipulated to deprive it of funds. Mr Michael Fairey, chief executive of the Royal London trust, said last night: 'I shall be delighted if Bart's managers wish to enter discussions with us.' A merged hospital could only benefit from the high level of medical excellence Bart's possessed. It would be for the new trust management to rationalise services, and some Bart's managers and doctors will hope to retain a range of activities on their City site. But the full cost benefits of the Tomlinson recommendations will be achieved only if locations are vacated, and there will be strong pressures to transfer services to the Royal London's 26-acre site. Doctors and managers at the Charing Cross Hospital in west London vowed yesterday to fight on to save their institution, which faces an uncertain future. Their hopes are pinned on a government review of specialist services. Charing Cross has, among its specialist departments, the second-largest cancer treatment centre in Britain and managers believe they can make a convincing case for the hospital's retention.</p>

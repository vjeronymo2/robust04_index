He also declared himself satisfied after his  Thursday meeting with the head of state and praised "President  Carlos Salinas' determination to resolve the crisis through  dialogue rather than force."    Fully accepting the official line of the Mexican  authorities,  which is challenged by a majority of the country's political  class, Juppe said that the violent incidents which have racked  the Chiapas state since 1 January were "outbursts which affect  four towns" on the Guatemala border. "I may be wrong in my  analysis," he said, "but I do not think we should blow out of  proportion (a local issue) that does not affect the whole  country."    Meanwhile, the Mexican Army seems to be taking more  seriously  risks of the conflict spreading to the Federation's other  states, since it has asked several foreign governments,  including France, to help it fight terrorism after several bombs  exploded in a number of cities, including the capital.  According to a source directly involved in the talks, Mexico's  Defense Ministry wishes to obtain training support for personnel  specializing in the neutralization of explosive devices.    France, which -- apart from a few Ecureuil marine patrol  helicopters supplied last year to the Navy -- has not sold any  military equipment to Mexico since 1984 (Sagaie wheeled armored  vehicles and Panhard light armored vehicles, currently in use in  the Chiapas conflict), has yet to answer Mexico's request for  help with mine clearance.    Insisting on Mexico's achievements with respect to inflation  reduction (less than 10 percent in 1993 compared with 159  percent in 1987), deficit cutting, and renegotiation of the  external debt -- which should let the country become soon an  "active member" of the OECD (Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development), among others thanks to France's  support -- Mr. Juppe concluded that "economic recovery has not  solved every social issue, but it remains essential in order `to  avoid'" explosions such as the Chiapas rebellion.    According to Juppe, the Chiapas conflict should affect  neither foreign investments in Mexico (France is the fifth  foreign investor in Mexico with nearly Fr9 billion and 228  firms, behind the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany,  and Japan) nor foreign trade, which is largely dominated by the  United States (70 percent of Mexico's trade involves its  northern neighbor, compared with a little over 2 percent for  France).    Mr. Juppe judged that "French firms understand they could  benefit" from the free trade agreement in force since 1 January  between Mexico, the United States, and Canada, provided the  three partners "do not pass legislation that discriminates  against third- party countries." One of the topics he discussed  with Mexican authorities -- he met with Finance Minister Pedro  Aspe -- had to do with supporting French investment in sectors  such as environmental protection (liquid waste reprocessing) and  public transportation, especially with respect to equipment for  a 10th subway line currently under construction.</p>

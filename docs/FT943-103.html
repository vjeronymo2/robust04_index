			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kenya to allow foreign bids in Firestone public share offer The Central Bank of Kenya is to allow foreign institutional investors to bid for shares in the public flotation of a Kenyan company for the first time in the history of the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). The owners of Firestone East Africa (1969), the only tyre manufacturer in Kenya, are offering 20 per cent of the company's shares for sale in the biggest initial public offering in Kenya to date. If the offer for sale is fully subscribed, it will raise Ks1.4bn (Dollars 27.9m) for Bridgestone/Firestone Inc of the US and Sameer Investments of Kenya, which own 19 per cent and 81 per cent of the local tyre manufacturer respectively. The offer has been priced at 10 times 1993 earnings, which is comparable with other manufacturing companies listed on the NSE. The Kenyan stock market is still officially closed to foreign participation regulations but Firestone East Africa obtained a special exemption due to the size of the share offer. 'We believe the government is using Firestone as a test case to assess the interest and the impact of overseas investors in our stock market,' said Mr Issa Timamy, group company secretary at Sameer Investments. With at least two local banks planning flotations before the end of the year, Mr Timamy believes the central bank will gradually relax the rules of foreign participation. The restrictions on foreign portfolio investment are virtually the last foreign exchange controls to remain following a year of steady deregulation. The Kenya shilling is fully convertible for all current account transactions. Exporters can retain proceeds in foreign currency and multinationals can remit profits and dividends. Nevertheless, the central bank is proceeding cautiously. Only 8m shares  - one-fifth of the offer - will be available to overseas bidders, who must be institutional investors. Underlying central bank concern is possible disruption caused by large flows of foreign funds on a small, illiquid stock market. Daily turnover on the NSE rarely exceeds Ks21m and the NSE index, although volatile, is up by 50 per cent since the beginning of the year. Nairobi stock brokers believe Firestone's issue will be of interest to overseas investors wishing to obtain a toe-hold in one of Africa's emerging markets.</p>

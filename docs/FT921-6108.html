			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / West German engineering orders fall ORDER intake at west German engineering companies took a sharp turn for the worse in January, the VDMA manufacturers' association said yesterday. A 16 per cent slump in export orders and a 2 per cent drop in domestic demand combined to produce an overall real decline of 9 per cent compared with the first month of 1991. The figures suggest a significant worsening of business conditions, particularly in export markets. In the three months from November to January, export demand was down 9 per cent and total orders were just 3 per cent lower than in the comparable period 12 months earlier. They also tend to confirm forecasts that growth in domestic output is stagnating and indicate that expectations of economic recovery in the engineering and plant industries' main markets in the US, Britain and France have yet to spur increased capital investment. Meanwhile, the IG Metall union warned engineering employers of more trouble to come in pay negotiations due to start next week. Mr Klaus Zwickel, the union's deputy chairman, announced widespread 'protest action' in support of a 9.5 per cent pay claim for 4m workers. The aim, he said, was to 'throw sand into the works' and to prove to the employers that the union membership would not accept cuts in real wages. It was prepared for and could afford a long struggle, including strikes, Mr Zwickel added. Gesamtmetall, the mechanical and electrical industries' employers' group, has warned that 'unreasonable' wage settlements this year will lead to losses of jobs. Its workforce fell 20,000 last year and numbers on short-time increased four-fold to 131,000 as orders shrank.</p>

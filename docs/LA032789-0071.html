			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS;  </P> <P> LOVE AND WAR IN THE FUTURISTIC CITY  </P> <P> The City, Not Long After by Pat Murphy (Doubleday: $17.95; 242 pages)  </P> <P> This novel is described on its blurb as an example of "magic realism," as if,  when you come to think of it, all reality weren't magic. "The City, Not Long  After" proceeds off the hypothesis that the world, as we know it, has already  "ended," and that the "end" has not turned out to be such a bad thing.  </P> <P> The place is San Francisco. The end has come in the form of a great plague. The  circumstances surrounding this plague were these: Back in the 1980s, peace  groups from all over the world heard of a monastery in the Himalayas that  sheltered a group of monkeys reputed to bring peace wherever they lived.  Peace-seekers concocted a plan whereby these monkeys might be shipped to world  capitals everywhere -- making use of them as potent symbols. The monkeys indeed  brought peace in a big way: They carried fleas that began a pandemic that  killed off 99.9% of the population. Now during the time of this novel, there's  nothing left to fight about.  </P> <P> Only 100 or so people live, these days, in San Francisco. There's "Books," a  nice man who tends to the library, "The Machine," who believes he survived the  plague because he was a machine, Mrs. Migdale, who writes the weekly  newsletter, a nice older man who creates glass mazes, and so on. Across the  Golden Gate, over in Marin County, farmers labor, but San Francisco itself has  become an artists' colony. (There don't seem to be any babies around, but maybe  it's too soon.) The artists live a carefree, some might even say feckless, life  in the city, working on that glass maze, constructing elaborate wind chimes,  putting up solar-operated spiders, generally living the life of the artist.  </P> <P> The question might then come up: Who is to be the audience for all this art?  But a young man, Danny-boy, who's lived in the city all his life, explains it  this way to Jax, a girl whose mother lived out in the sticks and who has just  moved into town: "Sometimes you make things that won't last just for the  pleasure of making them. . . . When you make something beautiful, you change.  You put something of yourself into the thing you make. You're a different  person when you're done." And, "While you change yourself, you change the  world. Make it more your own."  </P> <P> These city folk, then, living off the truck garden in Union Square, biking down  deserted streets to Ocean Beach, feasting on leftover caviar from emptied-out  department stores, are living an idyllic life.  </P> <P> But -- wouldn't you know it? -- some Jell-O-brain named General "Four Star"  Miles has got bit all over again by the military bug. He's formed an army, and  is tramping all over Northern California from Sacramento to San Jose, occupying  towns, imprisoning innocent passers-by for questioning, extolling the virtues  of democracy, and so on. He intends, naturally, to invade San Francisco, make  an example of the dissidents: All those things that military men hold so dear.  </P> <P> Jax, in fact, has been instructed by a mysterious metallic angel to journey  into the city to warn the inhabitants, and the middle third of the book  consists of Jax's own process of getting "civilized" -- engaging in  conversation with "Books," chatting along with "The Machine," and falling in  love with Danny-boy. But Jax is also honor-bound to explain to them the  exigencies of war.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urban Warfare  </P> <P> Finally, General Four Star invades, with mayhem on his mind. But Danny-boy has  made an important strategic decision: What if he and his friends treat this war  as an art project? This then develops into an engaging tale of guerrilla  warfare: The real soldiers ride around on horses and in jeeps. They carry guns  and threaten death: The artists use purple smoke and jars of cockroaches, angry  wasps and cheap perfume laced with LSD. The value systems are Danny-boy's  love-at-all-costs vs. Jax's "sometimes-you've-got-to-defend-yourself"  philosophy. Both Jax and Danny-boy learn from each other. And -- ghosts, angels  and the city itself pitch in against the bad guys.  </P> <P> This novel is simple to a fault. Just hovering at the young-adult edge in terms  of linguistic sophistication. But what's wrong with that? The ideas themselves  here are subtle and interesting. It may be argued that the sooner people get  exposed to this kind of material, the better.  </P></p>

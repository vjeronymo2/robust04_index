			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu. V. Kistovich and Yu. D. Chashechkin, </F> Mechanical Problems Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC  551.466]    [Abstract] A theoretical investigation was made of  two-dimensional harmonic packets of internal waves (IW) in an  ideal exponentially stratified fluid. With the neglecting of the  Boussinesq approximation a study was made of the reflection of  monochromatic packets of internal waves from a rigid plane  surface. The problem is solved in a Cartesian coordinate system  with application of the phase portraits method. The phase  portraits for different cases are examined in detail. Neglecting  of the Boussinesq approximation results in the appearance of new  effects, especially with glancing angles of incidence on the  plane. If the plane is situated beneath an incident packet, in  addition to an ordinary reflected packet a packet appears which  transports energy in a direction opposite that of the incident  packet. However, if the plane is situated beneath an incident  packet a packet appears which transports energy in the same  direction as the incident packet, which results in a change in  the configuration of the incident packet. The envelopes of  incident and reflected packets are illustrated and discussed.  Figures 4; references 8: 3 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: NatWest chief warns of subdued loan demand THE SCOPE for growth in National Westminster Bank's income may be inhibited 'for some time' because of subdued loan demand, Lord Alexander, chairman, told the annual meeting in London yesterday. He said the first few months of 1993 indicated that 'we are over the worst so far as UK bad debts are concerned', but that subdued loan demand 'may well continue for some time, and inhibit the scope for income growth'. However, Lord Alexander said that NatWest Markets, the recently restructured corporate and investment banking arm, was among parts of the group where income was growing. NatWest Markets contributed Pounds 252m to group pre-tax profits of Pounds 405m. The previous year, the businesses within it contributed Pounds 315m profit, while the total pre-tax profit was only Pounds 110m. The unchanged dividend for 1992 reflected 'a degree of caution about the pace of economic recovery', but the bank looked forward to the time when it could provide shareholders with real dividend growth, the chairman added. Directors faced criticism from some shareholders for the rise in their remuneration last year despite the dividend being held. However, Lord Alexander said that directors had managed to raise profitability.</p>

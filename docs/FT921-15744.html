			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): End to 'military' management urged OLD-STYLE military manage-ment needs to be replaced by a more 'feminine' approach, Dr Beverly Alimo-Metcalfe, a senior psychology lecturer at Leeds University, claimed at a British Psychological Society conference yesterday. She said at the society's occupational psychology conference in Liverpool that 'feminine' styles, which companies will need to adopt in order to survive, remain discriminated against by job-selection procedures. She added that many companies accepted that they would have to abandon 'military' organisation. 'Heroic', invariably male, company leadership would need to be replaced by female management styles, she explained. There was, however, evidence that selection procedures still reflected old values. For example, women were discriminated against in group discussions which formed part of interviews, as men dominated conversations. Research by two other psychologists presented at the conference suggested that women were not prepared to adopt what were seen as male patterns of behaviour in order to win promotion. According to Dr Catherine Cassell from Sheffield Polytechnic and Dr Susan Walsh from Sheffield University, women were often forced into 'managing their femaleness' to survive at work. That meant they had to 'mother' and 'nurture' male colleagues, massage egos, or use their sexuality by flirting with or by flattering the men around them.</p>

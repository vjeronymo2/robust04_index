The amendment, which was passed by a vote of 62-38 and will  attach to the State Department authorization bill, is not  legally-binding.    In response, White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said  President Bill Clinton has not decided on the embargo but  "welcome the Senate's sentiment on that."    "The President has made changing relations with Vietnam  contingent on progress on MIA and POW (soldiers missing in  action and prisoners of war) issues," she said.    Myers said the criteria for better ties with Hanoi include  return of remains, resolution of discrepancy cases and  cooperation with Laos on solving the MIA issue.    "Progress has been made but the overall issue is still under  review," she said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item by Borislav Lalic] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 21 (TANJUG) -- Only a few days  following the NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb positions and civil  targets around Gorazde, Russian diplomat Vitaliy Churkin said in  a sharp and threatening manner that he is cutting off all  dialogue with the Bosnian Serbs and called on his country to do  the same.    One would not have expected something like this from a  diplomat who was considered the most persistent and competent  mediator in the search for a peaceful settlement to the Bosnian  war. It was believed that no one could put out of joint this  diplomat of fine manners and notable tolerance.    Many news analysts have tried to explain the motives and  grasp the background of his outburst and believe that the  popular Russian envoy has made a diplomatic blunder and simply  "cracked."    By his nervous and explosive reaction to the Bosnian Serbs'  behaviour, even if things had really occurred as he said,  Churkin has failed both as a politician and diplomat.    As a negotiator and mediator, he did what was the easiest  and  what a good politician would never do -- he gave up Bosnia in a  moment of personal frustration.    Time, which eventually reveals all, will show whether  Churkin's outburst has cut short his brilliant diplomatic career  which was developped mainly owing to his efforts in the Yugoslav  crisis. Churkin has managed to score more diplomatic points in  his mediating mission in Bosnia than anyone else, including Lord  Owen. It appears, however, that the burden of such a fame was  too much for him.    Time will also shed more light on some other issues and  motives of such a reaction. For instance, why was outburst  caused only by the Serbs' conduct. Previously there were also  dramatic events and all sides broke their promises, but Churkin  never got upset. Not even when the Bosnian Serbs were bombed  without consultation with his country, although this could have  been the right moment to tell the NATO leaders that they should  realize once and for all that Russia is a big state and not a  banana republic, as he told the Serbs.    Nevertheless, the most important question now is about the  further role of Russia in the resolution of the Bosnian drama  and overall Yugoslav crisis. It should not be crucially  influenced by Churkin's outburst and by Russia's "brotherly  feelings" towards the Serbs.    In any case, Russia has not given up Bosnia. This is evident  from the latest peace initiatives of President Boris Yeltsin who  has announced serious Russian engagement, including cooperation  with all factors of the international community and negotiations  with all warring sides in Bosnia.    The problem is so serious that it cannot be resolved at the  level of deputy foreign ministers, the Russian defence minister  said yesterday in a rather rough allusion to the position of  Vitaliy Churkin in his country.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Observer: Hype goes on Meanwhile, not even the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty on monetary union has slowed the momentum behind the bids from cities across Europe to house the European Central Bank. With public relations machines from Edinburgh to Barcelona in overdrive, the mere fact that the ECB might never happen has failed to hold back the campaigns. For instance, Sir Brian Jenkins, Lord Mayor of London, has just set off on yet another trip, this time to convince the Spanish and the Belgians that his city is the most serious contender. Only last month he was in Paris talking to its mayor Jacques Chirac in pursuit of the City's Pounds 1.5m drive to capture the ECB. Oddly enough, the mayor of Frankfurt is heading for London the week after next - could his trip be in any way related? After all, the Bundesbank has just rented the top 15 floors of Frankfurt's Messeturm, Europe's tallest building. It would make a fine address for a central bank. Perhaps England's Old Lady should follow suit by speculatively taking the odd cubic mile of Canary Wharf.</p>

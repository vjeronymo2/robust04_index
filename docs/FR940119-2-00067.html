Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from December 23, 1993, through January 6, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 615). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity For a Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By February 18, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (Project Director) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket Nos.

Specifically, in Technical Specification 5.3.1, ``Fuel Assemblies,'' the fuel enrichment would change from ``a maximum enrichment of 4.05 weight percent U-235'' to ``a maximum radially averaged enrichment of 4.30 weight percent U-235 at any axial location.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Standard 1 --  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The adequacy of a given core design must be demonstrated for each core prior to core reloading. The fuel enrichment is only one of the factors that must be considered in this determination. The fuel enrichment does not directly impact the results of the plant safety analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Unit 1, 2, and 3 fuel and storage areas have been analyzed for a maximum radially averaged enrichment of any axial enrichment zone with a fuel assembly of 4.30 w/o U-235.

The results of these analyses indicate that handling and storage of such fuel assemblies do not involve an unreviewed safety question.

Leakage suppresses criticality at low moderator density. Without 3-D modeling of the array, erroneously high values of k <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> eff <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  are calculated. Thus, the assumption on array leakage is relaxed, but reflection from the walls, floor and ceiling is included. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above discussion of the new fuel vault criticality analysis, the following conservative assumptions are applied to both analyses: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> - No credit is taken for the presence of burnable poison rods. These rods displace fuel rod positions and are an integral part of selected fuel assemblies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> - An upper bound for the fuel density was included in the nominal configuration of the fuel densities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> - The upper statistical bound of the fuel assembly enrichment, as based on the fuel fabrication specification, is included in the statistical evaluation of uncertainties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The criticality analysis of the Palo Verde new and spent fuel racks shows that the maximum radially averaged fuel enrichment of any axial enrichment zone within a fuel assembly which meets the appropriate NRC limit with uncertainties is higher than 4.30 w/o U-235. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although a higher enrichment fuel cycle may result in fuel burnup consisting of a slightly different mixture of nuclides and inventory, the effect is insignificant because the isotopic mixture and inventory of an irradiated assembly is relatively insensitive to the fuel assembly's initial enrichment. Therefore, the doses from postulated accidents are not significantly affected and continue to be acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Standard 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  -- Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation of Palo Verde with the proposed enrichment limit change will not create any new or different kinds of accidents from those previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adequacy of a given core design shall be demonstrated for each core prior to reloading.

This proposed license amendment justifies the adoption of the ``Design Features'' section of the Combustion Engineering STS for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant and then applies the developed criteria to the STS. The proposed criteria for determining what requirements should be placed in the Design Features section of the TSs are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The amount, kind, and source of special nuclear material required; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The place of the use of the special nuclear material; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Those features of the facility such as materials of construction and geometric arrangements, which, if altered or modified, would have an immediate and significant effect on safety and are not covered in the safety limits, limiting conditions for operation or surveillance requirements of the Technical Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Design Features section is Section 5.0 for the Calvert Cliffs TS and Section 4.0 for the STS. Specifically, the following changes are proposed to the Calvert Cliffs TSs and the STS for the Design Features section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 5.1 Site <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 contain maps of the site boundary and low population zones, respectively. These maps also show the major structures, effluent release points, meteorological tower location, and the minimum exclusion area radius. The STS requires inclusion of the site and exclusion area boundaries and the low population zone and allows descriptions instead of maps. These maps or descriptions do not meet any of the criteria. However, Criteria 2 requires that the place of use of the special nuclear material be described. BG&amp;E proposes to delete the existing Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 and to create Section 5.1, entitled ``Site Location,'' and to include a text description of the location of the site. The current information and maps in the sections will be relocated to the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). This change is also proposed for Section 4.1 of the STS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5.2 Containment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section does not meet Criteria 1, 2 or 3 in that modification of the containment would not create an immediate and significant effect on safety. Furthermore, containment integrity is covered in the Limiting Conditions for Operation and Surveillance Requirements sections of the TS. This Section is not included in the STS. BG&amp;E proposes to eliminate it from the Calvert Cliffs Design Features. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5.3 Reactor Core <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Calvert Cliffs TS Section 5.3 and corresponding STS Specification 4.2.1 and meets Criteria 1, e.g., state the amount, kind, and source of special nuclear material. For consistency with the STS, BG&amp;E proposes to adopt the STS titles and wording. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5.3.3 Control Element Assemblies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Calvert Cliffs Section 5.3.3, ``Control Element Assemblies,'' and the corresponding STS Section 4.2.2 does not meet Criteria 1, 2 or 3. The safety significant aspects of control rods, e.g., the reactivity worth of control rods and their required insertion times, are included in other portions of the TSs. Therefore, control rods do not fall under the Criteria 3 as features not described in other sections of the TSs. BG&amp;E proposes that this section be eliminated from the Calvert Cliffs Design Features and the STS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5.4 Reactor Coolant System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section does not meet any of the criteria and is not included in the STS. It does not meet Criteria 3 in that the requirements on degradation, pressure, and temperature are contained in other portions of the TS and changes in the total water and steam volume would not have an immediate and significant impact on safety. BG&amp;E proposes that it be eliminated from the Calvert Cliffs Technical Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5.5 Meteorological Tower Location <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section does not meet any of the criteria and is not included in the STS. BG&amp;E proposes to eliminate this section from the Calvert Cliffs Design Features section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5.6 Fuel Storage <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Calvert Cliffs Section 5.6.1, ``Criticality - Spent Fuel,'' specifies the minimum center-to-center distance, a K <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> eff <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  limit, and the maximum enrichment for fuel in the spent fuel storage racks. These requirements are also contained in STS Section 4.3.1.1, Items a, b, and c. Section 5.6.2, ``Criticality - New Fuel,'' specifies the minimum center-to-center distance, a k <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> eff <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  limit, and a maximum enrichment for fuel in the new fuel racks. These requirements are contained in STS Section 4.3.1.2, Items a, b, c, and d. These sections meet Criteria 3, e.g., geometries which, if altered, would have an immediate and significant impact on safety. These requirements do not appear in other sections of the TS. The STS language contains the same restrictions as the Calvert Cliffs Design Features while introducing no new requirements. BG&amp;E proposes adopting the STS language and we will add information on uncertainties of the referenced sections of the UFSAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 5.6.3 Drainage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section in the Calvert Cliffs Design Features section and the corresponding STS Section 4.3.2 does not meet any of the criteria. It does not meet Criteria 3 in that it does not describe geometry or materials of construction and because the requirements are contained in another portion of the TS. BG&amp;E proposes that this section be eliminated from the Calvert Cliffs Design Features section and from the STS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5.6.4 Capacity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5.6.4, ``Capacity,'' states the maximum spent fuel storage capacity. This meets Criteria 1 in that it limits the amount of special nuclear material that may be stored on site. The Calvert Cliffs TS language varies slightly from the STS language in that it makes clear that the storage capacity limit applies to the combined storage pool for Units 1 and 2. Therefore, we propose to retain the Calvert Cliffs TS language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5.7 Component Cyclic or Transient Limits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section is not included in the STS and does not meet any of the criteria. We propose that it be eliminated from the Calvert Cliffs Design Features section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to the Design Features section adopts language from the Design Features section of the Standard Technical Specifications (STS) for Combustion Engineering Plants (NUREG-1432, September, 1992), based on the Commission's Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors (July 16, 1993). Some requirements in the current Technical Specifications have been eliminated or relocated to the UFSAR based on the STS as evidence that the NRC no longer considers those requirements to meet the criteria for Design Features in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(4). In some cases, we have proposed elimination of some requirements in the STS and the Calvert Cliffs Technical Specifications based on a determination that they have no legal or regulatory basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose eliminating the ``Site'' sections, present in the Calvert Cliffs and the STS Design Features sections, which contain maps or descriptions of the site boundary and low population zone. There are no legal or regulatory requirements for including this information in the Technical Specifications and this information will be relocated to the UFSAR. We propose adding a ``Site Location'' section which contains a description of the Calvert Cliffs location as required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [,as amended]. The ``Containment,'' ``Reactor Coolant System,'' ``Meteorological Tower Location,'' and ``Component Cyclic or Transients Limits'' sections do not meet the legal or regulatory requirements for inclusion in the Design Features section, are not included in the STS, and have been deleted. The information in these sections is or will be contained in the UFSAR and will be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59. The ``Control Element Assemblies'' and ``Fuel Storage - Drainage'' sections are included in the STS and Calvert Cliffs Technical Specifications but eliminated in this change as these sections do not meet any of the legal or regulatory requirements for the Design Features section. This information is contained in the UFSAR and will be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59. We propose adopting the STS wording for the ``Reactor Core'' and ``Fuel Storage'' sections with no changes in the present limits or controls. Some information in the Calvert Cliffs Technical Specifications is not contained in the STS ``Reactor Core'' section. This information is contained in the UFSAR and will be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All information eliminated from the Design Features section of the Technical Specifications is or will be located in the UFSAR and will be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59. The design and operation of the plant have not changed. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not represent a change in the configuration or operation of the plant. All information eliminated from the Technical Specifications will continue to be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59. All legal and regulatory requirements for the Design Features section continue to be met. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not represent a change in the configuration or operation of the plant. All information eliminated from the Technical Specifications will continue to be controlled under 10 CFR 50.59. All legal and regulatory requirements for the Design Features section continue to be met. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

This is the third of three submittals and it changes specific setpoints to accommodate a 24 month fuel cycle and provides a justification for extending the surveillance interval for those components and systems that are not related to instrument setpoint changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This submittal results in changes to various equipment surveillance intervals and related instrument calibration frequencies and setpoints. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of lengthening the current 18 month interval to 24 months was evaluated and identified no significant system or component degradation as a consequence of lengthening the interval to 24 months; therefore, systems and components will continue to perform their design function. In some cases, the 24 month interval required setpoint changes to ensure instrument drift associated with the extended interval would not result in exceeding an instrument's acceptable setpoint tolerance. In other cases, justification of an extended interval was not developed because the surveillance could be performed on-line. In these cases, the ``once/cycle'' surveillance requirement is changed to the currently allowed 18 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes were developed using the guidance provided in Generic Letter 91-04 and Note 1 of Table 4.2.A through 4.2.G of Pilgrim's technical specifications. The proposed changes do not degrade the performance or increase the challenges to the associated safety systems assumed to function in the accident analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of lengthening the current calibration/functional test interval from 1 to 3 months for certain components was also evaluated. The evaluation used the guidance in Generic Letter 91-04 and Note 1 of Table 4.2.A through 4.2.G of Pilgrim's technical specifications. No significant system or component degradation was identified as a consequence of lengthening the interval to 3 months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes do not affect the availability of equipment or systems required to mitigate the consequences of an accident, and do not affect the availability of redundant systems or equipment. The plant will continue to operate within the limits specified in the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR) and will continue to take the same actions if setpoint limits are exceeded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, both the proposed setpoint and non-setpoint changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes with one exception, do not add or remove active components and, therefore, do not introduce failure mechanisms of a different type than those previously evaluated. In one case, the EDG breaker time delay relays will be replaced with more accurate relays to ensure the specified time sequence for starting and accepting the emergency load remains within specification for the extended cycle. The replacement relays will be similar in size, weight, voltage and temperature operating range as those being replaced; therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created. In addition, the surveillance test requirements and the way surveillance tests are performed will remain unchanged. Since the intended operation and function of the analyzed systems do not change as a result of the setpoint and non-setpoint analyses, no new initiators are introduced capable of initiating an accident that would render these systems unable to provide their required protection. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the proposed Technical Specification changes will result in an increase in the interval between surveillance tests, the existing margins of safety are maintained through our proposed setpoint revisions. The proposed setpoint changes either increase the plant safety margin or maintain the existing margin and do not significantly impact the availability, performance, or intended function of the affected systems. In the case of non-setpoint changes, evaluation of the affected systems indicates lengthening the interval to 24 months does not have significant impact on performance. Therefore, the assumptions in Pilgrim's accident analyses are not impacted, and the proposed Technical Specification changes do not significantly reduce the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis, and based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The proposed amendment would for both Dresden and Quad Cities, upgrade the requirements of Section 3.9/4.9, ``Auxiliary Electrical Systems,'' to include operating and shutdown Limiting Condition(s) for Operation (LCO) and Surveillance Requirement(s) (SR) that are consistent with the Standard Technical Specifications (STS) and later operating plant provisions. Within the upgrade to Section 3.9/4.9, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) reliability provisions are added to implement the recommendations of Generic Letter(s) 84-15 and 91-09; Information Notice(s) 84-69 and 91-62; and Regulatory Guide 1.9, draft Revision 3.

Implementation of these changes will provide increased reliability of equipment assumed to operate in the current safety analyses, or provide continued assurance that specified parameters remain within their acceptance limits, and as such, will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the proposed changes represent minor curtailments of the current requirements which are based on generic guidance or previously approved provisions for other stations. These proposed changes are consistent with the current safety analyses and have been previously determined to represent sufficient requirements for the assurance and reliability of equipment assumed to operate in the safety analyses, or provide continued assurance that specified parameters remain within their acceptance limits. As such, these changes will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> A.C. Sources - Operating:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed modifications for Section 3/4.9.A, ``A.C. Sources - Operating'', administratively incorporate the requirements of STS, where applicable to Dresden and Quad Cities Stations. Most deviations from the STS requirements are based upon generic guidance and other approved requirements at other sites. Dresden and Quad Cities Station are retaining the current seven day allowed outage time from their current specifications for loss of an EDG. However, an additional verification of EDG operability has been proposed for approximately midway through the seven day AOT. The additional verification and additional details in the surveillances will significantly improve the overall safety of both Dresden and Quad Cities Station. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both Dresden and Quad Cities Station's EDG history have shown them to be very reliable. This can be demonstrated by the excellent pass/fail rate observed during the monthly surveillance tests. As stated previously, the addition of several new STS enhancements to fuel storage and transfer requirements and other miscellaneous EDG surveillances recommended by ASTM codes will improve EDG reliability. Therefore, because the EDG's for Dresden and Quad Cities Station do not act as accident initiators, the probability of an accident previously evaluated for the sites is not increased by the incorporation of the proposed requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other changes based upon STS guidance are more restrictive and limit operation of the site with respect to all A.C. power sources. A.C. power sources do not act as initiators of accidents. Therefore, the probability of an accident previously evaluated for the sites is also not increased by the incorporation of the STS requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consequences of any previously evaluated accidents are not increased as more restrictions and limitations are added to the current versions of both Dresden and Quad Cities specifications. The retention of the seven day allowed outage times for the EDG's and the offsite power sources does not increase the consequences of any previously analyzed accident for both sites as these are the current requirements. Therefore, the consequences of any previously evaluated accident is not increased as a result of the proposed changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> A.C.

Sources - Shutdown'', administratively incorporate the requirements of STS where applicable to Dresden and Quad Cities Station. The STS requirements add additional provisions not in the current Technical Specifications for EDG fuel storage capability that will reduce the consequences of a previously analyzed accident. The probability of any previously evaluated accident is reduced during shutdown by the additional STS restrictions proposed for fuel handling type of activities. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any previously evaluated accident for Dresden and Quad Cities Station. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> D.C.

Sources - Operating'', incorporate the requirements of STS where applicable for Dresden and Quad Cities Stations. Dresden and Quad Cities are proposing to retain the current provisions specified in the current version of Quad Cities Technical Specifications that allow the 125 and 250 VDC systems to be out-of-service for a period up to 72 hours. This 72-hour AOT may be extended, when applied to the 125 VDC systems, for up to a maximum period of 7 days with both units operating if the alternate 125 VDC battery is operable. These changes introduce a difference when compared to the STS requirements. However, the STS requirements as applied to Dresden and Quad Cities battery systems would prove to be overly burdensome requiring dual unit shutdowns to perform most maintenance or testing activities. The additional batteries in the design of the stations, with their surveillances, charger requirements, and breaker verifications, compensate for any STS deviations. The proposed requirements are comparable to the existing requirements and AOTs for Quad Cities Station; therefore, the consequences of any previously evaluated accident are not increased. The proposed changes add additional surveillance requirements to the D.C. systems at Dresden and Quad Cities to enhance their reliability and operational readiness. This also ensures the consequences of any previously evaluated accident are not increased. Because the D.C. system is not assumed as an accident initiator, the probability of any previously evaluated accident is not increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> D.C.

Sources - Shutdown'', administratively incorporate the requirements of STS where applicable to Dresden and Quad Cities Station. The proposed changes add additional surveillance requirements and more explicitly clarify the LCO's. The additional provision for fuel handling type of activities reduces the probability of previously evaluated accidents from occurring. The additional surveillance activities also improve D.C. reliability and thus, reduce the probability of D.C. system unavailability and hence, reduce the consequences of previously evaluated accidents. Because the D.C. system is not considered as an accident initiator, the probability of any previously evaluated accident is not increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Distribution - Operating:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed modifications for Section 3/4.9.E, ``Distribution - Operating'', administratively incorporate the requirements of STS where applicable to Dresden and Quad Cities Station. The proposed changes add additional surveillance requirements and LCO's. The proposed requirements/actions for the D.C. distribution system are retained to be consistent to the proposed AOTs for the D.C. system. The STS requirements as applied to the Dresden/Quad Cities D.C. distribution system would prove to be overly burdensome, requiring plant shutdowns to perform maintenance or testing activities. The additional distribution system surveillance and LCO's compensate for the STS deviations.

Extensive analyses and testing were performed to demonstrate the adequacy of the tube sleeves. The analyses were performed using design and operating transient parameters which enveloped loads imposed during normal operating, upset and accident conditions. Mechanical testing was performed to demonstrate leak resistance and joint strength, including fatigue resistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corrosion testing was also performed to assess the corrosion resistance of the sleeve and joint. Based upon the results of the analytical and test programs described in detail in the above mentioned reports, these tube sleeves meet or exceed all the established design and operating criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utilization of tube sleeves not only reduces the risk of primary to secondary leakage in the steam generator, but can also provide for more margin in the safety analysis. Sleeving a tube results in a primary flow reduction which has no significant effect on the steam generator performance with respect to heat transfer or system flow resistance and pressure drop. The cumulative impact of multiple sleeved tubes has been evaluated to ensure the effects remain within the design bases. The installation of tube sleeves can be accomplished within the tube plugging analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the extensive analysis and test program performed and the ability to monitor and remove degraded sleeves from service, this change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A sleeved tube performs the same function in the same passive manner as the unsleeved tube. Tube sleeves are designed, qualified, and maintained under the stress and pressure limits of ASME Section III and Regulatory Guide 1.121. Eddy current testing is performed following installation of each sleeve in order to verify the proper installation of the tube sleeve and to obtain baseline eddy current data. This baseline data is used to monitor any subsequent degradation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the use of tube sleeves does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Steam generator tube integrity is maintained under the same limits for sleeved tubes as for unsleeved tubes in accordance with ASME Section III and Regulatory Guide 1.1.21. The degradation limit at which a tube is considered inoperable remains unchanged and is detectable for sleeves as well as tubes. The technical specifications continue to require monitoring and restriction of primary to secondary system leakage through the steam generators, such that there remains reasonable assurance that a significant increase in leakage, due to failure of a sleeved (or unsleeved) tube, will be detected. The slight reduction in reactor coolant system flow, due to sleeving, is considered to have an insignificant impact on steam generator operation during normal operation and accident conditions and is clearly bounded by tube plugging evaluations. The technical specifications will continue to contain reporting requirements for tubes which have had their degradation spanned regardless of whether the tube is plugged or sleeved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

It is not a limit to be applied during transients. This is because accident analyses are initiated from steady state conditions and are not required to assume a core power distribution transient simultaneous with or immediately prior to the accident. This would in effect be two accidents occurring simultaneously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The probability of having an accident immediately after a CEA drop during the 24 hour period allowed for tilt to be restored to less than 3% is very low. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification 3/4.1.3 addresses the CEA misalignments and requires a 30% power reduction within one hour if the CEA cannot be restored to its proper position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reducing power as required in TS 3.2.3 action b.2 will tend to increase the azimuthal tilt, making the transient worse. A lower power reduces the rate at which xenon near the dropped CEA can be burned out. Maintaining power will quicken the process and keep the tilt as low as possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional time is only allowed for a confirmed CEA misalignment which operators have procedures to respond to. The change in tilt is expected and is not indicative of anomalous core power distribution behavior that might require more immediate action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change conservatively reduces the Azimuthal Power Tilt technical specification limit to agree with the assumptions used in the safety analysis. The lower tilt represents a more even power distribution in the core. A CEA drop event may temporarily cause the azimuthal power tilt to exceed the 3% limit. However, for the reasons identified above and since the probability of having another event within the 24 hours allowed for recovery after the CEA drop is extremely low, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The change in technical specification limit on tilt does not involve any change to any equipment or the manner in which the plant will be operated.

These ``notes'' were based on an overly conservative calculation which determined that both chargers were required to supply adequate power to connected loads including an Uninterruptible Power Supply. More recent calculations indicate that one (1) charger is adequate to supply power to connected loads and an Uninterruptible Power Supply. Based on these more recent calculations, Niagara Mohawk proposes to delete these ``notes.'' Because it has been determined adequate power will be provided to connected loads with one (1) charger, deletion of these ``notes'' will not affect the reliability of connected loads nor their ability to perform their intended function. Therefore, this change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing Technical Specification 4.8.2.1 requires that the 125-volt batteries be demonstrated to be operable by verifying that the average electrolyte temperature of one out of five connected cells is above 60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. The Nine Mile Point Unit 2 Updated Safety Analysis Report and current battery capacity calculations assume a battery electrolyte temperature of at least 65 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. The change from 60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F to 65 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F is conservative in that battery capacity is increased.

Since it has been determined that one (1) battery charger is sufficient to provide adequate power, deletion of these ``notes'' which require that two (2) chargers be available does not affect the capability of the chargers to perform their function. The proposal to change the required electrolyte temperature from 60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F to 65 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F increases the capacity of the batteries and therefore improves the capability of the batteries to perform their intended function.

The permanent cessation of power generation at Trojan and the May 5, 1993 amendment to the license which granted the licensee a Possession Only License for the facility has rendered many of the existing provisions of the current Appendix A Technical Specifications inappropriate.

Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment shows that the worst case design basis accident for this plant, in its permanently shutdown defueled state, is a postulated spent fuel handling accident at the Trojan facility. The licensee has also identified a second postulated design basis accident scenario, a loss of forced cooling to the spent fuel pool. Other Trojan Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) accident scenarios addressed in Chapter 15 are no longer applicable to Trojan in the permanently defueled mode. The proposed amendment does not lessen any of the requirements associated with handling spent fuel and therefore, the probability of a fuel handling accident occurring is unchanged. The licensee has analyzed the a loss of forced spent fuel pool cooling accident and has shown that this scenario would not result in a radiological release. The proposed amendment does not change the consequences of the accident since it does not affect the magnitude, detection, or mitigation of either accident scenario. Additionally, the ability of the spent fuel pool to withstand other applicable FSAR events, natural phenomena, and fires is either unchanged from the existing licensing basis or is improved during the permanently defueled condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

Most of the existing plant systems and functions will not be operational in the permanently defueled condition since power operations are prohibited and all of the fuel at Trojan is stored in the spent fuel pool. However, all structures, systems and components that are necessary for safe fuel handling and storage activities will be maintained operable during the permanently defueled condition. The proposed PDTS provide operation and surveillance requirements and administrative controls which are sufficient to ensure that the required structures, systems and components will be maintained operable in the permanently defueled condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed PDTS are sufficient to ensure no reduction in a margin of safety, in part, because of the reduced range of design basis accidents against which the facility must be protected now that the facility is prohibited from power operations and is permanently defueled. Only a fuel handling accident or a loss of forced cooling to the spent fuel pool are relevant during the permanently defueled condition. The margins of safety for both of these accidents will remain the same or improve by maintaining the facility in accordance with the proposed PDTS. None of the other Chapter 15 FSAR accidents are applicable since power operations are prohibited and the facility is permanently defueled. Additionally, the margins of safety for other applicable FSAR events, natural phenomena, and fires are either unchanged from the existing licensing basis or are improved during the permanently defueled condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis, and based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The allowance for the disconnection of sections of the WCPS will allow the Authority to avoid repairs that can potentially degrade containment integrity or the condition of vital equipment. The WC &amp; PPS will still provide continuous pressurization and monitoring of leak-tightness for the zones incorporated into the containment penetrations and for at lease 80% of the channels over the welds in the steel inner of the containment building. The WC &amp; PPS will continue to provide assurance that the containment leak rate in the event of an accident is lower than that assumed in the accident analyses because the accident analyses do not assume that any section of the WC &amp; PPS is operating. The administrative changes correct errors in the technical specifications and technical specification bases.

Burst testing performed on pulled tubes with up to 7.5 volt indications show burst pressures in excess of 5900 psi at room temperature. As stated earlier, tube burst criteria are inherently satisfied during normal operating conditions by the presence of the tube support plate. Furthermore, correcting for the effects of temperature on material properties and minimum strength levels (as the burst testing was done at room temperature), tube burst capability significantly exceeds the R.G. [Regulatory Guide] 1.121 criterion requiring the maintenance of a margin of 1.43 times the steam line break pressure differential on tube burst if through-wall cracks are present without regard to the presence of the tube support plate. Based on the existing data base this criterion is satisfied with bobbin coil indications with signal amplitudes over twice the 2.0 volt interim repair criteria, regardless of the indicated depth measurement. This structural limit is based on a lower 95 [percent] confidence level limit of the data. The 2.0 volt criteria provides an extremely conservative margin of safety to the structural limit considering expected growth rates of outside diameter stress corrosion cracking at Farley. Alternate crack morphologies can correspond to a voltage so that a unique crack length is not defined by a burst pressure to voltage correlation. However, relative to expected leakage during normal operating conditions, no field leakage has been reported from tubes with indications with a voltage level of under 7.7 volts for a 3/4 inch tube with a 10 volt correlation to 7/8 inch tubing (as compared to the 2.0 volt proposed interim tube repair limit). Thus, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, the accidents that are affected by primary-to-secondary leakage and steam release to the environment are Loss of External Electrical Load and/or Turbine Trip, Loss of All AC Power to Station Auxiliaries, Major Secondary System Pipe Failure, Steam Generator Tube Rupture, Reactor Coolant Pump Locked Rotor, and Rupture of a Control Rod Drive Mechanism Housing. Of these, the Major Secondary System Pipe Failure is the most limiting for Farley in considering the potential for off-site doses. The offsite dose analyses for the other events which model primary-to secondary leakage and steam release from the secondary side to the environment assume that the secondary side remains intact. The steam generator tubes are not subjected to a sustained increase in differential pressure, as is the case following a steam line break event. This increase in differential pressure is responsible for the postulated increase in leakage and associated offsite doses following a steam line break event. In addition, the steam line break event results in a bypass of containment for steam generator leakage. Upon implementation of the interim repair criteria, it must be verified that the expected distribution of cracking indications at the tube support plate intersections are such that primary-to-secondary leakage would result in site boundary dose within the current licensing basis. Data indicate that a threshold voltage of 2.8 volts would result in through-wall cracks long enough to leak at steam line break conditions. Application of the proposed repair criteria requires that the current distribution of a number of indications versus voltage be obtained during the refueling outages. The current voltage is then combined with the rate of change in voltage measurement and a voltage measurement uncertainty to establish an end of cycle voltage distribution and, thus, leak rate during steam line break pressure differential. The leak rate during a steam line break is further increased by a factor related to the probability of detection of the flaws. If it is found that the potential steam line break leakage for degraded intersections planned to be left in service coupled with the reduced specific activity levels allowed result in radiological consequences outside the current licensing basis, then additional tubes will be plugged or repaired to reduce steam line break leakage potential to within the acceptance limit. Thus, the consequences of the most limiting design basis accident are constrained to present licensing basis limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2) The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of the proposed interim tube support plate elevation steam generator tube repair criteria does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Use of the criteria does not provide a mechanism which could result in an accident outside of the region of the tube support plate elevations. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a steam generator in which the repair criteria has been applied (during all plant conditions). The bobbin probe signal amplitude repair criteria is established such that operational leakage of excessive leakage during a postulated steam line break condition is not anticipated. Southern Nuclear has previously implemented a maximum leakage rate limit of 140 gpd [gallons per day] per steam generator on Unit 1. The R.G. 1.121 criterion for establishing operational leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leak-before-break considerations to detect a free span crack before potential tube rupture. The 140 gpd limit provides for leakage detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated with the longest permissible crack length. R.G. 1.121 acceptance criteria for establishing operating leakage limits are based on leak-before-break considerations such that plant shutdown is initiated if the leakage associated with the longest permissible crack is exceeded. The longest permissible crack is the length that provides a factor of safety of 1.43 against bursting at steam line break pressure differential. A voltage amplitude approximately 9 volts for typical outside diameter stress corrosion cracking corresponds to meeting this tube burst requirement at the 95 [percent] prediction interval on the burst correlation. Alternate crack morphologies can correspond to a voltage so that a unique crack length is not defined by the burst pressure versus voltage correlation. Consequently, typical burst pressure versus through-wall crack length correlations are used below to define the ``longest permissible crack'' for evaluating operating leakage limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The single through-wall crack lengths that result in tube burst at 1.43 times steam line break pressure differential and steam line break conditions are about 0.53 inch and 0.84 inch, respectively. Normal leakage for these crack lengths would range from about 0.4 gallons per minute to 4.5 gallons per minute respectively while lower 95 [percent] confidence level leak rates would range from about 0.06 gallons per minute to 0.6 gallons per minute, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An operating leak rate of 140 gpd per steam generator has been implemented on Unit 1. This leakage limit provides for detection of 0.4 inch long cracks at nominal leak rates and 0.6 inch long cracks at the lower 95 [percent] confidence level and for three times normal operating pressure differential at less than nominal leak rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the implementation of interim plugging criteria will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3) The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of the interim tube support plate elevation repair criteria is demonstrated to maintain steam generator tube integrity commensurate with the requirements of R.G. 1.121. R.G. 1.121 describes a method acceptable to the NRC staff for meeting [General Design Criteria] 2, 14, 15, 31, and 32 by reducing the probability of the consequences of steam generator tube rupture. This is accomplished by determining the limiting conditions of degradation of steam generator tubing, as established by inservice inspection, for which tubes with unacceptable cracking should be removed from service. Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the worst case conditions, the occurrence of outside diameter stress corrosion cracking at the tube support plate elevations is not expected to lead to a steam generator tube rupture event during normal or faulted plant conditions. The most limiting effect would be a possible increase in leakage during a steam line break event. Excessive leakage during a steam line break event, however, is precluded by verifying that, once the criteria are applied, the expected end of cycle distribution of crack indications at the tube support plate elevations would result in minimal, and acceptable primary to secondary leakage during the event and hence help to demonstrate radiological conditions are less than an appropriate fraction of the 10 CFR [Part] 100 guideline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The margin to burst for the tubes using the interim repair criteria is comparable to that currently provided by existing technical specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addressing the combined effects of LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] + SSE [safe shutdown earthquake] on the steam generator component (as required by GDC 2), it has been determined that tube collapse may occur in the steam generators at some plants. This is the case as the tube support plates may become deformed as a result of lateral loads at the wedge supports at the periphery of the plate due to either the LOCA rarefaction wave and/or SSE loadings. Then the resulting pressure differential on the deformed tubes may cause some of the tubes to collapse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two issues associated with steam generator tube collapse. First, the collapse of steam generator tubing reduces the RCS [reactor coolant system] flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow area increases the resistance to flow of steam from the core during a LOCA which, in turn, may potentially increase Peak Clad Temperature (PCT). Second, there is a potential the partial through-wall cracks in tubes could progress to through-wall cracks during tube deformation or collapse or that short through-wall indications would leak at significantly higher leak rates than included in the leak rate assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, a detailed leak-before-break analysis was performed and it was concluded that the leak-before-break methodology (as permitted by GDC 4) is applicable to the Farley Unit 1 [RCS] primary loops and, thus, the probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered in the structural design basis of the plant. Excluding breaks in RCS primary loops, the LOCA loads from the large branch line breaks were analyzed at Farley Unit 1 and were found to be of insufficient magnitude to result in steam generator tube collapse or significant deformation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of whether or not leak-before-break is applied to the primary loop piping at Farley, any flow area reduction is expected to be minimal (much less than 1 [percent]) and PCT margin is available to account for this potential effect. Based on analyses results, no tubes near wedge locations are expected to collapse or deform to the degree that secondary to primary in-leakage would be increased over current expected levels. For all other steam generator tubes, the possibility of secondary-to-primary leakage in the event of a LOCA + SSE event is not significant. In actuality, the amount of secondary-to-primary leakage in the event of a LOCA + SSE is expected to be less than that currently allowed, i.e., 500 gpd per steam generator. Furthermore, secondary-to-primary in-leakage for the same pressure differential since the cracks would tend to tighten under a secondary-to-primary pressure differential. Also the presence of the tube support plate is expected to reduce the amount of in-leakage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Addressing the R.G. 1.83 considerations, implementation of the tube repair criteria is supplemented by 100 [percent] inspection requirements at the tube support plate elevations having outside diameter stress corrosion cracking indications, reduced operating leak rate limits, eddy current inspection guidelines to provide consistency in voltage normalization, and rotating pancake coil inspection requirements for the larger indications left in service to characterize the principal degradation mechanism as outside diameter stress corrosion cracking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted previously, implementation of the tube support plate elevation repair criteria will decrease the number of tubes which must be taken out of service with tube plugs or repaired. The installation of steam generator tube plugs or tube sleeves would reduce the RCS flow margin, thus implementation of the interim repair criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced through increased tube plugging or sleeving. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed change does not result in a significant reduction in margin with respect to plant safety as defined in the Final Safety Analysis Report or any bases of the plant Technical Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The probability of an accident occurrence is not increased in itself by the proposed changes in surveillance testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps and valves. [A]uxiliary feedwater pump testing is performed through a full-flow test line, thereby not affecting normal plant operations. Changes to the testing therefore do not affect the probability of an accident occurrence. Redundant trains of the Auxiliary Feedwater System remain available during surveillance testing, therefore, the consequences of an accident are unchanged by the proposed changes in the Auxiliary Feedwater System surveillance test frequencies. Quarterly testing of the pumps and valves will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System is capable of performing its intended functions for either unit if called upon. Consistent with Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' the new testing frequency should reduce Auxiliary Feedwater System unavailability resulting from failures and equipment degradation during testing, thereby resulting in improved system reliability. Invoking ASME Section XI as the acceptance criteria for testing the Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps is an enhancement to the acceptance criteria presently specified. Furthermore, the operability requirements for the Auxiliary Feedwater System remain unchanged. Therefore, the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident are not increased by the proposed changes in surveillance requirements for the Auxiliary Feedwater System. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

Quarterly testing of the pumps and valves during both operation and shutdown will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing its intended function for either unit. Invoking ASME Section XI acceptance criteria for testing the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps is an enhancement to the acceptance criteria presently specified. The operability requirements for the Auxiliary Feedwater System remain unchanged. Furthermore, new or different failure modes are not introduced by these changes in surveillance requirements. Therefore, a new or different type of accident is not created by these proposed changes in surveillance requirements for the Auxiliary Feedwater System. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

System operating parameters are unaffected. This reduced pump and valve testing frequency should reduce Auxiliary Feedwater System unavailability due to actual testing, as well as failures and equipment degradation during testing. Thus reduced testing results in an improved system reliability. Quarterly testing of the pumps and valves during operation and shutdown will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing its intended functions for either unit. Therefore, the reduction in surveillance testing requirements for the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps and valves does not reduce any margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The existing core power and reactor coolant system transient analyses assumed initial hot shutdown conditions for all cases analyzed since this represents the most conservative initial conditions for the accident. The analysis of the containment pressure transient also assumed initial hot shutdown conditions (at which time the steam pressure is highest and there is the greatest inventory of water in the steam generator). The containment pressure analysis also conservatively delayed the MSIV closures such that steam flow from both steam generators existed for the first ten seconds.

The proposed revisions to Section 15.3.6 specify appropriate completion times for each LCO to eliminate the need to default to the generic time requirements given in Section 15.3.0. If the required actions and associated completion times are not met, the plant must be brought to at least hot shutdown within 6 hours and to cold shutdown within 36 hours. The slightly longer time to hot shutdown is more than offset by the shorter time to cold shutdown, thereby reducing the consequences of a release from containment. These times are reasonable, based on operating experience, to reach the required plant conditions from full power conditions in an orderly manner without challenging plant systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no physical change to the facility, its system, or its operation.

The proposed amendments will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes will add operating conditions and limiting conditions for operation to Section 15.3.6, ``Containment System,'' of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant (PBNP) Technical Specifications (TS). This change also proposes revisions to Sections 15.1, ``Definitions,'' and 15.4.4, ``Containment Tests,'' to support the changes to Section 15.3.6. Additionally, the change will add explanatory text to the bases for Section 15.3.6 to support the revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revisions will add more specific LCOs for containment isolation valves, air locks, overall containment air leakage, and internal pressure. The proposed LCOs state more clearly the requirements for operability and the actions to be taken if the requirements are not met. The proposed LCOs reflect the intent of the Westinghouse Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1431. None of the existing LCOs are being removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As most of the existing LCOs in Section 15.3.6 do not specify completion times for required actions, Section 15.3.0, ``General Considerations,'' applies. Section 15.3.0 states that if an LCO does not prescribe a time period, the affected unit shall be placed in hot shutdown within three hours of discovering the situation. If the conditions which prompted the shutdown cannot be corrected, the unit shall be placed in cold shutdown within 48 hours of discovering the situation. The proposed revisions to Section 15.3.6 specify appropriate completion times for each LCO to eliminate the need to default to the generic time requirements given in Section 15.3.0. If the required actions and associated completion times are not met, the plant must be brought to at least hot shutdown within 6 hours and to cold shutdown within 36 hours. The slightly longer time to hot shutdown is more than offset by the shorter time to cold shutdown, thereby reducing the consequences of a release from containment. These times are reasonable, based on operating experience, to reach the required plant conditions in an orderly manner without challenging plant systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no physical change to the facility, its systems, or its operation. Thus, a significant reduction in a margin of safety cannot occur. In fact, by adding more specific LCOs for containment integrity and allowing for a more orderly unit shutdown when required, an increased margin of safety may be realized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

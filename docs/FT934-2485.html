			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Rover to raise car prices by 2.9% The price of Rover cars is to rise by an average of 2.9 per cent from Monday. The increase, Rover's first for a year, is expected to be followed by other manufacturers next month. However, some of Rover's rivals indicated last night that the traditional new year round of price increases - which has usually been triggered by market leader Ford - may not materialise because of exceptionally competitive conditions in the new car market. Rover last increased its prices - also by an average of 2.9 per cent - last December. Ford prices have had a complex year. In January there were substantial increases, mostly between 4.5 and 7.5 per cent. They were then cut by an average of 5.2 per cent in April, though Ford increased them by an average of 2.55 per cent in August. Vauxhall imposed average increases of 2 per cent and 2.45 per cent in March and August respectively. Peugeot has also put its prices up by a total of 3 per cent.</p>

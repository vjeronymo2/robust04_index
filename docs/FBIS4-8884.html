			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Damir Jurisic: "Moles, Agents, and Provocateurs"] </F>   [Text] Is the Republic of Croatia facing early elections,  as Tihomil Radja, vice president of the HSS [Croatian Peasant  Party], has asserted in VECERNJI LIST? This is a question which  has another two more important ones in the background: Who in  the government is thinking of organizing those elections and to  what purpose? Aside from that, Radja's assertion about a  "mentor" from the government who ordered a split in the HSS is  the finale of these 12 months since the election, during which  most of Croatia's parliamentary parties--from the HSP [Croatian  Rights Party], DA [Dalmatian Action], SDH [Social Democrats of  Croatia], IDS [Istrian Democratic Conference] to the HSS--have  been less concerned with politics and more with hunting "moles"  and "agents provocateurs of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union]"  in their own ranks. Which gives rise to a new question: If the  stories about the moles are accurate, who in the HDZ planted  them, the soft line or the hard line?    Finally, are there moles even in the very top leadership of  the HDZ? We might well ask ourselves following the public  statements by Stipe Mesic, president of the Sabor [Croatian  Assembly], and Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of  Zupanijas. Mesic has not only displayed a lack of party  discipline by refusing--say well-informed sources--Dr. Tudjman's  request that he submit his resignation, but has confused the  public with his statement in GLOBUS that many decisions in  Croatia are being made by the "force of authority, not by force  of law" and that some of the members of the HDZ have taken over  the "bolshevik model of thought and political behavior." He had  something equally important to say in SLOBODNA DALMACIJA to the  effect that the Washington agreement is a victory for the  original HDZ, and a defeat for the "current which favored war."  <H5>  Continuity or Change of Direction </H5>   At just about the same time, Josip Manolic in FERAL was  calling upon Gojko Susak, defense minister, to take  responsibility and resign because of the Muslim-Croatian  conflict, and indirectly President Tudjman himself for the  erroneously chosen policy of the HDZ, and thereby also that of  the Croatian state, toward Bosnia and Herzegovina. Manolic, say  sources close to the top leadership of the HDZ, also broke with  party discipline and violated the decision to interpret the  signing of the Washington agreement as expressive of the  continuity of HDZ policy, rather than as a change of direction.    Can the policy of the state be conducted without exchanges  of  fire between responsible statesmen along party lines, especially  in decisive moments, the citizen-voters are wondering and  remaining confused as to whether Mesic, Manolic, and the  president of the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party] are on the  same line? And why now? As Drazen Budisa says in GLOBUS, it  should be explained to every one of our citizens that the  opposition has been in favor of an integral Bosnia and  Herzegovina from the beginning. Is not Zdravko Tomac of the SDP  [Social Democratic Party] more sober and wiser when he warns in  NEDELJNA DALMACIJA that this is the time for the highest degree  of Croatian concord, that everything should be subordinated to  reestablishment of Croatian authority over the entire territory,  that maturity should be shown, and there should be no rejoicing  when leaders of the HDZ interpret the new decisions as proof of  the correctness of their Croatian policy conducted toward Bosnia  and Herzegovina up to now?    So, if, as the speculation runs in Zagreb political  corridors, an early election to the Sabor is the objective of  the Mesic and Manolic current, what is expected? The result is  allegedly supposed to be a weakening of the right wing of the  HDZ and, with the establishment of new coalitions among the  winners, constitutional and legal changes that would restrict  the authority of the president of the state to the advantage of  the Sabor. Would that compel President Tudjman to listen to  them, in spite of his legitimate five-year term, why would the  government have to schedule new elections for president? These  questions will nevertheless remain at the level of speculation,  because an "early" election for the deputies in the Croatian  parliament is called by--the president of the state!    So the real question is whether the president of the state  wants an early election to the Sabor, and could these dissonant  tones within the HDZ hurt him? What can the Mesic-Manolic  "faction" do? They can capitalize on the assumed political power  and influence of their parliamentary posts only to the real  limits of their influence on the coercive agencies: the army,  the police, and--most important in domestic political  conflicts--the state treasury.  <H5>  Integration and Confederation </H5>   That influence, say the well-informed, is not nearly what it  would have to be to mount even a small threat to the president  of the state. There is evidence that that is the case in the  fact that Josip Manolic presented his argument to the public  through FERAL. The impact is only a bit greater than if he had  given the interview to HRVATSKA LJEVICA, whose managing editor  Stipe Suvar put on the front page of the first issue (could it  be an accident?) a 1946 poster of Andrija Maurovic with the  caption "Long Live Election to the Constitutional Assembly, an  Expression of the Statehood and Sovereignty of the People of  Croatia"!?    At the moment President Tudjman certainly has no reason to  call an extraordinary parliamentary election. What is more, as  the political realists suggest, there are also not many reasons  for a referendum on confederation of Croatia with the federation  of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A customs union between the two  countries would be sufficient for the beginning. Aside from  that, although the first solicitor general, Smiljko Sokol, has  said on Croatian TV that only the percentage of votes "in favor"  in the referendum on confederation is important--so that it  would be valid even without being conducted on the occupied  parts of Croatia--the attitude of the public is summed up in the  formula: first, return of what has been occupied, and then  possible alliances with other states.</p>

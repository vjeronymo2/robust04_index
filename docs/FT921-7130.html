			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (10): The mission to motivate - Incentive Travel A DECADE after veteran cruise liner Canberra was on its way to the Falkland Islands carrying British troops, the ship will this year embark on a different mission: in June it will be carrying over 600 delegates on a three-day cruise as part of the Personal Investment Marketing conference and exhibition being held on board. The event, organised by Emap Events, will bring together invited top-level delegates, with more than 70 personal finance companies willing to fund the cruise for the sake of having a captive audience who, presumably, will be in a more receptive frame of mind away from their desks. Such captive cruises are increasingly part of the conference scene and emphasise that travel - be it by land, sea or air - is a crucial part of the reason why people attend conferences at all. Many conferences, in fact, turn out to be thinly-disguised incentive trips used to motivate key staff or distribution teams. 'The annual overseas convention is virtually part of the remuneration package of performers in life assurance,' points out Mr David Hackett, managing director of the Travel Organisation, which arranges conference travel. This is how the US conference market has worked for years, largely as a result of the need to bring together scattered sales forces for regular motivational sessions. Although many executives are used to travelling on business, a properly organised incentive trip offers more opportunity to provide excitement and luxury than most business travel actually delivers. The difficulty, however, for those in the travel industry is identifying when conference travel is really a disguised incentive and when it is a genuine business conference. Yet the distinction between the two is becoming so blurred as to be virtually meaningless for many delegates. But whether it is a conference or an incentive trip, there is little doubt that the companies paying for the travel are seeking a return for their investment. The straightforward incentive travel trip has traditionally been used to motivate sales forces in industries such as insurance, motors and pharmaceuticals. Companies in these sectors all depend a great deal on their sales forces - or dealers - to sell the products. Simply offering traditional rewards such as a better car or more money only works up to a certain level, these companies believe. Incentive travel may be more cost-effective. Research in the US has also shown that individuals who earn the right to be on a trip one year often work even harder in the following year to ensure that they retain the perk, lest the executive lose status in the eyes of his or her peers. Yet the problem with such performance-related incentives is that they only motivate the high-flyer: those without a realistic chance of achieving the travel award may be demotivated early on. Incentive travel organisers and their users are seeking ways of getting round this problem. One approach has been to offer different grades of travel incentives; a short-haul trip to a European city could be the incentive for those less successful than the high-flyers who win trips to more exotic, long-haul destinations. Another device is to offer special deals, such as the Air Miles/Latitudes system operated by British Airways. These enable companies to award so many miles of free air travel according to the particular incentive scheme. However, the harsher economic climate has made some companies wary about their key executives being away from home for too long. Experience has shown that companies prefer flight times of up to 1 1/2 hours for short-haul flights and up to 10 hours for long-haul. Companies also prefer not to change aircraft and often to remain at one centre with a strong local interest and image. France, not surprisingly, remains the most popular short-haul conference and incentive destination, followed by Spain and Germany, according to a survey of over 1,000 companies and conference organisers carried out by the publishers of the Conference Green and Blue Books which list conference venues. North America came next, ahead of Ireland and Italy which are both seen as difficult conference and incentive destinations for major companies because of the security implications. Cruise liners, on the other hand, offer not only high security but also other benefits. Actual expenditure, for example, can be forecast very accurately in advance since the bulk of spending - fares, accommodation and food - are known. Discretionary spending aboard conference cruises is usually left to the individual. The current economic climate is, not surprisingly, making companies more wary of their use of travel incentives. Mr Hackett points out that 'spending has moved away from incentives committed to achieving high volumes, and instead towards the need to motivate people simply to maintain market share.' He notes that in the motor industry, for example, 'what might have been an overseas event has reverted back to the UK, and where dealers might have previously been entertained overnight, in many cases events have been reduced to daytime only activities.' Mr Hackett sees no sign of a significant uplift in conference and incentive travel spending in 1992. 'For some companies this is merely a reflection of reduced marketing budgets, while for others such activity may be seen as inappropriate while their business suffers and some staff are being made redundant.'</p>

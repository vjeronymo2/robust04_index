			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Arts: Rudolf Nureyev - Obituary Few dancers have so held the attention of the public, or so imposed their image on the ballet of their time, as Rudolf Nureyev, who died yesterday. From the moment of his leap for freedom at Orly airport in 1961, when he fled his Soviet minders and made his sudden choice for the opportunities of the West, Nureyev was headline news. He remained so for the rest of his life. He performed more, and more adventurously, than any other dancer in this century. By force of will quite as much as by the magnetism of his stage presence, he created a vogue for male dancing that was unprecedented in its impact. His artistic shrewdness, blazing temperament, quick intelligence and extraordinary physical allure were fused in an irresistible combination which subjugated every audience. Above all else he was a star - with the merits that attend upon such an identity, as well as the inevitable faults. He was self-created, self-reliant. If the image was glamorous, the dedication to dancing was unyielding, serious. When ballet companies could not offer him the opportunities he sought, then he would generate work for himself. He initiated seasons and tours under the banner of 'Nureyev and Friends', in which a sequence of guest companies and dancers revolved round the immutable figure of Nureyev himself. He mounted the old classic ballets, in elaborate stagings, throughout the world; starred in them, and was filmed in them. He produced choreography - notably Romeo and Juliet; Manfred; Tancredi - in which he was usually the star and the justification. He danced with a multitude of ballet companies, and with modern dance troupes, unrelenting in his quest for new roles, new challenges, new audiences. He appeared in films - Valentino is the best known - and toured in a revival of The King and I. As his dancing days ended, he made himself an orchestral conductor. Born in a train in 1938 near Irkutsk, of Tartar parentage, Nureyev became obsessed with the idea of being a dancer while still a young boy. He contrived to get himself to Leningrad for training, and against all the odds of a late start as a student, he became a pupil of the great pedagogue Alexander Pushkin. Pushkin shaped his native genius, and the rare excitement that the young Nureyev generated on stage swiftly won him leading roles with the Kirov Ballet. His defection to the West in 1961 was symptomatic of Nureyev's vexed relationship with Soviet authority, and more especially of his life-long quest for artistic experience. He first appeared in London at a gala organised by Margot Fonteyn in November 1961; three months later he joined her in a performance of Giselle at Covent Garden. It launched a partnership that was to give new impetus to Fonteyn's career (she was 20 years older than Nureyev) and delight a world public for the next decade. The lasting memorial to their stage relationship was Ashton's Marguerite and Armand (1963), which captured that ardour and excitement which so thrilled audiences. No one company could satisfy Nureyev's eagerness for work. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s he danced with what must seem an insatiable appetite and indomitable physical stamina, performing despite injury, racing from one city to another to manifest himself before his worshippers. If his interpretations remained, in some cases, mere displays of Nureyev mannerism, his determination to honour classic dancing (he was an inspiring and searchingly observant coach for other dancers) was an abiding virtue. During the 1980s his obsessive performance schedule made it seem as if he were determined to outface his own legend, his earlier self, as he battled with roles for which he was no longer suited. His greatest achievement during these years was his direction of the ballet company at the Paris Opera - a notoriously intractable organisation - where his force of personality was more than a match for the intrigues and entrenched attitudes of the troupe. His programming was imaginative; his leadership gave new life and lustre to a company that had seemed sunk in arid traditionalism. In the five years between 1983 and 1988 Nureyev brought the Opera ballet to world acclaim. His own performances, though, became more laboured, and his final tours in 1990-91 suggested an artist unable to accept the depredations of the years, showing a fraught presence to a public which flocked to see what they believed was still Nureyev, but which was, more exactly, a shadow of the great star in an unworthy setting. Like Pavlova and Nijinsky, Nureyev captured the imagination of the world. Countless thousands, who might otherwise never have watched ballet, saw him dance, drawn by the magic of his name. His myth, and his manner, were irresistible to audiences. His willingness to work unceasingly at his art, to sacrifice everything for the rise of the curtain on a performance in which he starred, was obsessive. He was driven by this daemon, but he served ballet, and his vision of himself as a ballet dancer, with entire dedication. Ballet was much richer thereby. He was last seen in public in October, taking a curtain call after the first night of his staging of La Bayadere for the Paris Opera ballet. He was then clearly a very sick man but the enormous wave of admiration which came from the audience seemed to fire his temperament yet again, and our last view of him was of his saluting the public with a gesture of great gallantry.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rustenburg falls 65.5% on lower metals prices RUSTENBURG Platinum Holdings, the world's biggest platinum producer, yesterday reported half-year results well below analysts' expectations. Pre-tax profit fell by 65.5 per cent to R168.7m (Dollars 54.54m), earnings per share were down 49.8 per cent to 87.9 cents, and the dividend is to be cut by 28.5 per cent to 62.5 cents a share. Mr Barry Davison, managing director, said the second-half performance would depend on metals prices. Present prices for all the metals produced by Rustenburg, except palladium, were below those of the first half and could not be expected to rise until there was a substantial improvement in the world economy. Asked about the potential sale of 38.4 per cent of Johnson Matthey of the UK, the sole marketing organisation for precious metals produced by Rustenburg, by Charter Consolidated, the UK conglomerate, Mr Davison said his company had been in touch with both companies 'and we are happy with what is going on.' He said that neither Rustenburg nor any of the other platinum companies managed by Johannesburg Consolidated Investment were directly involved in the negotiations about the JM stake. Mr Davison noted that the half-year dividend would be covered 1.4 times by earnings, 'which is a lower cover than has formerly been the case at the interim stage.' But Rustenburg was not changing its dividend policy and it was unlikely that cover for the full-year would drop below 1.4 times. Gross sales for the six months to December 31 slipped by 5.8 per cent to R1.413bn, mainly because of a 34 per cent drop in the rhodium metal price, compared with the same period of 1991, and a 15 per cent fall in nickel prices. Capital expenditure for the period was R176.9m, down from R240m, and included R34.8m (R109.3m) for expansion projects.</p>

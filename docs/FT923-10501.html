			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Italian bourse legislation may need revision ITALY'S recently adopted stock exchange rules, might need revision, Mr Piero Barucci, the new treasury minister has suggested. The rules were brought into effect over the past 18 months to modernise equity trading. The bourse legislation - concentrated in last year's law creating the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim) as Italy's new form of broking and fund management hybrid - has been criticised domestically and by some of Italy's Community partners. The European Commission has been in contact with the Rome authorities following complaints from some member states that the Sims law, which obliges brokers trading certain types of securities to set up an office in Italy, conflicts with EC rules on free competition. Mr Barucci admitted it might be necessary to modify 'some points' of the legislation to bring it in line with EC practice or to change regulations in accordance with experience on the bourse since its introduction. In a message to parliament, he indicated his preference for a simplification of the supervisory and fiscal structure covering equity trading where these were deemed to be prejudicial to the growth of a lively equity market. Italy's stockbrokers are being squeezed by a drop in turnover and rising costs, and they have complained bitterly about aspects of the new legislation which they say have greatly increased the regulatory burden they have to meet. The new clearing and guarantee body for share trading on Italy's expanding screen-based dealing system should start operations by the middle of next month. The new organisation will act as a clearing house for the country's long-awaited government bond futures market.</p>

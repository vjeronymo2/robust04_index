			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Ratners It seems that the trading position at Ratners is not completely hopeless, and ordinary shareholders may keep going long enough to be heavily diluted by the banks and preference shareholders. Better control of costs and working capital is part of the answer, and one wonders how much better the group might have fared if it had acted earlier, rather than continuing with acquisitions as the recessionary storm gathered. Mr Gerald Ratner's salary, now modestly below Pounds 400,000, is defended on the grounds of his continuing contribution to the group. Shareholders may see matters differently.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Opec decision hits oils The decision by Opec to maintain its output quota until the end of the year saw analysts furiously reworking earnings estimates and leading oil stocks responding accordingly. Mr Keith Morris, oil analyst with Schroder Securities, said there would be short term weakness in the oil price but added: 'By the time we get to the third quarter, demand will rise as buyers start to stock up for the winter.' Pure exploration and production stocks, such as Enterprise Oil, which are most heavily exposed to a weak oil price, were seen as most at hazard. Hoare Govett has now factored in a Dollars 15 a barrel oil price, down from Dollars 17 before the Opec decision, and argues that Enterprise is on a net asset value of 250p a share. Enterprise shed 5 1/2 to 407p ex-dividend. Among the oil majors, BP is considered the most overvalued. Nomura, which has reduced its 1994 oil forecast by Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 14.50 a barrel, points out the recent strong outperformance in the stock and advises clients to sell. Hoare has cut its 1994 forecast of BP's profits by Pounds 200m to Pounds 1bn and said earnings recovery will be set back by two years. However, NatWest Securities still likes the stock. BP ticked back 7 to 366p. Shell Transport, down 13 per cent since November, firmed a penny to 657p. NatWest said Shell is starting to see the bottom of the cycle and 'moderated' its bearish stance on the stock.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing that the administrative changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping and reporting requirements for transformation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction be effective January 1, 1995. The changes are made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reduce redundancy and clarify the responsibilities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies that produce or import substances that are transformed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or destroyed, as well as the responsibilities of transformers or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyers controlled substances (see paragraph A.1. of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule). EPA is proposing changes to the recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reporting requirements for importers to address issues of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importation of used, recycled or reclaimed controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed recordkeeping and reporting requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers are described in greater detail in Section C.7.c.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recordkeeping and Reporting for Imports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements for producers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and importers of controlled substances that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced or imported explicitly for transformation or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction in the United States. Today's proposal does not change the recordkeeping and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements for persons who produce controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances that are explicitly for transformation or destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the United States. Although EPA is proposing changes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for importers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address issues of importation of used, recycled or reclaimed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances (described in greater detail in Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.7.c., Recordkeeping and Reporting for Imports), there are no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to the requirements for importing controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are explicitly for transformation or destruction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current regulation, companies that produce or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> import controlled substances explicitly for destruction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation in the United States are required to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records and to report to EPA quarterly. The producers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers must report quarterly the ``amount of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances sold or transferred during the quarter to a person for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in processes resulting in their transformation or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction,'' and submit the IRS transformation certification or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction verification. Producers and importers must also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report quarterly on the quantity that they themselves transform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or destroy in the quarter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements for producers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and importers of controlled substances that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced or imported for intended emissive uses but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequently transformed or destroyed. Today's proposal does not change these requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding controlled substances sold for intended emissive uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are subsequently transformed or destroyed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current regulation requires producers and importers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report on controlled substances sold for emissive uses. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current rule does not require producers or importers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain records or report to the Agency on the subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation or destruction of controlled substances initially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced for emissive uses. Once the controlled substance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sold for an emissive use the producer or importer is no longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for informing the Agency of its subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposition, whether it be for emissive use, for transformation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or, for destruction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformers and destroyers of controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that were produced or imported explicitly for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation or destruction. The Agency is not proposing changes to the recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reporting requirements for those persons who transform or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroy controlled substances that were produced or imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explicitly for transformation or destruction. The transformers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will continue to submit an IRS certification of intent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transform to the producer or importer and the destroyers will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to submit a destruction verification to the producer or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer. Those transformers and destroyers who submit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification or verification must continue to report annually to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA as in the current regulation under &sect;82.13(m). The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verifies the transformation or destruction of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances that were explicitly produced or imported for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation or destruction through this annual reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

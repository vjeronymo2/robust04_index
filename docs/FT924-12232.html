			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Letter: CNN business programme Sir, I would like to clarify Raymond Snoddy's piece referring to World Business Today, the daily business programme broadcast on CNN International (October 9). As the article states, at the end of this year, by mutual agreement, CNN Business News and Financial Times Television will no longer jointly produce World Business Today. However, the article does not make clear that CNN International will assume sole responsibility for the programme and it will continue to be aired. Piper Parry, vice-president corporate communications, International Turner Broadcasting, 19-22 Rathbone Place, London W1P 1DF</p>

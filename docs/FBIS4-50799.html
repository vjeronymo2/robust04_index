			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporters Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li </F> Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "Li Peng Issues Order Placing Whole  Nation on Alert"--first five paragraphs is CHENG MING  introduction]    [Text] Li Peng issued the following order in the name of  the premier of the State Council: Beginning 0000 on 18 April,  the standing committee members of the party committees of  various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities  throughout the whole country will work a 24-hour shift system to  take charge of security, public order, and sudden incidents  which occur in their localities. In addition, Li Peng ordered  the public security units and armed police units in the  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the  country to go on alert beginning 0000 on 18 April.    It was an unpleasant surprise: The whole country was on the  alert!    The Armed Police must be on the alert and party and  government units must also be on the alert.    The information circulated within a small circle in the  capital. Although it was a rumor some intellectuals believed it  to be true. Many people did not understand: It is still a long  period of time from now to "4 June." Why must they be on alert  ahead of time?    The information was as follows:  <H5>  Li Peng Issues Nationwide Alert Order </H5>   On 16 April, Li Peng issued an order in his name as premier  of the State Council: Beginning 0000 on 18 April, the standing  committee members of the party committees of various provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the whole  country work a 24-hour shift system to take charge of the  security, public order, and sudden incidents which occur in  their localities.    Li Peng also ordered the public security units and armed  police units in various provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities throughout the whole country to go on alert  starting 0000 on 18 April.    On 16 April, Qiao Shi issued an order in his name as  chairman  of the National People's Congress Standing Committee,  authorizing the standing committee members of the people's  congresses in various provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities throughout the whole country to make decisions  according to the conditions or sudden incidents occurring in  their localities and to issue orders to safeguard social order  and protect the normal work and daily lives of the people.    At 0900 on 16 April, the State Council approved and relayed  the order from the armed police and the Public Security  Ministry, that beginning 1800 on 17 April, the public security  units and armed police units in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang,  Chengdu, Chongqing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xian, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan,  Fuzhou, Urumqi, Nanjing, Jinan, and Haikou go on alert.    The order issued by Li Peng on 16 April was "urgent and top  secret."    When the State Council approved and relayed the order from  the Public Security Ministry and the armed police on 16 April,  it clearly pointed out that the alert period must last until an  appropriate time when it can be lifted or partially lifted.  <H5>  Possible "Sudden Incidents" Which Make the Alert Necessary </H5>   Some intellectuals are not very interested in whether the  rumor is true or false or else they believe it but do not take  it seriously. What they find interesting is: What are the  "sudden incidents" which make the alert necessary? The  following views have been expressed:    "Hu Yaobang died on 15 April 1989 and, thereafter, a great  political earthquake took place. Li Peng issued the alert order  on 16 April. Was he afraid of a recurrence of the historic  event?"    "Is this a coincidence... or the death of a certain person  will lead to a repercussions like those in 1989? Is it because  the senior level of the CPC is worried about Deng Xiaoping's  health problems?"    "Recently, the official rhetoric that 'Deng Xiaoping is in  good health' has repeatedly appeared in the official media. Is  it a sign of misfortune?"    "Perhaps the official rhetoric is not too strange but the  cadres and the masses are rather worried, for they are afraid  that the situation may become unstable or change tremendously."    "This mental condition has been reflected in the sensitive  monetary market--since late March, many people have rushed to  buy gold, bought U.S. currency notes on the black market, and  sold some shares. To conclude, the people's minds are neither  at ease nor stable."    "The current situation is different from that in April and  May 1989. However, inflation is very high and in the first  quarter of this year it reached 24 percent on average, whereas  in the municipalities, provinces, and autonomous regions such as  Beijing, Guangdong, Hubei, Liaoning, Sichuan, Shanxi, and  Xinjiang, it was between 28 and 40 percent. On 11 April, the  State Statistics Bureau revealed some data and figures for  internal use which showed that the State Council's promise to  keep inflation under 15 percent in the first quarter of this  year could not be realized. Under these circumstances, the  people have more complaints."    "The shadow of 1989 cannot be removed and can be vividly  portrayed, therefore..."    "The approach of several dates makes people like Li Peng  feel  uneasy even when eating and sleeping. These days, the 75th  anniversary of the "May 4th Movement," the "1989 pro-democracy  movement," and the fifth anniversary of the "4 June massacre"  are the things that they fear and so it is not strange to see Li  Peng hurriedly issuing the alert order in a panic.  <H5>  Jiang and Li Regime Feels Its Own Weakness </H5>   "The spearhead of the alert order is aimed at the healthy  forces within the party and, on the other hand, at the  pro-democracy forces in society. And Li Peng and his men had  the nerve to think of this!"    Regardless of whether or not "sudden incidents" do occur,  one  thing can be certain and that is: The current Jiang and Li  regime can feel its own weakness and it has lost confidence.  Therefore, even if nothing happens, their hearts will almost  jump out of their chests.</p>

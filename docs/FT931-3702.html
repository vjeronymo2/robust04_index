			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / International Company News: Italy's final step to private pension funds - The imminent move has already bolstered the stock market Almost 11 years ago, Mr Enzo Berlanda, then a senator in the Italian parliament and today chairman of Consob, the country's companies and stock exchange watchdog, first drafted legislation for the creation of private pension funds. This month, the government gave the funds the green light, putting another of the missing pieces of Italy's financial jigsaw into place and bringing the country closer in line with its big European neighbours. Although still to be debated in parliament, the government's decision to use a decree law, by-passing lengthy discussion, means official approval for pension funds could come as early as next month. That has already bolstered the stock market, where the prospect of a large injection of fresh institutional money has helped drive up prices. The inauguration of private pension funds could also help the government's ambitious privatisation programme. One of the main obstacles has been the relatively small size and limited liquidity of the Milan bourse; any increase in the amount of funds flowing into the market should smooth the way for flotations or capital increases by cash-hungry state-owned companies. The new law has boosted insurance stocks in particular. They are seen as the biggest potential beneficiaries from private pensions in view of their actuarial expertise and existing know-how in life insurance. Mr Angelo Marchio, managing director of RAS, is bullish about prospects. 'We're ready to go ahead as soon as the law is approved,' he says. RAS is already active in pension or pension-related activities, by running pension plans for some big private companies or through its own life insurance policies for the public. Like other insurers, Mr Marchio is keen for established insurance companies to play a central role in running the new private pensions. Although some details are still unclear, private pensions will be available in a variety of ways. Individuals will be able to take out their own schemes, while collective bodies, such as trade unions or professional associations, will also be able to offer private pensions to members, as will smaller companies which do not operate group pension schemes at present. The insurers see a role both as agents, collecting and administering premiums and pension payments on behalf of organisations running their own schemes, and as principals, offering private pension plans directly to the public. Mr Marchio also expects insurers to be active in managing funds. While some insurers might contract out administration to third parties, such as a bank or a Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare, Italy's new brand of securities house, others will manage the money internally. RAS is already one of Italy's biggest institutional investors, with about L7,000bn (Dollars 4bn) in the 13 investment funds it now administers. Some observers have predicted that the arrival of private pension funds could reshape Italian capitalism by creating a new source of long term risk finance for the stock market. The new, professionally-managed money could help to stabilise what is still a highly-speculative market and, some believe, persuade more of the country's privately-owned companies to go public. However, both Mr Marchio and Mr Gianmario Roveraro, managing director of Akros, a leading investment bank, are cautious as to whether pension funds on their own will do all that is expected. 'Our priority will be to pay pensions, so the risks of our investments will have to be examined very closely,' says Mr Marchio. 'If equities offer acceptable dividend yields and potential capital gains, they would be an obvious investment.' But he says pensions funds in particular, which need to consider payment obligations well into the future, tend to require carefully-balanced portfolios involving a wide variety of assets. 'First you have to ask how much new money might be available - one theory is around L5,000bn a year,' says Mr Roveraro. 'Then you need to think how much of that will go into shares rather than bonds. 'Even in countries, unlike Italy, where shares offer better yields than bonds, and where the legislation covering the mix of pension fund investments is relatively liberal, only a relatively limited proportion of funds find their way into equities,' he cautions. 'I don't think the effect on the bourse will be dramatic. I see pension funds as one of a variety of measures which will help to create a bigger and more liquid equity market.' Mr Roveraro thinks the biggest impact will be on the bond side, where the new institutional money may help to deepen Italy's capital market by creating a pool of cash for long-term corporate borrowing. At present, long-term domestic bonds are dominated by the government, which offers relatively high returns and tax incentives to entice private savings into funding the budget deficit. That has crowded out big corporate borrowers, which have been forced to use the Euromarkets, while smaller companies have fallen back on bank lending. The arrival of private pension funds, which are natural buyers of long-term fixed-income securities, could help create a new long-term credit market, thinks Mr Roveraro. Borrowers could either be companies, or one-off issuers linked to essential public-works projects, such as new bridges or motorways. 'Why not issue a 25-year, index-linked security to fund a new highway project, for which big insurance companies would be natural takers?' he asks. Provided the new securities were granted equal treatment with government bonds, the paper would be highly appealing to institutional investors looking for fixed, inflation-protected returns, while broadening Italy's capital markets as a whole.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Ali 'Ammar of the "Bloc for </F> Allegiance to the Resistance" in the Chamber of Deputies, by  Salim Badawi; place and date not given; from "The Event"  program--recorded]    [Text] ['Ammar] First, I would like to stress that the  recent Israeli aggression is not the first and will not be the  last. Since its establishment, Israel has been driven by a  spirit of aggression and tyranny. Therefore, we are not amazed  by any act produced by this deep-rooted Israeli aggressive  spirit. All that we want to affirm to the international,  regional, and local public opinion is that resistance in Lebanon  will remain. It will not be discouraged by those blows,  irrespective of how strong they are in terms of the disasters  and the pain that they leave.    This resistance is the product of a free national, popular  will representing all Lebanese and all the free people in the  world. In this regard, we would like to stress that the more  blows they deal to the Lebanese and the resistance, the stronger  and more determined this resistance becomes to continue its  jihad and its approach, in order to enable our individual and  land to attain freedom and independence, which are the token of  our existence, especially at this critical stage. However, in  view of this sick reality, the double standards of the U.S.  Administration, and of the West in general and their biased view  toward matters and issues that are related to peoples' freedom,  pain us and incline us to hold those administrations politically  and otherwise fully responsible for Israel's aggression. Israel  would not have dared to defy all international resolutions,  human rights, people's freedom, countries' sovereignty, and  peoples' independence had it not been this U.S.-Western cover  which provides it with all the elements of strength, in terms of  money, weapons, and policy as well.    As for our reaction, our natural reaction is continued  resistance until all the holy land and our individuals are  liberated from all the effects resulting from the marriage  between U.S.-Western and Israeli interests on the basis of the  spirit of colonialism and aggression.    [Badawi] Haj 'Ali 'Ammar, first there was the operation that  targeted and resulted in the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani. A  few later, attacks continued until they culminated in the  Israeli raid against one of your positions in the al-Biqa' area,  leaving dozens of victims. Do you not view these repeated  Israeli attacks as a preparation for a certain objective that  Israel has for some time been seeking to achieve, namely,  liquidating Lebanese resistance and putting pressure on the  Syrian-Lebanese negotiator by striking at Hizballah, Hizballah  leaders, and the resistance?    ['Ammar] Your question is politically multifaceted. I would  like to clearly and frankly answer all the points included in  your question. First, regarding the liquidation of the  resistance, I would like to stress a point which is known well  by Israel and the U.S. Administration: The resistance in  Lebanon is not an armed organization or a specific group of  Lebanese taking care of it.    Resistance in Lebanon has become part of every child, woman,  and old person. It has dug its roots deep into the Lebanese  people and the Lebanese territory, beginning with those in their  mothers' wombs, and ending with those elite struggling in a  world that has lost its freedom, after freedom has been denied  all factors of support and strength as a result of the arrogant  Western-Israeli plotting against the region. This resistance is  not easy to liquidate. This is despite the fact that we do not  deny that there is a disparity between the strength of the  resistance and that of the U.S. war machine that Israel is using  to kill our people, children, and women, and to dominate our  territory. However, the weapon of the resistance is in its  being in the heart of those broad masses who took to the streets  today to bury their martyrs and make their message quite clear.  The gathering has been a true referendum as to the extent of  support for the resistance.    ['Ammar] Concerning the liquidation of the resistance, as  we said the resistance is not an armed group with a limited base  to be liquidated in this way. The real liquidation of the  resistance can be effected by wiping out all levels of Lebanese  society and annihilating the revolutionary and the ideological  spirit which these people have been imbibing throughout history.    As for the issue of the negotiations, the second issue I  would like to talk about, you are aware that since the beginning  of the negotiating process, from Madrid until now, we have never  seen any benefit coming from these negotiations at all, because  we perfectly believe that in light of the colonialist U.S.  single-handed dealing with the region and in light of the  aggressive spirit represented by Israel, which flouts all  values, norms, and all the international, cultural, and  humanitarian conventions, it is impossible to sit with this  enemy at the negotiating table in any form whatsoever. If by  these strikes Israel wants to influence the Lebanese and Syrian  negotiators, and the Arab negotiators in general, we have said  from the beginning that we have nothing to do with these  negotiations and their results. I do not believe this situation  will end in capitulation to Israeli demands, whether on the  diplomatic level of negotiations or on the level of jihad, which  we believe in and which we insist on continuing until the  liberation of all the sacred soil.    Therefore, I would like to say--and let public opinion be  well aware of this--that the resistance is not a link in  political investment or blackmail, neither on the negotiating  table or away from it. This is because the resistance is the  choice of people who want to be free and independent.    [Badawi] On the practical side, within his warnings and  threats, Yitzhaq Rabin asked the United States to intercede with  Syria so Damascus would pressure you to stop your shelling of  northern Israel. How true is this information? Have you  received anything, any indications, any demands or requests from  the Lebanese or Syrian authorities to stop the resumption of  missile attacks on northern Israel?    ['Ammar] First of all, our relations with sisterly Syria are  strategic relations which cannot be affected by a casual event,  be it an Israeli attack or anything else. We are aware that  this recent spirit of aggression and the recent attacks were  aimed at confusing the internal situation in Lebanon and  disturbing the ties with fraternal Syria. We harbor  appreciation and respect for Syria and its leader al-Asad for  his sponsoring the resistance and for his defense of it and his  protection throughout the recent history we have passed through.  As for us being asked, we cannot allow anybody to demand  anything from us, especially if the demand is related to our  freedom, independence, self-respect, and our protection of our  sanctities. We and al-Asad's Syria are on the same frontline  against this Israeli aggression and domination and will not  allow the Israeli-U.S. terms to pass even by one iota at the  expense of our people.    [Badawi] Therefore, the confrontation is there, the Israeli  threats exists. Will you continue to shell the Israeli  territory in case the Israeli Army attacks continue? You are,  of course, aware that this will again lead to justifying an  Israeli invasion of Lebanese territory, as happened last year?    ['Ammar] Since the beginning of the resistance against the  unjust Israeli occupation, we have adopted a sacred slogan,  namely, kill us, because this will make our people more and more  aware. We as a people have had a spiritual upbringing that  rejects oppression, iniquity, occupation, and domination in any  form whatsoever. We are free to use all the means available to  us to defend our freedom, dignity, and independence. We will  not spare any method to hurt this enemy, give it pain, and expel  it form our land, and to remove all the effects of the  international and regional imbalance on the military, political,  and material levels. We do not care what the Israelis think.  Our main concern is to defend freedom with all means available  to us. Yes, the battle is open. Let them wipe us out if they  want. If we can wipe them out, we will not hesitate to do so.</p>

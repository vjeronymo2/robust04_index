			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: NFC NFC is trading on the kind of dizzy rating that leaves no margin for error. Yesterday's full year figures planted seeds of doubt about both quality of earnings and the solidity of the balance sheet. That was enough to send the shares 7 per cent lower. Even so, it is too early to call the turn. True, an unexpected Pounds 10.5m contribution from the pension fund flattered profits. But the contribution will be a recurring item, at least until the next revaluation of the pension fund in 1994. The sharp rise in gearing is more worrying. In other circumstances, NFC might be tempted to take advantage of its high rating to raise cheap equity. With almost half the shares in the hands of employees or pensioners, though, that is hardly a realistic option. If the shares continue to perform, the proceeds of last month's convertible bond issue will eventually be transformed into equity. But that cannot be taken for granted. NFC is confined to funding expansion out of cash flow and debt. Yesterday's figures confirm that cash flow alone is not enough. With its logistics business backed by long-term contracts, NFC might argue that debt funding is appropriate. The rise in gearing is partly the result of goodwill write-offs and interest cover remains strong. Judging by yesterday's fall in the shares, the market remembers the days of 200 per cent gearing in the mid-1980s. One can only trust the management is equally alive to the dangers.</p>

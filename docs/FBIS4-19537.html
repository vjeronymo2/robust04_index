			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Theo Waigel by Friedemann </F> Weckbach-Mara; place and date not given: "Waigel: Tax Reform  in Summer -- But Without Tax Raises"]    [Text] [Weckbach-Mara] There is an ongoing quarrel about  taxes in the coalition. Will the solidarity surcharge be  limited to three years after all, as has been suggested by the  Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]?    [Waigel] No. In the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], the  FDP, and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  unanimously adopted the solidarity surcharge without any  limitation. Revenues of about 30 billion German marks [DM] per  year are necessary for the foreseeable future because of the  burdens caused by the fund for repaying debts inherited from the  GDR. It would be unprincipled to say now that the solidarity  surcharge can be abolished by this or that date.    [Weckbach-Mara] The Federal Constitutional Court demands  that the government no longer tax the subsistence level. When  will you accordingly reduce taxes? And where is the money for  this measure to come from?    [Waigel] The current transition regulation has made the  subsistence level exempt from taxes until the end of 1995  anyway. For the final regulation, which the court demands as of  1996, I have established a committee to work out proposals.  Before the summer recess I will also present our tax policy  concept for the next four years. This includes, among other  things, improvements in the equalization of burdens for families  and the continuation of the corporate tax reform. All that must  be financed through savings and subsidies cutbacks. Neither tax  increases nor an increase in new debts must be used for this  purpose.    [Weckbach-Mara] Not an increase in the inheritance tax,  either?    [Waigel] Most definitely not. Inheritances will not be  further taxed by changing the bases for assessment. Even if the  Federal Constitutional Court were to force us to change the  basic values, I want to compensate that with tax-exempt amounts  or by reducing the tax rates. I do not want additional taxes  for the heirs. Otherwise, there would be considerable problems,  in particular in medium-sized businesses, not least of all in  agriculture and forestry.    [Weckbach-Mara] Transportation Minister Wissmann has  announced a "careful" increase in petroleum tax and is preparing  road use fees. Does he really need DM8 billion more as of 1996?    [Waigel] As of 1996 there is indeed a gap of DM8 billion in  financing railroad reform. I leave it, as agreed, to clever  traffic politicians to close this gap.    [Weckbach-Mara] The FDP has made its coalition statement in  favor of the CDU/CSU. Material demands are to follow. Will you  accept conditions for continuing the coalition?    [Waigel] The FDP can make demands as an independent party,  but so can we.    [Weckbach-Mara] So can we. [as published]    [Waigel] We demand a correction in legal and domestic policy  with the introduction of the great bugging campaign so that in  the future the police will be permitted to monitor discussions  of new serious crimes. We will insist on that. If the FDP is  smart, it will already decide to agree to the great bugging  campaign at its next party congress, in time before the  elections. I also expect the FDP to vote for our candidate  Roman Herzog by the third ballot of the elections for the German  president at the latest. This would be a very positive signal  for the coalition. In addition, the FDP would be well advised  if, next week, it were to withdraw its complaint in Karlsruhe  against Bundeswehr participation in NATO AWACS flights. Then the  foreign minister can finally openly advocate the policy he  really wants instead of continuing to sue his own government in  the highest German court.    [Weckbach-Mara] In your opinion, has the SPD's candidate for  the chancellor's office, Scharping, been able to improve his  prospects of being elected as a result of his trip to the United  States?    [Waigel] Certainly not, he just followed Helmut Kohl. But  at least now he knows how great Helmut Kohl's reputation is in  the world. On the other hand, Scharping was reproached by the  U.S. Treasury because of his unbidden comments on U.S. monetary  policy.    [Weckbach-Mara] The CSU is in a slump. Will Edmund Stoiber  remain Bavarian minister president?    [Waigel] Yes. Edmund Stoiber is and remains minister  president with my full support. One cannot blame the current  situation on him. He has acted correctly and he is doing very  well. I am sure that we will get out of the slump and return to  sober discussion of real problems.    [Weckbach-Mara] Will there not be a discussion about  personnel in the CSU even if your party gets bad results at the  European elections?    [Waigel] No, not even then.    [Weckbach-Mara] Do you agree to Bavaria's demand to cancel 3  October as a public holiday to finance nursing care insurance?    [Waigel] There are differing ideas on this matter. Everyone  knows that, for instance, the chancellor and the CDU are against  that. I do not see any prospects of success for this proposal.  It will not be possible to push through the cancellation of the  3 October holiday.</p>

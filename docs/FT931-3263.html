			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cala deeper in red but optimistic INCREASED LOSSES were incurred by Cala, the housebuilding and commercial property developer, for the half year to December 31. At the pre-tax level, the loss jumped from Pounds 1.57m to Pounds 2.85m on turnover Pounds 6.8m lower at Pounds 20.6m. However, Mr Geoff Ball, chairman, took an optimistic view of the remainder of the year. He said that following a buoyant start to the second half, the closing six months will produce near to 70 per cent of full year sales. Losses per share for the first six months amounted to 5.39p (2.98p). An interim dividend of 0.75p (1.15p) is declared but a maintained total of 2.3p is forecast.</p>

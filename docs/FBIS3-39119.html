In the discussion,  it was the majority's opinion that the present problems of the  German economy cannot be overcome by an economic recovery alone.  It is particularly important for him that it was no longer  discussed "whether" deregulation, privatization, and the opening  of the market are to be carried out "but how" this is to be  done, Rexrodt said.    In the opinion of Michael Glos, chairman of the Christian  Social Union [CSU] land group, the business location forum has  proven that Bonn's policy with its 30-point action program is  correct. It is now the turn of both sides of industry to  contribute their share to more flexibility and efficiency  regarding working hours and wage costs.    At the same time, the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] sharply criticized the Bonn coalition. SPD Deputy  Chairman Oskar Lafontaine reproached it for its "complete  failure" in economic and financial policies. A comprehensive  growth and employment concept has to be immediately developed.  In return, Friedrich Bohl (Christian Democratic Union),  minister in the Chancellor's Office, called on the Saarland  minister president "to put the economic policy of his land in  order first before he hands out advice to the government." Bohl  advocated the promotion of more part-time work. In the  Netherlands, 34 percent of all jobs are part time and in the  FRG, it is only 17 percent, he said.</p>

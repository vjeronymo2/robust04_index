			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The prospects for the Skopje issue [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] appear positive following  yesterday's meeting in Geneva between UN mediator Cyrus Vance  and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today described the  meeting as a sure success, stressed that Vance understands the  Greek positions, and announced that the talks between Papoulias  and Vance will resume. It is not ruled out that Vance's  associates will meet Greek Government officials.    The government spokesman also announced that a Skopjean  delegation has been called by the European Union [EU] Commission  and the European Parliament to participate in a pan-European  transport conference in Crete on 14-15 March organized by the EU  Commission and the European Parliament with the participation of  the responsible Greek ministers who also preside over the  respective EU councils. The Skopean delegation will be headed  by the Assembly President Stojan Andov. The government  spokesman noted that the Skopean delegation will participate in  the conference under the conditions that recall the practical  signs [of goodwill] that Greece demands from Skopje. Venizelos  clarified that the Skopjean delegation will come to Greece with  a visa on a plain piece of blank paper with no Star of Veryina  in sight and with the use of the term FYROM. Venizelos added  that no issue outside the conference framework will be raised  and said it would not be proper for Andov to hold a news  conference on Greek territory on issues concerning Greek-Skopje  relations.    Referring to yesterday's meeting in Geneva, the government  spokesman also said that Vance submitted ideas that Greece will  study and reply to with relevant comments within 15 days. Asked  if Vance's ideas include the proposal for the name, Venizelos  said these ideas refer to all the topics. He added that Greece  remains firm in its positions on the need to formulate the  preliminary conditions for resuming the dialogue.    Referring to the resolution adopted by the European  Parliament, Venizelos expressed the Greek Government's  satisfaction and noted that, given the climate at the European  Parliament, the resolution was the best possible. He also  stressed the contribution of PASOK's [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement] deputies who participate in the European Socialist  Party, the draft from which formed the basis for the resolution.</p>

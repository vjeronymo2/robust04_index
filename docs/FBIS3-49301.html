			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the coming visit of U.S.  President Bill Clinton to Prague, President of the Republic  Vaclav Havel granted an interview today to Czech Television:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified interviewer] What program  and  what aims will you have at these historical talks?    [Havel] The Czech Republic naturally has its views not only  on the "Partnership for Peace" plan, not only on the future of  the North Atlantic Alliance, its identity, its position, and its  meaning, but also on the overall security situation in Europe.  Naturally, we would like to convey this view to the U.S. side.  We would be glad if there were a dialogue; we should not just be  told things.    [Interviewer] No one in the West denies that NATO is going  through an identity crisis. How do you think NATO should solve  this crisis and, together with it, the question of security in  Europe?    [Havel] NATO has realized that, in the new situation of the  end of the Cold War, its doctrine, its meaning, its position,  and its role in Europe have to change, and it has been working  on it.    It may appear from our viewpoint that it has been working on  it far too slowly, that the situation would require greater  courage, greater magnanimity, a faster rate. But I think it  cannot be disputed that this alliance, as the strongest and the  only functioning one, should be a kind of a stabilizing core of  all European security. There are differences in the ideas as to  what technique to use, what speed and so on. [end recording]</p>

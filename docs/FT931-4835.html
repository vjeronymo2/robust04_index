			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sime Derby up 9.3% to MDollars 171m at half-way SIME Darby, the Malaysia-based conglomerate that has grown into one of the region's leading multinationals, posted a 9.3 per cent rise in net first-half profits to MDollars 170.9m (USDollars 65.25m) from MDollars 156.4m a year earlier, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. Earnings per share rose to 10.9 cents from 10.0 cents, and the interim dividend is being maintained at 3.5 cents a share. Pre-tax profits rose to MDollars 374.7m from MDollars 358.8m on turnover 6.8 per cent ahead at MDollars 3.32bn from MDollars 3.11m. However, the directors said the results for the second half were unlikely to show noticeable improvement as in previous years, and they expected profitability to be maintained at the same level as in the first six months. The Malaysia region was the top profit contributor, due to strong results from the oil and gas division.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sweet way to preserve food A TYPE of sugar, which has the uncanny ability to preserve meat and plants so that they can can be revived to their original state after being dried, has been approved by the UK's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for use in the food industry. Trehalose is a simple sugar, made up of two glucose molecules stuck together, and is found naturally in yeast. Food which has had trehalose added to it before drying, from fruit to meat, can remain on the shelf indefinitely. When re-hydrated the food resumes its colour, flavour and texture. Even vitamins, such a vitamin A, are retained during the dried phase. Trehalose has been patented in the UK, US and Europe by biotechnology company Quadrant Research, of Cambridge, which is licensing the use of its patents to large food manufacturers.

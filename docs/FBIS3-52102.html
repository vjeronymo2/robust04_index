Musa expressed the hope that an agreement will  eventually be reached.    Musa said his meeting this evening with Dr. Nabil Sha'th,  political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, was  part of the consultations that Egypt is holding.    Meanwhile, Dr. Nabil Sha'th said: We are working together to  solve the problems and overcome the obstacles preventing an  agreement so that we can return to the negotiating table in  Taba. He added: The Israelis have raised an uncalled for and  groundless furor about an agreement reached and on which the  Palestinians have backed down. He said: As a matter of fact,  no agreement had been reached. All that happened was that a  working paper had been written and submitted to President Yasir  'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin so that the  points of agreement and disagreement could be marked on this  paper to facilitate the work of the negotiators in Taba.    Sha'th stressed that the Palestinians are prepared to return  to the talks but the Israeli side is still resorting to an  escalation. Mr. 'Amr Musa and the Egyptian side are trying to  resolve this problem so that we can return to the negotiations  and accomplish what we have agreed to accomplish.    Asked whether the Palestinians have received a reply from  Israel, Sha'th said: We have received a lengthy reply  containing the Israeli stand vis-a-vis our stand. This is a  normal matter.</p>

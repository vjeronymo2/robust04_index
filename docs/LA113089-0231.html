			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BERNSTEIN TO PLAY BOTH SIDES OF WALL  </P> <P> Leonard Bernstein will conduct Christmas performances of Beethoven's Ninth  Symphony on both sides of the Berlin Wall in celebration of universal  brotherhood, it was announced today.  </P> <P> Margaret Carson, a spokesman for the conductor-composer, said the first concert  will be held at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a World War II ruin in West  Berlin, on Dec. 23 and the second will be held Christmas Day at the  Schauspielhaus theater in East Berlin. Both are near the Berlin Wall, which  until recently divided the city.  </P> <P> The idea for the concerts originated with Bernstein after the wall was opened  by East German authorities and East Germans streamed into West Berlin, Carson  said. Bernstein has conducted peace concerts in Hiroshima, Japan, Warsaw and  other cities in the past several years and has been active in efforts to end  world conflict.  </P> <P> He has organized a multinational orchestra and chorus to perform the Beethoven  work, which has a thrilling choral finale known as the "Ode to Joy." Although  most of the musicians will be from the Bavarian Radio Symphony, there will be  players from New York, London, Paris, Dresden and possibly Leningrad,  representing both West and East Germany and the four Allied powers that  occupied Berlin after World War II, Carson said.  </P> <P> Bernstein sent word from his home in Connecticut that the celebration was  inspired by "Schiller! Beethoven! Freude (joy)! Bruder (brother)! Freiheit  (freedom)!"  </P> <P> "It's all coming true! Hooray!" he said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 19 (AFP) -- Arab budgets, already hit  by low oil prices, are reeling under heavy defence spending at  the expense of development allocations, an official Arab report  said on Thursday [19 May].    In countries such as Syria and Yemen, defence and security  expenditure consumed nearly half the total government spending  while in the oil-rich Gulf states it far exceeded allocations  for public and social services, said the report by the Abu  Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund (AMF).    The report gave no new figures for Saudi Arabia, which has  sharply boosted defence spending since the Gulf war.    It also did not cover Iraq, believed to be the region's  biggest spender on defence as it had the strongest army in the  Arab world before being crushed by a U.S.-led coalition in the  Gulf war in early 1991 after it invaded Kuwait.    Most Arab states do not divulge figures on defence spending  but Gulf nations have made no secret of their intentions to  bolster their armies.    Military experts believe Saudi Arabia and its five partners  in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) may spend more than 50  billion dollars on arms by 2000.    "High defence spending is one of the reasons for the  economic  problems in the Arab world and persistent budget deficits in  wealthy Gulf states," said a Western diplomat in the region.    "Imagine what could have happened if half of the defence  allocations had been channeled into development."    The AMF said defence expenditure in the 22-member Arab  League  accounted for 28.07 percent of the total 1992 spending of 172  billion dollars. This compared with 34.78 percent of the 1991  spending of 180.16 billion dollars.    Syria, which is still technically at war with neighbouring  Israel, emerged as the top spender on defence and security in  the region, with allocations of 54.5 percent of the 1992 budget  of 3.12 billion dollars.    Yemen, now torn by civil strife, came second, with  allocations of 44.55 percent of the total 1992 spending of 4.83  billion dollars.    Defence spending stood at 43.75 percent in Oman, at 39  percent in Kuwait, 36 percent in Qatar, 35.89 percent in the  United Arab Emirates (UAE), 34.54 percent in Bahrain, 32.23  percent in Jordan and 27.8 percent in Libya.    In Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia and Mauritania, it ranged  between 14 and 26 percent while there were no figures for  Lebanon, Djibouti and Somalia. Defence spending in Algeria was  the lowest, standing at 8.23 percent.    The report gave figures for Saudi Arabia in 1989, when the  defence budget accounted for 25 percent of the total expenditure  of 40 billion dollars. But experts believe the level could have  risen as the world's top oil producer and exporter has pressed  ahead with massive armament plans.    Except for Jordan, Arab states suffered from budget deficits  in 1992 while foreign debt, excluding that owed by Iraq, Libya  and GCC nations, exceeded 150 billion dollars.    A trade and balance of payments deficit also persisted in  Arab states, except in major oil producers.    In Kuwait, the budget deficit soared as high as 84 percent  of  the Gross Domestic Product while it reached 10.3 percent in  Sudan, 10 percent in Yemen, 8.71 percent in Saudi Arabia and  7.28 percent in Jordan.    The AMF report showed Arab spending on public services  accounted for 18.67 percent in 1992 while allocations for social  services stood at 26.43 percent and for economic development at  12.78 percent.    "High defence allocations underscore the importance of peace  in the Middle East," a Gulf-based diplomat said. "It will pay  off not only in political and military terms, but in economic  terms.</p>

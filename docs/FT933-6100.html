			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Focusing on UK ethnic communities - In A Nutshell The bulk of small business research work in the UK has been focused on Asians and West Indians. However, besides Bangladeshis and Afro-Caribbeans, a new study on ethnic enterprise and the high street bank includes interviews with Greek-Cypriots. The authors of the report* - James Curran and Robert Blackburn of Kingston University - point out that Greek-Cypriots are the longest established of the UK minorities and have the most diverse pattern of ownership. Their businesses are the largest, and the most likely to have broken out of the ethnic market. The report is generally sceptical about the importance of ethnic communities as alternative sources of finance. It says that the Greek-Cypriots are the most frequent users of bank advice, have expanded their businesses more than the other two minorities, and are likely to perform similarly to white-owned firms. *Available from Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University, Kingston Hill, Surrey, KT2 7LB.

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Selling coffee to the Brazilians - The world's largest coffee producer is fighting to maintain its home market From plush government ministries in Brasilia to humble wattle and daub homes in the poverty-stricken north-east it is impossible to go anywhere in Brazil without being offered a cafezinho, a small cup of strong black coffee so full of sugar that a spoon stands up in it. It is such a national symbol that last year, when the presidency wanted to convey to the people the full gravity of the country's economic crisis, it stopped serving cafezinhos in its offices. Surely the world's largest coffee-producing country does not need to advertise the stuff to its own people. Yet Brazil is currently in the throes of an advertising blitz on television and in magazines to promote the world's favourite pick-me-up. Supermarkets are handing out leaflets and recipe cards and taste stands have become a common sight at conferences and seminars in the latest stage of the Brazilian coffee industry's first-ever promotion campaign. For while Brazil remains the world's second largest consumer, per capita consumption has plummeted by almost 50 per cent in the last 10 years. The worried coffee industry started to respond in 1989 - initially through targeting retailers and trying to encourage the public to differentiate between blends and become more discriminating. Latterly, the generic campaign - which has cost more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) and is the first of its kind by any sector of the Brazilian food and drink trade - has been aimed more directly at consumers. Nowhere is more associated with coffee than Brazil. It has been grown there since 1727, after a goatherd in Ethiopia discovered his charges became more frisky whenever they ate coffee beans. Brazil is now responsible for 25 per cent of world production though coffee is no longer the basis of its economy. Always focused on exports, the Brazilian coffee industry until recently paid little attention to the home consumer. As a result the local population thought it was being fobbed off with inferior products and began turning to other beverages such as tea or juice. In 1988 a study commissioned by the Brazilian Coffee Roasters and Grinders Association found that 67 per cent of Brazilians thought that 'all good and pure coffee was exported and that sold in Brazil was impure and of low quality'. This was partly true. Years of government price controls meant that the local industry had no incentive to produce better coffee for the domestic market. However, since 1989 a world glut and falling international prices has intensified the need to build up the home market. America Sato, president of Abic, explains: 'It has become essential for our survival to recapture Brazilian consumer confidence in the quality of our coffee.' In its study Abic found that Brazilian per capita consumption had dropped from 4.6kg per annum to 2.8kg since the 1970s and was falling off rapidly. 'We were ceding space to other drinks and there is a big potential for increase,' Sato says. As a first step the industry created a 'self-monitoring and purity control programme', establishing the Abic seal of quality and contracting consultants Peat Marwick and Ernst &amp; Young to oversee a constant evaluation. The seal is now on 80 per cent of coffee for domestic consumption. The 600 members of Abic united to invest Dollars 2m a year in marketing. 'If we were to reconquer the consumer it had to be through an institutional campaign rather than just separate companies advertising their own products,' says Sato. Abic contracted the Sao Paulo-based Rino advertising agency with the aim of increasing total consumption by 20 per cent in the next two years to 11m bags (each 60kg). Rino Ferrari, who heads the campaign, says: 'It is a major challenge. Coffee has a serious problem in Brazil. It's not just a matter of saying coffee tastes good, but of totally changing the image of coffee.' The liberation of prices in 1991 meant that the industry could concentrate on quality for the home market and the latest stage of the campaign focuses on quality and diversification. Sato explains: 'In the past all coffee in Brazil was seen to be equal and of a lower standard. Now we're saying 'coffee is different and each consumer has his or her own palate so buy accordingly'.' The television ads currently showing during prime time show a group of different people, all wearing the same mask, under the slogan: 'Purity you must demand. Quality you should choose.' The aim is to make consumers aware that coffee comes in different flavours and aroma resulting from different types of beans and degrees of roasting. Rino is also distributing free recipe cards and running adverts in women's magazines to show the different potential uses of coffee - in cakes, ice cream and Irish coffee, for example. Ferrari says: 'We're aiming at everyone over 25 from all social classes but the real ambition is to get the habitual consumer to drink more, be more selective in the purchase and more adventurous in the use.' To encourage publicity an annual prize has been set up for reporting on coffee and Abic has started its own newspaper. An accord has been signed with Campinas University to monitor consumer reaction. The next step is a Dollars 2m promotion of coffee as a stimulant, aimed at young people whom Abic has found begin drinking coffee only after starting work. 'Coffee is seen as Brazil's national drink throughout the world,' says Ferrari. 'We have to make sure Brazilians keep drinking it.'</p>

In statements to MENA, he said that all the Jordanian  Government did was request that the number of Iranian diplomats  in Amman be close to the number of Jordanian diplomats in Tehran.    He added that the Iranian Government did not object, and  understood the motives of the Jordanian request, which was made  according to diplomatic norms. He affirmed that the request had  nothing to do with any incident before or after it was made.    He noted that current Jordanian-Iranian relations are  normal,  that both countries have embassies in each other's capitals,  that there is normal trade exchange between them, and that  Jordan always seeks friendly relations with Arab and Islamic  countries.    The Jordanian Government had requested the departure of 21  out of the 26 diplomats at the Iranian Embassy by the end of  February. In its request, the Jordanian Government explained  that the move was aimed at achieving a balance in the diplomatic  representation between the two countries because only three  diplomats are working at the Jordanian Embassy in Tehran.    While Iran announced its acceptance of Jordan's request,  Arab  diplomatic sources in Cairo said that relations between Jordan  and Iran are somewhat clouded after Iran recently submitted to  the Jordanian Government a number of proposals for relations  between the two countries to be enhanced through popular, not  official, political channels, over which Amman expressed  reservations.    The diplomatic sources interpreted this as fear of  infiltration by pro-Iranian forces into Jordanian political life  as was the case with Hizballah in Lebanon, especially at a time  when the Jordanian Government is strenuously trying to contain  the Islamic extremist trend that overshadows the country's  political life.    These developments come at a time when the Jordanian  Government has expressed displeasure at the recent burglary  attack on the home of Jordanian Ambassador in Tehran Yasin  Istanbuli. The Jordanian Government believes that the Iranian  authorities did not deal with the incident properly. These  developments also coincide with the assassination of the  Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut by people  believed to be extremists and with explosions at two movie  theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa' last week.    The Jordanian Foreign Ministry has announced that it  arrested  a group of Afghan Arab returnees who received military training  during the Afghan war against the former Soviet occupation.    The Jordanian Interior Ministry said that these Afghans were  responsible for the explosions at the two movie theaters.    The Jordanian-Iranian relations improved after the end of  the  Gulf crisis. Diplomatic relations between Amman and Tehran were  resumed in 1991 after a 10-year hiatus because of Jordan's  support for Iraq in its war against Iran.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> The issue is not pro-life or pro-choice; abortion is as old as the species and  will continue until its extinction, regardless of the current sound and fury.  The issue is whether or not all women who are faced with this dilemma will have  access to a safe, inexpensive procedure in the most therapeutic of medical and  social conditions.  </P> <P> The actions and words of those who would deny them this clearly demonstrate  that they have no interest in the fetus, the woman, or society. Their purpose  is to impose their beliefs on the rest of us. That cannot be allowed to happen.  </P> <P> LYLE N. WHITED  </P> <P> Lomita  </P></p>

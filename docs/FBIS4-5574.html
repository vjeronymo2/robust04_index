			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the Advisory Committee of the ROK Foreign  Ministry have urged the government to fully review its nuclear  policy indicating that the third round of U.S.-North Korean  high-level talks can be held only if the exchange of special  envoys between the North and South is held. The government has  so far made efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.    Members of the "Unification Subcommittee" under the Foreign  Ministry Policy Advisory Committee -- which includes scholars,  journalists, and former Foreign Ministry authorities -- held a  behind-closed-doors meeting at the Foreign Ministry on 11 April  with the presence of high-level Foreign Ministry officials,  including Pak Su-kil, chairman of the Institute of Foreign  Affairs and National Security. They agreed that it is desirable  not to link the exchange of special envoys with the third round  of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks.    Participants in that meeting said: "The UN Security Council  president's statement has called upon North Korea to accept  additional nuclear inspections by early May, at the latest.  Therefore, the government should not link the exchange of  special envoys with the nuclear inspections in order to make  North Korea accept the additional nuclear inspections by then.    Such recommendation by the Advisory Committee members has  been made at a time when the ROK, the United States, and the  International Atomic Energy Agency have made efforts to seek the  multilateral plans to resolve the North Korean nuclear issues.  Thus, it attracts the people's attention.    They said that "either U.S. Secretary of Defense William  Perry or U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had stated  that diplomatic efforts to get North Korea to allow  international inspections of its nuclear facilities will last  another six months," and that "there are some signs of change in  the U.S. position toward North Korea."    They have pointed out that there are differences in opinions  between the ROK and U.S. Governments regarding the North Korean  nuclear issue. They also stressed that the government should  comprehensively review its nuclear policy toward North Korea and  formulate concrete plans to resolve the North Korean nuclear  issue.    Furthermore, some participants said that the government  should not be restricted by time during nuclear negotiations  with North Korea, and that it should be patient in resolving the  North Korean nuclear issue, while properly using both a hardline  and moderate policy.</p>

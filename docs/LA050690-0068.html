			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIGMENT ENVY  </P> <P> Dr. Frances L. Cress Welsing's theory about the origins of racism will no doubt  trigger a deluge of mail from whites who feel their pants have been pulled down  ("Public Enemy and a Psychiatrist's Theory of Race," Pop Eye, April 29). I  don't see how her pigment envy theory is any more ridiculous than Freud's idea  that women have "penis envy."  </P> <P> I am a white male who has lived in and loved black communities in Detroit, New  York and Los Angeles. Whites who have been victims of racism by blacks ought to  consider their own inner feelings. White communities are rife with idiots who  make racist remarks unchallenged.  </P> <P> I live in Hollywood because while there is still racism here, it is less severe  than most parts of this country. Ironically, that is probably the result of the  liberalism of the same Jews that Professor Griff of the Public Enemy rap group  feels are responsible for "the majority of wickedness."  </P> <P> FREDERICK CLEVELAND  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Digital losses fail to deter as income and costs improve DIGITAL Equipment reported larger than expected losses for its third fiscal quarter, but revenues increased and costs fell, suggesting that the second largest US computer company is on the way to recovery. Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 30.1m (Pounds 19.9m), or 23 cents per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 311.3m, or Dollars 2.50 per share, in the same quarter last year. Revenues rose 6 per cent to Dollars 3.5bn from Dollars 3.3bn, boosted by favourable foreign exchange trends. Wall Street had been expecting losses of around 16 cents per share, but reacted favourably to Digital's financial report. Digital's stock gained Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 41 3/4 yesterday. 'We are meeting the goals we have set for ourselves in returning Digital to profitability and growth,' said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive. 'For the first time in six quarters, we generated positive cashflow from operations and investments, even with restructuring activities and the loss.' Mr William Steul, chief financial officer said: 'Our personal computer business doubled year over year, and service revenues grew 12 per cent.' He noted however, that without the favourable impact of foreign exchange rates, revenue would have been flat in the third quarter. Digital said it shed 4,000 jobs during the quarter, bringing total job losses to almost 16,000 since the beginning of the fiscal year. For the nine-month period, revenues were Dollars 10.5bn, up 4 per cent. Net loss for the nine months was Dollars 364.5m (Dollars 940.4m).</p>

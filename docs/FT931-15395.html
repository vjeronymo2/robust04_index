			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / US warning as Iraq taunts allies: Missile alert and third incursion into Kuwait prompt threats from west THE US delivered a strong warning to Iraq yesterday over its tactic of 'going to the brink' as President Saddam Hussein continued to taunt the United Nations and western allies. The threat to Baghdad was echoed last night by the president of the UN Security Council, Mr Yoshio Hatano of Japan, who said after a meeting with Iraq's ambassador to the UN that he was losing his patience. The Iraqi ambassador, Mr Nizar Hamdoon, said after handing over a letter to Mr Hatano that Baghdad wanted to defuse the crisis by discussing a range of issues with the Security Council. However, Baghdad had no specific proposals and Mr Hatano said there had been no mention at the meeting of an intention to open a dialogue. Earlier yesterday, Mr Saddam changed the status of surface-to-air missiles to operational in the northern air exclusion zone and, for the third consecutive day, sent men across the border into Kuwait. General John Shalikashvili, US supreme allied commander of Nato forces in Europe, described Iraq's behaviour over the past few days as brinkmanship. He warned that Baghdad could provoke a 'dangerous accident' by changing the status of SA-2 and SA-3 missiles north of the 36th parallel where only non-operational missiles are allowed. Mr Robert Gates, the CIA director, said on Monday that Iraq had resumed moving missiles in and out of the southern no-fly zone. Mr Hamdoon said he was worried about a US attack but saw no way to prevent such action. Iraqi had also ignored the Security Council's condemnation on Monday of incursions across the newly demarcated border into Kuwait. Mr Hatano said he had told Mr Hamdoon that, in view of this condemnation, the council took 'very seriously' the continued removal yesterday by about 150 Iraqis of warehouses and equipment near the port of Umm Qasr. The UN has demanded the return of missiles and other military equipment removed by 500 Iraqis from four weapons bunkers on Sunday. In Britain, Downing Street said its impatience with Iraq was growing and that further defiance of UN resolutions would be met by 'whatever action is deemed necessary - and that includes military action'. Officials recognise that Iraq is testing the UK, US and other allies with small-scale incursions into Kuwait. But Downing Street signalled that any reaction need not be proportionate to individual violations and could reflect the cumulative impact of a succession of 'flea-bites'. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, repeated that the Iraqis would get no further warnings. 'They cannot continue to violate UN resolutions and there is a clear pattern to the violation, whether it is missiles or these raids into warehouses, or other actions they have taken. It remains to be seen what may come of that but, as we said, there will be no warnings.' Mr Bob Hall, a Pentagon spokesman, said the US had the ability to take action, if called upon to do so. Newspapers in Baghdad said that western military forces would not deter Iraq from challenging the restrictions imposed by the allies. The two no-fly zones were created by the allies in the aftermath of the Gulf war. The zone north of the 36th parallel was set up in 1991 to protect the Kurdish population. This was followed last August by one south of the 32nd parallel designed to give the Shia population some relief against attacks by Baghdad forces seeking to quell the remnants of the 1991 rebellion.</p>

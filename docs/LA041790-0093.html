			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOG FIGHT;  </P> <P> GROOMERS PROTEST STATE CURBS ON DENTAL CLEANING  </P> <P> As a remarkably well-behaved group of dogs looked on, groomers and their  supporters gathered on the Capitol steps Monday to protest new state  regulations that would allow only professional veterinarians or their  technicians to clean animals' teeth.  </P> <P> The new regulations, promulgated by the Board of Examiners in Veterinary  Medicine, will take effect in three weeks and will allow non-veterinarians to  use only such devices as "doggy tooth brushes," while the use of metal scrapers  would be limited to vets and their assistants. The groomers say this would take  them out of the tooth-cleaning business.  </P> <P> A dozen or so canines, ranging in size from Yorkshire terriers to golden  retrievers, listened quietly as Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno) denounced  the proposed rules as "nothing more than a special-interest grab at a monopoly  in a particular market that should not be tolerated."  </P> <P> Bronzan has introduced legislation that would undo the veterinary board's  rules.  </P> <P> This is the latest skirmish in a bureaucratic struggle that has continued for  more than two years, involving several state agencies, a Superior Court judge,  various lawyers and lobbyists and even the governor's office.  </P> <P> The Board of Examiners in Veterinary Medicine contends that only veterinarians  are able to clean animal teeth properly (though the work is usually done by a  technician working under a vet's supervision).  </P> <P> Vets usually anesthetize the animal to work below the gum line, and charge $60  to $100 for a service that includes cleaning, polishing and an oral  examination.  </P> <P> Dog groomers claim that they can do just as good a cleaning job, without  anesthetic, charging $20 to $40. "Dozens and dozens of animals have died as a  result of anesthesia" for tooth cleaning, said Cindy Collins, a Costa Mesa  groomer.  </P> <P> But Gary Hill, executive officer for the Board of Examiners in Veterinary  Medicine, said in an interview, "Deaths of animals caused by anesthesia are  much less than those caused by peridontal disease."  </P> <P> A year ago, the veterinary board approved similar rules but they were vetoed by  Michael A. Kelley, director of the state Department of Consumer Affairs, who  said they would "preclude the public from being able to obtain a legitimate  service at an affordable cost."  </P> <P> This year, after meeting with Gov. George Deukmejian and members of the  veterinary board, Kelley withdrew his opposition. "I decided to defer to the  professional opinion of the five veterinarians on the board," Kelley said  Monday.  </P></p>

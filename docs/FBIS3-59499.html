			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Hartmut Weule, Daimler-Benz managing </F> director for R&amp;D; place and date not given: "`Under  Pressure'";  Subheadline: "Daimler-Benz Managing Director for R&amp;D on  Cultural  Revolution Needed at Germany's Economic Core"]    [Text]    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Mr. Weule, it is rumored that the latest  small car introduced by Mercedes-Benz was developed unbeknownst  to upper management.    [WEULE] That is incorrect.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] But the rumor is still not off the mark.  Small cars were taboo at Mercedes Benz previously.    [WEULE] Still, it is not possible to slip the development of  a complete automobile past upper management. But there have  already been similar instances in the history of our firm. For  example, the designers once created a second design paralleling  their official job and they caught upper management by surprise  with it. But today that is no longer necessary. Since then we  have gotten a management culture that is receptive enough to  innovation. If the employees are innovative, they are  encouraged. Back to the small car. Our research has been  constantly at work on small cars over the past 15 years.  Basically, it is not a novel subject for us.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Not infrequently, companies stifle  creativity forcing employees to cobble together innovations  clandestinely. What is going wrong at the core of German  innovation?    [WEULE] We are not starving. Essentially, we have an  excellent basis with well-educated personnel. Few industrial  countries in the world enjoy this to the same extent. Even  compared with the Americans and the Japanese we need not worry  that we do not have enough clever, knowledgeable, and capable  individuals.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] But innovative products bring others on  the market.    [WEULE] There is a general problem underlying that. Not only  researchers, but we Germans have grown lethargic about our  successes. Developments take too long. They are too expensive  and often they are not market-oriented. We lack the unqualified  resolve and readiness to take on the risk to very rapidly  transform our know-how into products that offer an opportunity  to succeed. We also lack the will for both internal and all  encompassing dialog to manage the transformation as efficiently  as possible.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So, as you see it, the Germany economy's  waning innovativeness is not a matter of resources but primarily  a mental and cultural problem?    [WEULE] Exactly. Here is just one example. In the Daimler  company, the difficulty confronting us is that the researchers  of the individual corporate sectors have developed their own  world. The result was a not-invented-here syndrome. No one felt  duly responsible. In order to do away with that, we have come up  with something we call integrated R&amp;D management. If our  researchers and developers are pondering a new car, they  straightaway call in marketing personnel and product experts. In  this way, the researcher becomes acquainted with market  requirements and stumbling-blocks to production. After the  get-together they return to their divisions with definite  objectives and work together through goal-oriented networking.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Has there not been any resistance to this  cultural revolution?    [WEULE] Sure. In fact, we had to exert pressure with  definite  formulations and a new form of budgeting. But now, those  directly impacted are enthusiastic. Only middle management still  has problems with it off and on. But bottom-up and top-down  pressure will also solve this problem.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] You are pretty much out on a limb with  this integrated approach. According to a current poll, only four  percent of German companies make use of simultaneous management  tools.    [WEULE] Then that study is portraying yesterday's world of  industrial research. I know very many colleagues in research and  they are all in the same processes as ourselves.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So then, it is not all that bad.    [WEULE] Wrong. Nothing is accomplished with a new  orientation  just in industry. We have to accomplish the same in the large  government sectors.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So the government again gets the blame?    [WEULE] In our country, the problem is that we lean back  greatly relieved and always with very smug looks on our faces  when we attend to the ratio of R&amp;D spending to gross social  product that is approximately 2.7 percent. My quarrel then is  continuously with economists and politicians. Of the total DM80  billion going to the R&amp;D sector, only a small portion is  actual  research. The lion's share goes for development, that is,  towards safeguarding markets, now and in the immediate future.  We do not give much thought to the larger future.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] How much do you estimate that share to  be?    [WEULE] No one knows for sure. I estimate that altogether in  industry fewer than DM5 billion go for actual research. This is  where we fundamentally diverge from the Japanese and the  Americans who give considerably more attention to this sector.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So then, the problem is of a pecuniary  nature. Industry and government allocate too little money for  research.    [WEULE] Not really too little, but frequently misdirected.  There are outstanding scientists occupying positions in the  Max-Planck or Fraunhofer Societies and in large research  facilities. The government invests exorbitantly large amounts in  them, about DM26 billion each year. It is my opinion that the  resources that federal and state governments allocate to them  have to be focused more intensively on the interests of  industry. I dare question whether, absent a clear commitment  with industry, for example at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research  Center, DM40 million should be allocated for a hard x-ray source.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There is no one at all in Karlsruhe who  questions it.    [WEULE] See, the cultural dilemma of faulty communication  reveals itself again in this case. Everyone in our country  should be expected to wonder who your customer is, why you are  doing that. In industry we work hard at such customer  orientation and I expect the same of a researcher of the  Max-Planck Society or of a large research facility.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] As the saying goes: who really is  interested in the work I do?    [WEULE] More so: who profits from it? If the researcher sees  that he is working in a void, I would expect him to reorient  himself. I am quite willing to admit that industry also has to  open up to this more earnestly. This is a source of reproach for  it. In the past, there was a great temptation to misuse  government funding in many different way. For instance, for  political influence peddling, for satisfying regional interests,  for nurturing personal research hobbies. We can no longer afford  any such use of funding.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Would central coordination modeled on  Japan's MITI help?    [WEULE] I doubt it. It does not square with our way of  thinking. We need three things in this situation: first, a  consensus on the common goals of research; second, operational  networks in which such goals can be tackled; and, third, quality  assurance for research.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Is not that a bit much all at once?    [WEULE] Actually, radical change is already under way. For  example, in Germany, in the production engineering sector, we  occupy a prominent position. To safeguard this position, we have  encouraged Daimler-Benz to get specialists across all  disciplines thinking about the shape of the future in this field  so as to bring relevant research to bear on it. In the spring we  held an initial workshop on this at the federal research  ministry. This was the first time such deliberations are being  conducted not in isolation but in coordination wit the Federal  Ministry for Research and Technology [BMFT] and academia. It is  a process with a well-defined timetable and precise milestones.  The industry group will meet in early November for a concluding  vote. In the spring, at the research minister's, there will then  be a national workshop on production engineering, at which a  common guideline for national research is supposed to be  hammered out and given concrete expression. The crucial question  then will be: will government, academia and industry keep to it?  Will selfish interests prevail or will the guideline assume a  binding character? The next two years will tell the tale.</p>

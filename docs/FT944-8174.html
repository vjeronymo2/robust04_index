			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (20): A bitter legacy of Communism - Who owns the land / Judy Dempsey recounts the battle of the title deeds 'The restructuring of land in eastern Germany has proved to be one of the most difficult processes the Treuhand privatisation agency has had to face,' said Mr Otto Bammell. As a senior official at the agriculture ministry, Mr Bammell has seen how property has pitted east German against west German, revived old family feuds, and has convinced many experts that the German government's decision to allow restitution before compensation in 1990 may now have been a mistake. 'We have the law. We have to make the most of it,' said Mr Bammell. Under the terms of the unification treaty, former Nazi victims and those whose land was confiscated by the Nazis have full right to restitution and compensation. This right also applies to people whose land was confiscated by the communists between 1949 and 1990. When, in late 1990, the Treuhand started applying the law to agriculture in a bid to privatise 1.2m hectares of east German land, it soon ran into difficulties. At that time, the agency had two aims. It wanted to restructure the region's agriculture, which meant breaking up the Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaften, or LPGS, the large cooperatives, and the Volkseigene Guter, or VEGs, the state farms; and then it wanted to sell the property. This entailed the loss of thousands of jobs in the agricultural sector. Indeed, the unemployment rate in the countryside is in some cases as high as 70 per cent. Soon after German unification, the agency began selling agricultural land. But many of the buyers were coming from west Germany. 'The east Germans felt aggrieved. They felt there were being colonised,' explained Mr Bammell. 'They had little chance to buy land because they had no capital. There was terrible tension in the countryside. We decided we had to give the easterners a chance. So we introduced a new system. We would lease land to the easterners at preferential prices,' he added. The leases were based on short-term three-year contracts, or long-term 12-year ones. But no sooner had the Treuhand embarked on this plan than its officials discovered that many questions concerning property rights stipulated in the unification treaty would have to be tackled. For instance, the Treuhand soon realised that when it wanted to lease land to east (or west) Germans, it had to make sure that there were no outstanding claims on the property. 'In some cases, the east Germans complained that they received only short-term contracts of about three years, compared with some west Germans who managed to obtain 12-year contracts,' said Mr Bammell. 'The problem facing the agency was that it was afraid to extend long contracts in case former property owners had already put in a claim. What could the Treuhand do with an east German long-term leaseholder if a former owner wanted to come back?' The Treuhand was faced with another problem. It was often difficult to ascertain who originally owned the land. The example of the LPGs explains why. These state farms were created from land expropriated by the former Soviet Union which had ruled eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949, and from small landholders who in 1952 were forced to place their plots in the LPG. In many cases, the original land register was closed and a new one was created which stipulated that the owner of the LPG was the east German state. However, the Treuhand is now finding that former owners have been able to trace the original land registers. As a result, they are now claiming their land back. 'This has inevitably slowed down the whole process of leasing land,' said Mr Bammell. 'If land has been leased, even for a short time, and if the former owner can prove legal title to it, then the Treuhand can allow the lease to run its full term. But once the lease has expired, the Treuhand must pass on to the original owner the rent from the leaseholder'. This sense of uncertainty about who owns land in eastern Germany has been compounded by another factor: former land owners, usually belonging to the Prussian aristocracy, whose land was expropriated by the Soviet administration. These owners have no right to restitution but have a right to buy back their land, rent it, or, following a law passed last September, to limited compensation. 'After unification, these former large landowners hesitated to buy back their property. They were waiting to see what kind of compensation law would be agreed,' said Mr Bammell. But in the process, the privatisation - and investment in east German agriculture - was delayed. As a means of speeding up the privatisation of land, the German government gave investors priority over restitution claims. This law allows individuals wishing to buy land in eastern Germany to circumvent outstanding property rights claims if they can prove to the Treuhand that they will invest and create jobs. In some cases, this has meant that a former landowner can only get the land back if he or she can match that investment plan. 'The east Germans simply do not have the money to compete with the west Germans,' said Mr Werner Loranz, an east German who, along with 14 other colleagues, farms 1,300 hectares in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Despite the scale of these problems, the Treuhand has drawn up 9,000 contracts which involves leasing 90,000 hectares based on short-term contracts, and a further 788,000 hectares based on long-term contracts. 'I think the turmoil in east German agriculture is nearly at an end. But it has been a high price to pay.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- A stone plate bearing  words about the birth of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  written 50 years ago appeared recently in Taegu, the Seoul-based  radio Voice of National Salvation reported.    A scroll bearing the words "The bright star of Paektu is for  independence of Korea. Let us uphold the bright star for the  liberation of Korea and for the world generation after  generation. 1944" was already discovered in Chorwon County,  South Korean Kangwon Province, on February 10, 1994, the New  Year's day of the lunar calendar.    An old man surnamed Ri, a retired professor of Kyongbuk  National University in Taegu, on June 12 showed a round stone  plate 15 centimetres in diametre he had kept carefully. Written  on the stone with a writing brush are the words "O Korea, boast  worldwide of the birth of the bright star of Paektu, successor  to General Kim Il-song. 1944."    He said he found the stone, announcing the auspicious event  of the nation, lying on the wooden floor under the eave of his  house when he opened the door one morning in August 1944. At  that time, a rumour was afloat that a big stone bearing the  words "Long live the independence of Korea. Kim Il-song is  coming" was found in front of the gate of the house of the chief  judge of the Taegu district court.    "This stone plate is a most precious national treasure  because it tells about the intense joy of our fellow countrymen  at the news of the birth of the dear leader Kim Chong-il, and  the historical fact that they highly praised him as the bright  star of Paektu and the sun of the future," the old man stressed.</p>

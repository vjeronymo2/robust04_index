			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Almost every commenter discussed the initial evidence rules, which proposed that an application or petition filed without the evidence required by the instructions on the application or petition form would be denied, but without prejudice to the later filing of a complete application or petition. A number of commenters agreed that the proposal would reduce the percentage of cases in which the Service has to ask for more evidence during the adjudications process, and thus review twice, and that this would help speed overall processing times. Several commenters noted that the additional explanations on the new application and petition forms of what evidence is required will help people to file complete applications and petitions. Others supported threshold standards for filing. However, a number of commenters had serious reservations about the initial evidence requirements described in the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that the Service should help applicants and petitioners correct cases that lack the required initial evidence rather than require them to start over and file again. Others suggested the proposed rule did not sufficiently recognize that some people may unintentionally fail to file the required initial evidence. A few suggested that while the Service should deny clearly deficient cases, it should not deny ``marginal'' cases, but should give those people a chance to correct their cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the Service continue to add evidence explanations to its new forms, but only monitor the effect and not implement procedures to deny incomplete applications. Another commenter, who opposed the entire concept of threshold requirements, asserted that allowing the Service to deny an application or petition for lack of initial evidence would give it ``unbridled'' discretion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initial evidence is the evidence necessary to establish a basis for filing and to allow the Service to process the average case through to completion the first time. As indicated by many commenters, it is in the best interest of applicants and petitioners, as well as in the interest of the Service, that an application or petition be complete when first filed so a decision can be entered quickly and correctly, without delays caused by having to go back and ask an applicant or petitioner for more evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial evidence explanations included in revised application and petition forms are designed to help people know what types of basic evidence they should always submit with their application or petition. The explanations also clarify statutory and regulatory eligibility criteria by translating them into more concrete terms. The question here is what the Service should do when someone files without the required threshold evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most basic issues in processing an application or petition for an immigration benefit are determining eligibility for the benefit, and treating all applicants and petitioners fairly and equitably. Among other things, this means using processing systems that ensure that cases are not processed in a way that enables one applicant or petitioner to derive an unfair advantage over another applying for the same benefit. For example, this means ensuring that priority dates for immigration and case processing dates are accorded in ways that do not encourage a person to file an incomplete application as a means of stepping in line in front of someone else who waits to obtain all the necessary evidence before filing. It also means establishing processing parameters to minimize instances where the Service has to handle repeatedly an application because basic documents are missing. This increases average processing time, and raises costs which are transferred to all applicants through filing fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Service recognizes that these processes must operate in an environment in which a significant number of applicants and petitioners are unfamiliar with the English language and government requirements. The Service's goal is to recognize the needs of the population we serve while setting processing parameters that allow the agency to process applications quickly, correctly and fairly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, most applications were submitted in person at a local Service office. This provided an opportunity to review the application, and not accept it at that time if it lacked necessary evidence. However, this has led to occasions where discrepancies in local acceptance standards have been alleged. In order to make filing easier as the volume of applications has grown, and to make processing more consistent, the Service has moved towards a mail-in process. Since advance review is not possible in such a situation, there must be clear guidelines for handling cases filed without necessary evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has revised the initial evidence process as a result of the comments received. In general, the Service will not deny a case for lack of initial evidence. An application or petition will be reviewed after fee receipting. If required initial evidence is missing and there is no evidence of ineligibility in the record, the applicant or petitioner will be notified and given 12 weeks from the date of the notice, without extension, to submit the missing initial evidence. However, if the application is pre-screened by INS prior to its submission, such as in a situation where the person files the application in person, and the person insists on filing the application even though necessary initial evidence is missing, the case shall be denied for lack of required initial evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule does require that where the Service requests evidence after filing, it must be submitted in one response. In addition, as requested by a commenter, it clarifies that a case that is missing initial evidence will not result in the loss of its priority date until a final decision is made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This revised process encourages applicants and petitioners to obtain the necessary threshold evidence before filing so that their case can be processed in order and without delay. However, it also allows people who fail to file this threshold evidence a limited period to submit the missing evidence. A time limit of 12 weeks was set because while the Service wants to afford people an opportunity to correct a filing deficiency, we must balance that with ensuring that the process does not encourage people to file before they have a complete application or petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an applicant or petitioner does not submit the missing initial evidence within the time limit, the application or petition will be automatically denied for lack of initial evidence. While the rule clarifies that an applicant or petitioner may immediately refile after such a denial, it should be noted that if the subsequent case is filed without the required initial evidence, it may be denied without a grace period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this process will normally be sufficient, there are situations where a person's immediate status in the United States hinges on the application or petition, or he or she becomes entitled to a benefit because the case is pending. For example, a person who files for adjustment of status would in certain instances be able to obtain an advance parole to travel based on the pending application. An applicant for an employment authorization document may be entitled to interim employment authorization because the Service cannot make a decision within a certain period. Applying the general process outlined above in such situations would allow a person to obtain interim benefits based on an incomplete application or petition while the Service waits for him or her to submit the necessary initial evidence, or because he or she asks that an interview be rescheduled, delaying processing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The filing of an application or petition without the required initial evidence, or asking that a case be rescheduled, effectively hampers our ability to make a definitive determination of eligibility. An applicant or petitioner may not be allowed to either inadvertently or intentionally hamper the Service's ability to render a decision and as a result gain a potential or actual benefit. Therefore, the Service considers processing time for any application or petition to refer to time unhampered by the applicant or petitioner's action or lack of required action. This means there is nothing under the applicant or petitioner's control that hampers our ability to make a final decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the process outlined earlier, filing an application or petition without required initial evidence hampers the Service's ability to render a final decision. Similarly, requesting a scheduled interview be rescheduled will delay full adjudication of a request for benefits, and will require the Service to duplicate several processing and review steps. The process must balance the need to ensure that persons do not receive undue interim benefits with the need to ensure that any applicable statutory or regulatory processing timeframes are adhered to once we are no longer hampered from making a decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, in such circumstances the processing clock will stop with respect to any time limits for adjudicating the request for Service action at the time the Service sends a notice for initial evidence, and it will start over at the time the Service receives the evidence. Similarly, the processing clock will start over when the Service receives a request to reschedule an interview. The clock stops because the lack of required initial evidence or request for rescheduling hampers the Service's ability to make a final decision. It starts over again because to merely have it resume would effectively shorten the Service's processing window because we have to duplicate several processing and review steps because the application or petition was not complete when submitted or because we were asked to reschedule the interview. Having the clock start over also serves to encourage the filing of complete applications, which, as indicated above, is in the legitimate interests of all applicants and petitioners as well as in the legitimate interest of the Service. However, this process also preserves the processing clock concept because it does not suspend the clock indefinitely until we can resume processing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Service is hampered from making a final decision, interim benefits will not be granted based on a case held in suspense for the submission of requested initial evidence, except that the Service will normally allow the applicant or person the petition is for to remain in the country while an application or petition to extend or obtain status while it is pending. In addition, employment authorization previously accorded based on the same status and employment as that requested in the current application or petition may continue uninterrupted as provided in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(20) notwithstanding the case being held in suspense for the submission of necessary initial evidence. The Service of course reserves the right to pursue other actions to seek the removal of persons notwithstanding a pending application where required, such as in cases involving fraud or clearly frivolous applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule also provides for denial where evidence submitted later does not establish eligibility at the time of filing. The evidence must establish that the applicant or petitioner was eligible for the benefit when the application or petition was filed. As suggested, the Service will monitor the rate of cases in which initial evidence is not submitted at the time of filing as a way of determining how we can further clarify form instructions, and to determine if we need to implement other changes, including those originally proposed in the rule, in order to ensure equity and fairness to all applicants and petitioners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Leonidovich Manilov, Russian </F> Federation Security Council deputy secretary, by SYN OTECHESTVA  correspondent; date, place and occasion not specified; under  rubric "Russia's Vital Interests"; photo of Manilov included]    [Text] As is generally known, the Russian Federation  Security Council was formed a little over a year ago to ensure  realization of the Russian Federation President's functions in  governing, shaping domestic, foreign and military policy in the  security area, preserving Russia's state sovereignty,  maintaining sociopolitical stability in society, and protecting  citizen rights and freedoms. Our readers expressed the desire to  learn more details about the status, functions and powers of  this constitutional entity established on the basis of the  Russian Federation Law "On Security." The conversation with  Security Council Deputy Secretary Valeriy Manilov began with a  traditional request.    [SYN OTECHESTVA] Valeriy Leonidovich, we would like to  hear explanations from the horse's mouth, as they say.    [Manilov] To put it briefly, the Security Council  essentially is a collegial, consultative entity which prepares  the President's decisions in the security area.    [SYN OTECHESTVA] You called the council a collegial  entity. What is its makeup?    [Manilov] The council presently includes 14 of the  state's top officials. Three are permanent members by position:  the President, who heads the Security Council; Chairman of the  Council of Ministers, the Government of Russia; and the Security  Council secretary. Among the 11 members appointed by the  President are the ministers of Economy, Defense, Security,  Internal Affairs, Justice, Ecology and Natural Resources,  Health, and Finance; Chairman of Goskomfederatsii [State  Committee of Federation]; and the Director of the Foreign  Intelligence Service. In jointly deciding vital issues for the  country under the President's direction, they coordinate and  unite the efforts of ministries, departments, establishments and  organizations in developing and implementing policy and strategy  and ensuring state, economic, social, defense, information,  ecologic and other kinds of security.    [SYN OTECHESTVA] But Security Council sessions probably  are preceded by some kind of preparatory work?    [Manilov] Of course, an enormous amount. In the  most general terms we are speaking of a comprehensive systems  analysis of the development of the domestic and international  situation and a forecast of its possible changes. A broad range  of scientific, research and information-analysis structures are  involved in such an analysis, and the capabilities of  ministries, departments, and public organizations are used. It  is on such an integrated basis that--let's put it this  way--warnings of existing and potential threats to Russia's  security are developed and proposals for reacting to them and  recommendations for preventing emergency situations, overcoming  their consequences, and ensuring stability and law and order in  the country are formulated.    [SYN OTECHESTVA] Isn't the former Politburo's "hand"  apparent here?    [Manilov] I know that such an analogy, concocted  by someone for who knows whose need, begins circulating in the  media from time to time. Despite the seeming significance, it  is--excuse me for saying so--hollow. Do you know why it is  absolutely illegitimate to compare the Security Council with the  Politburo? This seems rudimentary, but unfortunately one has to  repeat it. The Security Council has a fundamentally different  mentality, if one can speak about some kind of mentality at all  as applied to the Politburo. The Security Council is a  constitutional entity. Its status, functions, and powers are  clearly and precisely spelled out by law. And like its staff and  its working entities, the interdepartmental commissions, it  operates strictly within the framework of the law, on the basis  of the statute approved by the President and of other  legislative instruments in the security area. Its decisions are  formalized by presidential edicts. They are public and open to  society to the maximum possible extent. Judge for yourself  whether or not substitution, duplication, let alone usurpation  of the prerogatives and powers of any authoritative structures  whatsoever are possible with this. No. I repeat once again: the  Security Council, in which top officials of our state who are  personally responsible for organizing its life and activity in  the most important directions are represented, synthesizes their  political will, their political wisdom, and their professional  experience and knowledge into a unified national policy.    [SYN OTECHESTVA] Nevertheless, the Security Council has  coordinating and monitoring functions?    [Manilov] This question touches on a very  sensitive area, so I would like you to set forth my response to  it with extreme precision. First. The Security Council does not  engage in executive-administrative activity. As they say, this  is the purview of the government, ministries, committees and  departments. Second. The Security Council has no management  functions. In accordance with the law, it develops proposals for  coordinating the work of executive authorities in the process of  implementing decisions made in the security area. Third. Take  heed that such coordination is organized not by functions (this  is the prerogative of the government), but by  objectives, i.e., not at an executive level, but at a  political level. And this specifically is what ensures strategic  coordination of operations and the development and  implementation of a unified security policy. Fourth. One other  level of coordination is envisaged by legislative instruments.  It relates to the development and implementation of federal  programs for ensuring Russia's security.    That is how matters stand with coordination. As for  monitoring, it is carried out by the Security Council secretary  and staff with respect to implementation of Security Council  decisions and presidential edicts in security matters.    [SYN OTECHESTVA] In your opinion, what is the important  thing in ensuring national security?    [Manilov] Generally speaking, there are no  unimportant, secondary directions and spheres here. I would  include problems of ensuring economic, defense, ecologic and  information security and security in the foreign policy area  among the basic, principal ones. Only their agreed upon,  coordinated, mutually correlated resolution can be effective. No  department can cope with them alone. Take ecologic security. The  state of affairs here is assuming a threatening nature in many  regions, including Moscow. What kind of air are we breathing?  What kind of water are we drinking? Will its reserves suffice  for long? What kind of "habitat" are we leaving for our  children? Will it be possible to live in it? You can continue  the list of questions. They must be answered today. Tomorrow  already may be too late. It is the same with public security,  for we are speaking essentially about creating conditions for a  life that is normal and, I would say, free of fear, and about  forming mechanisms for the functioning of a rule-of-law state  and a civilian society. And public health protection? Is it  really possible to underestimate those enormous, fully real,  tangible threats about which demographic statistics of recent  time literally shout? Or information security, a concept which  we did not employ at all until recently. But we are speaking  about something very serious. Take just one facet of the  problem--our people's moral and psychological mentality. To what  values--aesthetic, moral, historical, military-patriotic,  cultural--is it devoted? Is it permissible to substitute for  these values, alter them in an offhand way, and break the  character of the people? For often the information flows which  bring a cult of violence, spiritual impoverishment and primitive  sex down on Russians are targeted specifically at this. This is  national property which must neither be squandered nor crowded  out by something alien and borrowed.    [SYN OTECHESTVA] Is it possible to say at least a few  words about defense security?    [Manilov] Today new threats to vital interests of  Russia and its allies have come to replace previous ones, which,  by the way, still have not been overcome completely. A  classification of them is given in the "Basic Provisions of  Russian Military Doctrine" developed by the Security Council and  adopted in early November. These threats must be parried.    And with all the adherence to the priority of peaceful  means,  this is impossible to do without the presence of a defense  potential adequate to Russia's place and role as a great power  in the modern world. Our Armed Forces are the concentrated,  realized part of this potential. Their mobility, strength level,  outfitting, state of supply, and combat readiness are a national  concern. This concern has two principal points of  application--material and spiritual. Speaking in a generalized  way, the former consists of weapons and the latter is the  readiness to defend the homeland. Together they provide defense  security.    [SYN OTECHESTVA] Evidently the Security Council staff  also is structured taking into account the broad spectrum of  council tasks?    [Manilov] You are correct. The structure of the  Security Council staff has two main units--information analysis  and coordination. They adjust close, daily interworking with  federal authorities and management entities and with federation  components for analyzing and forecasting the situation  development, developing proposals and recommendations in the  security area, and preparing and implementing federal programs.    One more unit presently is being created--a system of  interdepartmental commissions. These are basic working entities  of the Security Council with which the staff operates side by  side. There are ten. They are called upon to study and prepare  fundamental proposals on security in appropriate spheres,  coordinated at the ministerial and departmental level.    The staff now is being formed. It is a complex stage, for,  as  you know, affairs are organized by humans. The main requirements  placed on those who come here to work are professionalism,  decency, and dedication to the job of new Russian statehood.    The supertask is to establish a harmonious, hard-working  collective and an atmosphere of comradeship and responsibility.    [SYN OTECHESTVA] The Security Council approved the  "Basic Provisions of Russian Federation Military Doctrine."  Today this document is the focus of attention of politicians,  political scientists, analysts, sociologists and the military  here in our country and abroad. What could you say about this  document?    [Manilov] First of all, it is a national document.  Secondly, it is Russian in spirit and content. Thirdly, it is  realistic. Fourthly, it is timely. Fifthly, it is legal. It  would be possible to continue, but it would appear the important  thing lies elsewhere, in the fact that by adopting the "Basic  Provisions of Military Doctrine" at such a difficult, highly  dramatic point in its development, Russia clearly and firmly  declared adherence to principles of democracy, humanism, nonuse  of force, and nonintervention in affairs of other states; a  clear vision of prospects for the country's reform; and a firm  resolve to protect its interests, the interests of Russia. Of  course, military doctrine is a topic for a separate conversation.    [SYN OTECHESTVA] We hope it will take place. You  mentioned Russia's interests. We spoke somehow timidly and  diffidently about this previously.    [Manilov] True. Even worse, at times we passed  over it in silence altogether. But the fact is, vital Russian  interests--above all the country's territorial integrity,  sovereignty, economic independence, preservation of natural  resources and all national property, and spiritual  originality--are on the one hand an objective reality and on the  other hand an objective need for normal development of the  individual, society and the state. And in this sense--pardon me  for the unintended tautology--any system, including a national  security system, is vital to that extent to which it meets the  Motherland's vital interests.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ashland Oil warns of reverse ASHLAND Oil, the Kentucky-based diversified energy company, yesterday predicted a significant drop in third-quarter earnings. It added that it would sell assets valued between Dollars 200m to Dollars 250m to compensate for the shortfall in net income, given its large capital spending requirements for petroleum refineries. Ashland, which had net income of Dollars 76m, or Dollars 1.19 a share, in the 1991 third quarter, blamed declining refinery margins and the cost of meeting increased environmental regulations for the disappointing outlook. Mr John Hall, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Without a marked improvement in refinery margins over the balance of our fiscal year, we will be unable to achieve last year's results for either our fiscal fourth quarter or the year. 'We believe it is prudent to sell some assets in order to maintain our financial flexibility during this difficult period in the industry,' he added. 'We have attempted to select assets that are currently providing us with a relatively low rate of return.' Ashland is considering selling its SuperAmerica petrol and convenience stores in Florida and its Arizona highway construction subsidiary. Some smaller assets and parts of other businesses may also be put on the block. The proceeds will be used to cut debt. Ashland has retained First Boston to advise it on the dispositions. On Wall Street yesterday, shares in Ashland closed Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 27 7/8.</p>

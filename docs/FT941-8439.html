			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Derivatives expiry meets bad bonds news Bad news on the US business outlook from the Philadelphia Fed hit the US long bond on Thursday night, feeding through into European bond markets and equities yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's Dax index, initially, lost some of the post-bourse gains it chalked up after the Bundesbank rate cut on Thursday afternoon. While the blue chip indicator closed officially 23.25 higher at 2,151.97, 2.9 per cent up on the week, this was some 10 points below the Ibis close of the day before. Worse was to come. Wall Street opened weaker again and the Ibis Dax eventually dropped another 18.12 to 2,133.85. The bourse also had domestic considerations. Yesterday saw the expiry of stock options, and options on the DAX future which held up during the session but dropped heavily thereafter, hitting 2,138.0, down 49.0 at one point late in the day. Turnover, frequently affected by the expiry operation, rose from DM8.5bn to DM9.9bn. Furthermore, brokers were worried about the prospects of industrial strife, with IG Metall officials due to vote on a strike ballot on Monday. PARIS retreated in late trading in line with the trend elsewhere. The session was extended because of a technical problem, the CAC-40 index ending off 29.40 at 2,251.78, a week's loss of 1 per cent. Aside from influences outside of the equity market, particularly in the matif, there was little to stimulate trading activity, with turnover a low FFr3.3bn. Pinault-Printemps, the retailer, announced that it was to merge with La Redoute, its mail order division. Both shares were suspended until Monday, having closed on Thursday at FFr995 and FFr960 respectively. Euro Disney was one of the day's few risers, up FFr1.40 at FFr36.60, but the shares remain 14 per cent down since the beginning of this year. AMSTERDAM slid into negative territory in the afternoon session, influenced partly by the expiration of options. However, sentiment remained uncertain, with some traders suggesting that the market might start to consolidate around these levels. The AEX index closed off 6.00 or 1.4 per cent at 426.91, a week's fall of 1.7 per cent. Investors are also taking profits ahead of results due out in the next week or so from Royal Dutch, down Fl 3.50 at Fl 208.70, Unilever, off Fl 3.10 at Fl 225.50 and Akzo, down 10 cents at Fl 213.60. ZURICH brokers said that the expiry of futures and options contracts helped lead the market lower. Volume was low as the blue-chip, SMI index fell 44.7 to 3,025.9, still showing a recovery of 1.3 per cent on the week. The blue chips led the way down, as they had led on the upgrade earlier in the week. The SPI all-share index fell 21.73 to 1,926.45. Roche, SFr80 lower at SFr7,015, led the active list. Since volume was low, it did not take much to drive prices lower and push some shares down to the derivatives' strike prices. MADRID, always susceptible to foreign market weakness, was also led into a late correction by the expiry of the February futures contract. Bond market weakness cancelled out the Bank of Spain's decision to cut its daily intervention rate by 25 basis points, to 8.55 per cent. The general index fell 2.52 to 345.46, 0.7 per cent lower on the week. Volume almost doubled in the last 45 minutes of the session as the futures expiry boosted activity - although total turnover, at Pta33.9bn, was well below its recent daily average. Telefonica fell Pta30, or 1.4 per cent to Pta2,045. Banks were generally weak and while Banesto recovered Pta25 at Pta785, BBV lost Pta20 at Pta3,405 and BCH Pta30 at Pta2,960. STOCKHOLM retreated with heavy profit-taking seen in Volvo following the Thursday's news that the Swedish car maker and Renault of France were to end their strategic alliance. Volvo Bs lost SKr9 to SKr683, but closed the week still 4.6 per cent ahead. The Affarsvarlden index lost 6.60 to 1,582.40, also 4.6 per cent higher over the week. Turnover was up to SKr4.2bn from SKr2.9bn, with activity in Volvo accounting for nearly half of yesterday's amount. ATHENS moved upwards on prospects of a peaceful settlement in the Bosnian conflict, leaving the general index up 36.94 to 1,067.35, and 0.5 per cent higher across the week. Turnover was estimated at Dr8bn, with construction companies outperforming the market with rises of 8 per cent. ISTANBUL brought its week's gains to nearly 40 per cent as the composite index advanced a further 143.64 to 19,274.64. However, some traders commented that further rises might be restricted because of instability in the money markets. Turnover was down to TL1,440bn from Thursday's TL1,540bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 18                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Open      10.30      11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1504.85    1505.03    1503.53   1502.26 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1559.45    1559.71    1558.09   1557.54  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             13.00      14.00      15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1500.02    1499.43    1497.89   1495.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1556.12    1554.73    1554.04   1550.75  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Feb 17   Feb 16   Feb 15    Feb 14    Feb 11  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1516.65  1491.80  1483.24   1477.57   1487.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1569.16  1554.49  1540.98   1534.08   1543.87  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90);  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1505.51; 200 - 1560.48 Low/day: 100 - 1495.00 200 - 1550.42  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane and John Pitt</p>

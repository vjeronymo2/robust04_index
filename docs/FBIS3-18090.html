According to our  correspondents in Brussels, positions on the key issue of  regional supports were still far apart on Sunday. We have this  report.    [Unidentified reporter] It looked on Sunday as if a war of  nerves was underway in EU membership negotiations in Brussels.  Finnish representatives and officials of the EU gave the media  directly conflicting statements on the measure of progress seen.  The chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers, Theodhoros  Pangalos, told the press on Sunday afternoon that talks with  Sweden were the furthest advanced, closely followed by  discussions with Finland. He stated that he believed that a  settlement was forthcoming on the tough question of the future  of Finland's agricultural sector within the EU.    In contrast, both Finland's Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto  and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen said that not much  ground had been covered on Sunday. Salolainen stated that all  of the crucial issues were still unresolved and that the EU was  holding to its previous positions -- stands which Finland has  declared as unacceptable. Salolainen added that while  everything possible is being done to ensure the achievement of  accord on membership terms, Finland is insisting on viable terms.    [Announcer] Meanwhile, the Finnish center-right coalition  cabinet was scheduled to meet late Sunday evening to debate the  latest results in the membership talks in Brussels. President  Mauno Koivisto was also expected to sit in on the cabinet  meeting.</p>

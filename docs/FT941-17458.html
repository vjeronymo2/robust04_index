			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: Austrian bank goes ahead 55% Creditanstalt Bankverein (CA), one of Austria's three biggest banks, yesterday reported record provisional operating profits of Sch5.3bn (Dollars 434m) for 1993, an increase of more than 55 per cent on the Sch3.4bn achieved in 1992. Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, managing board chairman, said the results were 'the best the bank has ever posted,' signalling a 'clear trend reversal' after difficult years. The improved earnings performance was due mainly to a steep rise in trading activity and profits which doubled to Sch2.4bn last year. It also benefited from favourable developments in the securities market. Partial operating profits - interest plus fee income minus operating expenses - rose from Sch2.1bn in 1992 to Sch2.7bn last year. As other Austrian banks, CA has been under pressure to reduce operating costs which rose by 1 per cent last year to Sch8.5bn. Personnel has been reduced by 272 employees to 7,457.</p>

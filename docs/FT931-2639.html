			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CrestaCare cuts losses to Pounds 1.49m CRESTACARE, the nursing home operator which is selling its sheltered housing and commercial property activities, recorded a reduced loss before tax in 1992 of Pounds 1.49m, against Pounds 13.2m, writes Maggie Urry. The group made an operating profit of Pounds 3.9m (loss Pounds 138,000) on turnover up by half to Pounds 25.6m, compared with Pounds 17.2m. A change in accounting policy meant a Pounds 2m adverse restatement of the 1991 figures. CrestaCare is now charging costs incurred after a home opens to the profit and loss account. Previously it had deferred such costs until the home reached a certain occupancy rate. The operating profit from nursing homes rose from Pounds 1.52m (restated from Pounds 3.5m) to Pounds 4.16m. Other activities lost Pounds 229,000 (Pounds 1.66m). The interest charge was lower at Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 458,000). Exceptional costs of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 12.6m) largely reflected property write-downs. There was a retained loss of Pounds 2m (Pounds 15.5m) and losses per share were 1.8p (18.2p). The good result from nursing homes encouraged the group to declare a 0.4p final dividend (nil), to give a total of 0.5p (0.7p). Year end borrowings were Pounds 21.2m, compared with net assets of Pounds 28.2m but the group expects to raise between Pounds 8.5m and Pounds 9m from property sales.</p>

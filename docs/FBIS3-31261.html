			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] President of the Republic Vaclav  Havel returned during the night from his eight-day official  visit to India and Thailand. Czech radio correspondent David  Stahlavsky, who accompanied the president during his trip, is in  the studio now with more details.    [Stahlavsky] President Havel considers the visit to be a  success. He reiterated this tonight shortly before landing at  Old Ruzyne airport. He praised, in particular, the  participation of Ivan Kocarnik, deputy prime minister and  finance minister; Josef Zieleniec, minister of foreign affairs;  and Radomir Sabela, deputy of the minister of industry and  trade. They all agree with the president's assessment of the  visit. [passage omitted]    Vaclav Havel made a brief unofficial stopover in Kuwait. He  had private talks with the amir in power, Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad  al-Jabir al-Sabah. This is what the Czech president said about  these talks:    [Begin recording] [Havel] The amir and I discussed political  cooperation between our countries. We agreed that our views  were very close and that no political shadows exist between us.  We also discussed economic cooperation. I said that this  cooperation is not as good as it could be, that unutilized  potential exists in this respect. I explained the reasons we  did not use this potential as best we could during the period  that our entire economy was undergoing the process of  transformation. The amir emphasized that Kuwait is very  interested in economic cooperation with the Czech Republic and  that our firms are well known in that country. An agreement  between Kuwait and the Czech Republic on the protection of  investments is due to be finalized and signed in the spring.  [passage indistinct] [end recording]    [Announcer] It should be added that our trade with Kuwait  amounted to approximately $5 million last year. Czech exports  to Kuwait account for the best part of it, while Kuwaiti imports  to the Czech Republic are very small.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Peter Schwarz: ``Eco-Audit: If They Are </F> Unwilling the Market Will Pressure Them''; Subhead: ``Pressure  on Companies to Certify Their Environmental Management Growing  as Result of EC Ordinance'']    [Text] Duesseldorf, 4 March -- As of April 1995, companies  will be able to have their environmental management assessed  voluntarily. That is what the EU Eco-audit ordinance stipulates.  But it is obvious even now that many firms are being compelled  to implement the eco-check. Banks, insurers and customers are  applying pressure.    In mid-November, last year, the presidents of the Federal  Association of German Industry [BDI] and the German Industrial  and Trade Association [DIHT] addressed a letter to the federal  environmental minister. In their letter to ``Dear Mr. Toepfer,''  Tyll Necker and Hans Peter Stihl condemn the turnabout in  government environmental policy. According to the three-page  document, the private sector expects the government to seize the  opportunity afforded by the eco-audit ordinance to ``refashion  the relation between self-responsibility and oversight.''    The leaders of Germany's private sector would like the  federation and the laender to confine themselves to their core  responsibilities. The eco-commitment at summit sessions should  henceforth promote environmental protection and no longer new  laws and regulations. The corporate eco-check that the EC  ordinance outlines in 21 articles and five appendices was  vigorously opposed for years by German industry.    Since then, private sector groups, gnashing their teeth,  have  struck up a friendship with the new instrument of Brussels'  environmental policy. They have reconciled themselves to the  ordinance on two grounds. Otherwise than originally stipulated,  no firm is strictly obliged to take part in the audit. Besides  that, the text of the ordinance is amply unspecified. It is up  to the national governments to regulate what, how and by whom  the detailed audit should be conducted.    So that in the future the government will not get involved  in  regulating corporate environmental management any more than at  present, in Germany the BDI and DIHT are pushing for a solution  ``that is private sector-friendly and based on the principle of  self-administration.'' In their conception, the Accreditation  Sponsorship Society [TGA], that is entrusted, among other  things, with the licensing of quality certifiers, should examine  and oversee the suitability of environmental auditors. Since  formal appointment of the auditors is a sovereign act, they are  proposing a joint Chamber of Industry and Commerce center for  it. Ultimately, according to the associations' plans, the  central Chamber of Industry and Commerce [IHK] would also be  responsible for registering the firms participating in the  eco-audit and reporting to Brussels.    Such extensively conjured self-administration goes too far  for environmental minister Toepfer. He would like for the  auditors to be appointed by the federal environmental department  and registration of the examined business sites turned over to  the laender.    What seems to be a petty bureaucratic squabble at first  glance is in fact of some significance. For the examining and  monitoring organizations that the ordinance requires will  ultimately decide how high to set the criteria for the  eco-audit. Environmental protection groups like BUND [expansion  not given] suspect that the ordinance will be watered down if  the private sector implements its proposals.    Dr. Adolf von Roepenack who is involved with the EC  ordinance  at the BDI, does not share such fears. The requirements for the  auditors have to be ``pitched very high.'' In fact, the private  sector would hurt itself if lax examinations led the eco-audit  ``to degenerate into an elegant method for worming out of  environmental protection,'' as Dr. Gerhard Feldhaus, head of the  NAGUS [expansion not given] environmental committee at the  German Industrial Standards [DIN] in Berlin, expresses it.  Hence, only if the eco-audit is undertaken earnestly will the  federation and the laender be prepared duly to reduce pollution.  Anyone participating in the eco-audit could be relieved of the  reporting obligation for it. Shorter approval times might also  be conceivable.    NAGUS chairman Feldhaus, however, considers bureaucratic  muscle-flexing justified only once the audit has proven its  worth in practice for several years. First of all, the  legislative groundwork for it has to be laid. Experts from the  environmental ministry and private sector associations are  currently consulting on the moot issues.    But even were a solution to be found in upcoming weeks, no  one in the federal environmental ministry expects an  ``eco-auditor and site registration bill'' can be passed in this  legislative session. At most, a cabinet decision may be  possible. According to the EC ordinance, however, the member  countries will have to create a feasible certification system at  the latest by April of next year.    The new administration therefore will be under time  pressure.  If the Social Democratic Party [SDP] has the say-so in Bonn  after the election in October, the BDI and DIHT will not be able  to implement their self-administration model. Social Democratic  environmental spokesman Michael Mueller gives minister Toepfer  encouragement on this issue. For this reason too, something  augurs that the federal environmental department will chime in  with something important to say on the licensing of auditors.    Many corporate consultants are annoyed by the squabble  between the minister and the industrial lobby that has been  simmering for months. The consultants scent a big deal. Dr.  Marlies Sander of Roland Berger &amp; Partner concedes: ``Of  course  we have an abiding interest in moving the issue along.''    The Munich consulting firm, one of the majors in the branch,  with nearly DM300 million in annual turnover, has not yet  decided if it will have itself accredited as an independent  eco-auditor or confine itself to the consulting business. At the  moment, Marlies Sander estimates that Roland Berger is earning  ``in the single-digit millions'' with eco-consulting. In her  opinion, so far only a few firms in Germany are involved in the  issue of eco-management.    The Brussels eco-audit could now change this. If not from  conviction, then under the more or less gentle pressure of the  market, many firms will participate in the examination process.  By as early as next year experts are projecting several hundred  firms will. Large companies like Daimler Benz are presently  checking out the ecological fitness of a number of sites. If  certification is possible by 1995 they will be the first to have  their environmental friendliness checked by the EU.    But medium-sized outfits too are well advised soon to cast a  glance at EC ordinance 1836/93. Automobile suppliers, above all,  will have to expect pressure on them from the manufacturers for  the eco-check, according to the conclusion of an in-house study  by Roland Berger. After all, vehicle manufacturers in turn will  be under pressure. Eco-certificates will be required with  increasing frequency from abroad in the government's award  guidelines.    Banks and insurance firms too will be taking an interest in  the eco-risks of their clients. Dr. Hans-Juergen Advena,  managing director of Cologne's Gerling Consulting can therefore  well imagine that a successful eco-audit will be taken into  consideration in setting premiums and awarding loans. In  Advena's words: ``Ultimately, the confirmed eco-report from a  neutral auditor facilitates an objective risk impression.''    For this reason too, Gerling Consulting is unwilling to  exclude the fact that after a successful trial period the  eco-audit will become obligatory for all businesses. On the  basis of article 20 of the ordinance, in any case, the entire  system will be on the test bench by 1998 at the latest. Even Dr.  Klaus Heuvels of Frankfurt's Metallgesellschaft [MG], who took  part last year with a lead works in a Brussels pilot audit,  expects ``effectively, what is an option will become an  obligation.''    On the basis of his experience at MG subsidiary BSB  Recycling  in Braubach the EC concept has ``fully passed the first  practical test.'' What does the audit contribute to the firm?  Heuvels mentions four items above all: all essential eco-data  are documented, weaknesses are identified, employees are  sensitized to ecological problems. Also, according to the  eco-jurist, the expert examination can reduce civil and criminal  legal liability risks.    For Volker Brennecke who is preparing the ``eco-management''  project at the Association of German Engineers [VDI] in  Duesseldorf, the eco-audit affords the firm an additional  opportunity: ``The operational eco-checks should be seized by  the firms as an opportunity, based on the comprehensive analysis  of processes and procedures, both to avoid future pollution and  also to initiate technical and organizational innovations. In  this context synergistic effects are possible that will pay off  in business terms.''</p>

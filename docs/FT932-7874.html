			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Management: Guiding lights - British companies are turning increasingly to mentoring When Ulysses put his son in the care of his old friend Mentor while he began his epic journey, little did he know what he was starting. Some three thousand years later mentoring has become one of the most fashionable areas in management development. According to a recent survey by the Industrial Society, 40 per cent of British companies have a mentoring scheme, and a further 20 per cent are thinking about creating one. The subject has spawned its own jargon, specialist consultancies, conferences and even a society with a database dedicated to mentoring. But the idea could scarcely be simpler. A mentor is someone with experience who offers help and knowledge to someone junior. The mentor is not the boss, nor is he or she trying to teach anything specific. They are there to guide, listen and advise. There is nothing special about that; most people on the rise have had their own career confidants, just as most senior people have had a protege or two. Mentoring, as conceived by the human resource experts makes the process formal and, by doing so, creates a fairer system, less subject to politics and back scratching. Mentoring as a science became established in the US in the 1970s, when an article in the Harvard Business Review argued that being a mentor distinguished a leader from a mere manager. Other US research found that top executives who had had a mentor did better than those who had not. In the 1980s mentoring caught on in the UK as a way of helping graduates settle down in big companies. Now there are mentors for managers at all levels, mentors for disadvantaged groups of employees and even mentors for mentors. The idea accords well with the latest management thinking: people 'own' their development and in flat organisations, where people are no longer being told what to do by their immediate superiors, they need others to guide and help them. Despite the popularity of mentoring schemes, not all have been successful. Many of the early US efforts went wrong because they were too formal and established so many rules for the behaviour of mentor and mentoree that the relationship was stifled. In the UK the problem has been the reverse. According to David Clutterbuck, director of the European Mentoring Centre, some companies simply said 'You are a mentor, go away and mate', and then were surprised when their schemes collapsed. At a recent conference on mentoring organised by the Industrial Society, Clutterbuck said the most common sources of problems occur when companies failed to: Prepare the mentors or mentorees properly Set clear goals for the scheme Set clear goals for each mentoring relationship Provide support networks for mentors and mentorees. BT, the telecoms group, has addressed many of these issues and has established a large mentoring programme for its graduate engineers. The aim, says Adam Scott, an enthusiastic mentor and a director of BT, is to avoid the 'rather muddled experience' he had when he qualified. Scott, in common with every mentor, was selected as someone who not only had the necessary experience, but also had 'interpersonal skills.' The loss of senior management time is the main cost of the scheme - Scott estimates the six annual meetings he holds with each mentoree cost about Pounds 1,000-Pounds 2,000. At the first meeting he sits with his mentoree at his Apple Mac computer and they agree the terms of their relationship, its confidentiality and the subjects to be discussed. Scott, in common with other BT mentors has been trained in the art. So, too, have the mentorees and the line managers, who are left out of the relationship, but who need to understand and support what is happening. Every three months there are meetings for both sides to discuss shared concerns. Mentors prepare regular reports on the process and there are support staff to solve problems. So far some 80 graduates have taken part and about 60 per cent have asked for the relationship to be continued once the formal two-year programme is over. Although graduate schemes still predominate, there are an increasing number of mentoring programmes aimed at other well-defined groups of employees. At the Prudential, a mentoring programme has been designed for pregnant women, to make it easier for them to return to work afterwards. Mentors are chosen among women with similar experiences and who can help with the problems of juggling jobs and babies, offer advice on childcare and keep the mentoree in touch with the company during maternity leave. The Pru says the scheme has helped retain staff in whom much has been invested and has made those who return immediately effective in their jobs. The Pru has had little trouble finding women prepared to be mentors, but the same is not the case for companies establishing schemes for senior people. Indeed, those which want mentors for their top executives frequently end up seeking outside help. One company that provides such a mentoring service is the consultancy GHN, which says it has mentored senior managers from around 200 companies. 'At the very top levels it is almost impossible to handle mentoring internally. There are so many hidden agendas,' says Susan Block of GHN. She denies that it matters if the mentor is ignorant of the ins and outs of the particular company. Instead, they must be good at probing, listening and questioning and may also need to deliver painful home truths. Such home truths do not come cheap - a year's programme of tailor-made personal development costs between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 10,000. Not every senior person wanting a mentor has to hire a professional. As Oxford Regional Health Authority has found out, some mentors are prepared to offer their services for free, even if they do not work for the same organisation. The authority has set up a nine-week programme for 100 chief executives and top health managers, which includes a confidential mentoring scheme. Each manager is responsible for finding their own mentor, who could come from another region or an academic institution. There are limits, though, as Gary Hoyte, who helped to set up the scheme, admits. 'If everyone in the country needed a mentor, perhaps mentor overload would set in. There would be a backlash, with everyone resenting the amount of time they were spending. But we are a long way from that now.'</p>

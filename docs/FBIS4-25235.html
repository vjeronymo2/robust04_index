			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xing Shiguo (6717 0013 0948) "Heilongjiang </F> Province Will Carry Out Mass Inspection Over the Enforcement of  the Statistical Law"]    [Text] In line with the state unified demand, Heilongjiang  Province will carry out mass inspection over the enforcement of  the statistics law from early June this year. This is the  specific arrangement made at the telephone conference sponsored  by the provincial level departments concerned on 26 May.    It was pointed out at the conference that since the issuance  and enforcement of the "statistics law" in 1983 and the  "province's regulations on statistical inspection and  supervision" in 1992, localities across the province have  gradually oriented statistical work onto the track of legal  systems thanks to earnestly implementing the "statistical law"  and the "statistical regulations". However, specific  localities and departments as well as some units and individuals  have got blunted in their sense of statistical legal systems and  not earnestly implemented the "statistical law". By paying no  attention to the state statistical law, some of them have  employed trickery on the statistical work in order to seek  through fraud and deception the political honor and economic  interest of their own small communities. They have also done as  they pleases in making false statistical reports and falsifying  the statistical data. All of these have seriously affected the  state in making its policy decisions and conducting its  management in this regard in a scientific way and brought about  grave harmf to the society. For this reason, the province has  decided to carry out mass inspection over the enforcement of the  statistical law from early June this year.    The mass inspection is aimed at all investigation units  across the province, which are organizing the statistical  investigation, and at all units (state apparatus, social  communities, and enterprises and establishments in various  economic sectors) that ought to accept the investigation and are  obligated to provide their statistical data. It also chiefly  aimed at the following unlawful practices cropping up in the  statistical activities over the past few years and particularly  since 1993:    1. The statistical reports have been falsified and the  statistical data have been forged or distorted.    2. The statistical organs and personnel have been forced or  incited to employ trickery in their statistical data.    3. The statistical personnel who have upheld the principles  of making statistical reports according to the facts and  informing against or exposing the unlawful practices in this  regard have been retaliated against.    4. Units have refused to make their statistical report or  repeatedly delayed their reports.    5. Units have caused losses and harmful influence by  publishing or providing their statistical data arbitrarily and  by letting out the state secret.    6. Units have conducted at will the dismantlement and merger  of statistical organs or weakened the strength of statistical  affairs.    7. Units have obstructed the investigation and handling  conducted by the supervisory and statistical departments for the  violation cases.    The focal point of the mass inspection will be placed on the  unlawful practices of employing statistical trickery in the  fields of industrial output value, particularly the output value  of township enterprises, population, grain output and storage,  per peasant net income, investments made in fixed assets, and  price index. All of these have drawn a greater complaint from  various social circles.    In order to successfully carry out the mass inspection Zhang  Chengyi, assistant to the governor, urged various administrative  offices and the party committee of various cities and counties  to establish a specialized leading group or working body to  investigate and handle the violation cases in this regard by  taking a clear-cut stand. They should resolutely investigate  through to the end and in line with the law the units and  individuals who have employed trickery in the important  statistical data in order to seek through fraud and deception  their own political honor and economic interest and their own  small communities interests, as well as units and individuals  who have retaliated with the activities of fraud and deception.  By no means should they wink at or tolerate these units and  individuals. He also urged various localities to integrate the  mass inspection with the education on popularizing the law, with  the basic construction of statistical work, and with the  investigation and handling of violation cases.    The mass inspection will conclude at the end of August this  year.</p>

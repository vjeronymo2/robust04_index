			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Mercedes in Indian venture Mercedes-Benz is to start assembling E-Class executive cars and manufacturing vehicle engines in India in a new joint venture with its long-standing partner, Tata Engineering and Locomotive (Telco) of Bombay. The partners will invest DM250m (Pounds 97.2m) in equipping a factory in Poona with capacity for 20,000 cars and 50,000 petrol and diesel engines a year. Car assembly will start this year, while engine output is scheduled to begin in 1995, Daimler-Benz, the Mercedes parent, said yesterday. Mercedes will hold a 51 per cent stake in a new operating company, Mercedes-Benz India, which will further tighten ties with Telco, in which Daimler has a 10 per cent stake. The two groups have co-operated since 1954, when Telco was awarded its first licences to manufacture Mercedes commercial vehicles under licence.</p>

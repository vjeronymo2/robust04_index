			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Crimea by correspondent Aleksandr Lebedev </F> --from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] The military council of the Black Sea Fleet has  expressed the firm conviction that the situation on the Crimean  peninsula is becoming more stable and interference by power  structures to overcome the political crisis is completely out of  the question.    According to the estimates of experts from the Ministry of  Defense of the Russian Federation, the deployment of military  equipment by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine throughout the  territory of the Crimea does no pose any danger from a military  point of view. The Black Sea Fleet is capable of intercepting  any provocations in the region. [video shows military experts  at work]</p>

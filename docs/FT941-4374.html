			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / In a flap at feeding time: Plans to inject capital into Air France highlight Europe's problems over state aid to the public sector The French government's plan to inject capital of at least FFr20bn into Air France, its financially stricken flag-carrier, may bring to the boil a row that has been simmering over the past year. At the heart of the dispute about state hand-outs to public sector companies are fears that some governments are distorting the single European market by unfair subsidies. That is the charge made by British Airways, one of Air France's fiercest rivals: 'State hand-outs are unfair and distort the air transport industry.' Other non-aided airlines, such as Holland's KLM and Germany's Lufthansa, are also expected to be furious. The proposed capital injection for Air France is an important test for the European Commission, which is struggling to bring state aid to industry under control. Under the Treaty of Rome and Treaty of Paris, Brussels has responsibility for policing subsidies. It is hard to see how the Commission could allow the Air France plan through in its current form without a loss of credibility. But the French government is not in a mood to compromise either. Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister, said he would be prepared to 'battle with Brussels to get a green light' to proceed with the plan. A long drawn-out dispute is in prospect. Air France is just the largest in a series of troubled flag-carriers that have recently received subsidies from their governments or are shortly expected to seek them. Others include Spain's Iberia, Ireland's Aer Lingus, Portugal's TAP and Greece's Olympic. Nor are hand-outs confined to the airline industry. Before this week's Air France announcement, the controversy had been most bitter in the steel industry, which has been badly hit by the recession. Non-aided steel groups are so enraged at the European Union's decision last December to sanction Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.3bn) in subsidies to their public sector rivals that they have pulled out of an industry-wide restructuring scheme. Mr Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, are scheduled to meet European steel chiefs on March 23 in an attempt to resolve the crisis. But Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman, has threatened to boycott the meeting unless there is an end to subsidies. The Commission is also investigating scores of other state aid cases. The most prominent is Groupe Bull, the French public sector computer group, which is about to ask Mr Van Miert to approve a new restructuring plan involving state subsidies. UK companies feel particularly cheated by such subsidies. Companies such as British Steel and British Airways were privatised in the 1980s and had to cut costs savagely. They feel their rivals in other countries should do likewise. Many companies are angry because this is not the first time their aided rivals have received state cash. For example: Air France received FFr5.8bn (Pounds 670m) in three tranches in 1991 and 1992 from the French government, the then state-owned Banque Nationale de Paris and an international banking consortium. Last year there was a FFr1.5bn bond issue taken up by the state-owned Caisse des Depots, which is being investigated by the Commission. The airline still lost FFr7.5bn last year and has debts of FFr37bn. Ilva, the Italian steel group, and Finsider, the bankrupt group from which Ilva was formed in 1988, received Ecu11.3bn in state aid during the 1980s. The Commission sanctioned another Ecu2.6bn last December. In Bull's case, the Commission authorised a FFr6.68bn capital injection in 1992. The French government provided another FFr2.5bn last February and its current plan involves the injection of a further FFr8.6bn. The non-aided companies believe this flow of subsidies is damaging their interests. In the steel industry, aid has kept inefficient public sector groups in business and so depressed prices, says Mr Brian Moffat. 'We have had an unnecessarily long price war, which has been maintained by subsidised losses.' One consequence of propping up state companies could be the closure of more efficient, private-sector plants. Private enterprises are being asked by the Commission to cut up to 25m tonnes of capacity, while the aided groups have agreed to cut only 5m tonnes. Similarly, British Airways argues that subsidies to Air France are undermining its ability to expand in the French market through its associate, TAT. 'It is pretty clear that Air France is trying to eliminate competition in the domestic market,' says Mr David Holmes, BA's government relations director. Competitors of aided companies are not the only ones who are worried. Economists fret that state aid is delaying the necessary restructuring of European industry, and so harming the region's overall competitiveness. Scarce resources are being wasted on bailing out lame ducks instead of being invested in companies with brighter futures, they say. Many governments accept this analysis, but have to tailor their policies to take account of political realities. Ending subsidies overnight would often lead to bankruptcies and job cuts. Most national politicians prefer to minimise opposition by phasing aid out gradually. The pressure to compromise is particularly strong in sectors such as airlines, steel and coal, which are often seen as strategically important. The French government, for example, had to abandon its original restructuring plan for Air France last autumn after workers went on strike. The new plan is a softer version, which involves only 5,000 redundancies out of a total workforce of 42,000 - all of them voluntary. Even the UK, which has taken the toughest line against state aid, was forced last year to offer subsidies to its coal industry, after a revolt by members of parliament over plans to close most of the country's pits. In the steel sector, Spain decided to provide Ecu2.8bn in subsidies to state-owned CSI in order to save jobs in the politically explosive Basque region. Similarly, Germany gave Ecu428m in aid to Ekostahl rather than close eastern Germany's only large steel mill. Although the Commission has the power to order governments to stop subsidies, it too has to take account of political considerations. Officials fear that an uncompromising crackdown could provoke a public backlash, with Brussels being blamed for bankruptcies and job losses. Some believe too harsh a line could also destabilise member states. 'Can you say that fairness must be considered more important than public order, terrorism and the stability of institutions?' asks one official. Mr Robert Coleman, head of the Commission's transport directorate, points out that the Treaty of Rome does not ban aid totally. Subsidies may be sanctioned so long as they are in the Union's 'common interest', something the Commission has discretion in defining. 'The Commission has a juridico-political judgment to make. It is not a mathematical exercise,' he says. Nevertheless, the Commission's overall aim is to curb state aid. Since the mid-1980s, a succession of competition commissioners - first Mr Peter Sutherland, then Sir Leon Brittan and now Mr Van Miert - has progressively tightened policy. They have put a greater emphasis on monitoring aid flows. The Commission produced its first catalogue of subsidies in 1989. It has also established special task forces to monitor aid in Italy and eastern Germany, because of the size of the problem in both areas. In addition, the Commission last year passed rules requiring all governments to file annual returns about the finances of their public sector companies. This is to make sure that subsidies do not sneak through without the Commission finding out. 'We are learning a lot in this way,' says Mr Van Miert. The Commission has also become more insistent that aid can be approved only if it is part of a viable restructuring plan. This accounts for much of the horse-trading between the Commission and national governments. In steel, for example, the Commission initially rejected restructuring plans for Ilva, Ekostahl and CSI. It finally agreed only after the companies promised capacity cuts to reduce their financial outlays and so increased their chances of becoming profitable in the long run. A similar process is under way with Air France and Bull. The Commission will probably approve subsidies in the end, but only if there are commitments to more radical cost-cutting than was contained in their original plans. Linked to this tougher line is a policy that groups should receive no second helpings of aid. Companies can receive one last hand-out to return them to viability but, after that, they are on their own. The doctrine, which is known as 'one time, last time', was first applied in the airline industry, when Mr Van Miert was transport commissioner. It also featured in December's steel deal, and Mr Van Miert would like to see it spread to other industries. But the policy applies only to companies which have been explicitly warned that they are receiving aid for the last time. So Sabena and Aer Lingus are covered, but not Air France. Although the French airline received capital injections from its government after the policy began, the Commission did not judge them to be subsidies at the time. It considered them normal financial transactions. This does not mean the Commission will necessarily approve the new Air France capital injection. It could object either on the grounds that the restructuring is insufficient to create a viable enterprise or that the subsidy is so large that the consequent distortion of competition is against the Union's common interest. Non-aided companies argue that the 'one time, last time' doctrine is not tough enough. BA's Mr Holmes asks: 'Why shouldn't the presumption be that Air France can cut its networks, reduce its staff and sell its hotel chain as British Airways did?' Meanwhile, British Steel wants European industry ministers to make a solemn pledge that there will be no further steel subsidies when they meet next month. This would apply not just to those companies receiving aid as part of December's deal, but the whole sector. 'The steel industry has had enough,' says Mr Moffat. Another idea is that aid should be contingent on a company being privatised. This proposal was contained in a recent report on the airline industry by a committee of 'wise men' set up to advise the Commission. Commission officials argue that they cannot formally tie aid to privatisation, since the Treaty of Rome does not allow them to discriminate between public and private ownership. But they can apply a 'premium to privatisation', because the fact that a company is being prepared for privatisation enhances the credibility of its restructuring plan. It is also the best guarantee that subsidies are being provided for the last time. Privatisation plans were taken into consideration in the steel subsidy deal. Italy pledged to privatise Ilva, while Germany and Spain promised that new investment in Ekostahl and CSI would be financed in partnership with the private sector. Similarly, the French government intends to privatise both Air France and Bull. 'The pace of privatisation is speeding up. A whole new raft of countries and industries is being prepared for privatisation,' explains Mr Oliver Letwin, a director at merchant bankers N M Rothschild. This trend suggests that state aid to public sector enterprises will eventually be brought under control. For non-aided airline and steel groups facing unfair competition from their state-owned rivals, however, that is not the way things look. But the long-run prognosis is more optimistic. Europe may be witnessing the death throes of a practice that many believe has debilitated its industry for decades.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Anti-dumping Having congratulated itself on the outcome of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations, the European Union now seems bent on thwarting by the back door the liberalisation it is intended to promote. That door has been opened by the decision of the Council of Ministers this week to make anti-dumping duties subject to approval by a simple majority of member states, instead of by a qualified majority vote. The change threatens to make it even easier for the EU to wield a protectionist weapon which it has deployed with frequency in the past decade. All the more so since Brussels plans to double its anti-dumping staff and speed up the handling of cases. Recent history does not inspire confidence that the new powers will be exercised wisely. Brussels' anti-dumping procedures are so obscure, arbitrary and elastic that they can be used to find that almost any third country exporter is guilty of 'unfair' price competition and punished accordingly. The result is huge costs to EU consumers - Pounds 1.3bn annually for consumer electronics products alone, according to Britain's National Consumer Council. The change in voting rules is unlikely to be revoked, since it was an explicit condition of France's acceptance of the Uruguay Round package. In the short term, the best hope that it will not be abused is that Sir Leon Brittan, the liberal-minded trade commissioner, will exercise restraint in proposing anti-dumping actions. However, he may not remain in his job after this year. Much stronger institutional safeguards and greater transparency are needed. Brussels has gone some way by separating investigations of alleged dumping and injury, providing more information to consumers and allowing for speedier judicial review. It needs to go further. Management of the anti-dumping division needs to be tightened. In addition, all proposed actions should be analysed by the Commission's economic and competition directorates. These analyses should be published, along with the division's own arguments and calculations. Such measures would not guarantee fairness and impartiality. But they should enable consumers, both businesses and individuals, to gauge the price they were being asked to pay - and require governments to justify it publicly.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> STREET SHRINES: The season opens today (C1 and special Baseball '90 section,  S1) but it's baseball year-round in northeast Placentia, where the streets are  named after Hall-of-Famers Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Ducky Medwick, Ted Williams,  Stan Musial, Christy Mathewson and others. . . . Baseball stars are one of the  official categories for Placentia street names, probably adopted by some  long-forgotten sports fan, said Public Works Director Bob Hodson. . . . Next:  streets named after famous athletes from Placentia, such as Olympic swimming  gold medalist Janet Evans and tennis star Michael Chang. Steve Emmons and Mark  I. Pinsky  </P></p>

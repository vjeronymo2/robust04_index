			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / British Steel shares down 10% as Pounds 55m loss is reported SHARES in British Steel fell nearly 10 per cent yesterday to their lowest level since privatisation in 1988 after the dominant UK steelmaker reported a Pounds 55m pre-tax loss and cut its final dividend from 5.75p to 1.5p per share. The announcement of British Steel's figures for the year to March 28 - the last in six turbulent years under Sir Robert Scholey's chairmanship  - was coupled with the unveiling of a big stainless steel link-up with Avesta of Sweden, creating one of the largest European producers with combined revenues of Pounds 1.2bn and 9,000 employees. The deal is one of the most important cross-border ventures aimed at reducing the European steel industry's chronic overcapacity and increasing its ability to weather recessions. It was overshadowed, however, by the extent of the profit collapse at British Steel, which had pre-tax profits of Pounds 254m in 1990-91 and record profits of Pounds 733m in 1989-90. British Steel's shares fell 6 1/2 p to close at 60 1/2 p, less than half their value at the privatisation. The Pounds 55m loss was smaller than some City analysts had predicted, and the dividend cut was widely expected after warnings from SirRobert when the company announced its half-year figures. 'I said at the interim stage that there was no sign of an upturn in our main markets, and disappointingly that still remains the case,' said Sir Robert, who retires next month and will be replaced by Sir Alastair Frame. British Steel's decline since privatisation is due to a worldwide steel recession, exacerbated by overcapacity in Europe. Prices for British Steel's products fell by an average of 8 per cent in the year ended March, and in the European Community prices have fallen by nearly 20 per cent since late 1989. The recession was the final straw for British Steel's Ravenscraig steel plant in Scotland, where steelmaking ended last week, after the collapse of the Scottish shipbuilding and motor industries which it served. Sir Robert warned that the timing of UK market recovery was uncertain and could be overshadowed by reduced demand in other main markets.

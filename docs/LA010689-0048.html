			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration, ending years of research and controversy,  issued a requirement for large air transport planes to have devices that warn a  pilot of an impending collision. All commercial jetliners with 30 or more seats  will have to have the device, known as T-CAS, by December 30, 1991. For some  time, the FAA has let it be known it was preparing such a requirement. Several  airlines have been using T-CAS units on a test basis on a smallnumber of planes  for more than a year. Transportation Secretary James H. Burley IV called  installation of the collision avoidance technology in aircraft "one of the most  significant safety initiatives in recent years."  </P></p>

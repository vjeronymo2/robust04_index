			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways lower British Airways tumbled 7 to 370p following news that USAir, in which BA has a 25 per cent stake, had run up another big loss for its third quarter and was downbeat about trading in the final three months of 1994. BA paid Dollars 400m for its stake in USAir. Yesterday's losses - Dollars 3 a share, or possibly a full dollar above analysts' projections - led the market to speculate on the possibility of BA writing off all, or part of, its investment. The combination of a weak US dollar and bearish comments from one US investment bank ensured that Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, was one of the FT-SE 100's principal casualties yesterday. The shares were down 18 in early trading and against the trend. Goldman Sachs published a research overview reiterating its negative stance on the stock and voicing concern over the long-term prospects for Wellcome's herpes franchise. Then, as it was noted that the dollar was continuing its weak trend, the shares slid further with the market to close 24 lower at 627p on desultory turnover. Elsewhere in the sector SmithKline Beecham was affected by a Sunday newspaper report that the US Food and Drug Administration was launching an inquiry into its acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager DPS. The shares fell 8 1/2 to 411p. The share buy-back story, including talk of special one-off dividend payments, spilled over into the banks arena, driving stocks such as Barclays and TSB sharply higher. Barclays raced up to 585p early in the session, as the stories took hold, but later fell sharply to close unchanged on balance at 572p after the bank poured cold water on the suggestions. The bank said it would require shareholder authority for such a move. Turnover in Barclays reached a hefty 8.1m shares. TSB, which already has shareholder authority to buy in its own shares, edged up 3 1/2 to 224 1/2 p. Life assurance stocks marked time ahead of an announcement from the Securities and Investment Board, expected this afternoon, regarding compensation for the victims of miss-selling of policies by life assurance salesmen. Scottish and Newcastle and Whitbread stood out in a dull market, although the failure of the Lazard Brewers Investment Trust new issue came too late to affect sentiment in the sector. The merchant bank said applications for less than 10m units had been received - out of 215m on offer - and the issue, aimed at investment in UK regional brewers, will not go ahead. Bass ended 4 lower at 530p. In low activity, S&amp;N and Whitbread, the two brewers felt to be at the forefront of any industry rationalisation, rose 6 to 521p and 5 to 552p. Stores group Marks &amp; Spencer added 4 1/2 at 425 1/2 p after Hoare Govett underlined its enthusiastic stance at its morning meeting. It believes interim profits in early November will show an increase of around 9 per cent from last year's Pounds 312.7m and pointed out the bottom line benefits of M&amp;S trading on the four Sundays before Christmas. Rank Organisation edged up 2 to 415p ahead of expected good third quarter results from Xerox Corporation on Thursday and market confidence in a favourable trading statement from the UK's leading leisure group on Friday. Filtronic Comtek, which designs and manufactures components for mobile telephones, put up a good performance on its stockmarket debut, the shares, offered for sale at 105p, opened at 108p and progressed to 119p before settling at 113p.

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Record company case goes to US Phonogram UK, the record distributor, yesterday switched from the UK to US courts its legal dispute with American Recordings over the distribution of albums by artists including Johnny Cash, John Mason writes. Phonogram, a subsidiary of PolyGram, the music and film group, had been seeking a High Court injunction to block American Recordings from dealing with other distributors for its sales of its artist's records outside the US. It claims that American has violated a joint venture agreement in which Phonogram was named as sole distributor for American's artists outside the US. At the start of yesterday's hearing the company said that it was dropping its British action and launching a multi-million dollar claim for punitive damages in the US. The action in the US also seeks to restrain American from entering into a distribution agreement with any other company until the dispute is resolved. The action is a counter-suit to a Dollars 14m (Pounds 9m) action already brought against Phonogram by American in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The US label has said that Phonogram did not abide by the terms of the joint venture agreement.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Insurers admit role in pension fears survey Two of the UK's leading life insurers have admitted to MPs that they took part in the pilot survey which sparked public concern about the mis-selling of personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes. TSB Life and Standard Life responded to a letter from the Commons social security committee by saying that theirs were among the files examined by accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick. This is the first official confirmation from any of the 61 survey participants. The study, published in December, concluded that in nine out of 10 pension transfer cases no evidence could be found that sales agents had met regulators' requirements. Regulators have emphasised that the findings of the KPMG study were representative of the industry as a whole, but companies have still been unwilling to reveal their participation. As part of the committee's inquiry into aspects of personal pensions, Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, had written to seven leading life companies asking if they had been included in the report. After originally refusing to answer the question, Lloyds Abbey Life backed away from a clash with the committee saying it had not taken part. Prudential and Pearl Assurance have also said their files were not in the survey. The other two companies - Legal &amp; General and Allied Dunbar - have so far failed to give information on the query. Although their replies did not anger MPs - as the letter from Lloyds Abbey Life did - the committee is still likely to pursue the issue. Its determination to discover who took part in the study stemmed from concern about the basis of the survey. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, which commissioned the survey, has refused to say who the participants were. The committee will begin evidence-taking sessions after Easter, and will hear at an early stage from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. It has not yet decided which life companies to summon as witnesses. Pension transfers have also arisen in the context of the Treasury committee's inquiry into financial regulation. Commons select committees have wide-ranging powers to call for persons, papers and records. Labour has chosen the private pensions sector as the subject for a full-day debate in the Commons next Wednesday.</p>

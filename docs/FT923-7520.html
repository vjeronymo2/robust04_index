			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A SQUEEZE late in the day led to a firm finish for stock index futures after a volatile session characterised by thin trading, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,381 before moving forward to 2,384 within minutes of the opening. However, the upward momentum failed to hold as dealers focused on falls in gilts and short sterling, together with the negative CBI retail trades survey. This sent the contract falling to 2,362 by mid-morning. After a bout of sideways trading over the lunch-time period, a squeeze developed in the September future, helping it to rally from the earlier fall, with demand said to have been led by buying from Salomon Brothers. The firm early showing by Wall Street sent September further forward before it tailed off just before the close on profit-taking. September ended at 2,389, just one below Friday's close and around two points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover at 8,335 was poor. Traded options were dull, with volume totalling 24,341 lots. The FT-SE 100 option had 7,125 contracts dealt. Fisons was the most active stock option on 2,682 lots, with the 180 calls the busiest series.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Observer: Translation 'Internationalisation' has been a wildly popular word in Japan these last few years - particularly among leading companies which have been keen to appoint a vice-president for dealing with all things and people foreign. Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading house at the centre of the Mitsubishi group, yesterday went one better, choosing a Harvard-educated 'internationalist', Minoru Makihara, 62, as its president. Makihara, who joined Mitsubishi's marine products division in 1956, worked in London for eight years and, more recently and probably more importantly for a Japanese trading house, has spent the past few years in the US, serving as resident senior managing director. Having headed a Japanese chamber of commerce in New York, Makihara has a proven record as a man with whom US companies can deal. And while Japanese executives are often reluctant to voice opinions on matters of international controversy, there will clearly be an important role for a corporate spokesman whose sometimes ironic thoughts will not need translation for Washington's benefit.</p>

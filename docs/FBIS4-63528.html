			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ukraine's Security Service Against </F> Ukraine's State Independence?"]    [Text] Head of the political association "Ukraine's State  Independence" [DSU] Roman Koval turned to head of Ukraine's  Security Service Ye. Marchuk with an open letter. Mr. Koval  asserts that, despite the fact that his organization has been  registered by the Ministry of Justice, officials of Ukraine's  Security Service are closely "watching" DSU members: They exert  political pressure upon them, try to recruit them, and conduct  surveillance.    Therefore, in R. Koval's opinion, Ukraine's Security  Service,  in fact, drives the organization headed by him to embark upon  the road of illegal activity and extra-parliamentary struggle  for Ukrainian independence. Mr. Koval calls upon General  Marchuk to stop secret surveillance over DSU members or,  otherwise, they will have to turn to judicial bodies and sue  Ukraine's Security Service. However, if Ukraine's Security  Service opts to work for Ukraine, the DSU chairman promises it  his organization's assistance.</p>

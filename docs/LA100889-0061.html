			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOYS TOWN IS BOOMING BUT THE MESSAGE REMAINS;  </P> <P> ONE MAN'S DREAM FOR UNWANTED YOUNGSTERS NOW A NEBRASKA LANDMARK  </P> <P> The year was 1921 when a bespectacled young Irish priest used his meager  savings to buy a 160-acre farm outside Omaha.  </P> <P> After the final papers were signed on a crisp October morning, a group of  homeless boys packed their scant belongings and headed 10 miles west of the  city to their new home.  </P> <P> Theirs was a strangely moving procession. Two trucks loaded with worn furniture  crept at the front. In their wake, under the expansive Nebraska skies, trudged  125 ill-clad youths pushing wheelbarrels and carrying suitcases. Along Dodge  Street and past the city limits they plodded.  </P> <P> By sunset the scraggly paraders had bedded down in the "mecca of their dreams."  Overlook Farm had everything: rolling grasslands, barns, chicken coops, a  cattle shed, even an ice house. No matter that they bunked in concrete-floored  wooden barracks, heated by corncob-fed potbelly stoves.  </P> <P> These boys and their leader -- the charismatic Father Edward J. Flanagan --  were about to build a "City of Little Men." Before long it would become,  simply, Boys Town, the home for youths no one wanted.  </P> <P> Now, years later, Boys Town has become a tourist attraction.  </P> <P> In December, 1917, Father Flanagan had opened the doors of a large Omaha  rooming house to his first wards: three newsboys and two boys living in the  streets. Those were difficult days. The harried priest had to borrow $90 for  the first rent. Three months later the house overflowed with 50 street kids.  </P> <P> Although Overlook Farm provided space to grow in, Father Flanagan remained in  need of funds. In 1922 he organized a traveling minstrel show. Fifteen boys,  billed as the "World's Greatest Juvenile Entertainers," toured Nebraska towns  in four secondhand circus wagons. Wearing cutoff World War I uniforms, they  sang their hearts out.  </P> <P> The Boys Town of today would almost certainly cause its emotional, soft-hearted  founder to weep for joy.  </P> <P> A mini-metropolis stretching over 1,300 acres, it contains 98 buildings,  including a post office, a dairy and horse farm, a greenhouse, a police  department, a field house, an auditorium, schools and 70 living units -- home  to more than 500 troubled boys and girls who have been abused or neglected.  Girls have been admitted to Boys Town since 1979.  </P> <P> A married couple, called "family teachers," leads each home of six to eight  youngsters aged 8 to 19. The youths cook, sew, do their own laundry, shop and  plan menus, and learn social skills and how to communicate. Most stay about two  years.  </P> <P> Now a National Historic Landmark, Boys Town has through the years provided  shelter for more than 16,000 young people. It is one of Nebraska's foremost  tourist attractions, displaying its good work to about 100,000 visitors a year.  </P> <P> I find myself revisiting Boys Town almost like a retreat, seeking once again  the farm's simple serenity and sense of mission. The lovely landscape is  permeated by a bucolic sense of peace.  </P> <P> Perhaps it is the abiding presence of Father Flanagan that makes the prairie  air so radiant. Flanagan died of a heart attack in 1948 at age 62 while in  Berlin on a mission for former President Harry S. Truman. He was seeking  remedies for Europe's displaced children.  </P> <P> Visitors stroll the priest's former residence, explore the Hall of History  museum, pause before the symbolic statue of a youth hoisting a small boy on his  back, and stop at the Vocational Career Center, where 17 trades are taught.  </P> <P> On campus, the legendary Father Flanagan lived most of his adult years in a  modest red-brick house with his sister Nellie. She was her brother's personal  adviser and surrogate mother, as well as a warm and giving homemaker to the  boys.  </P> <P> The Flanagan house still retains its aura of warmth. Upstairs, Father  Flanagan's cassock, cape and white-laced surplice rest on his bed. In Nellie's  room, her wicker chair, sewing machine and personal items are arranged as if by  Nellie herself.  </P> <P> In the study downstairs sits a six-foot inlaid desk of 39 types of wood. Boys  from one of the manual training classes made the desk for Father Flanagan. They  began the tedious task of fitting together thousands of pieces of wood in 1936,  taking three years to complete.  </P> <P> Les Dreifuerst, former youth counselor and longtime guide at Father Flanagan's  residence, remembers the man whose dream is now a legacy.  </P> <P> "The father was full of life," Dreifuerst recalls. "Typically Irish, he flared  up if kids got into mischief, especially the big ones. But with little guys, he  was a bleeding heart."  </P> <P> The spirit of the young people who have lived in the home is mostly alive in  the Hall of History museum. In the foyer, newspaper headlines dramatically  describe the plight of unwanted children in the early 1900s: "Children Living  With Pigs," "Boy Tramps Found Worthless Lot," "Parent Would Pawn Boy and Girl  for $300."  </P> <P> Against this attention-getting backdrop, a lifesize figure of Father Flanagan  stands with an arm around the shoulders of a boy wearing tattered pants and a  raggedy sweater.  </P> <P> In the museum, exhibits depict scores of people associated with the City of  Little Men, from President Truman and actor Mickey Rooney to comic strip  characters Joe Palooka and Captain Marvel.  </P> <P> An attraction is the Academy Award won by Spencer Tracy for his portrayal of  Father Flanagan in the 1938 movie, "Boys Town." After the film was completed,  it was shelved for several months, with Louis B. Mayer, MGM president,  insisting, "It will never sell, there's no sex!"  </P> <P> Visitors also will see scenes from "Boys Town," as well as from two other  motion pictures about Boys Town. In addition, home movies about campus life in  the early 1960s are shown.  </P> <P> Throughout the Hall of History, moving mannequin displays tell the story of  Father Flanagan and his boys. One display depicts a runaway boy sleeping in a  cardboard storage box; pressing a nearby button elicits the story of Billy's  life in the streets.  </P> <P> Another display shows three early Overlook Farm boys shooting marbles, one of  the few leisure activities the priest could afford for his tatterdemalion  brigade in the early years. He once sadly said: "Some of the finest people in  the world go through life handicapped because they never learned how to play as  children."  </P> <P> The museum's crimson circus wagon is a reminder of those first minstrel shows  and boy soprano voices.  </P> <P> Also on exhibit is the front half of the old school bus that used to carry Boys  Town football teams to games. By entering and honking the horn, you can start a  film of the football games. In the 1940s, Boys Town football teams rolled over  opponents across the country.  </P> <P> Museum displays also introduce today's family living program. "My Room" is an  exhibit showing a typical corner of a young resident's room: a desk, a closet  full of clothes and a bureau with a mirror. Look into the mirror. You see  yourself. But the mirror "talks" at the push of a button above it. Alternating  girls' and boys' voices tell their stories:  </P> <P> "This is my room at Boys Town. I didn't always live here, but my parents used  to fight a lot and sometimes they hit me. I've run away. In my room I study and  pray and take care of my clothes and work on projects I like to do. Sometimes I  get lonely. We come from places like your hometown and your neighborhood. We  could even be you."  </P> <P> A Hall of History tour ends quietly with a brief videotaped message from the  current director, Father Val Peter, quoting from Father Flanagan: "The work  will continue, you see, whether I am there or not, because it is God's work,  not mine."  </P> <P> A fitting end to a Boys Town visit is the Dowd Memorial Chapel and Father  Flanagan Shrine, where a marble and bronze vault contains the beloved priest's  tomb. Embossed on the tomb are the Irish leader's most famous words: "There are  no bad boys. There is only bad environment, bad training, bad example, bad  thinking."  </P> <P> Boys Town is about 10 miles west of Omaha on U.S. 6 (Dodge Street). A visit  should begin at the Visitors Center, which, along with the Hall of History and  Father Flanagan's residences, is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., except  Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Day and Good Friday afternoon. Dowd  Memorial Chapel is open daily.  </P> <P> Self-conducted tours of Boys Town can be taken all year. The Visitors Center  has maps and tape recordings explaining what to do and see on campus.  </P> <P> Personally guided tours by Boys Town teen-agers are available hourly from the  Visitors Center in June, July and August, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. All Boys  Town attractions, including tours, are free.  </P> <P> Points of interest include the Music Hall, which houses band and choir practice  rooms; the Boys Town High School and Wegner Middle School; the Field House,  which has a trophy case near the entrance; the Roe Garden, adjacent to the  Father Flanagan House, plus the Vocational Career Center, Dairy Farm and Hall  of History.  </P> <P> The Boys Town choir sings on Sunday at the Dowd Chapel 10:30 a.m. mass. There  are also masses at 8 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. Protestant services begin at 9:15 a.m.  at the Nativity Chapel.  </P> <P> The Visitors Center has a cafeteria (open Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to  1:30 p.m.), souvenirs and a display of stamps and coins. The most unusual item  is a 600-pound solid ball of stamps that has been featured in Ripley's Believe  It or Not. The ball is 32 inches in diameter and consists of 4,655,000 used  stamps. Nine boys constructed it in 1974. It took them nine months.  </P> <P> For more information on Boys Town, write to Father Flanagan's Boys Home, Boys  Town, Neb. 68010, or call the Visitors Center at (402) 498-1140.  </P></p>

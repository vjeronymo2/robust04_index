			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / MP says nearly 2m voters 'missing' AS MANY as one in 10 eligible voters could be missing from electoral registers, MPs were told yesterday. Mr Harry Barnes, Labour MP for Derbyshire North East, made the claim as he failed to secure a second reading for his Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, seeking to adapt the registration process and increase the powers of electoral officers. Mr Barnes said official figures indicated that about 1.9m people, equivalent to 5 per cent of eligible voters, were not registered. But inaccurate entries for people who had moved or died masked the possibility that twice that number could be missing. He blamed a range of factors including the poll tax. Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office minister, said the government agreed with the bill's objectives but could not support it because it had come a year too early. He stressed that five working groups of Home Office officials and electoral registration officers had begun consultations on all aspects of the existing system. Defending government efforts to maximise registration, he said 'we have estimated registration levels of about 95 per cent and every year about Pounds 40m is spent in England and Wales on registration'. The bill failed to gain a second reading after only 78 MPs - fewer than the 100 required - voted for a closure motion to end the debate. No MPs voted against the closure.</p>

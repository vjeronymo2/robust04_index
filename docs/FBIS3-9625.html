			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Text of speech by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy </F> Zlenko at the Eastern Studies Center in Warsaw on 22  March--furnished by the Polish Foreign Ministry]    [Text] Dear Mr. Director! Ladies and Gentlemen!    First of all, I want to thank you for the honor of being  able  to speak at your center, which has gained worldwide recognition  as an institution whose analyses, advice, and forecasts are  attentively listened to, not just in Poland but also beyond its  borders.    So I expect my speech to contribute to a better  understanding  of concepts that are the current guidelines for the Ukrainian  Government in its hard work aimed at strengthening a sovereign  Ukraine in European international relations, and also that it  will contribute to a better understanding of our approach to  contemporary political realities.    The restitution of the Ukrainian state, as the two years of  its independent existence have shown, is taking place under  extremely complicated external and domestic conditions. To a  great extent, these conditions are a consequence of historical  eruptions that took place in Europe in the late 1980's and early  1990's. Unfortunately, our expectations of speedy reforms and  the unconditional acceptance of Ukraine into the European  community of nations did not materialize. Also, our  expectations of speedy assistance on the part of Western  countries came across the fact that these countries, while  undergoing serious crises in their own economies, were not able  to come up with sufficient resources to support young and  independent states, including Ukraine. It is also true that it  would be a mistake not to see some prejudices and old-fashioned  stereotypes in the politics of some countries.    It was also difficult to predict that, along with the  elimination of military and political confrontation between the  two blocs, the world is not going to become a safer place, and  the degree of predictability with regard to individual  countries' behavior will not increase at all.    Bloody conflicts are going on in various regions of the  globe, which require much effort and many resources on the part  of developed countries and the entire international community.  International organizations whose goal was to maintain and  assure peace are faced with new and unexpected challenges that  force the world to change its approach to many problems that  have, so far, not been unequivocally resolved.    Ukraine does not exist in a vacuum, nor is it isolated from  the world and these events. The complexity of the new situation  in Europe and around the world required a constant search for  ways of maneuvering so as to lead the country through the  underwater reefs that emerge at points of disagreement among the  countries of the world, as well as at points where different and  sometimes contradictory interests and trends cross one another.    There are also many specific domestic factors that do not  make our situation any easier. You are aware, ladies and  gentlemen, that Ukraine inherited, as a legacy of the former  USSR, an industry that is oriented primarily to the production  of products of the military-industrial complex, and also morally  exploited technologies, completely amortized industrial  equipment, the enormous burden of the Chernobyl disaster, as  well as many other problems, the overcoming of which would be  difficult for even the world's most developed countries. A  whole list of objective and subjective reasons also led to a  decline in production and a rise in inflation. Within the  complicated economic situation, a constant shaping of Ukraine's  internal political system is taking place. Currently, as never  before, we are radically feeling the need for cardinal changes  in the activities of the legislative, executive, and judicial  branches. Of course, under conditions where mistakes simply  cannot be avoided, many people find it hard to resist the  temptation of making political capital. At the same time,  representatives of a whole range of organizations, parties, and  movements have been using the most disgraceful of methods:  preying on national and religious feelings, applying completely  unmotivated incitements to strike, and cultivating separatist  ideas.    But the Ukrainian nation and Government have already made  the final choice. While not paying attention to any kind of  obstacles, we will persistently follow the path of a return to  all-human values, the creation of a state based on law, and the  guaranteeing of human rights and freedoms; it is the path of  democracy and economic transformations, a rebirth of Ukrainian  culture with simultaneous legal guarantees of maintaining the  independence of all national and ethnic minorities living in  Ukraine.    The fundamental principle of securing state independence and  political sovereignty has been the basis for Ukraine's foreign  policy doctrine from the very beginning. As one of the founding  members of the United Nations, Ukraine declared its desire to  shape and develop its relations with other countries in  accordance with the UN Charter, decisions contained in the Final  Act of the Helsinki Conference, the Paris Charter for New  Europe, and other CSCE documents. Nonconditional observance of  generally recognized norms of international law and  nonapplication of any means of pressure or dictate whatsoever in  international relations, acquired special importance in  Ukraine's foreign policy.    Taking the aforementioned principles as the basis, we wanted  Ukraine's entry onto the international scene as a sovereign  country to take place in the "softest" way possible, without  interfering with relationships and connections existing in the  international community. At the same time, Ukraine, due to many  factors and reasons and aware of its role in the world, intends  to achieve the place it rightly deserves among European  countries. I would like our fundamental and priority-based  approach to be well understood: Ukraine is an inherent and  inseparable part of Europe, and that fact determines the  philosophy and direction of our ideas on Ukraine's place and  role in the contemporary world. Precisely because of that,  overcoming the artificial separation of Ukraine from Europe, as  well as overcoming the barriers which continue to exist and  divide our not-too-big continent, is one of the most significant  tasks of our independent policy. The policy is aimed at  securing certain guarantees of Ukraine's external security,  using experiences acquired by European democracies in the area  of building a democratic society of law and order which would be  an inseparable part of European political, legal, economic,  material, and spiritual culture.    A return to the practice of bilateral relations with other  countries after a break of 70 years, is a fact which cannot be  overestimated from the standpoint of building an independent and  democratic Ukraine. At the same time, we view the European  region as a whole, and as a common home for all nations and  countries which live here. The full integration of Ukraine into  all-European political, economic, cultural, and other kinds of  associations, is our final goal.    It is quite a natural thing that neighboring countries are  of  primary importance in that activity. That is why the fact that  Russia, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, Moldova, the Slovak Republic,  and Romania are our geographical neighbors, requires working out  precisely this kind of policy, that is one of approaching them  as neighbors with whom one wants to see peaceful coexistence,  cooperation, and mutual respect. That is an objective reality  and must be perceived precisely in that context.    Speaking about bilateral relations, I would like to discuss  separately Ukraine's relations with the Republic of Poland. We  remember and we highly appreciate the fact that your country was  the first foreign country to have recognized Ukraine's  independence. After Ukraine gained its independence, relations  between our two countries, which have a balance of common,  European interests as their basis, entered a qualitatively new  stage and right now we are fully entitled to describe them as  relations of a strategic partnership. The decision to establish  a Consultative Committee of the Presidents of Ukraine and the  Polish Republic, which was made during the visit of Polish  President L. Walesa to Ukraine, is proof that Poland also treats  Polish-Ukrainian relations in an appropriate manner. The  committee's activity includes analyzing and preparing proposals  concerning a wide variety of issues which emerge in relations  between Ukraine and Poland, as well as problems of the Central  and East European region and international politics.    Ukraine is a European country and in its desire to integrate  with European political and economic structures in the most  natural way possible, it is condemned to the necessity of  developing multifaceted relations with European countries, with  economically developed ones as priority, whose assistance  Ukraine counts on in the current period, which is very  complicated from the standpoint of making our economic and  political independence permanent.    The development of relations with Western European countries  creates the necessary conditions for resuming Ukraine's  political, economic, cultural, and spiritual ties with European  civilization, as well as for speeding up the democratization  process, the implementation of market reforms, and nursing the  national economy back to health. At the same time, such  cooperation will become a basis for widening Ukraine's  participation in European structures and for the future  integration of the Ukrainian economy into the European and world  economic area.    Access to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean determines  other priorities in the area of regional cooperation, first of  all with countries enjoying some authority, primarily with  Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria.    Our country attaches great importance to the development of  mutually beneficial and effective bilateral relations with  countries of the Asian and Pacific region which, due to its  extremely high rate of economic and social development by a  majority of countries in the region, has quite correctly been  called the "region of the 21st century."    The process of a practical shaping of partnership relations  between Ukraine and countries of the Asian and Pacific region,  has already begun and it is bringing results which can be felt  as time passes--that is demonstrated first of all by the results  of last year's official visits to Ukraine by state and  government delegations (including at the highest level) from  India, the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, and other  countries.    But it is with the year 1994 that we associate our special  hopes linked to the implementation of enormous prospects for  Ukraine's cooperation with countries of the Asian and Pacific  region. Our relations of mutual understanding and cooperation  with Japan and also with North and South Korea, are beginning to  take the desired course.    We regard the development of relations with countries of the  Near and Middle East, as well as Africa, as one of the most  important directions of Ukrainian foreign policy; these  countries are gradually becoming our economic partners. The  official visits by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to Egypt,  Israel, and the Republic of Tunisia, are proof of our intentions  and readiness to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with  the countries of these regions.    Our relations with the United States in military and  political areas, are valuable to us; this applies in particular  to common security and disarmament. But the priority nature of  these relations is not just a consequence of that: Currently,  economic cooperation with that huge country is important to  Ukraine.    As for our relations with Russia, they remain the main  priority in Ukraine's relations with the outside world, and this  is the way they will remain in the predictable future. Russia  is our most important neighbor. Our approach to the development  of these relations is defined in detail in "The Main directions  of Ukrainian Foreign Policy." We understand that Russia is a  special kind of partner to us and that is why we regard our  relations as those of a special partnership. Of course, there  are also many problems in the development of our relations, as  we have seen during 1993, these problems were first of all  caused by the fact that issues linked to the collapse of the  former Soviet Union continue to be unresolved. This applies in  particular to the problem of legal continuity, the property of  the former USSR, as well as some others. Some constructive  measures have been undertaken in that regard in the recent time  period. We have always been saying--and we will continue to do  so--that Ukraine is open to any proposals which would not  conflict with our national interests, and these are the  realities of our approach to the development of relations with  Russia.    We believe that compromises are certainly important;  however, they must correspond to the fundamental interests of  this or that state. It is understandable that the internal  political situation that has now developed in Russia compels us  to make some reflections. It may be necessary to work in not  very favorable conditions; however, this will not change our  view that we must work. We are ready for such work. I would  like to emphasize once again, however, that real achievements in  the development of Ukrainian-Russian relations may be made only  if every political decision takes into account, to the maximum  degree possible, the interests of both parties. Vital is the  good will of both partners; the Ukrainian side exhibits such a  good will.    In the situation which has now developed in Russia and some  other states of the CIS, also due to the conflicts which pose a  real threat to peace and stability not only on the territory of  the former Soviet Union, but also in all of East Europe, one can  say that the 52 million Ukrainians are able to play and are  already playing a serious stabilizing role throughout the  post-Soviet areas. Therefore, one of our main priorities is  supporting the process of strengthening stability and security,  both in Europe and in our regional relations.    Being aware of the importance of both regional and national  activities for strengthening the stability and security in  Europe, Ukraine confirmed its devotion to these goals by firmly  starting along the road to achieving the status of a nonnuclear  state. This is proven by the signing on 14 January of the  well-known Trilateral Declaration by the presidents of Ukraine,  the United States, and Russia, as well as the recent decision by  the Supreme Council of Ukraine canceling the reservations  included in the resolution on the ratification of START I. This  exceptionally important decision paves the way for the practical  implementation of the program of the gradual nuclear disarmament  of Ukraine, as well as renders the overall situation in Europe  and in the world more stable and predictable.    Considering the principle of the indivisibility of  international peace and security to be one of our main guides,  in our foreign policy we defend the approach of "security for  ourselves through security for everyone." Considering this  principle to be the motto of contemporary European international  relations, it is with particular responsibility that we approach  one of the most important elements of the situation in Europe  today--the ability of each European state, including those  called "new democracies," not only to seek, but also create  security.    In this context, the role of Ukraine, as we understand it,  is  tremendously important because, as a consequence of Ukraine's  regaining its statehood in Europe, a radically new geopolitical  situation has developed.    The establishment of a potentially powerful state, located  in  the geographical center of Europe, and its entry into the  European community without any conflict should play a  stabilizing role. Such a role certainly corresponds to the  principles of Ukraine's foreign policy. Our diplomatic efforts  concentrate on establishing and strengthening stable  international mechanisms of security on the bilateral,  subregional, regional, and global level. This task is rather  difficult and it must be resolved in not-very-favorable  surroundings, because when new independent states appeared,  whose national interests have not been established and agreed  upon yet, the old structural mechanisms, supporting stability  and security, were practically destroyed. This produced the  effect of the so-called security vacuum, which was felt by  practically all the new democracies. Old threats and dangers  were replaced by new ones.    Bearing the above-mentioned facts in mind, Ukraine launched  an initiative to create a zone of stability and security in  Central and East Europe. This idea is to a certain extent  convergent with the approach which was once proposed by Polish  President L. Walesa, and then also by French Prime Minister E.  Balladur. The most important element in our approach is that  stability and instability cannot coexist for a long time without  conflict. The stability of "traditional Europe" is supposed to  become the stability of "the new Europe." Each participant  should make serious efforts so that this can be achieved.    Since the confrontation of military blocks in Europe has  ceased to exist, especially important becomes the issue of  establishing an all-European security structure on the basis of  existing international organizations, such as CSCE, NATO,  Council of North Atlantic Cooperation, and the Western European  Union. We are convinced that only the direct membership of  Ukraine in such a structure will provide it with indispensable  guarantees of its national security.    An important role in the strengthening of security in the  CSCE region is played by NATO. Ukraine actively participates in  the activities of its new organ--the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council, the establishment of which was indisputably a logical  and bold step. However, time is running out. Present-day  challenges call for a new look at the concept of the activities,  the role, and the place of NATO in Europe. A significant step  in this direction was the acceptance of the "Partnership for  Peace" program at the NATO summit in January. Ukraine expressed  its readiness for active cooperation with NATO within this  program, and I myself have recently had the honor to place my  signature on the "Partnership for Peace" framework document.  Thus, our country was the first CIS state to join this program.  It was with understanding that Ukraine responded to this  initiative, as one that does not introduce any new lines of  division in Europe, leaves an open door to NATO, and is an  instrument for gradually extending this organization for the  purpose of shaping a new security system in Europe. At the same  time we believe that it is extremely important and indispensable  to resolve the problem of NATO's continuing search for its new  role in the process of building the European security system and  the problem of the organization's overcoming its "identity  crisis" in the contemporary, postconfrontation Europe.    Certainly the issue of ensuring stability and security in  the  new Europe is multidimensional and complex. It comprises  elements of a military-political nature, as well as economic,  social, cultural, humanitarian, and other areas. We understand  that in all those directions, we must face very difficult tests.  We also understand that the main burden of passing from the  communist model of development to the European, democratic model  will have to be carried by ourselves. At the same time, we  expect that the importance of the tasks that we must face will  encourage all of Europe to give some thought to the current  situation and to understand the significance of uniting their  efforts in the work of building a more secure and flourishing  new Europe.    Economic relations, both bilateral and multilateral, with  European countries are of tremendous importance to us. As we  worked on the concept of Ukraine's regional cooperation, we bore  in mind the obvious necessity of "economizing" our contacts,  increasing the commercial-economic aspect of Ukraine's  participation in regional organizations. Only this road will be  able to lead us to effective implementation of economic  transformations of the country and to the transition to the  market economy. Ukraine's firm goal is the development and  deepening of comprehensive cooperation with the EC and gradual  integration into the Pan-European economic zone. Right now we  still need aid and support from the European Union and leading  European financial establishments.    We are aware of the fact that the full incorporation of  Ukraine in the contemporary all-European process in all its  dimensions calls for some time, considerable efforts, and an  open request on the part of all the interested parties. We  speak about the latter firmly and openly, taking into  consideration our real possibilities and the results of the  lasting integration of the economic and social systems within  the former Soviet Union and the Council for Economic Mutual  Assistance.    I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Ukraine  not only wants to be incorporated into the integration processes  in the West, but it also supports real, new integration  processes in the East. It is most important to abandon, within  those integration processes, the centralized system of  controlling the economy, and to strengthen qualitatively new  relations that are mutually favorable and effective.    Right now in Ukraine, active preparations are under way for  the adoption of a new constitution; soon we will hold  practically the first democratic elections to the organs of the  legislative authorities. A general strategy of the country's  economic and political development is being defined. Despite  great difficulties, fundamental elements of democracy and a  socially oriented market economy are taking root in our social  life. Moreover, Ukraine managed to maintain the most important  things: peace and social, civic, and ethnic order.    Today we can say with full responsibility that there is no  alternative to democracy and economic reform for Ukraine. In  the future, we see Ukraine as a democratic state with equal  rights in a united Europe. We expect you to actively support  this historical striving of ours.    Thank you for your attention.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Congress endorses Zedillo Mexico's Congress formally appointed Mr Ernesto Zedillo president-elect yesterday, preparing the way for his assumption of power on December 1. After long and tense negotiations, the centre-right National Action party (PAN) finally abstained and the centre-left Democratic Revolutionary party voted against ratifying the presidential election. PAN said the election had not been fair and just, and thus could not endorse the result. The leftist PRD said the election was invalidated by widespread fraud.</p>

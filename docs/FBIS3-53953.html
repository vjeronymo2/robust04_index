Stressing the role of the media, especially radio and  television, in informing and enlightening society and  maintaining the people's presence and involvement in the fields  of reconstruction, he said: Broadcasting the facts about our  Islamic society by the mass media encourages our people and  instils despair in the enemies and opponents of the Islamic  revolution.    Referring to the negative propaganda of our enemies against  the Islamic system, the president said: The enemies of the  Islamic Republic by making use of their propaganda media have  always tried to portray the ability of the revolution in  reconstruction and the administration of the affairs of society  as weak and inadequate. However, the facts of the past few years  and the important steps which have been taken in reconstruction  and in the comprehensive development of the country have  demonstrated that the enemies have been defeated in this battle  too.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani described the truthfulness,  reliability, interest, and realism of the media as the reasons  for winning the trust of the people. Emphasizing the need for  maintaining and strengthening this important asset, he said: The  Voice and Vision as the greatest publicity media, through  necessary vigilance and understanding and timely and correct  analysis of the special tricks and policies of the enemies,  should choose the appropriate methods for confronting all this  hostile propaganda. Thus, while it carries out its mission to  inform the public it will also establish a close relationship  with the people.    Expressing his satisfaction with the achievements and  valuable services of the Voice and Vision at different junctures  of the Islamic revolution, especially its role in maintaining  the preparedness, steadfastness, enthusiasm, and mobilization of  society during the period of holy defense [Iran-Iraq war], the  president said: It is expected that, by making use of all its  publicity capabilities and facilities and its artistic  creativity, the Voice and Vision will encourage the people to  greater participation in the work of reconstruction and will  reflect the positive results of all their efforts and  achievements.    Referring to the implementation of the government's major  infrastructural plans in industrial, agricultural, development,  and cultural fields and the severance of ties of dependence in  many of those sectors, the president stated: To date, many  important and basic projects in the country, including the  construction of the biggest dams, power generators, refineries,  silos, huge oil and gas platforms, and bridges, the development  of the communication industries and transportation, the  provision of gas to towns and villages, the manufacturing of  petrochemical products, the provision of raw materials for many  domestic industries, the discovery and exploitation of mines,  and hundreds of other development projects have been implemented  by our own committed experts and capable local human resources.    He stressed that the mass media, including the Voice and  Vision, have a major role in reporting these activities to  society and should make greater efforts in this field.    The president referred to the particularly distinguished  status of the Islamic revolution in the world, and said:  Historical experiences have proved that safeguarding the  revolution is much more difficult than the achievement of its  initial triumph. In Iran the movement of the masses around the  axis of the leadership of the late imam, and the special virtues  of our people, not only made victory in military and political  wars possible, but also put the country on the right economic  course toward comprehensive growth and development.    The president added: Constructive moves by the government in  economic spheres and success in making up for earlier  underdevelopment and in repairing the damage caused by the  imposed war [with Iraq], constitute issues which have forced the  enemies to revise their attitudes and viewpoints towards the  Islamic Republic of Iran.    According to a report by a Central News Unit correspondent,  at the beginning of this meeting Mohammad Hashemi, the head of  the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting organization [IRIB]  presented a report and announced: At present, in addition to  broadcasting 40 hours per day of domestic and foreign political,  cultural, economic, and scientific news, the IRIB has an  external service which broadcasts across the globe in 19  different languages.    The IRIB head said: Due to possession of an expert workforce  with an interest in the Islamic system, the IRIB is at present  in a very good condition, in that it now plays an active role in  the global information system arena. He then referred to the  operation of the third television network and the radio news  station, as well as new efforts underway to make IRIB programs  more varied. He added: With our current active workforce, we  are also ready to establish a television news network.</p>

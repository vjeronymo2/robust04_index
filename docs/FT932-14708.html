			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / S Africa braces for violence THE African National Congress (ANC) yesterday announced that a protest campaign calling for early all-race elections would continue to the end of May. The move came as South Africa braced itself for a weekend of potential violence, with mass protests planned to mark the funeral of slain Communist party leader Chris Hani. Mr Hani's body will lie in state from tomorrow and he will be buried on Monday. Business leaders and the ruling National party immediately condemned the ANC announcement that mass action, which might include strikes, would not end after the funeral as planned. ANC leaders were seen as struggling to placate radical ANC youth, who regarded Mr Hani as a hero. A similar campaign last May led to scores of deaths in clashes with police, and between rival black groups. ANC officials said they were concerned that negotiations had so far yielded nothing concrete for their supporters. 'So far, all the negotiations have accomplished is to get Chris Hani killed,' said one ANC official, quoting a common view among angry young supporters. Meanwhile, gunmen shot and wounded a white businessmen in the Transkei black homeland, the fourth such attack in recent days. In South Africa itself, the government declared emergency measures in 19 districts including Johannesburg and drafted in police reinforcements. In these areas, police may arrest without warrant, detain without trial and impose curfews.</p>

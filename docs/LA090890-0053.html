			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT SAYS IT'S TOO EARLY TO RULE ON SURVEILLANCE ISSUE  </P> <P> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that it was premature to  decide the constitutionality of government surveillance conducted while  investigating seven Los Angeles-area Palestinians and a Kenyan, whom the  government has been attempting to deport.  </P> <P> The eight were originally charged with subversion 3 1/2 years ago, and have  been fighting deportation proceedings in U.S. Immigration Court in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Currently, two of the defendants face subversion charges, while the others are  accused of a variety of visa violations. The surveillance was conducted by a  top-secret unit of the Justice Department.  </P> <P> A federal judge had declined to hear arguments of the American Civil Liberties  Union which contended the surveillance was unconstitutional. In a 3-0 opinion,  the appellate court said, in effect, the deportation proceedings would have to  be resolved first before it could consider the surveillance issue.  </P></p>

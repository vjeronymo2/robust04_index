			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / EC near deal on protection for bank deposits EC FINANCE ministers are poised to override German objections and strike a deal today on a new Community-wide bank deposit guarantee scheme. Agreement on the EC bank deposit directive would raise the level of minimum protection to Ecu20,000 (Pounds 15,240), paving the way for similar arrangements to raise cover for investors in stocks and shares. EC officials believe a qualified majority vote in favour of the bank deposit scheme will be the most concrete result of today's meeting in Brussels. Finance ministers will discuss the recent upheaval in the ERM over lunch, but Brussels diplomats said no decisions are expected. The new EC bank directive covers deposits in EC banks denominated in EC currencies and Ecus. Member states would be free to oblige third-country banks to join the scheme, marking a further step towards completing the single European market. Germany is expected to oppose the bank deposit guarantee proposals on the grounds that a Community-wide approach could undermine its own scheme, which offers virtually unlimited protection to account-holders in the event of a bank defaulting. Germany is worried that its own privately-managed scheme would be more difficult to supervise if it has to accept members from third countries. For the UK, the scheme would raise the level of protection. Under present law, investors are offered 75 per cent protection on the first Ecu20,000 of deposits but only on sterling deposits. Under the latest proposals from the Belgian presidency, the EC would require banks to raise protection to 90 per cent on the first Ecu20,000 with a five-year transition period. The directive does not specify whether member states should introduce a public or private guarantee scheme. But it stipulates that banks must inform depositors on the level of protection. Finance ministers are today likely to give a cool reception to two European Commission proposals aimed at boosting the EC's growth initiative. One would allow the European Investment Bank to offer interest rate subsidies to medium and small businesses, the other would permit up to Ecu5bn of Community borrowing against future EC structural funds.</p>

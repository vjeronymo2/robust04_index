			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Advisers the winners in M&amp;A revival When it comes to advising on hostile takeovers, there is no question which side it pays to represent. For their work on American Home Products' uninvited run at American Cyanamid this summer, Gleacher &amp; Co, a small advisory boutique, will receive Dollars 10m. For representing the defending side - which agreed to Home Products' offer after a 14-day skirmish - Morgan Stanley and CS First Boston will be paid Dollars 47.6m between them. The fee levels agreed in extremis by besieged company bosses are often challenged later by successful acquirers. With the US takeover market just completing its most active quarter to date, however, the deal remains a clear sign that the merger and acquisition advisory business remains one of the few bright spots on Wall Street. To judge from the bald numbers, it appears that fees paid in the present takeover wave are well below the levels of the late 1980s. But anecdotal evidence such as the Cyanamid deal - and the comments of senior takeover advisers - suggests this is still a lucrative business. According to Securities Data, the average advisory fee in 1988, at the height of the last merger wave, was equivalent to 2.88 per cent of the transaction value: so far this year, it has been 1.25 per cent. The discrepancy is due largely to the absence of junk bond financing in 1990s takeovers. The underwriting fees associated with raising the debt to pay for acquisitions accounted for a large part of the money paid to investment bankers in the 1980s. Structural changes in the market could also have held down fees. Mr Felix Rohatyn, head of M&amp;A at Lazard in New York, points to 'the constantly increasing level of sophistication in the financial departments of big companies'. These companies can handle more aspects of an acquisition in-house - and when they do need to farm work out, they are more aware of fees, Mr Rohatyn says. Advisers generally say they are applying the same fee scales they have used for years, and find companies willing to pay. 'The corporate advisory part of (takeovers) is really not much different from the 1980s,' says the head of M&amp;A at one big US investment bank.</p>

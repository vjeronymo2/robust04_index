			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: How the charges at Ford come to more than Dollars 8bn FORD, the US carmaker, last night disclosed more than Dollars 8bn of one-time write-offs that it said would result in the company reporting a net loss in 1992. The first of these is a Dollars 419m after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 1992, caused by the decision to reduce Ford's European workforce by about 10,000 employees during 1993. The second charge is a Dollars 440m one-time write-off for 1992 related to the adoption of new accounting standards governing retiree benefits, which are in large part healthcare costs. A number of US companies are making such one-time accountancy-related charges. Mr Harold Poling, Ford's chairman, said these write-offs would result in a net loss from operations for the whole of 1992. Beyond these 1992 charges, Ford last night also announced a separate one-time Dollars 7.5bn write-off caused by the accounting changes on benefits and covering the period until 1992. Ford also said it would have a Dollars 685m one-time net gain related to accounting changes for income taxes. In the first nine months of 1992, the Ford group made a Dollars 681.4m net profit. The company was, however, in loss in the third quarter and has warned that it could also be in the red in the closing three months of 1992. The one-time charges and the gain disclosed yesterday, minus the net profits already earned for the first nine months, point to an after-tax loss for the whole of 1992 of nearly Dollars 7bn, a figure that could be higher if Ford suffers an operating loss in the fourth quarter. Ford incurred a loss of Dollars 2.26bn for the whole of 1991.</p>

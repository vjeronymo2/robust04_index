			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Show Boat steams into Broadway / Review of Hal Prince's production Nearly everything about Hal Prince's production of Show Boat, which opened on Broadway last Sunday, is huge: the budget, Dollars 8.5m; the cast, over 70 performers and 30 musicians; the venue, the cavernous Gershwin Theatre; the ticket prices, topping at Dollars 75, a new Broadway high; the hype, a blitz of TV, radio and print advertisements; and the expectations. With only one other major opening this autumn (Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard), New York is hungry for a hit. So why is Show Boat's emotional impact so small? The problems are not musical. With a company of marvellous voices, Prince's production is a celebration of Hammerstein and Kern's classic score which includes such favourites as 'Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man', 'Make Believe', 'You Are Love', 'Bill', and 'Ol' Man River'. This last, as sung by rich-voiced Michel Bell, brings down the house. But the production fails to disguise the musical's dramatic faults, which remain as evident on Broadway as they did at the production's opening in Toronto a year ago. Show Boat, written in 1927, follows 20 years in the lives of an extended show-business family on the Mississippi paddle-steamer, Cotton Blossom: the bickering father and mother, Cap'n Andy and Parthy Ann; their innocent daughter, Magnolia, who is swept away and eventually done wrong by the charming but raffish gambler, Gaylord Ravenal; and the boat's leading lady, Julie, who is driven off the ship when she is revealed to be of mixed race. This introduction of serious social issues - racism, gender politics, family conflict - into musical comedy was to revolutionise musical theatre. Nearly 70 years later, however, the *something in here (HP) * innovation that it triggered has left Show Boat way behind. There are levels of realistic human behaviour and dramatic resolution we have come to expect from our musicals and Show Boat simply does not deliver. Characters serve as representations of ideas rather than complex, believable people; and motivations and emotions are left troublingly unexplained - as with the show's ending, in which Magnolia takes Ravenal back, 25 years after he walked out on her, with not so much as a raised eyebrow. Prince has skilfully updated the show's treatment of race by removing references that contemporary audiences might find blatantly offensive (the first word of the show is no longer 'niggers' but 'colored folk'), while not covering up the racial inequality that was a fact in America during the time the show is set. But attempts to beef up the show's flimsy characterisation are too few. We could use many more touches like the moment added by Prince in which Julie, who disappears without explanation from the original musical, appears briefly late in the second act, washed-out and dissolute. Far from advancing plot and character, the show's few scenes of dialogue wander and drag, particularly those between John McMartin and Elaine Stritch as Cap'n Andy and Parthy Ann, who turn in the show's least convincing performances. McMartin overplays the Cap'n as an addled, fey, pathetic showman (as did Robert Morse, whom he replaced during the show's Toronto run), and Stritch's unmistakeably contemporary persona makes her presence on the Cotton Blossom a complete anachronism. The remaining central performers  -Rebecca Luker, Mark Jacoby, Dorothy Stanley, Joel Blum, and Michel Bell - are attractive and in excellent voice; buttery-voiced Lonette McKee particularly stands out as Julie. This is Prince's first production of an existing musical - he made his name with his roles in the creation of such new musicals as Sweeney Todd, Company, Phantom of the Opera and Kiss of the Spider Woman - and it is perhaps his distance from the material which has contributed to the Show Boat's stately pace and reverent tone. The few typically Princean directorial touches add welcome life: set changes are executed in full view of the audience; supernumeraries move constantly on the periphery of the action; costume and dance montages, joyfully choreographed by the ingenious Susan Stroman (Crazy for You) provide the show's most effective and entertaining moments. For those for whom price is no object, a ride on this floating musical theatre museum would surely not be a waste. The rest, be advised: the cast album, on Livent Records, costs only Dollars 11.95.</p>

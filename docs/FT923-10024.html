			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Boats for all seasons - Nick Garnett meets an old-fashioned craftsman PETER Freebody's cavernous and dusty shed on the Thames at Hurley, with its cobwebbed corners and persistent creepers poking through the wooden planking from the mass of undergrowth outside, is hardly a microcosm of anything. But in this tiny, old-fashioned corner of British industry, where Freebody makes and restores fine, hand-crafted wooden boats, the distinct whiff of Britain's recession mingles with that of the varnish his workmen use on the rich mahogany and teak decking. The hull of a 50 ft steam launch owned by businessman Peter de Savary lies forlorn in the shed, all restoration stopped by one of the most prominent but now hard-pressed entrepreneurs of the Thatcher years. The new superstructure of another launch, built in 1912 and now being re-timbered, rests in another corner; the owner, a Midlands businessman, is short of the cash to complete it. What remains of a pre-First World War racing motor-boat waits for its purchaser, an engineering company director in Wiltshire, to start producing the money for rebuilding. When well-heeled individuals feel the recessionary pinch, expensive toys usually are the first things to get the elbow. 'It's a wonder we have managed to keep our team together,' says Freebody, 57. 'Last year was very tough.' So tough that the company lost Pounds 80,000 on a yearly turnover that normally reaches about Pounds 650,000. The manual labour force has shrunk from 28 to 18. He reckons the worst is over, though, partly because he is hoping for new boat orders from at least three US businessmen. The company's habits also are changing for the better. Freebody, who clings to a rather romantic view of business life, says he appreciates the need for improved practices. 'For one thing, I have realised that our accountant has really been just an auditor. I accept that all kinds of things have to be done more professionally here in the way we cost and charge for work.' The family has built boats on the river for more than 200 years and Freebody bought the present company - near the rowing town of Henley, Berkshire - from his grandfather in 1962. But purpose-built it isn't. 'One shed, a US lend-lease one, was given to me and the other shed was bought for Pounds 500,' he says. Part of the yard's office is a former boat house and some of the roof came from an old jam factory. He will repair a leaking propellor shaft for under Pounds 100 and makes punts for just over Pounds 8,000. But he also produces marvellous Edwardian-style electric launches for perhaps Pounds 150,000, and steam launches for up to Pounds 300,000. When the Andrews yard in nearby Bourne End, which was a style leader for classic sloping-back Thames slipper stern launches, collapsed a decade ago, Freebody stepped into the breach. 'I realised there was still a market for boats like that.' A 30 ft electric-powered slipper stern that simply oozes class will cost Pounds 38,000 (excluding VAT), and a 25 ft version Pounds 27,000. The company uses Burmese teak, African and Brazilian mahogany, English oak and British Columbian pine for its vessels and builds everything from the keel up, including old-fashioned spoked steering wheels. About the only thing it does not do is the sign-writing. The yard has the kind of ambiance which, while looking efficient, entrances many a customer. It is the type of place where varnish is held in tin cans with the 'plum tomatoes' labels still attached. Last year, Freebody made a punt for Mrs Tiny Rowland, wife of Lonrho's owner, one for Virgin group tycoon Richard Branson, and two very small ones for an ornamental lake at the home of former Beatle George Harrison. Overall, though, 'it was a barren year for new boat orders.' So, much against the advice of his bank, NatWest, he kept the yard's work force busy building for stock. 'As it turned out, that has helped us keep afloat. I've sold in the last month Pounds 108,000 of vessels built for stock, though a lot of that was probably close to cost,' says Freebody. This included an eight-seater electric 'canoe' and a 30 ft launch. Last year, 60 per cent of the company's turnover came from repair work, compared with 40 per cent in normal years. Hiring out mooring space and making rope lanyards for aircraft brings in a steady Pounds 60,000 a year. Reducing the work force has eased Freebody's Pounds 250,000 wage bill. A new accountant, Aruna Boyland, says she is putting in systems to cost jobs properly, as well as setting up a proper system of billing. 'In the past,' Freebody says, 'I have asked customers how they want to pay. Perhaps I'd bill them every Pounds 4,000 or maybe every Pounds 10,000 and we'd stop work for periods if they wanted a breather.' Boyland says craftsmen there work as if it was a paid holiday rather than a proper job. The company was upset a few weeks ago when - without warning, according to Freebody - NatWest told it to start slicing its Pounds 130,000 overdraft by Pounds 1,000 a week. But Freebody has potential orders for Pounds 800,000 of new boats including those three from the US, one of them a large, Edwardian-style launch for a senior manager in Cincinnati Milacron, a machine tool company. He points out, too, that wooden launches are good value. 'They are often half the cost of a similar-sized glass fibre boat. They hold their value,' he explains. They do need revarnishing, every year, though - which costs about Pounds 1,500. What about turning to glass fibre? 'I've absolutely no need to. People are going to go back to electric, steam, and wood.' Peter Freebody, Mill Lane, Hurley, Berkshire SL6 FND. Tel: 0628-824-382.</p>

Despite disappointing results at inter-Korean contact  earlier  in the day, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci told a  press conference he doesn't "understand the talks as having  broken down."    But he was clear that exchange of envoys was the bases to  the  next high-level talks with North Korea, repeatedly referring to  the Feb. 25 "agreed conclusions" with Pyongyang with both  Washington and Pyongyang taking simultaneous steps.    Gallucci, chief U.S. negotiator to the high-level  negotiations with North Korea, had come to Seoul for  consultations on how to counter Pyongyang's nuclear situation.    He refused to speculate on what would happen if North Korea  did not meet the demand on inter-Korean envoy swap, saying only  Seoul and Washington will "deal with that when that happens."    He repeated U.S. hopes of keeping the promise of the meeting  with North Korea, leaning more toward optimism than pessimism.    "I would like to go to Geneva on March 21. I have not given  up hope that the exchange (of envoys) will take place," he told  reporters.    He foresaw even more difficult negotiations ahead in the  next  round of high-level dialogue with North Korea where he said the  United States "is willing to go beyond the nuclear issue."    "But we do that only if we reach an understanding in other  areas and move together in that direction," said Gallucci.  These other issues are what the United States "would like the  opportunity to talk with (North Korea) about."    On Feb. 25, North Korea and the United States agreed on  simultaneous steps that brought Pyongyang's nuclear problem out  of immediate crisis.    North Korea agreed to reallow International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) inspection on its declared facilities and to  resume inter-Korean dialogue.    The United States, in return, would cancel this year's  annual  military exercise "Team Spirit" held jointly with South Korea  and hold high-level dialogue with North Korea on March 21 in  Geneva.    "We made clear in the days before that understanding that  the  meeting on 21st of March was agreed on the premise...that there  would be exchange of envoys."    While not saying per se that the March 21 meeting will be  delayed if the envoy exchange is not implemented by then,  Gallucci said the envoys' cross visits were "the bases" to the  steps to be taken.    The IAEA inspection team is currently in North Korea and in  middle of its activities.    Gallucci admitted that the inspections were not going  "perfectly smoothly, that there have been differences."    But like inter-Korean dialogue, "activities are still  ongoing," said Gallucci, and the U.S. position is to wait until  the activities are concluded in full.    On possibility resuming the Team Spirit this year and  mobilizing the troops, the official said "if it became  necessary, the forces in the United States and Republic of Korea  would be able to accomplish that."</p>

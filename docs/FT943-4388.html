			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Two face satellite pirating charges Two men have been remanded in custody charged with conspiracy to defraud British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, following a police investigation into the alleged illegal sale of pirate satellite decoding cards, Raymond Snoddy writes. It is believed to be the first time the police have brought charges for such an alleged offence. Until now BSkyB, in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a stake, has used injunctions against alleged pirates. Mr Paul Richard Bridgeman and Mr Najam Butt, both of Manchester, were yesterday remanded in custody by Macclesfield magistrates for seven days. They had first appeared before magistrates at Crewe on Saturday. In an unrelated development News Datacom said it believed it had struck a blow against pirates in Ireland and a system of avoiding payment called Phoenix. The pirates have been claiming they can upgrade existing cards so they can receive all the Sky channels for the price of the cheapest subscription package. News Datacom has changed its signal to disrupt Phoenix in the continuing cat-and-mouse battle against the pirates.</p>

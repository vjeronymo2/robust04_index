			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Warrants It is difficult to know whether the recent flurry of warrants on UK equities should be taken as a sign of encouragement or as a warning. Most have been call warrants, giving investors the right to buy the underlying stock. At first glance, that does not suggest a market on the brink of retreat. Yet many have been warrants on hitherto unpopular sectors such as food retailers and drugs companies, often accompanied by bullish research notes. On a cynical interpretation such issues are part of an increasingly desperate search for value in an over-stretched market. While it can be unsettling to see the market led higher by derivatives, such instruments are increasingly a feature of day-to-day investment management. Unit trust managers have gained in confidence since the Securities and Investments Board clarified the rules in 1991. The manner in which pension funds should account for derivatives has also been standardised. Importantly, pension fund trustees no longer regard futures and options as a black art to be avoided at all costs. The current fashion for warrants is unlikely to form part of this process, though. Pension funds have been using them for some years. BTR, a core holding for many UK funds, started issuing them in 1988. On that basis the latest spate of warrant issues looks like a response to peculiar market conditions rather than part of a secular trend. The taste for highly-geared investments will not outlive the bull market.</p>

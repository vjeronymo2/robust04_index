			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 04, BNS -- The Russian military attache  to Latvia, Capt. Vladimir Konyaev, was accredited April 1 at the  country's Defense Ministry.    The event was "a substantial step toward normalization of  relations between Latvia and Russia," Defense Minister Valdis  Pavlovskis told reporters after the accreditation.    Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh agreed to the  minister's  words saying that the appointment of Russian military attache to  Latvia would promote contacts between both countries' defense  structures.    The activities of the newly accredited attache would not be  directly connected with the process of Russian troop withdrawal  but he is expected to engage the Russian embassy in tackling  withdrawal problems.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Prospect of Iraqi sales hits oil price Oil prices tumbled to new five-year lows yesterday as markets took fright at reports that Iraqi oil exports could resume earlier than expected. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend broke through the psychological barrier of Dollars 14 a barrel, to touch a low of Dollars 13.65 a barrel. It later recovered in late London trading to Dollars 13.85, but sentiment remained bearish, according to traders. The price slide was exacerbated by news that the main Russian Black Sea oil export terminal at Novorossiisk had reopened after being closed for three weeks by bad weather. Its closure had been one of the few factors underpinning prices. The main reason for yesterday's fall, however, was a report that Iraq had shown greater flexibility in accepting UN terms for lifting, at least partly, the embargo on oil exports. The possibility of resumed Iraqi exports at a time of plentiful supplies and weak prices has been a factor behind the 25 per cent slide in oil prices over the past year. One Gulf Arab official complained that none of the recent reports about the return of Iraqi exports has proved true. 'The market appears to be reacting to headlines rather than hard information,' he said. The UN Special Commission (Unscom) said last week that by accepting its weapons monitoring programme Iraq had removed the 'major remaining obstacle' on weapons requirements which are linked to the oil embargo in force since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But it gave no indication how long Unscom will take to finish its work, and inspectors have not precluded the possibility of turning up new evidence. The next inspection team is unlikely to visit Iraq before February and Mr Rolf Ekeus, who heads the commission, has suggested it would take at least another six months from then to complete its work. Even then there would be powerful opposition to lifting oil sanctions while President Saddam Hussein retains power. President Clinton is opposed to such a move in the near future and the US could be expected to cite other examples of Iraq's aggressive intentions to justify keeping sanctions. Gulf countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, argue that lifting the embargo would reward an unrepentant Iraq.</p>

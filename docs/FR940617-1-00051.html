			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding the effectiveness of chloroxylenol, the agency stated the following in the previous tentative final monograph: ``Claims for broad spectrum activity have been made *&blank;*&blank;*; however, the Commissioner finds that inadequate effectiveness data were submitted. Many studies were old and not performed with modern antiseptic testing procedures. *&blank;*&blank;* effectiveness testing both in vitro and in vivo should be done in accordance with the Guidelines'' (43 FR 1238).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicable effectiveness data submitted by the comments were derived from in vivo and in vitro studies (Refs. 1 through 7 and 13 through 16), along with data subsequently submitted under the ``feedback'' procedures (Refs. 22 through 28 and 50).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data from in vivo glove juice studies (Refs. 1, 2, 19, and 50) demonstrated the antiseptic activity of chloroxylenol in a range of 3 to 3.75 percent when formulated in an aqueous surfactant vehicle. Chloroxylenol formulations are substantive in their activity, i.e., they do not produce an initial high reduction in the number of bacteria but after repeated use (routine use), they reduce the baseline number of bacteria and suppress bacterial growth for 6 hours. In vivo data for surgical hand scrub products containing chloroxylenol at concentrations lower than 3 percent are insufficient. Aqueous solutions of chloroxylenol in a pine oil vehicle (1:40 dilution of Dettol <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &reg; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) consistently reduced more than 99 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Staphylococcus aureus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. aureus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) from the hands of test subjects (Ref. 25).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In vivo cup scrubbing and other appropriate data (Refs. 22, 23, and 24) indicate that chloroxylenol, in 70 percent alcohol, is fast acting as a patient preoperative skin preparation. However, alcohol itself meets the criteria for a preoperative skin preparation and is a significant contributor for fast acting contaminant reduction. The data are not sufficient to demonstrate that chloroxylenol in this formulation contributes to the total antimicrobial effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In vitro study data (Refs. 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 16, and 26) show that chloroxylenol in various vehicles is effective against gram-negative bacteria, i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Escherichia coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. aeruginosa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proteus vulgaris <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Klebsiella aerogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> K. aerogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). This anti-gram-negative activity is formulation dependent. Tested aqueous solutions of pure chloroxylenol with no other additives show that low concentrations (0.3 mg/mL) reduced 95 percent of some  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in 10 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data regarding the antiseptic activity of chloroxylenol itself are not adequate. While the data are considered sufficient to support in vitro effectiveness for the finished products, the available data are inadequate to show the contribution of the chloroxylenol. Because these finished products contain several additional ingredients, e.g., surfactants, isopropanol, pine oil, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which contributed substantial germicidal activity, conclusions regarding chloroxylenol's active contribution to the product's efficacy cannot be supported. The agency's detailed comments and evaluations of the submitted data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 51 and 52). One manufacturer has responded to FDA's concern and provided additional data (Ref. 53). These data are currently being reviewed by the agency and will be discussed in the final rule for these drug products. In summary, the data are sufficient to support the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of the formulations tested. However, additional data are needed to demonstrate that chloroxylenol contributes to the activity of these formulations. In addition, data from glove juice studies indicate that the antimicrobial activity of chloroxylenol is substantive in nature and does not produce an initial high reduction of bacteria, but that repeated use of the ingredient will produce a reduction in bacteria as well as a suppression of the baseline number of bacteria of the normal skin flora for 6 hours. As discussed in section I.N., comment 28, the agency is proposing that all antimicrobial products indicated for use as a surgical scrub or health-care personnel handwash be able to demonstrate an immediate reduction in bacteria and is inviting comment on the use of substantive antimicrobials in health-care antiseptic drug products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency, therefore, is proposing that chloroxylenol at the concentrations evaluated (0.24 percent to 3.75 percent) be classified as Category I for safety and Category III for effectiveness for short-term use as a patient preoperative skin preparation and in Category III for safety and effectiveness for long-term uses, i.e., antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and surgical hand scrub. The existing data are not adequate to extrapolate and assess the chronic toxicity of chloroxylenol for long-term use. Before chloroxylenol may be generally recognized as effective, the agency recommends that appropriate in vitro and in vivo effectiveness data be submitted. The data should include results obtained from both in vitro and in vivo tests as described in the testing procedures below.

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Water watchdog praises service THE LEVEL of customer service provided by water companies has improved for the second consecutive year, Ofwat, the industry regulator, said yesterday. It said in a report that the biggest improvements have been in dealing with the 13.5m billing queries and 125,000 written complaints received by the 22 water companies and 10 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales in the year to the end of last March. Ofwat noted that the companies' response times to customers improved in spite of a rise of 8.5 per cent in the number of billing enquiries and a 27 per cent increase in written complaints. Ofwat judged individual company performance against seven measures of service, although its comparisons between companies were based on four criteria: Pressure of water mains; Interruption to supply; Response to billing queries; Response to written complaints. It found that five companies - Hartlepool Water, Portsmouth Water; Sutton District Water, York Waterworks and Southern Water Services - performed particularly well against all four measures. But North West's 'overall performance compares unfavourably with the average', according to the report. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said the report 'shows that some companies can achieve a high level of service across the board which sets the standard that others must achieve'. Fifteen companies reported none or very few properties affected by unplanned supply disruptions lasting longer than 12 hours. But two, North West and Yorkshire, accounted for more than half of the 58,000 properties subject to such interruptions of supply.</p>

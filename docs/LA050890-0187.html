			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LIVING COLOUR BAND SUES FOX  </P> <P> The Grammy-winning hard rock group Living Colour has sued Fox Broadcasting Co.,  claiming that the network's new "In Living Color" show stole the band's name  and logo.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed Friday in New York, seeks an injunction against Fox and  producers of the Saturday night comedy as well as unspecified damages.  </P> <P> "In Living Color" producer Tamara Rawitt declined to comment, as did Brad  Turell, senior vice president of Fox.  </P> <P> "In Living Color" has received rave reviews and was 29th in the ratings during  its April 15 debut.  </P> <P> Created by Keenen Ivory Wayans, who did the black satirical films "Hollywood  Shuffle" and "I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka," "In Living Color" is a black version  of "Saturday Night Live" that pokes fun at racial stereotypes with an almost  all-black crew of comedians.  </P></p>

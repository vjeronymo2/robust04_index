			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Argentaria joins Banesto contest Argentaria, the partially-privatised Spanish banking corporation, has become the latest contender to control Banesto, the ailing banking group to be auctioned among the domestic financial community late next month. To prepare its bid, Argentaria yesterday hired the US bank Goldman Sachs to evaluate a rescue plan, drawn up by Banesto and by the Bank of Spain, which aims to recapitalise Banesto and absorb its estimated Pta605bn (Dollars 4.3bn) overvalued assets. Banco Santander announced three weeks ago it was studying the wisdom of bidding for Banesto. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) a rival big bank, is expected to publicly declare its interest at its AGM tomorrow. Under the terms of the rescue plan, subject to the approval of Banesto's shareholders, a strategic domestic buyer will acquire a minimum of 35 per cent of Banesto's reconstituted share capital.</p>

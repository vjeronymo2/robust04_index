			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria, 11 May (PL) -- Today, the South African  Government of Nelson Mandela adopted one of its first foreign  policy decisions and established diplomatic relations with Cuba,  it was announced officially in this capital.    Today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and South  African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo signed the protocol that  establishes a new status in relations between Pretoria and  Havana.    Up until now, the two governments had not maintained  diplomatic ties because of the Caribbean island authorities'  rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of apartheid.    Less than 48 hours after assuming the presidency, Nelson  Mandela, leader of the African National Congress (ANC),  finalized the government decision, reaffirming the relations of  friendship and solidarity maintained for years between Cuba and  the then-outlawed ANC.    Regarding the possibilities of cooperation between Cuba and  the South African state, Cuban President Fidel Castro had told  PRENSA LATINA: There are few countries that have the fraternal  links that we share with South Africa.    The country has, on the one hand, great development and  standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous  social needs in the areas of public health, employment,  education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to  appreciate in our talks with members of the South African  cabinet, Castro said.    Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples.    After signing the protocol, Alfredo Nzo, former secretary of  international relations of the ANC, told Robaina that the new  South Africa did not want Fidel Castro to end his visit before  making this decision.    For his part, Robaina underlined the importance of the  signing of the agreement, not only because of its great  significance, but because it is the first protocol signed by Nzo  as foreign minister. Cuba has close cooperative relations with  other African states in the areas of health, construction,  sports, and education, which can also be extended to South  Africa, he said. Hundreds of ANC youths have studied in the past  at education centers in Cuba, it was noted.    There were times of serious confrontation between the two  states, Fidel Castro pointed out during his visit, recalling  Cuba's international opposition to the aggressive policy  maintained by the dismantled apartheid regime against the South  African black majority and the peoples of Namibia and Angola.  "Now there is a new South Africa, where peace, respect, and  love toward Cuba exist," he stated.    The Cuban delegation, headed by President Fidel Castro,  concluded its first official and friendly visit to South Africa  today. The Cuban delegation began its visit Monday to attend  Mandela's inauguration. Mandela is the first black president of  the country, which now has unequivocally left behind more than  three centuries of racial discrimination.    In terms of Cuba's representation, Roberto Robaina was  accompanied at the signing ceremony by Angel Dalmau, Cuban  ambassador in Namibia; Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of science,  technology, and environment; and Marcos Rodriguez, diplomatic  counselor, who will temporarily represent the Cuban Government  in Pretoria.</p>

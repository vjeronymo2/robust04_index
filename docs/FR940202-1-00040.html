			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Livestock grazing is another form of habitat alteration that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributing to declines in the California red-legged frog. Jennings et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> al. (1992) found livestock grazing to occur at all known historic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locations of the California red-legged frog in the Central Valley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrographic basin. Livestock grazing also has been implicated as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributing factor in the decline and disappearance of California red- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legged frogs from the lower Salinas River (L. Hunt,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1993) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the San Francisco peninsula (S. Barry,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1992). Two remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregations of California red-legged frogs in the Central Valley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrographic basin (Corral Hollow Ecological Reserve and Frank Raines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regional Park) are threatened by sedimentation of aquatic habitats  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either directly or indirectly caused by livestock grazing and off-road  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle use (Jennings et al. 1992). Rathbun (pers. comm., 1993) reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that grazing is adversely altering California red-legged frog habitat on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pico, Van Gordon, San Simeon, Santa Rosa, Cambria Meadows, and Cayucos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creeks in San Luis Obispo County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous studies, summarized in Behnke and Raleigh (1978) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kauffman and Krueger (1984), have shown that livestock grazing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negatively affects riparian habitat. Cattle have a disproportionately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater adverse affect on riparian and other wetland habitats because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they tend to concentrate in these areas, particularly during the dry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> season (Marlow and Pogacnik 1985). Cattle trample and eat emergent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> riparian vegetation, often eliminating or severely reducing plant cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Gunderson 1968, Duff 1979). Loss of riparian vegetation results in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased water temperatures (Van Velson 1979), which encourage bullfrog  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reproduction (bullfrogs are a predator and competitor of California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> red-legged frogs). Riparian vegetation loss due to cattle grazing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes the loss of willows (Duff 1979), which are associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest densities of California red-legged frogs (Jennings 1988b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cattle grazing also results in increased erosion in the watershed (Lusby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1970, Winegar 1977), which results in the sedimentation of deep pools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Gunderson 1968) used by California red-legged frogs and adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affects aquatic invertebrates (Cordone and Kelley 1961), which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common prey items of California red-legged frogs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Off-road vehicle use adversely affects California red-legged frogs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in ways similar to livestock grazing. Off-road vehicles damage riparian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vegetation and increase siltation in pools. Off-road vehicles also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disturb the water in stream channels and may crush eggs, larvae,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> juveniles or adults. California red-legged frogs were eliminated either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all or in part by off-road vehicle activities at the Mojave River above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hesperia, at Rincon Station on the San Gabriel River, and at Piru Creek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above Pyramid Lake (M. Jennings, pers. comm., 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timber harvest threatens California red-legged frogs through loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of riparian vegetation, which is needed for cover and water temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, and increased erosion in the watershed, which fills pools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with sediment and smothers egg masses. In Santa Cruz County, timber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvest is proposed adjacent to Adams Creek (Celia Scott, private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citizen, pers. comm., 1993), 1 of 12 remaining streams in the county  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that support California red-legged frogs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational purposes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Records of harvesting California red-legged frogs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for food date back to an account by Lockington (1879) of the commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvest of this species for the San Francisco market. From 1890 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1900, the California red-legged frog supported a significant commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishery (Smith 1895) with about 80,000 frogs harvested annually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Jennings and Hayes 1984). Counties surrounding San Francisco Bay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided the bulk of the frog harvest in the early to mid 1890s, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys increasing in importance by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the decade (Chamberlain 1898, Jennings and Hayes 1985). By 1900,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvest figures for California red-legged frogs fell dramatically,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating that overharvesting may have occurred. Jennings and Hayes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1985) hypothesized that this rapid decline in the California red-legged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frog population was the result of selective harvesting of the larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> females. Introduction of the bullfrog in California in 1896 was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probably in response to the dwindling California red-legged frog  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population (Jennings and Hayes 1985).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

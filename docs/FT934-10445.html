			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Civil servants strike today ABOUT 300,000 civil servants are expected to take part in strike action today in the largest collective protest by public sector workers in 12 years. Five unions are involved, representing more than half of Britain's 540,000 civil servants. They are calling for a halt to market testing, saying that it threatens jobs and could damage public services. The last time so many public sector workers took industrial action was in 1981 when unions opposed the scrapping of the old civil service pay agreements.</p>

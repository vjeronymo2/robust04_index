			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Chernov report under the ``Details'' rubric: ``Do You </F> Want a `Cylinder'?'']    [Text] Sochi -- Staffers of the Sochi service of the  Russian FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service] and the  militia have detained a resident of the resort who was trying to  sell approximately 7 kg of a radioactive substance. Experts are  now determining the exact weight and composition of this  ``bomb,'' but it is conjectured that enriched uranium-238 was in  three cylindrical containers with a diameter of 15 cm and a  length of 40 cm.    Aleksey Shishkov, chief of the FCS Sochi service, has  reported that preliminary measurements showed that the  radioactive background created by the containers exceeded the  maximum permissible norms by a factor of two and that the  cylinders posed a great danger. Incidentally, the owner of the  commodity (it would be premature to name him) had put the  containers inside tubes, but it ``shone'' pretty well even  through the additional protection.    Intelligence officers are not yet saying how they happened  upon the uranium dealer. It is only known that two capsules  were first removed from two hiding places, while the third was  discovered on the citizen when he was detained. He was arrested  last weekend in the very center of Sochi. It is assumed that he  intended to sell the containers to foreigners for a large sum in  dollars.    Criminal proceedings have been instituted, envisaging  punishment not only for stealing radioactive substances but also  for violating the regulations governing their storage. The most  interesting question, to which the answer must be found, is  this: How and from where did the dangerous capsules get to the  Black Sea? According to militia staffers, the threads of the  crime lead to the Urals region....</p>

What could awaken feelings anesthetized by injections of  Israeli deception more than images of innocent blood shed in the  holy place in Hebron? What sanctities do those -- who claim to  be the descendants of Abraham -- believe in while they shed  innocent blood in the Ibrahimi mosque? What act of  international terrorism can be compared with what was committed  by the sinful Zionist hand against innocent Palestinians in  Hebron today?    This is one of a series of similar Zionist terrorist acts  that have continued since before 1948. They will not stop as  long as Zionists continue their arrogance and sin without  meeting deterrence from anyone in the name of humanity,  international legitimacy, or international determination to stop  their recklessness. They will not stop as long these Zionists  continue to see the world's silence about their crimes as  collusion giving them a free hand to desecrate anything, with no  deterrence of their oppression, terrorism, ambitions, and  violations of all noble and honorable human values coming from  anyone.    What is the reaction of the NATO members, who were justly  shocked by the market crime against scores of innocent people in  Sarajevo almost two weeks ago? Then, they issued a warning to  the killers and delivered an ultimatum, and the killers bowed to  the warning. Doesn't Arab blood incite any reaction from them,  or even any feeling of sympathy or mercy? It should not be  understood from this that Arabs are begging for sympathy or  mercy from anyone, or that they are waiting for another  international condemnation or denunciation statement. All the  international condemnation statements have not restored any of  their rights and have not stopped the violent onslaught of  Zionist terrorism and aggression. So far, all the international  resolutions have failed to enable Palestinians and Arabs to  restore any of their rights, because those who control the  international will lack the firm determination to force Israel  to pay attention to these resolutions.    Moreover, rather than employing effective international  pressure on Israel to heed international legitimacy's  resolutions and principles, we have seen acts of collusion  represented by silence or carelessness in order to circumvent  this legitimacy. The result of this is the daily horrible  massacres and crimes Zionists commit against innocent  Palestinians, without concern for values, norms, or principles.    The Israeli Government cannot dissociate itself from the  crime of massacre committed at the Ibrahimi mosque today by  claiming it was the act of an extremist or a deranged Zionist,  or that of a Zionist with any other adjective that may be  attributed to him in order to cover up the ugliness of the crime.    Direct responsibility for this crime, and for any other  crime  committed by Zionist settlers or occupation forces, is  shouldered by the Tel Aviv rulers who insisted, and are  insisting, on keeping the Arab land they usurped, and who  encouraged, and are encouraging, the settlers to remain on this  land.    The Tel Aviv rulers, who fabricated and ignored the facts of  history and geography, rejected the principles of justice and  disrespected the resolutions of international legitimacy, and  considered occupied Palestinian land a disputed land to which  Zionist settlers have more right than its original owners --  these rulers are the ones who planted, and are planting, the  seeds of terrorism that were terribly manifested today in the  Ibrahimi mosque massacre.    We have said and warned more than once that what Israel is  doing in the name of the so-called peace that it is hiding  behind is nothing more than aggravating elements of tension and  explosion, spreading terrorism, and endangering stability and  security in the region.    What happened today is only one part of these elements. This  will continue as long as Israel remains unrestrained and free  from any control that deters its extravagance and stops its  crimes and terrorism.    Will the world wake up and pay attention before it is too  late, before Israel pushes the entire region, by its antipeace  positions and practices, to the edge of an explosion?</p>

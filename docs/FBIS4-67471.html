			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent  environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan  Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 30 March to 18 April.  <H5>  CONGO </H5>   Dakar PANA in English, in a Brazzaville-datelined item at  1415 GMT on 11 April reports that "Congo now fears for the  future of its surface waters and pressures brought on its  forests." In a paper on the "forest climate and ecosystem" in  Impfondo, Likouala Region, Jose Djoni Bourges, regional director  of the Forestry Commission underlined the adverse effects of the  forest destruction. He said "the large destruction of forests  leads to the lowering of the output of streams," citing the case  of the Sangha and Obangui Rivers, on the border between Zaire  and the Central African Republic. "Bourges said there was a  risk of the desert now threatening Chad encroaching on its  forest. He added that countries separating Chad and Congo --  Cameroon and the Central African Republic in particular -- are  among those which are mostly threatened with desertification.  "According to official figures, Congo loses between 15,000 and  20,000 hectares of forest a year. Agricultural practice not  friendly to the environment is considered the first cause of  deforestation in the country."    London BBC World Service in English at 1515 on 18 April  reports that due to the effects of the violence in the country  last November, authorities are now planning to conduct a major  hygiene operation in Brazzaville. This operation will involve  digging up and properly reburying the bodies of those killed in  the recent ethnic violence. Opposition and presidential  supporters thought to have been responsible for the bloodshed  will be called upon to help locate the cemeteries or shallow  pits which were used as common graves for hurriedly-buried  bodies. At least 200 people are known to have been killed during  the clashes in Brazzaville.  <H5>  GHANA </H5>   Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in  English  at 1300 GMT on 18 April in its press review column says the  GHANAIAN TIMES carries the assurance by the Environmental  Protection Council that a strange substance in River Ankorbra  and its tributary is not harmful to human and animal life. The  columnist quotes the Western regional program officer of the  council as telling a meeting of fishermen in the communities  along the river that a substance which emits a bad odor does not  pose any danger to the health of the people. The chief of the  area disputes the claim saying that the "presence of the  substance in the river is scaring away fishermen from fishing  because the substance damages their nets and affects their  catch." The paper supports a decision by the Ministry of Food  and Agriculture to provide fishing communities with basic needs.  They quote the deputy minister of the ministry in charge of  fisheries of telling some fishing communities in the Dangbe West  and Dangbe East districts that landing facilities at the beaches  "would be provided to improve lighting systems and smoking sheds  as well as tax-free concessions."  <H5>  NIGER </H5>   Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 31  March reports that the Goulbi River, the main water reserve  which crosses the southern end of Maradi Region, is in danger.  It is threatened by the construction of a dam in neighboring  Nigeria. People and experts have been mobilized to find a  suitable, lasting solution that would enable Niger to retain the  waters that irrigate vast lands along the Goulbi River valley.  Agricultural activities have slowed down in the Goulbi River  valley because the river is drying out. Experts have studied  the issue and decided to implement four water projects. The  first one is a pilot project that is being tried out in a  village located 6 km from Maradi. Once completed, the project  will enable the flooding of about 17 hectares even during the  dry season and will refill the Goulbi Basin.    Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 4  April  reports that the people of Goudoumaria, rendered powerless by a  natural phenomenon, have found an easy alternative, but not  necessarily the best. Sand dunes have encroached on their farms  so they have begun a rural exodus. According to a Voix du Sahel  correspondent in the region, "Goudoumaria covers an area of  9,500 square km for a population of 30,000 comprising Fulanis,  Manga, Tubus, and Tuaregs who practice farming and animal  husbandry." He goes on to say that the frequency and intensity  of the wind which moves tons of sand from one place to another  have forced people to leave their homes. A regional  administrative official explains that because the people no  longer have farming land they often go to Nigeria where they  stay for months. He stresses that "theirs is a problem of  survival because they have no money to buy food and some of  their homes are totally buried in the sand." Commenting further  on the situation of the people of Goudoumaria, the regional  official suggests the creation of local jobs so that they could  remain at home and support their families.  <H5>  NIGERIA </H5>   Paris AFP in English at 0509 GMT on 30 March in a  Lagos-datelined item says: "Lake Chad has shrunk tenfold in the  past three decades as a direct consequence of global warming,  Nigeria's Minister for Water Resources Alhaji Isa Mohammed said  here Tuesday. The lake has gradually shrunk from about 26,000  square kilometres (10,400 square miles) in 1962 to its present  2,500 square kilometres (1,000 square miles), Mohammed told an  international workshop on the impact of global climate change on  energy development.    The adverse phenomenon is the direct impact of global  climatic change brought about by increased global warming caused  by depletion of the ozone layer, Mohammed said. He welcomed the  admission of the Central African Republic last week as the fifth  member of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, meeting in Abuja,  Nigeria, which could pave the way for a transfer of water from  the Upper Oubangui river to the Chari river in Chad to increase  the flow into the lake.    Lagos NTA Television Network in English at 2000 GMT on 11  April carries a report in which the Administrator of Anambra  State, Colonel Mike Attah says erosion is being tackled within  the limited resources of the state, adding that representation  has been made to the Federal Government on the issue. He made  the observation while on a familiarization tour of Anaocha local  government area of the state. In a report, NTA correspondent  quotes the administrator as remarking that "with intensified  revenue drive and prudent financial management, each local  government council should be able to pay staff salaries promptly  and embark on capital projects." He commended Anaocha local  government for the various development projects. The reports  says the chairman of the council drew the attention of the  government to the "devastating effects of erosion in the area,  the lack of motorable roads and health facilities within most  communities."</p>

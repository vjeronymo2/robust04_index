			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Troubled Credit Lyonnais delays results for first half Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French state-controlled banking group, surprised the markets by postponing publication of its results for the first half of 1994 yesterday. The move aroused fears about additional provisions still required to cover its heavy losses. The bank said the results were unlikely to be released for several days as a result of a board decision pending completion of 'certain analyses' in progress. Officials close to the bank said the delay was caused by a failure to complete discussions with the government about the way in which extra financial support should be provided. News of the postponement helped to prompt a sharp fall in price of the group's non-voting shares and reinforced speculation about substantial additional provisions that may be required as part of its restructuring. Credit Lyonnais lost FFr6.9bn (Pounds 820m) last year, one of the biggest losses in French corporate history. In July, the bank was the subject of a highly critical report from the government. The bank admitted that the delay in producing its results was 'embarrassing'. However, it emphasised that it still had the full support of the government. Mr Jean Sassure, a banking analyst with Societe Generale in Paris, said Credit Lyonnais could not cover its bad debts without additional government support, and estimated that special additional restructuring provisions for the first half of the year would exceed FFr10bn. The delay is understood to have been caused less by the government's refusing to accept the inclusion of extra provisions than by difficulties in finalising the way in which additional support should be provided - through cash, guarantees or other methods. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the chairman appointed by the government, has been holding a series of discussions with ministers in preparation for the announcement of the bank's restructuring. The announcement is expected before the end of the year. As far back as June, the directors had scheduled a board meeting and publication of the results for yesterday. A decision was finally taken to postpone only on Wednesday, when it became clear that not all details had been agreed. The delay may be for at least two weeks. Credit Lyonnais's certificats d'investissement - the only ones traded - closed 5.6 per cent down at FFr401. After the company's announcement, they reached a low for the year at one point of FFr390, down 7.05 per cent. Earlier, Mr Peyrelevade had predicted that the banking group would break even in the second half of this year and return to profit in 1995. It is likely to have to make further provisions for doubtful loans and investments by its Althus and SDBO subsidiaries. World stocks, Page 41</p>

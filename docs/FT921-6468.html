			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / National Institute Economic Review: Further 300,000 job losses forecast by 1994 THE UK faces more than 300,000 further job losses in the next 22 months, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research says. The institute, a leading economic think-tank, forecasts in its quarterly review published yesterday that the jobless total will increase to 2.92m by the end of next year and stay around 2m for the rest of the decade. A more cheerful conclusion is that a limited recovery from the recession is likely in the second half of this year, with gross domestic product set to increase 1.3 per cent after a 2.6 per cent fall last year. The institute expects growth of 2.7 per cent next year. In its assessment of options in the March 10 Budget the institute advises Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to put a boost for investment ahead of proposals to cut income tax. Support for companies' capital-spending plans would help UK productivity to catch up with levels overseas. A tax cut would act mainly to stimulate consumer spending, which the institute says would be 'not ideal' as a method of speeding up the recovery. The economic revival is likely to be held back by a further fall in investment this year, and by an upturn in the housing market that will be limited. The institute believes Mr Lamont will inject Pounds 2bn into the economy by taking 1p off the standard income-tax rate. A stimulus of this kind would push the public sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 22.2bn in 1992-93, and Pounds 21.6bn the following year. In both cases this amounts to about 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product. The institute warns that any effort beyond such a relatively modest cut in personal taxation to boost spending by consumers could increase inflation. In spite of a slowdown in the past year, inflation is still not 'safely in line' with levels in France and Germany. As a result 'Britain cannot afford a really rapid recovery'. The institute says the retail prices index will continue to show only small year-on-year changes for some time. It reckons this will be 3.4 per cent at the end of this year and 3.5 per cent at the end of next year. Among the main factors increasing UK growth this year will be the Pounds 11bn additional pubic spending for 1992-93 announced by the Treasury last November. The UK's ability to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy will be limited, however, by the need to keep sterling in its band in the European exchange rate mechanism. That will restrict annual growth and keep unemployment high. The institute reckons the jobless total will climb to 2.83m by the end of this year from 2.6m in January. The figure has risen by about 1m since March 1990. The institute hints that the UK monetary authorities should take action to damp erratic movements in credit to consumers and industry. Loans to these groups jumped in the mid to late 1980s, fuelling the 1986-88 boom, and have contracted sharply during the recession. 'A more cautious lending policy by the banking system can be expected in the light of recent experiences - and should be welcomed as more conducive to macroeconomic stability,' it says. Exports are expected to grow by 2.8 per cent this year compared with 1 per cent in 1991, helping the UK's growth prospects. The good performance by exporters may be partly because of a recovery in world trade, which is likely to grow by 4.4 per cent this year after 1.1 per cent last year. Any larger increase in world trade will be prevented by relatively slow expansion in the world economy. Growth in gross domestic product in the seven biggest industrialised economies - the US, Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Canada and Britain - will be 1.9 per cent in this year, after 0.9 per cent last year and 2.4 per cent in 1990.

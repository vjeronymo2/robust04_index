			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Rail dispute Britain's rail dispute is hotting up. The RMT rail union has decided to call two-day strikes by signal staff in pursuit of higher pay for past productivity increases. The disruption suffered by the travelling public - and British Rail's freight customers - will increase. An appropriate reaction is now needed from Railtrack, the state-owned company that runs British Rail's track and signalling operations. One option would be to settle the dispute as quickly as possible. The disruption is already costing British Rail many times the price of a settlement. It could also threaten the privatisation of the railways, by exposing the vulnerability of the train-operating companies to action by Railtrack staff. A well-run private business would probably settle. It would then recoup the cost through fierce cost-cutting and change its employment practices to avoid a repetition. Railtrack does not have that freedom, however. The government has already interfered to stop an earlier settlement. It fears that changing its mind might encourage others to challenge the public sector pay-bill freeze. An alternative would be to respond to the union escalation in kind. Those who long for a more macho response recall President Ronald Reagan's approach to striking air traffic controllers: offer the strikers personal contracts, sack those who refuse to accept them and train replacements as quickly as possible. Seductive though that would be, it would close the rail network for months - especially if other rail staff came out in solidarity with their signalling colleagues. The most promising approach is a combination of carrot and stick. Railtrack needs to do much more to talk directly to its signal staff, and to point out the damage the strikes are doing to their future. The opening of the Channel tunnel, with the opportunities it brings to export by rail, is no time to be reminding customers of the past unreliability of the railways. The company must also make it absolutely clear what is on the table for each of its signalling staff - and what it hopes to offer in return for further productivity improvements. And it could sensibly make a concession to the relief staff who are the main losers under the current offer. Given the high turnover of relief staff, it would cost little to allow existing staff to retain their current pay and apply the new terms to new recruits only. At the same time, Railtrack should be firm in dealing with attempts to disrupt the network by tactics such as next week's two-day strike. The strike will run from noon on Tuesday to noon on Thursday, effectively disrupting the rail network for three days. Those staff who join it should lose three days' pay. There are no quick solutions to strikes such as this. But a combination of persuasion and firmness is the most likely way to bring it to an early end. This will be a big week for Unilever. Having been sent reeling by Procter &amp; Gamble's assault on the quality of its new washing powders, Unilever will try to wrest the initiative back through a public relations campaign. This week's presentations - rejecting the claims that its washing powders rot clothes - could prove critical in determining whether the detergents succeed across Europe. They could prove just as important in re-establishing the reputation of Unilever's management, which has been sullied since the row began. In quantitative terms, the powder wars are of limited financial importance to Unilever. The group has sold Pounds 325m of new powder so far. That is small in relation to group annual profits of well over Pounds 2bn. The chief concern would be if the mud thrown at Omo Power and Persil Power were to stick to Unilever's other detergent brands. But there is no evidence of that to date. The more worrying aspect is qualitative. Launching consumer products successfully is the lifeblood of the company. Shareholders understandably grow uneasy when that starts to go awry. The company's touch has appeared unsure since the accusations started to fly. The subsequent reformulation of its powders and the dropping of litigation against P&amp;G have come as further public relations blows. Shareholders will hope the affair will prove cathartic. Unilever will certainly need to show it has regained its poise before P&amp;G launches its own new detergent this autumn. At least the scorching weather must be doing wonders for Unilever's ice cream sales.</p>

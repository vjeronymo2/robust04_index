In a statement addressed to UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali and members of the Security Council, the Commission  urged that action be taken "immediately" by the international  community to deal with such attacks and other human rights  violations.    It did not specify what type of action should be taken.    The Commission, which considered resolutions put forward by  the European Community and the Organisation of the Islamic  Conference, said it wanted an end to "ethnic cleansing" and  other acts of genocide in the former Yugoslavia, diplomats said.    The statement called Saturday's mortar attack which left at  least 68 dead and nearly 200 injured a "deliberate and  unconscionable" act which was "despicable and outrageous" and  called for "firm and resolute action to be tkaen immediately by  the international community."    The Commission also called for an end to the rape of women,  the siege of Bosnian towns and the bombing and massacre of  civilians and it demanded that "war criminals" be put on trial.    The statement came ahead of a meeting Thursday [date as  received] of the NATO council in response to a request by  Butrus-Ghali for NATO backing to deter any repetition of the  massacre, possibly including the use of airstrikes against Serb  positions around the city.</p>

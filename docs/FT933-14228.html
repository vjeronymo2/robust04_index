			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Observer: Title tattle News that just departed Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton has taken the title of Lord Kingsdown caught Observer off-guard. Didn't Kingsdown in Kent already have a lord of the manor in Kenneth Noye, one of the brains behind the 1982 Brinks-Mat bullion robbery? Perhaps the former guardian of Britain's gold was moving in to search for the still missing bulk of the robbers' undercover reserves. But the odds would surely be against him in an area where many of the houses look as though they must have been built without planning permission, besides being guarded by rottweilers. Wrong track, however. The said Kingsdown has nothing to do with Leigh-Pemberton's new title, which has a spotless record indeed. It has been kept unused for over a century, dating back to one of Leigh-Pemberton's great great grandads who died childless.</p>

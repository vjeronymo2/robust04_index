			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Ban urged on sale of non-approved modems ELECTRONICS manufacturers in the UK are urging the government to declare illegal the sale of computer communications equipment that has not been approved for connection to the public switched network. They are angry that US and Asian companies are able to undercut their prices by supplying equipment that has not been subjected to or passed the extensive tests required by the BATB, the UK telecommun-ications equipment watchdog. It is not, at present, illegal to sell non-approved data communications equipment although it is against the law to attach it to the public telephone network. An industry lobby, the Modem Approvals Group, has been established which next Wednesday will launch a campaign at the Commons to spread awareness of the need to establish a 'level playing field' for manufacturers prepared to comply with the regulations. Modems are pieces of electronic equipment which convert computer data into signals which can be transmitted down a telephone line. They are an essential component in the construction of computer networks which represents one of the fastest growing areas of the information technology business and a potential source of significant revenues to UK suppliers. Mr Joe Korner, a marketing executive with the UK manufacturer Dataflex Design which has been in the forefront of the campaign, said that 'grey' importers could sell for about Pounds 100, a modem that Dataflex priced at Pounds 199. The modem market is worth some Dollars 310m in the UK at present, according to the marketing consultancy Dataquest, equivalent to 340,000 units. Between 20 per cent and 40 per cent of the total is thought to be accounted for by grey imports. Members of the Modem Approvals Group include Dataflex, Cray Communications,Racal, Motorola Codex, British Telecom and Psion Datacom. The group has already brought the issue to the attention of the Department of Trade and Industry and to Oftel. Mr Barry Gilder, marketing director of Cray Communications, said there was a question of safety but the real issue was establishing fair trading conditions for manufacturers.</p>

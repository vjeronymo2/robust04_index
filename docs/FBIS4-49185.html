			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Baodong] </F>   [Text] Nairobi, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The "interim president"  of Somalia, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, will not come to Kenya to attend  a proposed conference on the Somali crisis scheduled to open  here on May 10.    In a telephone interview with XINHUA tonight, a high-ranking  official of the United Somali Congress said in Mogadishu that  the situation in Somalia, especially in the capital of  Mogadishu, is very grave because the Habarghidir clan, where  General Mohamed Farah Aideed is from, last month occupied Brava,  Merka and the area around the Mogadishu airport which belong to  the clans of Hawadle, Dir and Biimaal.    The airport is now under the control of the United Nations  Operation in Somalia (Unosom). The official said "if the  Habarg-Hidir clan does not withdraw from Brava, Merka and the  airport area soon, let it get ready to fight with us."    On March 24 this year, all Somali faction leaders signed a  declaration on Somali national reconciliation here after  eight-day negotiations. The leaders agreed that a national  reconciliation conference would be held in Mogadishu on May 15  this year to elect a president, a parliament and form a  government composed of all faction leaders.    Under the declaration, the faction leaders would hold a  preparatory meeting in Mogadishu on April 15 for the proposed  national reconciliation conference. However, the venue for the  preparatory meeting has been changed to Nairobi, Kenya, for  security reasons.</p>

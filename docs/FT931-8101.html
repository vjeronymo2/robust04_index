			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: The dangers of success - Investment Trusts / A look at the rise and rise of Fleming Claverhouse A TRUST that pays quarterly dividends, aims to invest in UK blue chip shares and has a good long-term performance record might sound just what many private investors are looking for. So it has proved for Fleming Claverhouse. Private investors now own more than 60 per cent of the share capital, compared with 27 per cent in 1985. Its record places it second (out of eight) trusts in the UK general sector over the 10 years to February 1, with a rise of 576.9 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income reinvested, according to Micropal). Over five years, growth has been 96.2 per cent, placing the trust third in the sector. But there are problems associated with success. The shares now stand at a 6 per cent premium to net asset value. This means that those who buy Claverhouse shares are, effectively, paying 106p to get 100p of assets. There is an element of paradox about this situation. Because private investors have been attracted to the trust, the shares have been pushed to a premium (in short, demand for the shares exceeds supply). But whether all those private investors appreciate the dangers associated with buying shares at a premium is open to question. If the premium disappears - or, worse, if the shares drop to a substantial discount - then private investors could see the value of their holdings drop sharply, even if the stock market is stable. But if private investors do not realise the danger, the premium could well stay in place. This is not, of course, a problem unique to Fleming Claverhouse. Like many of the other trusts in the same situation, it has taken power to issue new shares to savings plan-holders. A rights issue could be required at some point. Claverhouse was founded in 1963 and was named after 'Bonnie Dundee,' later the 1st Viscount Claverhouse, who led a rebellion against William &amp; Mary in 1689 and was killed at the battle of Killiecrankie. The name was chosen because of management group Robert Fleming's links with Dundee, where the firm had its origins in 1873. The trust aims to invest in blue chip shares, although this definition includes many medium-sized companies - only 50 per cent of the portfolio is in FT-SE 100 stocks. Claverhouse's 10 largest investments at the end of 1992 contained many names that would be familiar to the private investor: Glaxo, British Gas, NFC, Tate &amp; Lyle, Shell, BT, East Midlands Electricity, Severn Trent Water, Allied-Lyons and Unilever. In terms of sectors, the portfolio includes shares in the consumer group (38.5 per cent); financials (14.7 per cent); capital goods (10.4 per cent); oil and gas (9 per cent); others (26.8 per cent); and investment trusts (0.6 per cent). Claverhouse has debenture borrowings of around Pounds 15m, equal to gearing of 18 per cent, which it took out in tranches in January 1988 and December 1990. That level of gearing leaves it exposed to downturns in the market, and Claverhouse actually used a put option to hedge its exposure in September 1991. The trust has been managed for the past two years by 39-year-old Anthony Nutt, who worked previously for TSB Investment Management and broker Foster &amp; Braithwaite. Lewis Aaron of SG Warburg Securities, says that the departure of respected former manager John Redwood does not seem to have dented the trust's performance. In picking stocks, Nutt is able to call on Fleming's 15-strong team of analysts. He says the trust looks for stocks which can provide dividend growth rather than those with a high initial yield. That means it needs an exposure to convertible stocks (now 15 per cent) to push the yield up to 3.6 per cent. Even so, given the existence of additional plan charges, such a small yield might not seem the most obvious Pep choice for income-seeking investors. But as the graph shows, the trust has a good record for increasing dividends, which have nearly trebled over the past 10 years. And quarterly payments are undoubtedly an attraction. The trust's long-term performance has undoubtedly benefited from its limited exposure to small company shares, which have suffered over the past few years but may be due for a revival. The share price return has also been bolstered by the move from discount to premium, a factor which cannot now be repeated. So, the trust will face some interesting challenges over the next few years, some of which have, ironically, been caused by its popularity. Key facts. At the end of 1992, the trust had gross assets of Pounds 92m and net assets of Pounds 77m. On February 18, it had net assets per share of 375.5p and the shares were trading at 399p, a premium of 6.1 per cent. The yield was 3.6 per cent and the market capitalisation was Pounds 80m. Fleming has a two-year management contract, for which the annual fee is 0.5 per cent of assets. Board. Fleming Claverhouse has only a four-man board, chaired by Lord Mark Fitzalan Howard, a director of Robert Fleming. The other directors are Sir Timothy Raison, MP for Aylesbury and a former minister of overseas development, John Redwood, a former manager of the trust, and Professor George Stout, a director of XCL Sunrise.

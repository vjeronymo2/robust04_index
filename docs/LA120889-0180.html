			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHICAGO TRIBUNE EDITOR RESIGNS  </P> <P> Chicago Tribune Editor James D. Squires announced his resignation today,  effective Jan. 1, 1990.  </P> <P> No successor was named immediately.  </P> <P> "My decision was made for two reasons -- to ease and expedite the transition to  a new era of newspaper leadership, begun this time last year, with the  appointment of a new president -- and to placate my own restless heart,"  Squires said in a statement.  </P> <P> Squires referred to the appointment last year of Tribune President John W.  Madigan.  </P> <P> Squires was named editor of the Tribune in 1981. Previously he was editor of  the Orlando Sentinel and chief of the Tribune's Washington bureau.  </P> <P> His tenure at the Tribune has been marked by often surprising and sweeping  changes in staff assignments, including a recent switch of the newspaper's  legal reporter to the Notre Dame football beat.  </P></p>

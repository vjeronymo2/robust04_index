			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Voters scorn water transfer More than 97 per cent of voters in a Strathclyde region referendum have overwhelmingly rejected plans to remove the Scottish water industry from local authority control, James Buxton writes. The government proposals were rejected by 97.2 per cent of the 1.2m who voted in a postal ballot. Papers were returned by 71.5 per cent of those who received them - a high turnout for recent UK referendums. Strathclyde region includes almost half the population of Scotland. Mr Robert Gould, convener of Strathclyde regional council, which organised the referendum, called the result 'sensational'. He said the government 'would be very unwise to proceed with their water legislation with less than 3 per cent supporting it'. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, called the referendum 'pseudo-democratic' and 'meaningless'. The ballot paper had not explained that the status quo in the water industry could not continue when local government was reorganised. The government proposes removing water from the nine regional and three island councils and putting it in the hands of three state-owned authorities with boards appointed by the Scottish secretary.</p>

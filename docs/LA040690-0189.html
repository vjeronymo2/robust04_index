			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WALL STREET ARBITRAGERS FOUND GUILTY OF INSIDER TRADING, FRAUD  </P> <P> A federal jury today convicted two Wall Street arbitragers on insider trading,  fraud and other counts linked to the so-called "Yuppie Five" scandal, capping a  12-week trial.  </P> <P> Victor Teicher, 38, who headed the arbitrage firm Teicher &amp; Co., faces a  maximum 60-year prison term and fines that could total $3 million.  </P> <P> Teicher's firm faces a $500,000 fine, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Carl H.  Loewenson.  </P> <P> Also convicted was Ross Frankel, 33, former head of arbitrage research at  now-defunct investment house Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He could receive as  much as 30 years in jail and a $1.5-million fine.  </P> <P> The verdict ends five days of jury deliberations over a case stemming from the  "Yuppie Five" insider trading case. Four young Wall Street professionals and a  client pleaded guilty in 1986 to making illegal stock trades based on inside  information about corporate takeovers that they had obtained through their  jobs.  </P> <P> Teicher and Frankel were convicted of trading the stocks of eight corporations  based on stolen information. Loewenson said he did not have a figure for the  total profits reaped from their trades.  </P></p>

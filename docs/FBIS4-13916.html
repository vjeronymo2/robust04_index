			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, 23 Apr (INA)--Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Rafi'i,  secretary of the Lebanon Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th  Party and former member of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, has  condemned the Lebanese Government's decision to sever diplomatic  ties with Iraq, describing it as a decision that is lacking in  patriotic and pan-Arab sentiments, as well as any legal or  legitimate grounds.    In statements carried by Arab and foreign media  organizations  in Nicosia, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Rafi'i asserted that the  Lebanese people cannot but be supportive of Iraq, which has  strongly nurtured their struggle in the course of their defense  of their national unity and promoted their steadfastness on  their national soil to enable them to liberate it from the filth  of the Zionist enemy.    Al-Rafi'i noted that the Lebanese Government's decision to  sever ties with Iraq is part of a conspiratorial scenario  targeting both Iraq and Lebanon.    Al-Rafi'i urged the nationalist and pan-Arab forces that are  opposed to the subjugation of the Lebanese political  decisionmaking process to close their ranks and overlook their  differences to save Lebanon from the current state of loss and  thwart the schemes that aim to eliminate its sovereignty.    Al-Rafi'i also condemned the campaign of arrests targeting  nationalist and pan-Arab figures in Lebanon, which is coupled  with another campaign aimed to muzzle intellectual freedom and  heavily censor various Lebanese media organizations.</p>

The SP statement was  made by the SP vice chairman, Servet Pellumbi, and Deputy  Bashkim Zeneli on January 10, who said that a further  declaration on the subject would be forthcoming the next day.    However, Mr. Zeneli subsequently informed our reporter that  the SP had not yet marshalled the data to substantiate their  charges. Several days have now passed without further word from  the SP.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Key US index signals growth acceleration A SURGE in the purchasing managers' index - a closely followed barometer of industrial conditions - yesterday signalled an acceleration in the momentum of US economic recovery. The index rose to 56.3 per cent last month against 51.3 per cent in April. This was the strongest reading for three years and well above financial markets' expectations. 'It's the gong that announces the recovery is here to stay,' said Mr David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey Lanston, the New York broker. Growth was likely to accelerate from an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in the first quarter to 3-3.5 per cent during the summer, he said. Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Companies in Chicago, said the surge in the index pointed to strong growth in industrial production as companies rebuilt inventories after the lengthy downturn. Rebuilding of inventories could add 1.5 percentage points to the growth rate in the current quarter, he said. The index is usually a reliable guide to economic trends. It dipped between March and April but is now decisively above the 50 per cent threshold indicating expansion in manufacturing. Components of the index pointed almost unanimously to sustained recovery. The index for new orders rose to 61 per cent, against 56.7 per cent in April. Indices for export orders, production and prices rose sharply. The employment index also rose significantly, but remained below the 50 per cent threshold indicating growth of jobs. Other economic data released yesterday were less encouraging, but related to April when the economy seemed to experience a dip. The Commerce Department said personal income rose only 0.1 per cent in April, the second month of sluggish growth after a sharp rise in February. After allowing for inflation, disposable incomes fell 0.2 per cent. In real terms, personal consumption spending rose 0.1 per cent in April, following a 0.5 per cent decline a month earlier. Official figures also showed a 0.3 per cent decline in construction spending in April following a strong gain in March.

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Santos bid clears court hurdle THE full bench of Australia's federal court yesterday refused to overturn an earlier decision not to grant an interim injunction blocking a ADollars 560m (USDollars 400m) hostile bid by Santos, the Australian energy group, for Sagasco Holdings. The ruling followed an application by Sagasco, a rival energy group, and the Trade Practices Commission, which contended that the takeover would breach competition regulations. The decision means that Santos can proceed with the bid, but will still face a full court hearing of the substantive issues raised by Sagasco and the TPC, probably in March. The court accepted that Santos would be capable of divesting its proposed holding in Sagasco if it was found at the substantive hearing to be in breach of the Corporations Law. The TPC argued that the acquisition would give Santos an unacceptable monopoly over gas reserves in most of Australia. The TPC said the market power which would accrue to Santos would be increased if a parallel bid by Sagasco for Magellan Petroleum goes ahead. Sagasco was offered for sale in mid-July when the South Australian state government put its 57 per cent stake up for tender. Sagasco shares closed four cents higher at ADollars 2.54 while Santos shares were 1 cent up at ADollars 2.44.</p>

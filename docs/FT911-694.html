			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Prices indicate values to bottom out in spring THE decline in commercial property values is expected to bottom out next spring, according to the prices posted in the first day of the London Futures and Options Exchange property futures market, writes Vanessa Houlder, Property Correspondent. Prices indicated that the Investment Property Databank capital value index would fall 2.5 per cent between March 1991 and March 1992, but then rise steadily. Volume was three-quarters of that expected. There was little business in the commercial rental values, house price and residential mortgage rate contracts. By the end of the day contracts valued at Pounds 15m had changed hands. Mr Jon Payne, business development director, said he was 'pretty happy'. But Mr Tim Bolton-Carter of James Capel, a designated broker for the market, said that trading had been 'a little disappointing'. Business was concentrated in the commercial value contracts, which accounted for 126 of the 152 lots traded. Most of the activity was in the contracts relating to the coming year. Fox said trading was by a range of brokers, end users and traders dealing on their own account. One broker said that the slow trading reflected the conservative nature of the property profession. The thinly-traded commercial rental value contracts implied a decline of nearly 3.5 per cent in the next year. Futures on the Nationwide Anglia house price index also showed a bearish trend to September this year, although they predicted a rise in house prices by December. Mortgage futures prices indicated an average building society mortgage rate of just less than 12 per cent in December this year.</p>

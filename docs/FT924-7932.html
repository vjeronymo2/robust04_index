			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: John Waddington moves ahead 18% to Pounds 7.76m JOHN WADDINGTON, the packaging, printing and games company, reported higher interim profits, helped by the absence of exceptional charges. Pre-tax profits increased by 17.6 per cent to Pounds 7.76m in the 26 weeks to October 3, up from Pounds 6.59m in the corresponding period last year when profits were reduced by a Pounds 1.04m charge in exceptional costs to cover redundancy and relocation costs. Earnings per share increased to 7p (6.12p), and the interim dividend is unchanged at 3.6p. Despite 'extremely difficult trading conditions' sales volumes increased in most businesses and margins improved in all three divisions. The margin gain was attributed to the group's capital investment programme and savings produced by last year's cost reduction programmes. Operating profits from continuing businesses increased by 5.8 per cent to Pounds 9.48m (Pounds 8.95m) on turnover which was flat at Pounds 108m (Pounds 107.6m) reflecting weak market prices. Discontinued operations last time added Pounds 442,000 to operating profits and Pounds 7.25m to turnover. In the packaging division operating profits increased to Pounds 5.68m (Pounds 5.44m), despite a 3 per cent decline in sales to Pounds 61.6m (Pounds 63.6m) which reflected the impact of the dollar's weakness on the group's US plastic food-services business. Waddingtons Cartons' sales volume grew by 15 per cent, helped by significant growth in some of the company's main accounts. However, the group's label business experienced difficulties after Waddingtons of Gateshead lost a large Heinz contract, resulting in a Pounds 400,000 operating loss and the need to make further cost cuts, including redundancies. Operating profits in the business forms and specialist printing division rose to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.59m) on sales which increased to Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 32m). Waddingtons Business Forms continued to suffer the effects of overcapacity in the industry, but the group's two specialist printing companies, Chorleys and House of Questa, improved sales and profits. The games division, responsible for some of Waddington's best-known board games, such as Cluedo and Monopoly, also performed well despite the difficult retail market trading conditions. Trading profits improved slightly to Pounds 2.02m (Pounds 1.92m) on sales marginally higher at 12.4m (Pounds 12m).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jean Beyls report: "Two-Speed Europe Unavoidable"] </F>   [Text] Karel van Miert, vice president of the European  Commission (EC), spoke yesterday [16 May] at the International  Relations Organization (VIRA) forum on the subject "More Europe  or Less Europe?" "There are two issues: The apparent gulf  between the European public and European bureaucracy and the  controversy over the transfer of responsibilities," he said.  "Some years ago this choice of title for a talk would have been  inconceivable; it would have seemed ridiculous or  Moscow-inspired. But now the advocates of European building  must come to terms with a challenge to its very principle, as  well as doubts and unenthusiasm. This was not serious as long  as the very foundations of Europe were not threatened, but this  is happening now, and publicly too. Mrs. Thatcher has gained  converts, and not only in Italy. In other words, to be a  European now means to expose yourself to suspicion or  marginalization," Van Miert explained.  <H5>  Minimalist Europe </H5>   "The Paris-Bonn axis is no longer the heart of European  action. Paris is not happy about Europe's enlargement or about  Germany's growing influence, so much so that it is becoming an  internal French problem of balance," Karel van Miert continued.  "But there is more to it than that: Every member state is  engaging in an increasingly sharp debate on its financial  contribution and on what benefits its derives in terms of  budgets and transfers. Germany and Spain stand out in this  regard. This kind of inter-Belgian debate, with which we are  well acquainted, is now developing throughout the Europe of the  Twelve. We have even heard remarks that indicate a negative  attitude with regard to aid to Palestine. Thus the minimalist  Europe is gaining ground. The possible elimination of the  Commission is even being suggested. Such ideas are being  advocated publicly and even in election campaigns."  <H5>  Positive Aspects of Europe </H5>   Nevertheless, Karel van Miert believes that the advocates of  Europe must go back onto the offensive more. And that they have  every justification for doing so. "First, there is the historic  necessity for European unification, which guarantees peace in  Western Europe. Furthermore, if we slide down the slippery  slope of nationalisms, nobody knows where the trend could lead.  And threats of confrontation could reemerge, doubtless more  quickly than is imagined." And this is why the European  commissioner considers populism and hypernationalism major and  very dangerous faults.    "Last, there is the entire internal dynamic of the great  European market, despite certain shortcomings, compromise  decisions, and disappointments. It is leading to the  liberalization of markets in both telecommunications and air  transport. It is a difficult transition, but the change will  enable Europe to meet the challenges presented by the United  States and Japan worldwide."    "This dynamism also occurs in other fields, such as  audiovisual media. The Commission is currently examining some  20 cases: The disputes are between the public and private  sectors, the national and the regional, while major groups are  being established to implement the latest advances in computer  technology and other innovations. The dispute extends to sports  and to the broadcasting of soccer matches." "I also note,"  Karel van Miert said, "that it is often the countries that most  criticize European building that are also most demanding in  terms of community directives." "Experience also shows that  major principles are not enough if they are not accompanied by  specific instructions for their implementation. Last, within  the growing interdependence, of which even the Germans are now  becoming more aware, in the light of their own difficulties,  European Monetary Union also appears to be a necessity. And the  Twelve absolutely must reach agreement on this."  <H5>  Crucial Issues </H5>   Having described the negative and positive aspects of the EU  today, the EC vice president concluded by saying that "the EU  enlargement will raise some crucial issues. He fears blockages,  because individual members will from time to time raise  questions, as in connection with the accession of Malta and  Cyprus. The EU foreign and defense policy also suffers as a  result of this. At the institutional level, some major member  states are unwilling to accept that the rotating presidency be  granted to minor states."    "Last, there is the huge cost of the envisaged enlargement.  In order to achieve it it will be necessary to increase the  Union's resources `enormously.' And there is therefore a danger  of lapsing into a policy of expedience." Karel van Miert  therefore thought it inevitable that the trend would be toward a  two-speed Europe. This prospect has become unavoidable.    "To pretend otherwise would be to lie to the public," he  said. "Some countries are tired of waiting for new progress on  the road to union. Some member states must also realize that at  the end of the transition period they must better honor the  obligations connected with their EU membership. This also  applies to Switzerland, which citing its democratic aspirations,  is trying to establish new relations with the Twelve, in the  belief that it can derive the maximum benefits for the minimum  of drawbacks and offsets."</p>

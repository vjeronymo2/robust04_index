			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For most tenants, the amount of the utility allowance is less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the amount they are required to pay toward their rent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including utilities. In most cases, the utility allowance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves no direct payment to the household, but is merely a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit reducing the household's contribution to the landlord. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the utility allowance exceeds the rent that can be charged for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dwelling, the excess is paid in the form of a ``utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement'' or rebate to the household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similar reimbursements are made to some rural low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Agriculture as part of its Rental Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program which provides, pursuant to 7 CFR pt. 1930, subpt. C; pt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1944, subpt. E, loans for housing in rural areas. Under the FmHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program, the borrower (the owner of the property) may apply for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rental Assistance for each tenant in the project who meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility criteria. The Rental Assistance payment equals the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between 30 percent of the household's income and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sum of the rent plus the utility allowance for the project. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tenant pays the utilities, the total Rental Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment from FmHA is made to the owner, who is obligated to pass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on to the tenant the portion allocated to utilities. When FmHA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility allowance is more than 30 percent of the household's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted income, the landlord is obligated to forward the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference to the tenant as a utility reimbursement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 5(d) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2014(d)), any income received by the household directly or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirectly must be counted in determining the household's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility and benefits, except for the exclusions listed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. Neither the Food Stamp Act nor current regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically address the treatment of HUD and FmHA utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursements. It is clear that Federal energy assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments are excluded by section 5(d)(11) of the Food Stamp Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the HUD and FmHA reimbursements are not provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically for energy assistance alone. Current policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires counting these HUD utility reimbursements as income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy is applicable nationwide except in jurisdictions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the reimbursements are excluded by judicial decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, it was our policy that utility reimbursements did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not qualify as energy assistance. In response to questions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the payments, we issued Policy Memo 90&hyph;6 addressing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD payments and Policy Memo 3&hyph;91&hyph;04 regarding FmHA payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy Memo 90&hyph;6 provides that any amount paid by HUD directly to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household as a utility reimbursement or indirectly to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility provider must be counted as income to the household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Policy Memo 3&hyph;91&hyph;04, the utility reimbursement paid by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landlord to the tenant is counted as income to the household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy has been maintained over several years and has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successfully defended in court on a number of occasions. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we believe the current policy is a permissible interpretation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute, we believe it is not in the best interest of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program to continue to litigate this issue. In reexamining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy, we have determined that there are several compelling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons to change the policy so as to exclude the utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursements in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, although the HUD and FmHA utility reimbursements are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided specifically for energy assistance, a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of a household's utility expense is for heating and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling. A change in policy to exclude the utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursements is not inconsistent with the specific exclusion in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 5(d)(11) of the Food Stamp Act and 7 CFR 273.9(c)(11) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal energy assistance. Excluding the utility reimbursements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the existing regulatory provision would achieve consistency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the treatment of Federal energy assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the current policy is inconsistent with the policy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program in most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. Increasing consistency between the Food Stamp and AFDC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs is a Department priority because it makes the Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simpler to administer and more understandable to households.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maintaining the current policy also causes inconsistent treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of households in subsidized housing between those in traditional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing whose utilities are included in their rent and households  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who are responsible for paying their own utility expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Excluding the utility reimbursements would provide greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency in treatment of various forms of housing assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a change in policy eliminates the need to maintain at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least two distinct and conflicting policies for the foreseeable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future because courts in some jurisdictions have affirmed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current policy and others have found it insupportable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this rule amends 7 CFR 273.9(c)(11) to provide that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments or allowances made for the purpose of providing energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance under any Federal law, including HUD and FmHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursements, are excluded from income. We are making a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conforming amendment to 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to provide that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility expense which is reimbursed or paid by an excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment, including HUD or FmHA utility payments, shall not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deductible. In accordance with Section 5(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2014(e), households that receive these payments will be entitled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use a standard utility allowance that includes a heating or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling component only if they incur heating or cooling costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that exceed the amount of the excluded payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

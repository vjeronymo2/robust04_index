			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP steps up Chinese exploration efforts BROKEN HILL Proprietary, the Australian steel and resources giant, is stepping up its involvement in China with new explorations ventures in oil and minerals. But its chairman, Mr Brian Loton, says the company is proceeding cautiously in a complex market. Speaking in Beijing at the weekend, Mr Loton said BHP's approach to China would be 'practical and hard-nosed', but at the same it recognised the growth of new opportunities now that the country was 'opening up'. The BHP chairman, who has tended to be regarded by company insiders as a 'China-sceptic', was visiting Beijing to assess an expanding range of options for BHP in both the resources and oil and gas sectors. He was received by Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, one of the Chinese leaders responsible for economic management, and officials of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries. Mr Loton said that representatives of BHP Petroleum would be visiting China later this month to examine possible involvement in exploration of the vast Tarim basin in the north-west, which has recently been opened to foreign companies and may have reserves to match those of Saudi Arabia. He stressed, however, that BHP on its own did not have the resources necessary to explore China's desert wastes. This indicated that BHP might join forces with an oil major in a Tarim basin venture. BHP's experiences looking for oil in China had not been encouraging, Mr Loton noted. It had, for example, drilled 23 dry wells in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River delta in a consortium with British Petroleum. He added, nevertheless, that these setbacks had 'not dimmed our enthusiasm,' and that BHP was either actively engaged in exploration or was evaluating opportunities in several offshore areas. These included the Bohai Gulf in northern Chinese waters, the South China Sea and areas off Hainan island in the south. BHP was also expected to bid for blocks in the East China Sea off Shanghai in June. The company was also spending about ADollars 4m to evaluate a lead/zinc prospect in Sichuan province in China's centre-west. This venture marks something of a first for a foreign company in the strategic minerals and metals area. China has tended to guard jealously its minerals and onshore oil and gas resources from foreign involvement, but with demands from the leadership for speedier economic development, officials are now beginning actively to seek assistance abroad. Mr Loton said that his company had no immediate plans for further minerals exploration ventures, but he also noted that China recognised the expertise of companies like BHP in both looking for and exploiting mineral deposits. China has barely scratched the surface of its minerals assets across a vast country. An obsession with gold - in the past two decades about 70 per cent of China's exploration resources were devoted to looking for the metal - has been a serious drag on overall minerals development. BHP's chairman and his fellow executives were bullish about the company's iron ore sales to China, which they expected would rise by about 10 per cent to some 5m tonnes in 1993. The sales are being driven by the extraordinary growth in the Chinese economy in the past year of 12.8 per cent, well up on revised growth targets of 9 per cent. China produced 78m tonnes of steel last year, making it the world's number three producer. It is aiming for 100m tonnes a year by 2000, which represents continuing good news for BHP and other Australian iron ore suppliers.</p>

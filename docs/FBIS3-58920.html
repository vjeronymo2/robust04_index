Tsai] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Jan. 19 (CNA) -- The Belgian Government's  decision to further simplify visa procedures for Taiwan  businessmen and tourists will certainly help boost ties between  the two countries, a spokesman for the Taipei Economic and  Cultural Office in Brussels said Wednesday [19 January].    Belgium's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a notice to all  its consular offices on January 10 announcing new visa measures  for Taiwan visitors, the spokesman noted.    Under the new measures, Taiwan tourists or businessmen will  be issued visas at the Belgian Trade Association in Taipei.    And when applying for a Belgian visa in a third country,  Taiwan visitors who were granted a visa in the previous two  years will be processed without the need for approval by  Belgium's Foreign Ministry.    Earlier, the Brussels government simplified visa procedures  for Taiwan students who want to pursue advanced studies in  Belgium.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Swedish Match to return to Sweden in Procordia deal PROCORDIA, the Swedish food and pharmaceutical conglomerate jointly owned by Volvo and the Swedish state, has reached a preliminary agreement to purchase Swedish Match, the world's leading match and disposable lighter manufacturer. Swedish Match will become a subsidiary of Procordia's tobacco and confectionery business, Procordia United Brands, after negotiations are completed by the end of next month. Procordia United Brands will then have total annual sales of at least SKr8bn (Pounds 760m) and employ nearly 10,000 workers in 20 countries. The purchase price and other financial details were not disclosed. However, Mr Klaus Unger, president of Procordia United Brands, said the acquisition of Swedish Match would double its annual sales in Europe to SKr2.4bn. Swedish Match has about 75 per cent of the UK market through its Bryant &amp; May and Swan Vesta brands. Mr Massimo Rossi, president of Swedish Match, said: 'We have now reached a fine solution and feel that Swedish Match will be entering into the best possible industrial environment.' Mr Rossi said he would continue to run Swedish Match after the acquisition. Swedish Match is owned by an international consortium which includes Citicorp Venture Capital in London; Continental Holdings; the Italian Lavajji group; and Monforte, an Italian merchant bank. The company has passed through a number of owners since it was acquired for SKr5.9bn as a diverse industrial group by Stora, the Swedish forestry giant in March 1988. In November 1989 Stora sold Swedish Match consumer products, which included Wilkinson Sword, for SKr3.93bn to a group of international investors including Gillette of the US who registered the company in Holland. As a result of the deal, Swedish Match became the subject of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation in Britain which ruled in March last year that Gillette had to undo the effect of the merger in the UK market. Swedish Match's homecoming will appeal to many Swedes. The company holds a sentimental place in the country's industrial history going back to the 1920s when it dominated the world match market under the Swedish industrialist Mr Ivar Kreuger who shot himself in 1932 when his industrial empire collapsed.</p>

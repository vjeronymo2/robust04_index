			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Revolutionary Concepts" column: "Trust Beats </F> Weapons--Japanese and Chinese Officers To Open Dialogue"]    [Text] The "Leak" Is Welcomed?    On 20 December, Sino-Japanese working-level talks were held  in Beijing on security issues. At the beginning of the talks,  the Japanese delegation was surprised when Chinese officials  hinted they would welcome a "leak" of topics to be discussed at  the bilateral talks. An official said: "While Asian nations  used to feel the `Japan threat,' this is now being replaced by  the `China threat.' We would like to explain our policy  thoroughly, and to obtain Asia's understanding. Japan can  explain us to other nations." During the talks, the Chinese  officials repeated their assertion: "We are just trying to  maintain the minimum military strength for national defense."  However, the Japanese Government conveyed the Chinese  standpoint to the Asian nations through diplomatic channels.    In January, Japan and China agreed to hold the first  security  talks between the Defense Agency and Chinese Defense Ministry in  Beijing in February. Japan feels bad about its wartime  aggression, and China is changing through rapid economic growth  under the opening-up policy. The two nations are going to open  up military exchanges for the first time in the 50 years since  World War II. In post-Cold War Asia, the two nations are  beginning to seek new security relations.    The Sino-Japanese security talks by defense authorities were  advocated by the Defense Agency. Last November, (former)  Director General of the Defense Agency Keisuke Nakanishi  secretly told (former) U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin: "As  director general of the Defense Agency, I would like to visit  China. I want to go there as soon as possible -- probably  during the cherry blossom season." In reply, Aspin said: "That  is a good idea. But we would like you to inform us of what  China says." Nakanishi's true intentions are seen in the 1993  defense white paper.    The 1993 white paper has a new section entitled: "Efforts To  Establish a New Security Environment." In this section, the  paper notes "promotion of international exchanges with foreign  military officials will directly deepen mutual understanding  with these nations." And it stresses "further promotion of  dialogue is needed" especially for security in the Asia and  Pacific region. In view of the presence of various ethnic and  religious groups, the Defense Agency has a plan to establish  regional security through a network of bilateral exchanges with  various nations, rather than a multinational agreement. In this  sense, China is the biggest target to achieve this objective.    The security policy of postwar Japan has been promoted under  a liberal interpretation of the peace constitution. Even under  such circumstances, the Defense Agency and Self-Defense Forces  [SDF] have always been "bit players" in the nation's postwar  history. Although the SDF's role in UN peacekeeping operations  has been positively discussed since the Gulf war, the conclusion  of the cold war has led the world into an era of disarmament to  enjoy the "dividends of peace." The significance of the Defense  Agency is now in question since the Hosokawa administration  pledged an SDF scale-down through reviewing the nation's defense  buildup plan.  <H5>  Security Is Ensured Through Exchanges </H5>   What is the role of the "outlawry-of-war forces" in national  security in the new era? In reply to the question, the Defense  Agency is preparing the following answer: "To ensure national  security, exchanges of military officials should be promoted to  deepen mutual confidence with neighboring nations." The agency  is seeking Japan's initiative in confidence-building efforts in  Asia to overcome the trend of SDF rationalization.    Since the Tiananmen Square incident, China has been seeking  better ties with neighboring nations, such as the ROK and SRV.  However, these Asian nations are becoming wary of China's naval  force buildup and policy for the Spratly and Paracels Islands.    In this regard, the Defense Agency believes China will deal  positively in security talks with Japan. A top agency official  said he wants to hold talks on a regular basis, and noted: "The  Chinese military authorities have close relations with the CPC  leadership. That is why we attach importance to rerect dialogue  with the Chinese Defense Ministry."    The Defense Agency already has frequent exchanges with  most Asian nations except China. The National Defense Academy  and staff colleges of the Ground, Maritime, and Air SDF  currently have 315 foreign-national students from 14 countries,  including the ROK and Thailand. In return, some Air SDF  officers are scheduled to study at the ROK air staff college  this year.    The National Institute for Defense Studies also receives  military officials of Asian nations to dispel their suspicion  that "Japan may again step onto the trail of past wrongdoing."  As one of the guests, vice commandant of the Philippines  National Defense Academy said: "I have learned Japanese people  are not jingoistic."  <H5>  Seeking the Initiative </H5>   Senior Defense Agency officials noted that international  exchanges in this field are helpful to obtain neighboring  nations' understanding of Japan's prudent defense policy,  saying: "As a major economic power, Japan is certainly qualified  to take the initiative in confidence-building efforts in Asia."    On the other hand, international politics analyst Kazuhisa  Ogawa said: "National security should be discussed in view of  not only military affairs, but also food and energy policies.  For example, Malaysia has a think tank called the Institute for  International Policies. The institute has policymaking  authority superior to the Defense Ministry and other government  agencies. But Japan has no mechanism which overcomes  bureaucratic sectionalism. The Defense Agency should not  believe it can take the initiative in Asia without help from  other government agencies."    Mutual trust between military officials is superior to the  deterrent force of ultramodern weapons--will Asia accept such a  proposal made by a nation with a peace constitution?</p>

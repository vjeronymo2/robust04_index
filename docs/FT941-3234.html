			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Sheerness ferry service to end Olau Line, the German shipping company, is to end its ferry service between Sheerness in Kent and Vlissingen in the Netherlands. Mersey Docks and Harbour, which owns Sheerness Docks, yesterday declined to comment on the impact of the decision, but figures given to employees before it took over Medway Ports in September suggest that the service contributed about 11 per cent of turnover of Pounds 31m in 1991. The Pounds 103m takeover caused a row because 270 dockers dismissed three months before for refusing to accept new work practices had been obliged to sell back shares to the company for Pounds 2.50, while the takeover price was Pounds 37.25 a share.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Management: Mixed benefits of registration - Case study: Musthave postpones plans for certification Musthave (UK), a small haulage and warehousing company was well on the way to registering for BS5750 when business started to turn down. Having spent 'a couple of thousand pounds' on consultancy fees and two months of his time preparing the documentation, Stuart Baldock, the owner and managing director, was reluctant to scrap the project. He decided to shelve his plans for registration but to maintain the systems he had set up until demand improves. In the meantime, he says, he follows procedures which are equivalent to BS5750 even though he does not have the certification logo. 'When demand dropped off we thought 'What is the point of tying up a couple of thousand pounds when the money could be employed elsewhere?' We run all our procedures so that the certification body could come in. We will definitely go for certification when things turn up.' With turnover of Pounds 380,000 and a workforce of 20, the St Neots, Cambridgeshire company is typical of smaller businesses which have had to weigh up very carefully the costs and the benefits of registration. Baldock does not believe that conforming to BS5750 procedures has yet saved him any money. 'I run the business so I can watch every penny. I sign all the cheques and can make sure that the customer gets what he wants 99.9 per cent of the time,' he says. What the quality standard does do is 'minimise the potential for cock-ups.' It defines everyone's job and imposes a procedure for handling customers from the moment the telephone rings through to processing the orders, Baldock explains. Even so Baldock believes BS5750 is probably more relevant in the larger company, where departments do not communicate so easily with each other. Introducing BS5750-style procedures is not the end of the matter. It requires the company's quality representative, in Musthave's case it is Baldock himself, to keep a close eye on the way the system is running. 'Someone has to be on top of it all the time,' he says. If people on the shop floor discover a better way of doing things then the system can be changed. But sometimes people are reluctant to report changes. The quality representative has to make sure that shopfloor practice is not out of line with the procedures which are recorded in the quality manual or modify the manual. Despite the commitment Baldock has made to BS5750 he is ambivalent about its benefits for the smaller, owner-managed business. 'When business dropped off we decided to concentrate on saving money,' he says. 'In our business you can't put your rates up to cover the extra costs involved.'</p>

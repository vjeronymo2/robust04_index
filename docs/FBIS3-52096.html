[Sha'th] Good evening to you.    [Mu'addi] You have been holding intensive consultations and  contacts. You have received a letter from the Israeli foreign  minister. What is it about?    [Sha'th] The foreign minister's letter was in reply to one  from us on 30 December. He indicated he was prepared to return  for another round of talks in Taba. However, he makes this  return conditional on our acceptance of what he called the Cairo  agreement. Actually, we are ready to return to complete these  negotiations tomorrow to hammer out an integrated pact to  implement the Declaration of Principles agreement. We made it  clear to Minister Peres that there is no Cairo agreement in  existence. There are working papers that were drafted in Cairo.  We are bound by the points on which we reached agreement. As  for the points on which disagreement persists, we are ready to  discuss them in Taba. That is what negotiations are about. We  consolidate what was agreed upon and the pending issues may be  pursued if we went to Taba, hopefully soon.    [Mu'addi] The prime minister stated today that the document  of understanding worked out in Cairo had the approval of the  Israeli and Palestinian sides.    [Sha'th] Let met put the record straight: There is no such  thing as a document of understanding from Cairo. Minister Peres  knows as much. On the night of 28 December, he drafted minutes  written in longhand. On the following day we received a draft  far removed from the minutes. On the third day, I sent him a  clarification of this memorandum, including the points on which  we reached agreement in Norway. I have not yet received word  from him indicating his approval of any of these formulas. None  of these formulas amount to a document of understanding. One is  labelled minutes, the second a draft, the third a working paper.  We would like to know what is this Cairo document. These  minutes were supposed to be sent to the leaderships of both  sides for their approval. We sent them to the Palestinian  leadership in Tunis, and they okayed part of them, and expressed  reservations about the other parts. We want to return to Taba  to talk about all these issues.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what's next then? Is the Palestinian  side waiting for the Israeli response?    [Sha'th] I have just sent our response to Peres, which is,  by and large, positive. We are ready to return to the talks to  pick up where we left off in Cairo. We are also bound by the  Declaration of Principles. I hope the Israeli response will,  this time, be positive.    [Mu'addi] Egypt's Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said today the  Taba talks may resume next Tuesday.    [Sha'th] That's fine by us.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you so much.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

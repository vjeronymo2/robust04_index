			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORCORAN GALLERY APOLOGIZES FOR CANCELLATION OF EXHIBIT  </P> <P> The director and executive trustees of the embattled Corcoran Gallery of Art  issued a statement Monday expressing "regret" for offending members of the arts  community with their cancellation of a show of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs,  and said: "Our course in the future will be to support art, artists and freedom  of artistic expression."  </P> <P> Corcoran Director Christina Orr-Cahall said the significance of Monday's action  "is really not about the statement per se; it's about the fact that the  statement is real and that the trustees and I do feel regret and felt that the  approach we took did not work. . . . It was a failed strategy and probably on  my part naive. That's much more important than any piece of paper or  statement."  </P> <P> When she announced the cancellation in June, Orr-Cahall said she hoped to avoid  exacerbating a growing political crisis surrounding the National Endowment for  the Arts and federal funding of controversial art. She and others involved in  the decision have previously expressed regret for any distress their action  gave artists, using much the same language as they did Monday.  </P> <P> But unlike this statement, earlier comments have not been offered as apologies.  "This is a symbolic gesture," Orr-Cahall explained, "and one that we needed to  make and that we wanted to make. The Corcoran's strategy had not been  successful, clearly, and we needed to really make a statement that let the  artistic community know where we stood."  </P> <P> The full statement reads: "The Corcoran Gallery of Art, in attempting to defuse  the NEA funding controversy by removing itself from the political spotlight,  has instead found itself in the center of controversy. By withdrawing from the  Mapplethorpe exhibition, we, the board of trustees and the director, have  inadvertently offended many members of the arts community, which we deeply  regret.  </P> <P> "Our course in the future will be to support art, artists and freedom of  artistic expression."  </P> <P> Over the last 3 1/2 months, the Corcoran has been buffeted by criticism from  the art world, an artists' boycott that has forced the cancellation of two  exhibitions and endangered a third, as well as the withdrawal by artist Lowell  Nesbitt of more than $1 million in property and art that he had intended to  will the museum.  </P> <P> "Far-out!" said Nesbitt when the statement was read to him. "It's a little bit  overdue, but I am very happy that they could bring themselves to make that  statement. It is long overdue."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeks Proof  </P> <P> However, Nesbitt said that although that portion of his estate intended for the  Corcoran will end up in Washington, he will not return it to the gallery.  "Their position has yet to be proven," said Nesbitt, adding that its  destination is still being negotiated. Painter Annette Lemieux, who canceled  her one-woman show that had been scheduled to open at the Corcoran next month,  was more skeptical. "That's very safe," she said of the statement.  </P> <P> Orr-Cahall said that the statement was only the first "dramatic step forward"  in a campaign still under development to win back the respect and cooperation  of the artistic community. She said she had spoken earlier in the day to some  of the artists who have withdrawn from Corcoran shows, and that "they seem  pleased. I think they recognize it as a major step on the part of the  Corcoran."  </P></p>

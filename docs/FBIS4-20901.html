			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Academician Sergey Nikitich </F> Kovalev, general designer of nuclear submarine missile carriers,  by Sergey Ptichkin; place and date not given: "The Storm of  Reforms Is Stronger Than the `Typhoon'"]    [Text] I went to see Academician Sergey Nikitich  Kovalev, general designer of nuclear submarine missile carriers,  with one purpose in mind: To ask him to discuss the history of  the creation of the sea-based strategic system Typhoon, which is  the pinnacle of shipbuilding thought of the 20th century. But  the interview did not work out. Sergey Nikitich delivered a  passionate monologue on what, in his opinion, had made Russia a  great power and what guarantees its greatness in today's  world.    Russia is about to celebrate the 300th anniversary of its  Navy -- Kovalev smiled sadly. An organizing committee was even  created to prepare for the celebration. But what will we  celebrate?    When Peter the Great was building ships, the entire country  was watching. Every indentured serf knew that when the tsar  introduced new taxes he would put the people's money mainly into  the construction of a fleet for the powerful country. As they  would say nowadays, Peter I was implementing a nationwide  program at that time. Since that time, serving in the Russian  Navy has been tantamount to serving the Homeland...    When the Americans began to launch the first nuclear  submarines, the entire country was watching this great  experiment. Everyone understood that a program that was costly  but vitally necessary to the United States was being implemented.    Our nuclear fleet was built under the cover of strict  secrecy  and nobody knew the difficulties that were surmounted by our  scientists, engineers, and workers in order to preserve for  Russia the status of a great naval power.    When the United States began to carry out the great  strategic  project Trident, the whole world was watching this.    And few people knew that at that same time -- a year later,  actually -- the USSR had begun to create an analogous strategic  system, the Typhoon. Without any grandstanding we solved the  most difficult problems, and with much less cost than the  Americans did. We were able to have our own sea-based strategic  weapons system, which is equal to the Trident, in place at  practically the same time as they did theirs.    It was having the Typhoon in place that put an end to the  nuclear missile arms race between the USSR and the United  States, although for some reason people have always remained  silent about this and spoken only about mobile land-based  missiles, which were supposed to have created the parity we all  know about. No! Only the sea-based strategic forces that  appeared in the USSR in response to the American challenge  showed that there was no point in further increasing nuclear  weapons.    And now I have to talk about something I do not want to  mention since it is stupid to put questions of the development  of Russia's strategic forces up to public plebiscites; they  should be decided in the corresponding staffs by specialists who  are professionally trained for this. But the situation is  developing in such a way that today even we people who are not  used to public speeches have to appeal directly to the citizens  of Russia through the media for moral support.    What kind of country will we have to greet the 21st century:  Either the great world power which it still is to this day, in  spite of all the disorder, or indeed a likeness of "Upper Volta  with missiles?"... This is by no means about another round of  the arms race. On the contrary, it is about more efficient  expenditure of the scanty state funds, about the possibility of  preserving Russia's national independence in reality and not on  paper.    The fact is that today it has become especially crucial to  decide the future of Russia's strategic nuclear forces and which  to give priority to.    At the present time we are just developing the concept of  strategic weapons, which should be fully in keeping with the  defense doctrine we adopt. And it does not seem quite right to  me to publish articles of an openly promotional nature like the  one in IZVESTIYA of 9 February under the heading "Topols Will  Defend Russia" or openly defamatory ones like the one in  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS for 26 March.    Incidentally, today it has become acceptable to write only  bad things about the fleet, so it is probably not worthwhile to  respond to every "critical" article which is especially written  in street language. The article that appeared in IZVESTIYA is a  different matter, since the declarative heading itself seems to  proclaim unambiguously: The decision has been made, only Topol  land-based mobile missile complexes can defend Russia.    In a brief newspaper article it is impossible, of course, to  go into a detailed comparative description of various kinds of  strategic weapons, but precisely as a result of a detailed  comparison it would be possible to prove convincingly that it is  by no means land-based missiles but only strategic sea-based  forces, which are fully in keeping with the defense doctrine,  that are capable of defending Russia from any attack.    The fact is that only sea-based missile complexes have an  immense advantage over land-based in terms of their ability to  be retargeted to any object. There are many tactical devices to  guarantee the concealment of submarine missile carriers, as  distinct from land-based missiles, which are constant targets.  Moreover the probability of destroying missiles launched from  fixed starting positions (silo or "mobile") is considerably  greater than those that start from under water. And, finally, a  responsive missile volley even from just one submarine that has  survived is much more effective than a volley from dozens of  Topols which by some miracle have survived after the first  aggressive enemy attack.    But, I repeat, all these are specialized issues which the  public must accept on faith or else not believe at all. We love  to refer to the American experience. So let us look at what the  Americans are doing today in the area of their own nuclear  missile forces.    The United States made a decision to completely do away with  land-based complexes, giving all priority to sea-based forces  alone. The fact is that the Americans quite reasonably saw that  in the future land-based complexes could not be used as  counterattack missiles; they are good only for those who have  aggressive intentions.    After investing a good deal of effort and money in the  creation of the most complicated MX mobile missile system, the  United States today is abandoning this complex as well. The  Pentagon has recognized that even on the excellent American  roads it is quite dangerous to transport nuclear missiles, which  are exposed to everything, be it military aggression or a  terrorist act.    Today land-based nuclear missile complexes present a greater  threat to the territory on which they are located and which they  are intended to defend than they do to a hypothetical enemy. So  by refraining from further development of strategic missiles on  their territory, the Americans are actually showing concern for  the safety of the United States and their compatriots. Perhaps  our common sense should not be so different from that of the  Americans. We must simply understand that land-based strategic  missiles with any base have fulfilled their historic role and in  the future should be mothballed altogether.    The only effective means of restraining and preventing  aggression both for the Americans and for us are sea-based  strategic weapons systems.  <H5>  OUR NOTE </H5>   For many years Sergey Nikitich Kovalev was one of the most  concealed designers of our Homeland's defense complex. And he  probably did more to establish the USSR nuclear submarine fleet  than was done in the United States by Admiral David Rickover,  who was practically a national hero across the ocean. Well, we  sometimes do not know our own defense industry heroes as well as  we do foreign ones. But they are the ones, these hidden  academicians, who created the potential of hidden power that  makes it possible for Russia's leaders to feel that they are  leaders of a great power.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guarai, Tocantins, 6 Jun (AE) -- Federal Police have  captured 10 of the 11 drug traffickers involved in the operation  to transport 7.3 metric tons of cocaine to the United States.  This has been the largest seizure of drugs worldwide so far this  year and the largest in Brazilian history. For security reasons,  the 10 prisoners will be transferred to Brasilia on 7 June, in  accordance with decision by Silvane Parfieniuk, acting judge of  Guarai County Court. The prisoners were arrested after an  intense shootout during which Colombian drug trafficker Humberto  Vasquez was wounded. He has been hospitalized in Araguaina,  Tocantins State.    Federal Police had been preparing the operation for a month,  and were assisted by investigators from Sao Paulo, Parana, and  Amazonas States. Police were able to arrest the drug traffickers  and seize the 7.3 metric tons of cocaine through information  from an informer. Federal Police Inspector Sergio Sakon said:  "We do not have crystal balls." The cocaine was to be taken to  Santos Port, Sao Paulo State, and then shipped to the United  States.    The head of the gang--Lebanese-born Nasrat Mohamad Jamil  Rossauz, who has Brazilian citizenship--is married and lives in  Foz de Iguacu, where he has an electronic appliance store. Also  arrested were Colombians Marcelo Rodrigues, Mario Alberto Graca,  and Gilberto Wigando Scholze, as well as Brazilians Herbert  Gouveia Barcelos, Jose David Hadad, Jill Sandro Mimikoski, and  Carlos Henrique Barcelos.    Thirty Federal Police agents are chasing Colombian Vicentico  [Vicente Wilson Rivera-Ramos], the gang's big boss. He is the  son of drug trafficker Vicente Gonzalez Rivera, who is being  sought by police in several countries, including Brazil.  According to Federal Police, Vicentico still is at large and  must be hiding somewhere in Tocantins State.  <H5>  Operation </H5>   The 7.3 metric tons of the drug were hidden in two trucks  rented by the gang and concealed in the middle of a tobacco leaf  cargo. The gang created an export company to take the tobacco to  the United States. Federal Police, however, did not reveal the  company's name. Inspector Sergio Sakon believes that the  dismantling of this gang in Brazil will result in several  arrests in the United States, Colombia, and other countries  involved in the drug trafficking route. A consortium of 14  processing laboratories was established to process the drug  cargo. Sakon still does not know whether the cocaine came from  the Cali or Medellin cartel. The drug was packed in one-kilogram  bricks and had tags with the name of famous brands such as  Platino, UFA, Polar, Zorro, Coca-Colo, and Professional.    According to estimates by policemen who participated in the  operation, after being mixed with other products the cargo would  yield 55 metric tons of cocaine, i.e., 55 million one-gram  cocaine doses. On the market, the drug would be sold for a total  of $130 million. Nasrat, however, did not want to comment on how  much he would be paid to transport the drug. "I will only  testify before the courts," he said.    The 7.3 metric tons of cocaine will be transferred to  Brasilia on 7 June to be burned. Sakon asserted that the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Administration did not participate in any stage  of the operation. "The operation's success is due entirely to  the Brazilian Federal Police," he said. In the operation,  Federal Police also seized AR-14 rifles, machine guns, and  grenades, in addition to a large quantity of ammunition.    The police questioning will take place in Brasilia. The drug  traffickers have been arrested under Law No. 8072/90, the  hideous crimes law. These crimes have no bail. After being  tried, each person can be sentenced to a maximum of 30 years in  jail. Except for Vicentico, no other member of this gang had  been arrested previously by Brazilian police.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Statsenko: "What Did Sobchak Mean?"] </F>   [Text] Appearing on TV on 29 March, Mayor of St.  Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak announced that the law enforcement  organs, with support from the military, would shortly mount an  extensive offensive against the criminal underworld. What did  our mayor mean?    In the words of GUVD [Main Directorate of Internal Affairs]  Chief Arkadiy Kramarev, it is indeed planned to conduct a  special operation similar to "Signal-2" this spring (the  beginning date of the operation has already been determined, but  it is an official secret). The internal troops of the  Northwestern District of the Internal Troops of the Russian  Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs and assets of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia will be used in the  operation. The chief of the Main Directorate did not know  whether Sobchak meant this operation when he declared a war on  organized crime.    The staff of Lieutenant General Leonid Chervotkin, commander  of the Northwestern District of the Internal Troops of the  Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs, explained to  our correspondent that the Internal Troops have always provided  support for the militia in combating violations of law, and will  do so in the future. However, they have nothing to do with the  army because they belong to the organization of the Ministry of  Internal Affairs. In the opinion of the commander's adjutant,  the mayor's words on "support from the military" most likely  refer to the army. They could not give us an intelligible answer  at the Leningrad Military District, either. Nonetheless, it came  out in a conversation with Vladimir Balonkin, chief of the press  center of the Leningrad Military District, that our military  district does not intend to assign any military units to combat  crime because the tasks of the military are different.</p>

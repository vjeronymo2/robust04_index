			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (10): A distinct change of style - Politics FORMER President Ranasinghe Premadasa often found Sri Lanka's tabloid press more vicious than the Tamil Tiger rebels in the north of the country or the Pol Pot-style Singhalese nationalist rebellion in the south. Each Sunday the tabloids would tear Mr Premadasa's reputation to pieces, focusing on the fact that he was not a 'goigama' - the farmer caste which has traditionally produced Sri Lanka's political leaders. Since the assassination of Mr Premadasa in May, the tabloid newspapers have gone quiet. The new head of state, President D. B. Wijetunga, soft spoken and avuncular, does not make a good political target. Whereas Mr Premadasa was always viewed as an outsider by the political establishment, Mr Wijetunga is a 'goigama' from the Kandy hill country. Mr Wijetunga's prime minister, Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe, is part of the Colombo elite. The English educated professional class is relieved that what is perceived to be the natural political order has been restored. The new leadership has brought a distinct change of style. Gone is the populism and the showmanship of the Premadasa regime. Mr Premadasa, said to have worked 18 hours a day, was known as a very hard taskmaster. He was also feared by those who had crossed his political path. Now the political mood is more relaxed. The media is more open. But there has been some continuity. There has been no dramatic change in the direction of government policy. Some of Mr Premadasa's key advisers are still in positions of power. Mr R. Paskaralingam, an important Premadasa confidant and the man credited with persuading the former president of the need for economic reform, is also Mr Wijetunga's secretary of finance. The big question now is whether the country's new leaders have the strength to carry through tough economic policies, or whether short-term political trade-offs will be made. A budget due in early November will serve as an indicator of the new government's political will. During his time in office Mr Premadasa did put down - albeit brutally - an uprising in the south. He also tried, and failed, to negotiate a peace with the Tamil separatists. Perhaps most importantly, he made moves to open up the economy, while at the same time launching a much-praised poverty alleviation programme. Mr Wijetunga has been able to build on that legacy; able to sell Premadasaism without Premadasa. Less than three weeks after Mr Premadasa's assassination, voters went to the polls in seven of Sri Lanka's nine provinces to elect new provincial councils. The UNP made what was considered to be a surprisingly strong showing in the polls, although it did lose control of the western province, which contains Colombo and more than 25 per cent of the country's 17m people. Most importantly, the polls, which had a 75 per cent turn-out, were peaceful - seen by outsiders as evidence of the resilience and maturity of the country's political system. The UNP would appear to be secure. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), headed by Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, a former prime minister, is in some disarray. Mrs Bandaranaike, suffering the after-effects of a stroke, is not as active as she once was although she still commands a considerable personal following, especially in rural areas. Mrs Bandaranaike's daughter, Chandrika - now chief minister of western province - is at loggerheads with her brother, SLFP MP Anura Bandaranaike. In mid-October, Mr Bandaranaike resigned from the SLFP claiming the party was in danger of being controlled by what he called 'discredited Marxists.' Now there is talk that Mr Bandaranaike could join the UNP, the party to which his father, Mr Solomon Bandaranaike, prime minister in the 1950s, originally belonged. Meanwhile, the Democratic United National Front (DUNF), a breakaway UNP grouping, would appear to have lost its political platform which was almost entirely based on an intense dislike for the rule of former president Premadasa. After the violence of May, everyone is now hoping for a period of political calm. But already the talk is of presidential elections, due to be held before the end of next year. Mr Wijetunga, 71, was originally seen as a caretaker president but now shows signs of wanting to stay in office beyond next year's elections. At the moment, people seem comfortable with Mr Wijetunga. The opposition, more concerned with its own quarrels, holds few political cards.</p>

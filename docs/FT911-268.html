			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Economics: Market to focus on likely RPI fall THERE IS a lot for the market to focus on in the UK, with the performance of the Conservatives in Thursday's parliamentary by-election in Monmouth coming under scrutiny before the release of the retail prices index the following day. Well-highlighted by Treasury ministers has been the likely fall in the RPI on Friday to around 6.2 per cent in April from March's 8.2 per cent. The Treasury has twice used a fall in the RPI as a trigger point for a 1/2  percentage point cut in the bank base rate. The question this week will be whether the government wants to relax monetary policy ahead of Thursday's vote or at the time of a perceived easing in inflationary pressures. However, the market was warned last week that underlying inflation remained stubborn. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said the fall would reveal no more than the effect of last year's imposition of the community charge dropping out of the 12-month figures, aided by recent interest-rate reductions. Whatever the Conservatives' electoral plans, the money market expects a  1/2 point cut in interest rates to 11 1/2 per cent next week. Unemployment figures are set to show another very steep rise after March's record jump of 113,000. In the US, expectation of the Federal Reserve easing interest rates again could mount. While a small rise in tomorrow's consumer prices index is possible, further weakness in retail sales and industrial production will be evident. Other notable events and statistics, with market forecasts from MMS International, the financial research company, in brackets include: Today: UK, credit business for March (Pounds 125m) and final retail sales (3.7 per cent). Canada, housing starts for April. Germany, wholesale prices in-dex for April. Basle, Bank of International Settlements meeting.

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 3 BEST CITIES TO LIVE IN PICKED  </P> <P> Melbourne, Montreal and Seattle-Tacoma are the best cities in which to live,  the private Population Crisis Committee said after surveying conditions in the  world's 100 largest metropolitan areas.  </P> <P> Lagos, Nigeria, is the worst, the group said today in an analysis based on two  years of research.  </P> <P> Sharon L. Camp, the organization's senior vice president, said the study isn't  a guidebook for retirement or business or vacations but rather a warning about  the dangers of rapid population growth.  </P> <P> "More than half of these cities are sinking from the weight of too many  people," she said. "More than anything else, the numbers . . . add up to human  population overload."  </P> <P> Lagos averages 5.8 people per room in living space, only half the city's houses  have water and electricity and there is only one telephone per 100 people.  </P></p>

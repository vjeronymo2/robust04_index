			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Hollick silent on avoidance allegation LORD HOLLICK, the Labour peer who is managing director of MAI, the financial services group, yesterday declined to comment directly on newspaper allegations that the group had considered a plan to pay senior executives partly in gold bullion. When MAI was asked whether it had set up a such a scheme, or had plans to do so, it said it was 'unable to deal specifically with the points raised because legal proceedings had been set in train'. The intention of such schemes is legally to avoid National Insurance contributions, which are not required on payments made in bullion. The allegations are politically sensitive because Lord Hollick has been closely involved with the Labour party's election campaign. He has been tipped for a ministerial post if Labour wins, and has been mentioned as a possible governor of the Bank of England. In such bullion schemes, payment needs to be made outside the European Community in order to avoid paying value added tax on the gold. A further advantage of such schemes is that employees can defer tax for up to 18 months if the payment is timed for the end of the tax year. The tax year ends on April 5. Similar schemes to avoid National Insurance contributions involving unit trusts and equities were halted by the Inland Revenue last October. Wright, Webb, Syrett, a firm of solicitors, said yesterday that writs would be issued today for libel by Lord Hollick and MAI against the Mail on Sunday for articles published yesterday. An injunction to restrain further publication would also be sought. The solicitors warned in a statement that Lord Hollick would be seeking damages and looked forward to vindicating his reputation in the High Court. The Mail on Sunday articles claimed that several hundred senior executives at MAI had arranged to receive part of their earnings in gold bars in Jersey, which is outside the EC. An early edition of the newspaper suggested that Lord Hollick would also benefit from the scheme. However, later editions included a denial from Lord Hollick's solicitors stating that none of his salary would be paid in bullion. Lord Hollick's solicitors said the writs would refer to all editions of yesterday's Mail on Sunday.</p>

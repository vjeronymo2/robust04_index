The letter  relates to the efforts being made by Pakistan to prevent human  rights violations in the occupied Kashmir by presenting a  resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission meeting being held  in Geneva. This was stated by Pakistani Foreign Secretary  Shaharyar Khan in Washington yesterday evening. He said that he  has personally delivered the letter to senior State Department  officials. Shaharyar Khan said that he also held talks on  matters of mutual interest to Pakistan and the United States  during his meetings with U.S. officials.    Answering a question, the foreign secretary said that it has  been unanimously decided in Islamabad to present a resolution on  human rights violations in Kashmir during the current session of  the commission. He said that the situation this time is  different from the time when Pakistan, on the suggestion of some  friends and Islamic countries, had agreed to defer a similar  resolution. They wanted to allow an opportunity for talks so as  to peacefully resolve the dispute. He said that the situation  in the Indian-occupied Kashmir remains unchanged and there has  been no respite in Indian oppressive activities. The foreign  secretary expressed dissatisfaction over the outcome of the  recent Pakistan-India talks. He said that contrary to what  Pakistan expected, Indian atrocities in Kashmir recently  increased, which clearly indicates how sincere India is about  holding talks with Pakistan.    In reply to another question, Shaharyar Khan said that it  has  always been Pakistan's conviction that the Kashmir issue should  be resolved in accordance with the aspirations of the people of  Jammu and Kashmir. The foreign secretary has now gone to Bonn  on the next leg of his trip to secure support for the Pakistani  stand on Kashmir.</p>

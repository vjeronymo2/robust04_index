			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial report] Only the EU Council can decide, acting  on a qualified majority, to close a foreign border, reports  Renaud de Chazournes in the 19-20 February Paris daily LE  QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS in connection with Greece's unilateral  closing of the border with neighboring The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. Nevertheless, Greece is  attempting to justify its action by affirming that it conforms  to European law, with reference to Article 224 of the Treaty of  Rome, he continues. The reference is "rather unfortunate," he  notes, since the article stipulates that consultations between  member states must precede any action of this type. However, it  is "crystal clear" that the European Union (EU) is powerless if  one of the member states contravenes Article 224, for the treaty  in question does not envision exclusion, or even punitive  measures. For instance, notes de Chazournes, Athens' European  partners cannot freeze structural funds granted to Greece even  if, in the process, EU common foreign and security policy is  jeopardized. This does not mean that Brussels, where the Greek  move has been termed "irrational," easily accepts Greece's fait  accompli, he adds. In fact, a written explanation has been  demanded so that the Commission can review the blockade's  legality.    "There are few illusions in Paris on the European Council's  margin of maneuver," de Chazournes comments. At most, 11  countries will simply "express their annoyance" with the present  president of the EU. For good measure, he adds, the Greek  ambassador was called in by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on  18 February to provide an explanation.</p>

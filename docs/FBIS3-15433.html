			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, who held  talks with representatives of the Russian government, returned  from Moscow yesterday. On his return to Tbilisi, the prime  minister said the following.    [Begin Patsatsia recording] This was a working visit. Almost  all the issues I discussed with Oleg Soskovets [Russian deputy  prime minister] were resolved positively. Thus, a credit of 4.5  billion rubles, previously planned for 1993, has now been  officially registered. Another credit of 20 billion rubles will  be registered in the near future before the end of March. Boris  Yeltsin has issued an instruction that this credit of 20 billion  rubles should be registered.    I would like to say a few words about the gas issue. We  raised a the question of gas supplies from Russia. This issue  is under consideration at present and I believe it will be  resolved positively. We will find it more profitable because it  will cost us less than that from Turkmenistan. However, it does  not mean that we are going to stop receiving gas from there.  [end recording]</p>

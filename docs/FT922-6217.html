			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (3): Threatened by China - Trade KOREANS have long been used to living between a geo-political hard place and a rock, squeezed as they are between China and Japan. They are now finding to their dismay that the trade position with these two big neighbours is equally uncomfortable. Japan alone accounted for 90 per cent of South Korea's Dollars 9.6bn trade deficit last year, confirming that industry remains dependent on Japanese equipment and components in spite of efforts to diversify suppliers. A 2.1 per cent drop in the value of exports suggests that South Korean companies are finding it hard to compete in Japan against Japanese branded goods made in south-east Asia. The Chinese threat is a new one, with low-cost goods making inroads into Korea's domestic market as well as undermining its exports to Japan and elsewhere. A loss of market share in some sectors in the US has added to Korea's discomfort, and there is little prospect of early relief from Washington's allegations of dumping and complaints about market access. A partial solution to these problems, according to Mr Deuk-Hwan Yu, the assistant minister for trade policy, is export market diversification, a trend which is beginning to be discernible. Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) figures show that the trade deficit for the first quarter of 1992 narrowed to Dollars 3.84bn from Dollars 4.33bn in the same period last year. This, officials say, was largely due to increased exports to markets such as south-east Asia, which in March overtook the US as Korea's largest export area. There have been sharp increases in trade with the European Community and central and eastern Europe. Other areas which are seen as priorities for further development are the Middle East, South America and Africa. However, South Korean officials concede that none of these regions offers the potential of the US and Japan. In addition, areas such as the EC, with a variety of cultures and languages, pose problems for individual Korean companies, most of whom are accustomed to the homogenous markets of the US and Japan. Mr Gilles Anouil, the EC representative in Seoul, notes that Europe 'wasn't even on the map' for most Korean companies until 1989, when the Economic Planning Board produced its first report on the single market. Bilateral trade has increased by 35 per cent over the past two years as electronics and car manufacturers began to see western Europe as an antidote to a sluggish US market. But the rise has not been without rancour. Korean officials say they are still concerned that 'EC integration could result in a fortress mentality'. And a senior MTI official contends that there are 'too many EC anti-dumping cases against Korean companies and the penalties are too high'. The need to avoid such actions is one factor behind increased Korean interest in direct investment in Europe, according to Dr Moon-Soo Kang of the Korea Development Institute. He believes businesses 'are beginning to understand that they need a presence in the EC' to complement trade links. Mr Anouil has detected a change in attitude, and says 'most of the big companies accept that trade and investment now go hand in hand'. The number and size of Korean investments in Europe are relatively low. Official figures show that Europe accounted for only 112 of the 1,463 direct foreign investments made by Korean companies up to June 1991. The high cost of western European labour, even relative to the US, accounts for some of the reluctance on the part of Korean companies to invest in the EC. The opening up of eastern Europe, on the other hand, has generated a good deal of interest. This is explained in part by the fact that the Seoul government has been keen to make inroads in countries which had formerly maintained close relations with North Korea. Added to this has been the prospect of using eastern Europe as a low-cost assembly and production centre, primarily for exporting into the EC. Some deals have materialised, such as Samsung's decision to build refrigerators in Czechoslovakia. But Mr Anouil says many Korean companies are having second thoughts about rapid expansion in eastern Europe. Financial constraints, including high domestic interest rates and restrictions on overseas borrowing, are considerable. In addition, the Seoul government has rejected business requests for support to enable them to participate more extensively in eastern European privatisations. The parlous state of some eastern European industries is a deterrent. Samsung Electronics, for example, continues to study prospects in the region, but it has determined not to 'set up production facilities in a country without a basic electronics industry, no matter how low the wages are'. The lure of the US is proving hard to break. Mr Joon-Suk Jung, director of MTI's Europe division, says Korean companies still find the 'US much easier compared with the EC, let alone eastern Europe'. An early economic recovery in the US could slow the diversification drive, although it is unlikely to reverse it. The persistence of potentially disastrous trade disputes with the US, such as the latest allegation that Korean semiconductor manufacturers are dumping memory devices in the US market, is an incentive to maintain the policy. So is the possible message behind the recent loss of market share in the US and Japan. As a Western diplomat said: 'A country's performance in the free business environment of the US measures its current competitiveness, while the performance in Japan tells you how it will do in future.'</p>

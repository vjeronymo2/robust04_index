			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTAMINATED PLAYGROUND AT CUDAHY SCHOOL TO BE REPAVED  </P> <P> An elementary school that has been shut down for more than eight months because  its playground is contaminated with petroleum waste is scheduled to reopen in  the fall, Los Angeles school officials said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles school board has approved plans to cover the playground at Park  Avenue Elementary School with a layer of asphalt to prevent the sludge of  petroleum chemical compounds and its vapors from rising to the surface.  </P> <P> School officials hope to have the school reopened at the beginning of the  school year in September, school board member Leticia Quezada said Wednesday at  a meeting of parents, teachers, residents and state and school officials.  </P> <P> Although the petroleum-contaminated soil and sludge will not be removed,  parents, teachers and administrators said they are satisfied that the covering  will protect the students. They said they are tired of waiting for some kind of  solution to be found to clean up the ooze, and want to get back to their own  school.  </P> <P> The elementary school, at 8020 Park Ave., was closed last summer after parents  and teachers raised concerns about health hazards associated with the tar-like  petroleum sludge that appeared in tiny puddles on the surface of the asphalt  playground.  </P> <P> Since then, Park Avenue students have been divided and sent to Teresa Hughes  Elementary School and Clara Street Primary Center, which operate year-round.  Administrators and parents said Park Avenue students who have been attending  these schools, which were overcrowded before Park Avenue was closed, have  become much like guests who have overstayed their welcome.  </P> <P> "We need to go back to our own school," said parent Maria Castillo, who has  three children diverted from Park Avenue. "We're not wanted (at the other  schools) and we don't want to be there."  </P> <P> Principal Jose Velasquez, who has been forced to try to keep track of his Park  Avenue students sent to two other campuses, said the whole experience has been  an administrative nightmare. "What's important now is (that) we get back to our  school," he said.  </P> <P> According to an environmental report released in January, Park Avenue school  was built on an old city dump that contained petroleum-contaminated soil and  several pockets of tar-like petroleum sludge.  </P> <P> But the report by Angelo Bellomo, director of an environmental engineering firm  that conducted a series of tests last November and December, concluded that  students would not face any health hazards as long as they did not have  prolonged contact with the sludge. The report also found no dangerous traces of  hazardous vapor in the air.  </P> <P> Although the report concluded that it would be safe for students to return to  the school immediately, district officials have held off until they get a firm  recommendation from the state Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> Richard Hume, an environmental engineer with the Health Services Department,  said a decision will be made as soon as department engineers in Sacramento give  their decision. That decision is expected late this week, he said. Once the  state has reached a decision, a meeting will be held with Bellomo to discuss  the details of construction.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's meeting, a group of about 25 parents, teachers, administrators  and residents were presented with two options for covering the playground.  </P> <P> Both plans involve digging about 12 to 20 trenches in the playground, filling  them with gravel and laying pipes to vent gas to the surface, where it will be  monitored for hazardous vapor.  </P> <P> One plan calls for a thick plastic liner to be sandwiched between layers of  sand over the trenches, and a new asphalt surface poured on top. The other plan  would leave out the plastic liner and instead pour a thicker layer of new  asphalt over the trenches. Both, Bellomo said, would keep the petroleum sludge  from percolating to the surface, and keep gases from seeping to the surface  except through the ventilation system.  </P> <P> Both plans would take an equal amount of time to complete, but the option  involving the plastic liner will cost about $750,000 -- twice as much as the  other, Bellomo said.  </P> <P> Parents said they favor the more expensive measure.  </P></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Letter: Competition not all in electricity Sir, Your editorial, 'Mr Major's medium term ' (October 19), again refers to an 'inadequately competitive electricity industry'. The implication that competition solves all is perhaps a little optimistic. While nobody could plausibly claim that the generation industry structure is optimal, the market power of National Power and PowerGen has been used on the fuel purchasing side to reduce variable costs. In future the companies will use their scale to drive a good bargain over imported coal. So long as these economies are mostly passed on to consumers, which Offer's continuing monitoring will ensure, then the end user is arguably better off than in an industry with several smaller generators. More generally, the experience of the privatised and (partially) deregulated electricity industry seems to suggest that the system is highly effective in what one might call static efficiency terms, that is reduced costs and optimising plant availability, given the existing plant structure. Where it is rather less successful is in dynamic efficiency - the planning of new plants in future. The market is not a particularly good instrument for making co-ordinated decisions in an industry with 15-year time horizons, environmental constraints, government intervention (nuclear power), and where the costs of getting it wrong have macroeconomic consequences. There are limits to what one can expect from a market-based system when it has to operate so tightly constrained by political considerations.

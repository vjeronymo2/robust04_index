			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Management: Bedless but not bedlam - The UK's hospital league tables are published today. Alan Pike on coming to terms with the internal market 'Support the Save Guy's Campaign.' Roadside hoardings urging public resistance to government plans for the future of the famous London teaching hospital, irregularly painted in an amateur hand, have become a familiar sight around south London. Inside Guy's, senior managers of the National Health Service's biggest trust are preparing plans to merge with nearby St Thomas' hospital, bring a university complex to the Guy's site and develop Britain's most advanced bedless hospital. It is one of the most fascinating managerial tasks in the NHS. Yet the managers' grip on the public imagination is well behind that of the anonymous sign writer. Organisers of campaigns against hospital closures hold all the emotional cards. Managers' plans for restructuring services have little hope of competing for interest against slogans like 'Save Guy's - Save Lives'. But in this difficult and unsettling atmosphere Tim Matthews, chief executive of Guy's &amp; St Thomas' Trust, has begun the task of bringing the two hospitals together and securing their long-term financial viability in the NHS internal market. When Matthews - formerly chief executive of St Thomas' - was selected to run the combined trust last year, he was told by the government to prepare proposals to merge the two south Thames hospitals. His board produced a plan to retain the best buildings on each site, sharing services between them. The government - influenced by calls from consultants at the hospitals for a single site - rejected this and decided, subject to formal consultation later this year, to house all in-patient services at St Thomas', with Guy's used for out-patient and educational activities. Some of those same consultants are now backing the Save Guy's campaign: when they argued for a single site, they apparently took it for granted that it would be Guy's. 'The trust board offered a politically easier option but the government decided to go a stage further,' says Matthews. 'Now the responsibility of the senior management is to work for the decision and engender confidence in it, even though some people will remain unconvinced.' One of the most significant changes in the NHS during the 1990s has been the growing involvement of doctors in management. Although Matthews acknowledges that individual consultants' 'badge loyalty' to Guy's or St Thomas' will survive for many years, he has already established a clinical management structure spanning the two institutions. 'All the advice from management consultants was to go steady on introducing a new structure. But we found that everybody wanted to get on with it, so we did,' he says. The trust now has 43 clinical directors - one for each of its medical and surgical activities - based randomly at Guy's or St Thomas' but with responsibility for services at both hospitals. They report to eight group directorates, led by senior doctors supported by business teams of operations managers, accountants and personnel officers. All eight group directors sit on the trust's executive board - giving medical staff a majority at this level of the decision-making process. Responsibility for budgets rests with the clinical teams, although under the eye of a strong central finance department. 'One of the great changes of recent years is that we now have access to good quality information,' says Matthews. 'It was a tradition in the NHS that if anyone told you that you were over budget, the first thing you did was question the accuracy of their information. Today we can have confidence in it.' Financial controls - and financial savings - will be crucial to the future of the Pounds 240m-turnover Guy's &amp; St Thomas' Trust. It is, like other London hospitals, currently surviving in the NHS internal market on temporary subsidies - in Guy's &amp; St Thomas' case Pounds 18m in 1993-94. To balance his books and, Matthews believes, enable the trust to maintain 90 per cent of the two hospitals' present volume of activity, costs must be reduced by 20 per cent over five years. 'This is a level of saving most big organisations expect to achieve, particularly at a time of structural change. Reorganisation should give us scope for sufficient efficiency improvements.' Cuts will include 30 per cent reductions in staffing costs over the five-year period. Turnover in the London NHS remained high even during the recession, and Matthews expects natural wastage to play a big part in slimming the 6,500 workforce. Some 550 posts will go this year with only 150 redundancies. The decision to locate all in-patient services at St Thomas' will present the trust with a Pounds 60m-Pounds 65m bill for capital development. But Matthews believes his share of the costs can be recouped from revenue savings within two or three years. If anyone is listening above the noise of the Save Guy's campaign, Matthews stresses that the hospital is not going to close. Much of Philip Harris House, a new technology treatment, teaching and research centre just completed at Guy's, will, he says, be used as originally planned - notably for day treatment activities. Philip Harris House, he says, will enable the trust to 'test to the limit what can be done in a bedless hospital'. Critics will not be convinced easily; neither will charitable benefactors who pledged money for Philip Harris House which they are threatening to withdraw unless the building is used as originally intended. These include Sir Philip Harris, the former Harris Queensway chief executive after whom the development is named. This is only one way Philip Harris House has already proved something of an embarrassment to the NHS. Originally discussed as a Pounds 30m development which had reached Pounds 70m by the planning stage, the final outcome will exceed Pounds 150m. Matthews is determined that, now his board has responsibility for its own finances, controls on future developments will be much tighter than in the old-style NHS.</p>

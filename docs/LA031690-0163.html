			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEFICIT NEWS DOESN'T FAZE ARTS OFFICIAL;  </P> <P> FUNDING: THE HEAD OF A GROUP SEEKING COUNTY BACKING FOR A NEW ARTS AGENCY SAYS  THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES. BUT SUPERVISOR THOMAS F. RILEY ISN'T AS  OPTIMISTIC.  </P> <P> The head of a local committee that is seeking county backing for a proposed  arts agency doesn't seem worried about a recent financial forecast indicating  that Orange County government may face a budget deficit of up to $63 million in  two years.  </P> <P> But Supervisor Thomas F. Riley painted a less optimistic picture, saying that  the outlook of the county administrative office report does jeopardize county  funding of "additional projects such as the arts."  </P> <P> "If you took a look at figures we have now, to take on a new project certainly  would not be something any of us on the board would be willing to do," Riley  said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Committee to Form an Orange County Arts Council sent a report last week to  the Board of Supervisors recommending that the county contribute $125,000  toward creation of a countywide arts agency.  </P> <P> But the CAO's five-year financial forecast released this week predicts budget  deficits in the next four out of five fiscal years and said that the county  will have to find ways to cut spending or increase revenue to avoid these  deficits.  </P> <P> Charles Desmarais, president of the ad-hoc Committee to Form an Orange County  Arts Council, repeated Thursday that the committee's request for $125,000 --  "in cash and/or in-kind services" -- need not necessarily compete with other  county programs, however.  </P> <P> "It is my understanding that there may be alternative sources of (arts)  funding," such as money from the airport enterprise fund generated by fees  charged airlines and other airport users, said Desmarais, director of the  Laguna Art Museum.  </P> <P> Earlier, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez had said the forecast is not "a doomsday  prophesy," though he, too, said it dims the prospect for funding new programs.  </P> <P> County supervisors are expected to give an official response to the committee's  recommendations by April 2, when the county will have completed its own study  of its role in local arts support. No money from the county's $2.9-billion  budget is now earmarked for arts support.  </P> <P> Riley said he would wait until the county's arts study is complete to make a  final comment on the issue. He also added that "there is always a possibility  of (arts) funding coming from the private sector."  </P> <P> Asked if the enterprise fund might be another possibility, he said, "I'm not  ruling it out, but I'm not sure at this time in the airport's activities  whether that would be a fund we could reasonably ask for assistance."  </P> <P> The supervisors recently voted to apportion $40,000 from the enterprise fund to  support an arts program at the new John Wayne Airport terminal, scheduled to  open in September.  </P> <P> Desmarais, however, maintains that the county should find some room in its  budget for the arts.  </P> <P> "It seems to me there are ways we spend our (county) money that could be looked  at again," he said. "For instance, we have a really negative kind of emphasis  on 'just saying no' to drugs without giving kids an opportunity to say 'yes' to  something. The arts are such a life-affirming opportunity that the county could  take advantage of."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Oleg Velichko and Anna </F> Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- Russian Minister for Affairs  of Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray told an  expanded government meeting here today money from the federal  budget should be used to prevent inter-ethnic conflicts and not  to settle them.    He reminded the meeting participants that the  Ossetian-Ingush  conflict alone required some 100 billion rubles in 1993.    Speaking of the division of powers between the center and  regions, Shakhray said his ministry is preparing a treaty with  the Kaliningrad region. However, he noted equality of regions  does not mean their automatic identity. Some 60 per cent of  federation subjects live on allocations. "Bearing this in mind,  similar treaties with Russian territories will be elaborated,"  he said.    In the words of Shakhray, some 7,300,000,000 rubles worth of  a fund will be formed to support northern areas. The money will  be taken from the federal budget to help the delivery of prime  necessities. A number of northern cities, including Norilsk,  will be temporarily closed.</p>

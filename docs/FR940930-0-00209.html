			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is being adopted as proposed, with the exception that language has been added to subsection (d) to clarify FRA's original intent that state signal and train control inspectors can also enforce Grade Crossing Signal System Safety Rules only if they have demonstrated the ability to understand and detect deviations from those rules. While FRA anticipates that state signal and train control inspectors will have the technical expertise needed to ensure compliance with these rules, they also need to be familiar with the regulatory requirements themselves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 212.233&blank;Apprentice Highway-rail Grade Crossing Inspector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, this section establishes minimum qualification standards which applicants must meet prior to being enrolled in the inspector training program within the State Participation Program. FRA received no specific comments regarding this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 49 CFR Part 234 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 234.1&blank;Scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, this section expands the scope of Part 234. The final rule issued today adds two new subparts to Part 234, ``Response to Reports of Warning System Malfunction'' and ``Maintenance, Inspection, and Testing.'' This section is amended to include the subject areas covered by these new subparts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section has been revised from that proposed to make clear that this part does not restrict a railroad from adopting and enforcing additional or more stringent requirements not inconsistent with this part. In addition to prescribing standards for the reporting of failures of highway-rail grade crossing warning systems, this part also prescribes minimum actions railroads must take when such warning systems malfunction and imposes minimum maintenance, inspection, and testing standards for such systems. The actions required by this part are the minimum actions which need to be taken by a railroad in a specific situation. Thus, it would be acceptable for a railroad to determine that it will stop at every malfunctioning warning system rather than cross at a reduced speed. Similarly, it is acceptable to test a crossing system component every three months, rather than every 12 months as required by this rule. References in sections 234.105 and 234.107 to a railroad ``taking, at a minimum, the following actions:'' have accordingly been revised to delete ``at a minimum'' inasmuch as the requirement has been placed more appropriately in section 234.1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM contained a provision stating that ``[w]hen any person performs any function required by this part, that person is required to perform that function in accordance with this part.'' After review, and in an effort to delete unnecessary and confusing language, FRA will delete the proposed language inasmuch as section 234.6 ``Penalties'', provides for appropriate penalties against any person who violates any requirement of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section sets forth the scope of Part 234. Part 234 imposes minimum maintenance, inspection, and testing standards highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. This part also prescribes standards for the reporting of failures of such systems and prescribes minimum actions railroads must take when such warning systems malfunction. This part does not restrict a railroad from adopting and enforcing additional or more stringent requirements not inconsistent with this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.3&blank;Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA did not propose any specific changes to this section. Rather, FRA posed a series of questions pertaining to the application of these rules. FRA questioned whether the rules should apply to scenic or tourist railroads_those both on and off the general railroad system of transportation. FRA stated that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> FRA does not believe that scenic railroads which are part of the general railroad system of transportation should be treated differently than other railroads under the proposed rules issued today. The primary beneficiary of these rules will be the motoring public. A motorist should have the same assurance of safety whether crossing the tracks of a Class I railroad, a small short line, or those of a small scenic railroad. FRA invites public comment on this issue. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> FRA further questioned whether these rules should ``be applied to crossings on trackage not located on the general railroad system? Should the answer depend on whether the crossing is a public or private crossing?''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There was disagreement among commenters as to whether these rules should be applied to trackage not located on the general railroad system. The Minnesota Department of Transportation stated, ``We believe the rules should apply to all signals whether they are on public or private railroads, public or private roadways or whether the railroad is connected into the rail network or not. The driver of a vehicle is seldom aware of facility ownership. The credibility of crossing signals needs to be maintained regardless of where they are used.'' The New York State Department of Transportation (NYS DOT) agreed to the extent that the rules ``should apply to all crossings of public roadways regardless of the status of the railroad.'' However, the NYS DOT further stated that ``extension of the authority to include tourist and plant railroad crossings on private property would not be appropriate, since motorist expectations are different on private property and both train and vehicle speeds are generally low.'' This difference of opinion was also reflected in comments received from other parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

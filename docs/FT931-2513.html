			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / The Property Market: Portfolio for all seasons - Vanessa Houlder profiles the long-term strategy of Trinity College, Cambridge's richest These are hard times for many of Britain's traditional landowners. Leasehold enfranchisement, the collapse in agricultural land values and the treacherous property development market have damaged the interests of landlords ranging from the Duke of Westminster to the Church of England. But Trinity College, the richest college in Cambridge and one of the UK's oldest landowners, appears to be riding out the recession with enviable serenity. Its somewhat idiosyncratic portfolio, worth Pounds 207m, has so far stood it in good stead during the downturn. Its wealth, which mostly dates back to land and ecclesiastical tithes seized from the monasteries by King Henry VIII, takes a form dictated by history and chance as well as by conscious design. Its portfolio includes: gravel royalties; agricultural land; shops in provincial towns, including a large chunk of central Cambridge; the Cambridge Science Park; Felixstowe Docks; and a range of equities. It shuns offices, with the exception of three small London properties, on the ground that they need frequent refurbishment. It also avoids gilts, believing that the income from its shop portfolio is an adequate substitute for fixed income securities. In the past 35 years, the make-up of the portfolio has changed significantly from one that was split evenly between farms, urban property and securities. Nonetheless, its current breakdown - 5 per cent farmland, 50 per cent property and 45 per cent securities - is still far out of line with the average pension fund. The differences between Trinity's fund and mainstream institutions do not, it seems, stem from a relaxed approach to performance. Asset allocation is reviewed by the college's finance committee (which includes Louis Freedman, former managing director of Land Securities), which vets its investment decisions. The college insists it has pressing demands on its income, which last year totalled Pounds 15m. 'We are fully stretched. We need every penny,' says Mr John Bradfield, who ran the college's finances from the mid-1950s (when the assets were worth Pounds 3.2m) until this year. The money is used for the upkeep of its buildings, which costs more than Pounds 1m a year, the support of its fellows and a number of bursaries and trusts throughout the university. Some 15 per cent of its income is redistributed to the university and poorer colleges. But the college's objectives differ from those of most other funds in respect of its time horizon. Even more than most funds, Trinity is investing for the long term. 'You have to bear in mind the longevity of liabilities; here they are infinite,' says Mr Jeremy Fairbrother, the college's recently-appointed senior bursar. Mr Fairbrother is only the third senior bursar to be appointed in the past 60 years, reflecting a strong degree of continuity in the management of the college's affairs. This has generated a culture of long-termism, which has been furthered by a historical view of past investment decisions. 'We have to keep an eye on what has happened over the last four centuries,' says Mr Bradfield. His lack of enthusiasm for gilts owes much to a realisation that the college's income would be minimal had it been endowed with fixed-income securities. Inflation - with the exception of a long period of stability or deflation during the 19th century - has been a pressing concern for investors since the days of Elizabeth I, when it soared as large amounts of gold were brought back from the New World. The inflation suffered under Elizabeth I indirectly influenced the evolution of Trinity's investment philosophy, since it led to legislation which prevented landowners such as Trinity from selling land. The legislation was amended in the 1850s as a result of the need for railway development, and relaxed further in 1964. Mr Fairbrother believes the lengthy period in which the college was locked into its landholdings has left its mark on its investment strategy. 'Colleges became expert at handling property,' he said. Rather than trading their assets, they looked at ways of adding value to them. In the past 30 years, the College has enjoyed two spectacular successes in adding value to its agricultural land. Farmland bought in 1933 at Felixstowe was chosen as the site of a new port in 1968. Its deep water and its exclusion from the dock labour scheme ensured that it became Britain's largest container port. The port and its associated warehousing and industrial estate bring Trinity more than Pounds 1m in rent each year. If Trinity's success at Felixstowe was in some respects a lucky break, the Cambridge Science Park is a considerable credit to the college. The park, built on land acquired in 1440 by King's Hall, a predecessor of Trinity, was proposed in 1969, when a university committee argued there should be more science-based industry in Cambridge. The project, which began in 1973, covers 120 acres, of which 10 acres are undeveloped. It houses 80 companies, including contract researchers, venture capitalists and a wide range of technology-related businesses. The park, which is the first, the largest and the most famous science park in the UK, is seen as a model of its kind, and has attracted visitors from more than 45 countries in the past 10 years. Trinity is attempting to repeat the trick with its Eureka science and business park in Ashford, Kent, on farmland it bought in 1957. It has installed roads and has established academic liason with the University of Kent and Wye College. Although Ashford is well placed for the rail link to the Continent, the proposed park is not as well-favoured as the Cambridge one. Success, if it happens, is a long way off. Mr Fairbrother believes the rewards of working property assets justify their place in a long-term portfolio. Markets in property are imperfect, compared with those in equities, he notes. 'It is much easier to add value by active management in property.'</p>

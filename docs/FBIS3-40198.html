			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yang Shuang: "Establish Good Financial Market </F> System" -- Commentary Series No 4 on Deepening Financial Reform]    [Text] The financial market is an important component part  of modern market economy. There must be a well-developed  financial market in a flourishing market economy. The 14th  National CPC Congress explicitly pointed out that the goal of  the economic system reform is to establish a socialist market  economic system. Therefore, to establish a financial market that  satisfies the needs of the socialist market economy is something  basic and important in reforming China's financial system.    The financial market is divided into the money market  (short-term financial market), capital market (long-term  financial market), stock market, foreign exchange market and  gold market. China resumed the issuance of treasury bonds in  1984, and Shanghai issued the first batch of stocks in 1984. The  financial market began to develop since 1986, but it is still in  the preliminary stage and there are plenty of rooms for further  development. China's future financial market should be a unified  and open market with orderly competition and strict management.  It has the general features of today's world financial market as  well as China's special characteristics. It is well adapted to  the current situation in economic and social development in  China. In this unified and open financial market, funds which  are regarded as a commodity in business transactions are able to  circulate freely throughout the country so that limited social  resources are allocated in various localities. If the financial  market is cut into pieces, it will be difficult to circulate  funds and put them to effective use. This will be a tremendous  loss to China where funds are badly needed. In the past, China's  financial market is not unified and open due to various reasons,  and people in the financial circles were often restricted to  carry out their activities in a designated area. In dealing with  this situation, we must further carry out reform to develop a  unified, open market. If it is said that a unified, open  financial market is the basic prerequisite for the effective  circulation of funds, building an orderly and competitive market  is the basic way for the effective circulation of funds.  Competition instills vitality into the financial market. If  there is no competition, or competition is not allowed, it will  be difficult to make the financial market prosperous and avoid  market monopoly by a few financial institutions. Meanwhile, this  kind of competition must be orderly and it should be carried out  in accordance with certain rules and regulations. The "illegal  day-to-day loans" and certain types of chaotic phenomena noticed  on the stock market not long ago were precisely signs of  disorderly competition. This kind of disorderly, malignant, and  abnormal competition will disturb the market and harm the  legitimate interests of the people and enterprises in the  society. It would even endanger the regular operation of social  economy. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a good legal  system for China's financial market and exercise strict  supervision and control over the market. We must adopt resolute  measures and firmly curb these illegal activities. We must also  use our policy to guide those who participate in various  activities on the market to ensure that market competition  remains unified, open and orderly.    There is no doubt that a flourishing financial market plays  an important role in helping develop a modern economy and the  enterprises. However, the growth of China's financial market is  far from being strong in despite of the fact that for the past  14 years since the beginning of the reform program, such market  in China has started from scratch and begun to take shape. Due  to the fact that it was born at the time when the new system was  replacing the old, it still remains in the preliminary stage,  and many sectors of the market are still not operating smoothly.  Therefore, to quicken the pace in building the financial market  and strengthen market management has become an important theme  in reforming the financial system.    To achieve this goal, it is, first of all, necessary to  improve the money market. As a short-term financial market, the  money market plays a significant role in helping the central  bank exercise its macroeconomic control and the monetary  institutions utilize the time of turn-around of the funds, in  financing lateral financial institutions and making the best use  of available funds. 1) It is necessary to strengthen the control  of the money market, and set standards for the major  participants of the market and their behavior. 2) It is  essential to cut the direct link between the money market and  the capital market, and stop funds from flowing from the money  market to the capital market. Otherwise, there will be boundless  increases of investments in fixed assets, causing economic  overheating and serious inflation. 3) On the basis of different  requirements in regulating money supply and adjusting supply and  demand, it is imperative to set standards for the overnight loan  market and the short-term financing market. 4) It is necessary  to gradually develop an open business operation of the central  bank and turn the money market into a tool of the central bank  for implementing the monetary policy and into the main arena for  regulating the basic currency and the money supply.    Second, the stock market is the principal form of the  capital  market. Many problems have cropped in China's stock market  during the three years since the opening of the stock exchanges  in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Thus, we must vigorously develop this  market and make further improvements. Efforts must be made to  further improve the market for treasury and financial bonds.  From the point of view of credit and money, all activities  concerning credit invariably affect the money supply. Therefore,  we must make use of the large number of geographically  widespread financial institutions to help selling government  bonds. This is not only conducive to the issuance and  circulation of government bonds. It also helps enhance credit  worthiness of the government bonds and create conditions for the  central bank to regulate the money supply. In addition, the  stock market should also be further standardized. We must do a  good job in transforming the enterprise share-holding system,  set up a standard procedure for issuing and listing stock on the  market, and strengthen control over stock exchanges and the  stock exchange system. Currently, the market for corporate  stocks and that for personal stocks are separated, while the  market for Type-A stocks and that for Type-B stocks are not in  line with each other. We must energetically create conditions  and gradually form a unified and standard stock market.    Third, we must further develop and form a standard foreign  exchange market. Measures have been taken to reform the system  for the control of China's foreign exchange. After the  implementation of the method of allowing units to retain a part  of foreign exchange they have earned for their own use, a number  of foreign exchange swap markets have taken shape. Nevertheless,  there is still a part of foreign exchange which goes to units  that use the foreign exchange through administrative channels  instead of the swap market. Meanwhile, a dual-track or  multi-track system is being implemented in determining the  foreign exchange rate. Therefore, it is necessary to set a  single foreign exchange rate; develop a mechanism to form a  unified exchange rate and turn monetary institutions into the  mainstay for the foreign exchange market; and finally, form a  completely unified foreign exchange market to run the financial  market in an orderly manner.</p>

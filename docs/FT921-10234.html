			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Nokia acquires rival in FM205m deal NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, yesterday bought its domestic TV set competitor Finlux in a complicated FM205m (Dollars 47.6m) deal that also affects Nokia's ownership structure. Nokia will finance the Finlux deal by buying out the 8.5 per cent stake held in Nokia by Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the troubled Finnish bank, for FM542m and use some of those shares as payment for Finlux, which is now owned by Metra, an engineering group. Metra will consequently gain a 3 per cent stake in Nokia, whose dominant shareholders are the Union Bank of Finland and the insurer Pohjola, with shareholdings of 12.8 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively. The purchase of Finlux, which has annual sales of FM600m, will consolidate Nokia's position as a producer of televisions in its home Nordic market. Nokia, which is Europe's third largest maker of televisions, also announced yesterday a reorganisation of its ailing consumer electronics division by concentrating television manufacturing at factories in Finland and Bochum, Germany. A TV plant in Chartres, France will be closed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A little less than an hour ago in Milan, the  finance police entered the headquarters of Mediobanca, the  temple of Italian financial life. They delivered four  cautionary warrants. Antonio Graziani reports:    [Graziani] Honorary President Enrico Cuccia, Director  General  Vincenzo Maranghi, and Directors Maurizio Romiti and Gerardo  Braggiotti are the Mediobanca directors who received the four  cautionary warrants issued this afternoon by Ravenna prosecutor  Francesco Mauro Iacoviello. The news was given with an official  communique signed by the very same prosecutor who is  investigating the role played by Mediobanca in the Ferruzzi  affair. [passage omitted]    Although we took into account the ideas put forward by  Professor Dominioni [Mediobanca lawyer] in his defense document  and by Professor Trimarchi [Milan law professor] in his  pro-veritate statement--says the official document issued by the  Ravenna prosecution office--we think that at this point in the  investigation we must issue the cautionary warrants in order to  continue the investigation.</p>

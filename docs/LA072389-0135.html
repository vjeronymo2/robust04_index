			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CARSON TO CONSIDER AID TO TRAILER PARK RENTERS  </P> <P> The Carson City Council has decided to look into reallocating $164,100 in  federal Community Development Block Grant Funds to help 50 residents of the  Nu-Way Mobilehome Park buy the park from a developer who plans to build a  shopping mall on the site.  </P> <P> The park residents applied for the city's block grant funds weeks after Carson  had already allocated its $1.7 million in funds to four other city projects. If  the city approves the Nu-Way application, it will have to transfer money it  promised to one or more of the other projects.  </P> <P> City Manager Jack Smith said it is too early to tell if the city will  reallocate the funds. Applications for block grant funds must be reviewed by a  city advisory panel, which makes recommendations to the City Council. A public  hearing at a weekly City Council meeting also is required. The Nu-Way  application will be reviewed next month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Five-Acre Lot  </P> <P> The four projects that were approved for block grant funds in April involve  housing rehabilitation, street improvements, fair housing and public services,  Smith said.  </P> <P> The park residents are hoping to buy 4.5 acres of the five-acre lot for $1.5  million through the state's Mobile Home Park Assistance Program.  </P> <P> To buy the park, residents are seeking $396,000 from the state program,  $164,100 in block grant funds, $586,341 in bank financing and a $297,436 loan  from the developer, Knickerbocker &amp; Associates, who bought the property in  May, 1988. Residents will also pay $57,500 of their own money for the purchase.  </P> <P> Gerald Gibbs, an attorney representing the park residents, said the next time  the group can apply for the state funds is September.  </P> <P> But Nu-Way owner Craig Knickerbocker said that may be too late. "My investors  have been waiting for over a year now. I'm getting real hard-pressed to tell  them to wait," the developer said. "They either want to see the residents get  their funding approved soon or else build a shopping mall."  </P></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Centre left Hungarian voters shrugged off attempts to revive bitter memories of the 1956 Budapest rising against Soviet-imposed socialism as they voted over the weekend. In the first round of a complex two-part election they deserted the conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum which steered the country through the first four painful years of post-communist readjustment. Instead, like their counterparts in Poland and Lithuania, they voted heavily for a revamped socialist party led by men who received their political training and wielded power in the former communist regime. In three weeks the electorate will return to the polls for the final round of voting which will determine the shape of the next government. This will most probably be a coalition between the Socialists and the Free Democrats. But three weeks is an awfully long time in politics. The Free Democrats, a liberal grouping which emerged as the second party with just under 20 per cent of the votes against the socialists' 32 per cent, have made clear that they will use it to attract the votes of those who want to ensure that the socialists will be constrained by a strong coalition partner. Such a coalition, with a secure parliamentary majority and basic commitment to continuing the market-based economic reforms which have attracted Dollars 7bn in foreign investment to date, would be well placed to benefit from a rising tide of economic prosperity which is now in prospect after the sacrifices demanded over the last four years. The slow pace of recovery for an economy saddled with more than Dollars 20bn of foreign debt inherited from the former communist regime was one of the main factors leading to the loss of support for the ruling Forum. The party served Hungary well. It provided political stability for the entire four-year life of Hungary's first post-communist parliament. But now that Moscow no longer projects its shadow over central Europe, a substantial vote for a party that calls itself socialist and promises more professional government and a slightly greater degree of income redistribution raises no fears. The important thing is that voters have chosen to keep to the centre ground, albeit shifting it slightly to the left. Participation in the vote was high, voting took place calmly, and above all voters avoided alarming their neighbours in Slovakia and Romania by voting for those who talked of regaining Hungary's former dominant position in the Carpathian region. By ignoring the siren songs of both the nationalist right of Istvan Csurka and the hardline communists on the left, Hungarians have helped the cause of stability in the region. They have thus improved their own chances of doing what Hungary's rulers failed to do during the 50 years when socialism was imposed from outside: narrowing the gap between their living standards and those of their western neighbours.</p>

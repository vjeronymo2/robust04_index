			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 22 Jan (AFP) --  Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation  in Chiapas, announced today his willingness to meet with the  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) general command at an  undisclosed place and time.    Camacho said he received a communique from the EZLN but  would  "give no details due to security reasons." He answered the  communique thus: San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz and the  commissioner "are willing to meet at the specified place. [no  closing quotation mark as received]    Camacho said preparations are complete for the meeting with  the rebel command, which told the commissioner of its intention  to release former Chiapas Governor General Absalom Castellanos,  who was kidnapped by the EZLN on 2 January at a ranch at Las  Margaritas Municipality.    Camacho said the Zapatists made some demands in exchange for  Gen. Castellanos' release, but he did not reveal those demands  to avoid hindering the liberation process, which he termed a  positive gesture from the rebels within the framework of the  search for a negotiated political solution to the violence.    However, Camacho told the rebels that "Gen. Castellanos'  exchange for people arrested in connection with the events that  began on 1 January" requires "certain procedures, which are  being handled" and "which must be carried out for a prompt  solution to this negotiation."    Camacho referred to the amnesty law approved by Congress for  the people involved in the guerrilla rebellion, but he explained  that its enforcement requires that the parties to the conflict  reach a formal cease-fire as soon as possible.    The government commissioner said there are still obstacles  to  the negotiations but he that insisted Gen. Castellanos'  impending release is a good sign for the talks.    Camaco repeatedly said that security considerations  prevented  him from divulging any details of his meeting with the guerrilla  leaders or about Castellanos' release, but he added that this  "step is an important contribution to the peace process."    The guerrilla forces and the Mexican Army have maintained a  cease-fire since 13 January, when the Armed Forces began to  withdraw from rural communities in the conflict area to relocate  in various towns and military bases. This has helped the  parties reach a detente.    According to local journalists' commentaries, Camacho's and  Ruiz' meeting with the still unknown EZLN general command could  take place in the Lacandona jungle at a town under rebel  control, but such reports have not been addressed by official  sources.    According to previous communications between the  commissioner  and the rebels, the peace process will be long and difficult,  but the two sides have expressed their wish to reach a political  agreement as soon as possible.</p>

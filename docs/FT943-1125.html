			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Meaning of 'undertaking' must be clear Sir, Your leader, 'Workers' rights' (September 21), refers to the real problem with the operation of the Acquired Rights Directive, namely the judgments of the European Court of Justice, including what you call the famous (some would say 'infamous') Schmidt case. However, it reaches the wrong conclusion. There is no fundamental reason to scrap the directive - after all, it merely places employees who are involved in the transfer of an undertaking in which they work in a similar position to those who are employed by a company, the ownership of which changes hands. The urgent need is to draw a clear, unambiguous and, most importantly, European judge-proof boundary to the meaning of 'undertaking' for these purposes. The paragraph you have referred to in the revised directive seems unlikely to achieve this. It is, in my view, necessary to import the concept of the transfer of a business as a going concern, a concept which should be relatively easy to translate into all legal systems of European Union countries.

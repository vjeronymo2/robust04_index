			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening News Panorama" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Zedillo, Institutional Revolutionary Party,  PRI, presidential candidate, has demanded the continuation of  peace talks in Chiapas. Zedillo has said reconciliation is  something that interests all Mexicans; therefore, this process  must continue. The presidential candidate also commented on  last night's statements by Manuel Camacho Solis:    [Begin Zedillo recording] I believe that in relinquishing  the  responsibilities the president of the republic has given him,  Manuel Camacho made the best decision for himself and the  country. It seems strange the former commissioner is trying to  blame me for quitting when all I did was demand a permanent and  just peace. Furthermore, I have learned that before the Zapatist  National Liberation Army issued its communique and before I made  my statements, the former commissioner had already said he was  planning to resign his commission in Chiapas and do other things.    I hereby reiterate the peace efforts must continue. This is  a matter for all Mexicans, not only for one person or group. In  light of the government of the republic and the Mexican people's  reconciliating spirit, the withdrawal of the former commissioner  should not be an excuse for the reappearance of violence.

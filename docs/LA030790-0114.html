			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> COMPANIES TO MATCH $200,000 FOR SOS  </P> <P> The embattled charity Share Our Selves has been offered a $200,000 challenge  grant from the Fieldstone Co., a Newport Beach home-builder, and the  Irvine-based Fieldstead &amp; Co. to help buy a new home for the organization,  the charity's directors announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> Donations for the purchase that are received by SOS before July 1 will be  matched dollar for dollar by the two firms, up to a total of $200,000.  </P> <P> "This gives us a big boost," SOS founder and Executive Director Jean Forbath  said. "I am particularly enthused (that two such businesses) would show this  kind of confidence and leadership."  </P> <P> The nonprofit charity, which provides varied social services for the needy, is  negotiating to buy a $1.4-million, 12,000-square-foot industrial building at  1550 Superior Ave.  </P> <P> SOS was forced to seek new quarters after the City Council ordered it to move  from its current home in the city-managed Rea Community Center, 661 Hamilton  St., reacting to complaints from neighbors about the charity's clientele.  </P> <P> Although some businesses and the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce object to the  charity's proposed site, the city Planning Commission last week approved a  conditional permit for the building. However, the approval was appealed, and a  final decision will be made by the City Council on March 19.  </P> <P> Forbath said the charity has opened a trust account for building donations. If  the purchase falls through or the conditional use permit is not granted, all  money will be returned to donors.  </P> <P> SOS Chairman Scott Mather said the organization hopes to raise at least $1  million before the close of escrow so SOS can "continue to serve the poor  without interruption and without a heavy mortgage draining all (our)  resources."  </P> <P> The SOS building fund has already received nearly $300,000 in donations,  including a $100,000 gift from John Michler, vice president of Hunsaker &amp;  Associates.

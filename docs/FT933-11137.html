			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (1): Next test - a cultural revolution / A more fundamental change than an urban facelift will be for Wales to move from the employee culture, created by large state-owned industries, to an entrepreneurial culture THE VIEW is distracting as you cross the Severn Bridge into Wales. Seaward, in the middle of the estuary, concrete caissons are in place. Soon there will emerge - like the sword Excalibur in Arthurian legend - the main pylons for the new Pounds 300m bridge. They will be 137 metres high. The second Severn crossing, which is being built by Laing-GTM - and privately financed - is not scheduled to open until 1996, but it is a striking example of the infrastructure investment benefiting Wales. In the north, the upgrading of the A55 road link with England will be completed next year at a cost of Pounds 650m. Although parliamentary approval of the Cardiff Bay barrage bill has been delayed, contractors have already been invited to tender for the Pounds 152m project. Mr Peter Kelly, regional chairman of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property advisers, says: 'With a barrage, Cardiff will be propelled into the forefront of European cities as a property location.' In spite of such schemes, construction output in the principality slumped by 19 per cent in the first quarter of 1993, compared with the year before. But overall Wales has found this recession less traumatic than some other regions. The housing market has seen much smaller falls in prices than in south-east England. There have been heavy job losses - nearly 500 at Trawsfynydd power station in Gwynedd and 370 at a Port Talbot cigar factory were announced only 10 days ago - but the rate of unem- ployment, 10.2 per cent in June, has at long last fallen below the national average. An unfortunate consequence is some downgrading of assisted area status under the new plan announced last week, even though male unemployment remains above the national rate. 'The recession has hurt and hurt a great deal,' says Mr Ian Kelsall, director of the Confederation of British Industry in Wales. 'There are many scarred businesses and we have lost a lot of small businesses. But Wales has survived better than some other regions because the industrial base has been rebuilt over the last 10 years.' The latest quarterly surveys by the CBI and Wales Chamber of Commerce and Industry show that businesses are still cautious and reluctant to make commitments on capital expenditure until they are sure the recovery is well established. However, Wales is seen as being among the first of the UK regions to come out of recession. Mr David Kern, chief economist of National Westminster Bank, forecast last month that between 1994 and 1998 Wales would be one of the fastest-growing regions. Cambridge Econometrics this month forecast that the principality would have growth of 1.8 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent next year. The growth will be from a relatively low base. 'Even though Wales may have fared better than elsewhere during the recession, it has had to come from a long way back,' says Mr Graham Hall, lead executive of the Wales chamber. The GDP per head is lower than anywhere except Northern Ireland and wages last year averaged Pounds 271 a week, the lowest in Britain. This is not to minimise the structural change that has taken place. Wales has been transformed from an economy dependent on coal, iron and steel to one in which new industries, especially inward investors, have enabled the manufacturing sector to retain a quarter share of GDP, higher than the UK average. There are more than 350 foreign-owned concerns around which 'clusters' of indigenous businesses can develop and raise their own standards. 'Productivity has improved and unit wage costs are now among the best in the UK,' says Mr Kelsall. Among the big investments this year has been British Airways' maintenance hangar at Cardiff Wales airport, scheduled to be opened by the Prince of Wales today and which will employ as many as 1,000 by 1994. The value of regional selective assistance in stimulating investment was emphasised last April by Mr David Hunt, then Welsh secretary and now employment secretary. 'It has been a great success in encouraging job-creating projects in Wales,' he said. During the previous two years, companies had received more than 390 aid packages, worth nearly Pounds 150m. The aid has not helped the Conservatives to gain electoral ground in Wales. In the 1992 general election, Labour's share of the vote was 49.5 per cent, giving them 27 seats, compared with the Tories' 28.6 per cent and six seats, only two more than Plaid Cymru. But Mr Hunt's successor, Mr John Redwood, defending the redrawn assisted areas map, said it continued to cover the majority of Wales's working population and almost all of the main business locations. Mr Redwood, while valuing inward investment, believes that more needs to be done to encourage home-grown businesses, innovation, and the substitution of imports of everything from cheeses to domestic appliances. He would like to see more companies with their headquarters in Wales and the strengthening of Cardiff as a financial centre to encourage this. If it is a time of transition at the Welsh Office - with the arrival of Mr Redwood and next week of Mr Michael Scholar from the Treasury as permanent secretary, and at the Welsh Development Agency with a new chairman - so it is with the local authorities. Mr Redwood is pressing ahead with plans to replace the two-tier structure with unitary authorities by April 1995. Despite political differences over such issues, the public sector and private sectors show a willingness to work together, often lacking elsewhere in the UK, to accelerate projects such as urban regeneration. A more fundamental change than an urban facelift will be for Wales to move from the employee culture, which was created by large state-owned industries, to an entrepreneurial culture. The structure of employment is reshaping, with the numbers of male employees steadily falling and those of part-time women workers and self-employed rising. But Wales is still seen as an immature market for the risk and growth capital needed to develop home-grown businesses. Mr Nigel Guy, director in Cardiff of 3i, the venture capital group, says: 'The boost of inward investment can put a veneer over business and economic life in Wales. There are very few second or third generation businesses.' He calls for a sea-change in the way companies look at themselves. 'We need a switch in emphasis to make entreprenuerialism more respectable.' The Institute of Welsh Affairs, in its report: Wales 2010: Creating our future, says that small and medium-sized enterprises will be crucial in meeting the ambitious growth targets which it believes are possible. 'To achieve its enterprise culture, Wales needs nothing short of a cultural revolution.' Having survived the recession, that may be the next test for Wales.</p>

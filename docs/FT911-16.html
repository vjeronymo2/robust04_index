			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers' Viewpoint - Machinery rings seem an all-round success story / The time is coming in the UK for a co-operative idea already working very well on the Continent Farmers love government grants. But the flurry of urgent activity in recent weeks to beat today's deadline for applications for grant aid to help set up machinery rings has been out of all proportion to their value. There are much more significant reasons for farmers to co-operate in an effort to cut the capital costs of machinery. The ending of the modest Pounds 10,000 per ring grant payable over three years merely concentrated minds. Machinery rings began in Germany about 25 years ago. Born out of hard times, they brought together groups of farmers in local areas who were prepared to work some of their machinery on other people's farms where the appropriate tackle was worn out or did not exist. In other words, one member of a ring might provide the combine harvester and deal with the grain on a number of farms while another would bale the straw and yet another might plough and plant all the land for the following year's crops. Rings formalised local arrangements of this kind which had been going on between farmers in the same village for years and set standard charges for given tasks. By broadening the area over which such arrangements operated, it also gave members access to more specialised equipment. By employing a manager to co-ordinate the work it provided organisation and a guarantee of payment to those who did the work. Today, there are about 260 machinery rings in Germany and the idea has spread to other European countries, especially Holland and France. There were no rings established in the UK, however, until 1987 after a visit to Germany by a Scottish agricultural adviser who came home and enthused his clients over the concept. Since then, 10 machinery rings have been set up in Scotland. Although most are still developing and expanding, it is expected that the total turnover of the Scottish rings this year will reach Pounds 2.5m. Moreover, the single most successful Scottish group, with 220 members already, has a turnover in excess of Pounds 1m. The first English machinery ring was formed in Sussex and Kent only last year. Since then, 15 more have been established across the country. All have or are hoping to qualify for the Pounds 10,000 grant, 25 per cent of which comes from the EC and 75 per cent from the UK government. The scheme is administered by Food From Britain. At least another two rings are thought to be in course of formation but they will almost certainly not meet today's grant deadline. Within four years, therefore, Britain has gone from no machinery rings to close to 30 and the majority of them have been set up during the last few weeks. The ending of the grant had undoubtedly speeded their formation (it has been available since 1986) but Pounds 3,333 per year for three years split be-tween perhaps 200-300 farmers is insufficient motivation on its own for what has happened. The plain fact is that the machinery ring is an idea whose time has now come in the UK. To some extent there is an element of following fashion because the concept has received a great deal of publicity in recent months. The main reason for the rush of activity, however, is declining farm profits and the realisation by a growing number of farmers that they must cut their costs to survive in business. On average, the so-called 'variable costs' of running a farm - the money spent on seeds, fertilisers, sprays and so on - amount to between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of total costs. Fixed costs account for the remaining 60 per cent to 65 per cent and cover such things as labour, interest charges, power and machinery. In recent years, as margins have declined, some of these 'fixed costs' have had to become variable as numbers of farmworkers have diminished either through natural wastage or redundancy and as assets have been sold to reduce borrowings and, therefore, interest charges. Power costs are more difficult to control in the face of fluctuating oil prices while real depreciation on machinery values can be horrendous. Indeed, the depreciation rates typically used in farm accounts may well be insufficient to allow for the replacement of machines whose purchase prices continue to rise with inflation. Add to that the fact that many farms are over-mechanised for the understandable reason that farmers like to feel on top of any job, whatever the weather, and it is clear that economies in machinery costs are overdue in the current financial climate. The machinery ring has obviously been recognised as a possible solution. For Pounds 50 per year membership charge and a modest purchase of share capital, a farmer can plug into a source of extra income or extra help, whichever he prefers. Commission charges of 2 per cent are levied on both the demander and the provider of the work to cover the costs of the co-ordinator and his computer. Otherwise, the charges for work are set at similar rates to the most competitive contractors. Experience shows, apparently, that most rings lose money in their first year or two but that as the organisation develops and as members begin to review their machinery replacement policies, the flow of work offered and done builds up dramatically. Indeed, it is possible to foresee situations where some farmers decide to buy bigger machines than they can justify in order to earn extra cash working on other members' farms. At the same time, other farmers may see opportunities to earn more money off the farm and be pleased to pay a ring member to do most of his farm work. The pattern is already established in Germany, albeit on smaller farms than are typical in the UK. It is yet another step towards the establishment of significant numbers of part-time farmers in this country. In any event, those groups of farmers who have their machinery rings up and running are convinced that there is a potential for many more. A couple of weeks ago, there was a meeting of machinery ring leaders at the National Agricultural Centre at Stoneleigh, in Warwickshire. They decided to set up an Association of Machinery Rings to guide those who come after and to lobby on behalf of members on such things as the presently-restricted use of red, tax-free diesel fuel in tractors travelling more than 15 miles from their home base. They see this as a possible inhibition to the efficient working of rings which may cover an area 30 to 40 miles wide. The success of the concept relies on the willing co-operation of farmers. In this country, agricultural co-operation, with a few notable exceptions, has seldom succeeded beyond the first flush of enthusiasm. I believe this machinery ring version of co-operation will work. In any case, the other day I signed up to join one.</p>

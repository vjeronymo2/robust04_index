			<p>BFN     [Text] On 15 April in Marrakech, Morocco, with a rap of his  gavel on the lectern, the chairman of the Uruguay Round of the  GATT trade talks, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu,  closed the thorny process of tough negotiations on the new rules  for world trade, which had lasted seven years. A transitional  stage that is to be concluded on 1 January 1995 with the  institutionalization of the World Trade Organization  (WTO)--which will replace GATT in the settlement of problems  arising from international trade in goods and services--began  there, too.    Having signed on this occasion the Final Declaration of the  Uruguay Round launched in Punta del Este [Uruguay] in 1986, the  representatives from 124 countries burst into applause.    During the transition to the WTO, a Preparatory Committee  will once again have to make great conciliatory efforts to  harmonize different demands on issues such as labor regulations,  regional agreements, relations between trade and monetary  policies, immigration, countries' external debts, trade  practices, and even the alleviation of poverty.    Several bilateral agreements, which were signed at the very  last minute, provided for the mutual granting of compensatory  concessions to member countries or groups of member countries.    Abreu said that following lengthy negotiations "there are  absolutely no victors nor vanquished." He underscored that  countries had made concessions to one another "which obviously  vary in importance according to the blocs involved."  <H5>  Achievements by Uruguay </H5>   Uruguay--which already has a rather open economy--did not  have to make specific bilateral concession to other countries.  Nevertheless, the results of the meeting fell far short of the  expectations Uruguay and the other Cairns Group (exporters of  nonsubsidized agricultural and livestock products) member  countries had concerning the opening of international trade and  the reduction of subsidies to production.    Notwithstanding this, Uruguay obtained several specific  trade  benefits, and will be able to take advantage of the gains  derived from the greater global opening established by the new  regulations. The main achievements for Uruguay are:    Concessions by the United States    -- Tops [preceding word in English]: 50 percent tariff  reduction.    -- Plain weave textiles: 30 percent tariff reduction.    -- Garments made of woven fabric: 20 percent tariff  reduction    -- Knitwear: 10 percent tariff reduction.    -- Cheese: 10 percent tariff reduction.    -- Beef: An annual quota of 20,000 tonnes; a maximum 10  percent tariff will be levied on beef exports, which will  materialize once the country is certified as free of  foot-and-mouth disease.    -- Corned beef and salted beef: Zero tariff is maintained.    -- Dressed meat: Up to 75 percent tariff reduction.    Concessions by the European Union [EU]    -- Beef: A 2,000 tonne increase in the Hilton quota  assigned to Uruguay, which now totals 6,300 tonnes.    -- Mutton: Quota is increased from 5,220 to 5,800 tonnes  with zero tariff.    -- Dairy products: General increase in quotas and tariff  reduction in nearly all products.    -- Textiles: Up to 14 percent tariff reduction.    Rice Market    -- Uruguay will be able to vie for a share in the 380,000  tonnes that Japan agreed to import as part of a general opening  and in the 150,000 tonnes the ROK is going to import. This quota  for both countries will be increased to 1.1 million tonnes in  six years.    General Benefits    Uruguay's exports will benefit from the global opening of  and  boost in trade that is expected to take place worldwide in  several aspects:    -- Tariffs: Tariffs levied by the EU on agricultural and  industrial products will go down by 35 percent and 42 percent  respectively. Tariffs levied by the United States on  agricultural and industrial products will be reduced by 34.2  percent and 37.5 percent respectively. Tariffs levied by Japan  on agricultural and industrial products will be cut by 43.5  percent and 77.5 percent respectively.    -- Domestic Price Support: A 20 percent progressive  reduction in domestic support prices by industrial countries  over a period of six years and a 13.3 percent reduction by  developing countries.    -- Subsidies to Exports: A reduction in budgeted  allocations and volumes of 36 percent and 21 percent  respectively by industrial countries and 24 percent and 14  percent respectively by developing countries.    -- Nontariff barriers: Quotas, statistic or variable  rates, etc., will be quantified as tariffs and will be  progressively reduced by 36 percent in industrial countries and  by 24 percent in developing countries over a period of six years.    -- Animal and plant health agreement: Codes to regulate  the control of animal and plant health are signed, thus  preventing the implementation of discriminatory measures that  act as nontariff barriers.    -- Consolidated tariff: A maximum level of 35 percent is  set.</p>

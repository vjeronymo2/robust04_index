			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAX JACOBSON: CHANTECLAIR LOOKS BETTER THAN IT TASTES  </P> <P> Chanteclair is a French country inn that landed, as if by magic, across the  street from the John Wayne Airport a few years back -- a beautifully designed  theme restaurant of almost otherworldly beauty. The operative word, however, is  "almost."  </P> <P> You enter through a welcoming sitting room where you can relax in very  civilized fashion on one of the elegantly upholstered sofas until your table is  ready. From there, a dapper-looking captain guides you to one of the many  charming dining areas, each done in a different motif.  </P> <P> For lunch you might want to book a table in the atrium, a plant-filled room  flooded with a soft radiance from the overhead skylight. With its pink  tablecloths, green-cushioned chairs and all those plants, this room is so lush  and exotic that Henri Rousseau could have painted a jungle scene there.  </P> <P> At dinner time you may want to sit in the Grand Salon, positioned smartly at  tables decked in proper white linen, surrounded by Louis Quinze blue-and-white  wallpaper. Prop yourself up on the noble, high-backed chairs, and feel  resplendent. For a moment, you'll think you're in the royal catbird seat.  </P> <P> But the moment passes quickly. No matter how dapper the waiters or how idyllic  the setting, you've come here to eat, and that is something which, at present,  you're not likely to do well at Chanteclair.  </P> <P> There's really no good excuse, either. The restaurant recently passed into the  hands of the W. R. Grace Corp., which also owns the El Torito restaurants.  Grace has made at least one smart move in retaining the services of Byron  Gemmell, the talented chef who until recently was turning out some of the  county's best foie gras and sauces at the now-defunct Gemmell's in Costa Mesa.  Gemmell is a classically trained fellow (his teacher was none other than the  late master chef Jean Bertranou of West Hollywood's L'Ermitage) and his  capability is beyond reproach. That's why it's annoying to report that this  restaurant has such a long way to go.  </P> <P> Gemmell isn't really doing the cooking, you see. Grace has been using him in a  supervisory capacity, as a trainer and consultant. And so far, it looks as if  his talents are being wasted. The menu hasn't changed much since Gemmell came  aboard (although I'm told changes are planned). Meanwhile, the cooking doesn't  nearly measure up to anything with which this chef has been associated in the  past.  </P> <P> One has to wonder how the corporate yoke weighs on Gemmell's neck here. It felt  pretty heavy around mine when I was eating the food, especially during my last  lunch. A friend and I began with a terrible Caesar salad, inexplicably priced  at nearly $10 (at dinner, a better Caesar is mixed tableside for $6.50). The  salad was warm, the greens were limp and there was no discernible taste of  cheese or anchovy. I sent it back to the kitchen.  </P> <P> What my friend ordered wasn't much better: a mealy lobster bisque with a watery  little dollop of creme fraiche on top. If the atrium hadn't been so comfortable  and relaxing, we might just have packed it in right there. Instead, we nibbled  on a shrimp salad doused with a vinaigrette that tasted slightly stale.  </P> <P> Next came sauteed shrimp and scallops in sweet red pepper sauce and grilled  lamb T-bone chops with ratatouille and rosemary polenta. What the dapper  captain didn't tell us was that the lamb chops also came in a sweet red pepper  sauce -- the same sweet red pepper sauce as the shrimp! And an unpleasantly  bitter sauce at that.  </P> <P> Dinner was somewhat better, although far from memorable. One appetizer, a  simple enough conceit of ahi charred rare, was ill-treated by an insipid  orange-ginger sauce. Another, a game bird and pistachio pate, had the stamp of  high-speed food processor all over it: A uniformly mixed loaf, it had the  texture of Spam. The only appetizer that worked well was quail with wild  mushroom mousse. Basically a delicate duxelles of the sort Gemmell used to do  at his namesake restaurant, the mousse was beautifully offset by a good, fresh  piece of grilled quail.  </P> <P> The main dishes we tried, though, mostly lacked style. The class of the field  was sea bass, a perfectly cooked piece of fish in a tomato-Chardonnay  reduction, redolent of herbs and saffron. The firm and buttery fish had a  mysterious flavor distantly reminiscent of North Africa. One would have sworn  it had been prepared in a different kitchen.  </P> <P> Crispy duck and sweetbreads, however, were more symptomatic of the restaurant's  flaws. The first-rate Muscovy duck breast had been crisped to a frazzle, then  smothered in a sticky-sweet cherry sauce. The sweetbreads, blessed with an  excellent sauce of balsamic vinegar, tomato and basil, were themselves sinewy  rather than meltingly tender, as if they had either been stored too long or  hadn't been quite choice sweetbreads to begin with.  </P> <P> The desserts also seemed exhumed from long storage. They were elaborately  dished-up affairs sitting glumly in painted pools of sauce, and most had begun  to melt and run by the time the tray reached our table, like wax effigies in a  monster movie. The oozing three-layer mocha terrine, in particular, looked as  if it had been stuck under a broiler for a couple of seconds.  </P> <P> What's painfully obvious through the gloom is that this is a restaurant with  great potential. It seats 220, is breathtakingly beautiful and has a killer  location. It seems a shame to waste.  </P> <P> But all we can do for now is wait to see what El Torito decides to do with  Chanteclair. I'm almost tempted to come back sometime soon and check on the  progress. Almost.  </P> <P> Chanteclair is moderately expensive. Prices from the dinner menu are as  follows; appetizers, $6.95 to $15.95, salads and soups, $3.50 to $9.50,  entrees, $17.50 to $24.95, desserts $5.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHANTECLAIR  </P> <P> 18912 MacArthur Blvd., Irvine  </P> <P> (714) 752-8001  </P> <P> Open Mondays through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays  6 to 11 p.m.; Sundays 10:30 to 2:30, 5 to 10.  </P> <P> All major cards accepted.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez  yesterday signed two agreements with Efrain Goldenberg  Schreiber, the prime and foreign minister. One relates to  customs cooperation between the National Customs Administration  Superintendency (Sunad) and the Cuban General Customs  Directorate. The other is a cooperation agreement on the  struggle against drug trafficking.    Robaina said his country has signed similar documents with  other countries.    Robaina met yesterday in private with his Peruvian  counterpart. He said his country offers necessary legal  guarantees for Peruvian businessmen to invest in Cuba.    He said: "There is communication and room for exchange. We  want to talk about Cuba's real situation and we want to know the  real situation in Peru."    Before meeting with Goldenberg, Robaina lectured to  businessmen on what his country has to offer.    He said he will also explain what Cuba has to offer to the  Peruvian foreign minister because he wants to strengthen  bilateral commercial relations.    He added: "The most important issues are related to sugar,  tourism, and medical, paramedical, scientific, biotechnological,  and sports cooperation."</p>

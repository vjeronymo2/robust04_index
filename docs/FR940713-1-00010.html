			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Separation of the Trimmable Lesion/Condition Category From the Processing/Trim Categories <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> One goal of the proposed revised FPS program would be to ensure process control with a statistically valid method of identifying trimmable lesions and conditions and product requiring rework. The confidence level of the proposed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> on-line  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> test ensures a standard of no tolerance for trimmable lesions and conditions. The test would be objective and would result in actions that are firm, fair, and consistent. The standard for trimmable lesion/condition nonconformances is met through testing and actions independent of the other proposed FPS nonconformance categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Separating the trimmable lesion/condition category from the other proposed FPS nonconformance categories allows independent actions which include: (a) Monitoring a statistically valid number of carcasses on-line; (b) notifying the IIC immediately of trimmable lesion/condition nonconformance; (c) accurately identifying product with trimmable lesion/condition nonconformance for rework; (d) recording and evaluating corrective actions taken. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current finished product standards (FPS) program assigns a point value to the trimmable lesion/condition nonconformances found during a 10-bird monitoring test. These points are included in the CUSUM calculation for the pre-chill trim test. At the same time, trimmable lesion/condition nonconformances have a ``zero tolerance.'' That is, an immediate retest involving an additional 10-bird sample is required when a trimmable lesion/condition is detected. The 10-bird retest is not a statistically valid number of carcasses. The probability that trimmable lesions and conditions will be found through such 10-bird tests is low, even when the process is out of control. Thus, the testing does not result in identifying product for rework. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed on-line verification test is statistically based to ensure processing control and takes a reasonably short time to perform. The test would be conducted by the establishment on a 300-bird sample taken after the final wash at the reinspection sample collection site. An FSIS floor inspector would typically perform verification sampling for the Agency. A line-stop button would be required to facilitate the removal of carcasses with trimmable lesions and conditions during the on-line test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Simplifcation of Rules for Monitoring On-Line Processing Control <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An additional goal of the proposed revised FPS program would be to modify testing rules and procedures to ensure that testing is sensitive and specific enough to identify loss of processing control. A high probability of identifying product requiring rework would be associated with actions taken on the basis of the tests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned, testing rules in the current FPS program are cumbersome and result in repeated testing which rarely results in identifying product for rework. When pre-chill nonconformances reach action levels, immediate multiple location testing and retesting is required at pre-chill, post-chill, and on-line control points. This increase in simultaneous testing is labor-intensive for both the establishment and inspection. This labor-intensive effort rarely results in the identification of product for rework. There is little incentive to do testing that almost never leads to regulatory action. The program requirements generate a lot of paper work, while the intended effect on processing control is difficult to quantify. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revised FPS program would identify when the establishment's processing is out of control and product requires rework. All monitoring tests would be applied at pre-chill. Under the current FPS program, product is tested at post-chill using pre-chill standards to identify product requiring rework. At post-chill, product from multiple evisceration lines is sometimes commingled in one chiller. This commingling dilutes nonconformances and decreases the probability of identifying product for rework when tested post-chill. With the proposed FPS, all affected carcasses would be subject to reinspection, identified at pre-chill, and segregated for rework. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revised FPS is easily applied even when carcasses go directly to further processing. The proposed categories (Table 1 at proposed 9 CFR 381.76(h)) are designed to provide feedback to the establishment to ensure processing control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Corrective Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the on-line postmortem inspector observed a bird that should have been condemned or designated and marked for off-line knife-salvage, trimming, or reprocessing, the inspector would stop the processing line to make a proper disposition. The inspector would have the bird condemned, removed from the line, or, if the condition of the bird was found to be questionable, placed on a hang-back rack for veterinary disposition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

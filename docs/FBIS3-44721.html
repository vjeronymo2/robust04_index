Cheng Weigao pointed out: Leadership at all levels should  overcome the leftist influence and change the sub-standard  concept cropping up in regarding science and technology as  productive forces and in developing the market economy. Efforts  should be made to deepen the reform, to readjust the policies,  and to do a good job in stabilizing the establishment of a large  number of non-government enterprises. This means that we should  support and encourage by relaxing the policies' restrictions a  large number of scientific and technological personnel to open  more non-government enterprises in line with the needs of  markets both at home and abroad. This also means that we should  apply preferential policies and good services to attracting a  large number of outstanding scientific and technological  personnel throughout the country to work in the province. We  should also conduct reform among the state-owned scientific  research units with regard to having the state-owned  institutions in this regard be operated by individuals. We  should support a number of non-government units to open  joint-venture enterprises with foreign businessmen or firms.    Cheng Weigao urged the leadership at all levels to enhance  their services and to truly deal with the problems in which the  public opinions on scientific and technological personnel is  unfair, policies include discrimination against these personnel,  the regulations and rules on these personnel are seriously in a  mess, and nobody is supporting these personnel.    Cheng Weigao stressed: Non-government enterprises should  also deepen their internal reform and upgrade their quality so  as to better bring the role of non-government enterprises in  being a fine mechanism.    At yesterday's commendation meeting, the Baoding city  people's government and the Applied Technologies Development  Institute of Xingtai city delivered reports on their experiences  gained in this regard. The participating representatives will  pay a visit to the three institutes on 7 January, including the  Apartment Construction Technology Institute of Baoding city.    At yesterday's commendation meeting 10 industrialists from  the state-owned enterprises being operated by individuals,  including the Hebei technology development company, as well as  from various counties were respectively awarded.

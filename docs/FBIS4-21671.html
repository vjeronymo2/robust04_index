			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program  Network in Ukrainian at 1205 GMT on 31 March carries the  40-minute live "Independence" program on the issue of atomic  power plants and nuclear energy in Ukraine. The program is  moderated by Serhiy Omelchuk and the guest is Mikhaylo Umanets,  chairman of the State Committee for Nuclear Energy  (Derzhkomatom). Mikhaylo Umanets speaks Russian throughout the  program.    In his introduction, the moderator states that "an economy  without power engineering is like a car without an engine."  Such an opinion, according to him, can be also expressed with  regard to nuclear power engineering. Having stated that the  "seemingly most difficult winter" in the history of Ukraine's  power engineering has just concluded, the moderator asks Umanets  to make some preliminary conclusions "without going into  details."    Umanets begins with a statement that "one can be satisfied  with the results" and says: "We have fully met our obligations  to the state by producing 75 billion kilowatt-hours of energy,  that is, 3 billion more than in 1992. Energy produced in  Ukraine constituted 33 percent [of all energy production]. We  have had 12 incidents at various stations, but, fortunately for  us, none of them could be rated as an accident on the  international scale NS [as heard], which is now being used  throughout the world. I think that our radio listeners already  know that this system has seven levels. The seventh degree means  the worst accident, of the Chernobyl type. The first three  levels are related to minor incidents, while the last four, are  the nearest to accidents. So, we have not had any accidents.  Of those events, eleven were rated at the first level, and only  one -- at the second degree. Thus, at first glance, it may seem  that we should be satisfied with our results, but,  unfortunately, it is not the case. I do not know what your  second question will be -- maybe, I will answer it without being  asked -- but we are not satisfied with the results, because this  winter, in principle, we have totally exhausted our reserves to  accomplish what we have done."    Asked to comment on how nonpayments for energy supplies  affect the nuclear power industry, Umanets states that "we have  worked for free over these past seven months, or even longer."  The reasons for this, he explains, are twofold: "First, the  monetary system is not working, and we have permanent debtors  who today owe us 1.8 trillion karbovanetses. Second, the  tariffs for electrical energy are not being updated in proper  time." By now, Umanets continues, many power units are being  shut down due to the "spring and summer repair campaign."  "However," he states, "we have neither spare parts nor fuel to  make these repairs in due time." According to him, the problems  of nuclear power engineering could be solved if all the debts  were settled with a "ruble exchange rate of 1:7," which was  established by the National Bank according to "calculated  production costs." "If this is not going to happen," he says,  "it is not excluded that a number of power units will not be  ready for winter to keep the energy system going." Further, he  states: "This morning I saw that the system had a frequency  rating of 49.35 Hz. The system is close to disintegration."    The moderator recalls that the Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian  trilateral agreement on nuclear disarmament stipulates that  Ukraine is to obtain nuclear fuel as compensation for its  nuclear warheads. He asks Umanets whether Russia is fulfilling  this agreement. Umanets states that the first shipment with  nuclear warheads has been dispatched to Russia and says: "As of  today, we have not obtained any fuel. For the time being, I am  not able to say when we might receive a shipment. An agreement  on the procedures and terms for fuel deliveries has not been  signed with the Russian side. The United States has not  fulfilled its obligations, either; it has not given initial  [pervyye oborotnyye] means for this process -- the promised $60  million. During his visit to Ukraine, the U.S. secretary of  defense promised that the $60 million would be in Russia within  ten days of his return to the United States. However, time goes  on, and there is still no money. At my level, I have contacts  with the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering and  Industry, and I know that they have no means with which to pay  the factory -- and nowadays the factory will not give its  nuclear fuel away for free -- they have no means to pay the  factory to have the fuel shipped here. Therefore, the question  must still be resolved at very high levels, in any case, at the  Cabinet of Ministers level."    The moderator goes on to ask Umanets to provide some  information on the personnel situation at nuclear power  facilities, because "there is a trend of nuclear specialists  leaving Ukraine to take jobs in the neighboring state." Umanets  says that "much good has been done during this year" in the  training of nuclear specialists, in particular, "a full-scale  training simulator" was established at the Zaporozhskaya Nuclear  Power Plant, and preparations were made to establish such a  simulator at the Khmelnitskaya Nuclear Power Plant.  "Small-scale simulators," he continues, will be established at  the Yuzhnoukrayinska and Rovenskaya plants with French  assistance. Ukrainian nuclear specialists, he adds, are being  trained in Germany. Next, Umanets states: "This year's outflow  of cadres from nuclear plants was a terrible blow to us. There  are three reasons for this, and all three of them should be  named here: First, the attractiveness of the private sector;  this cannot be ignored -- many talented people go there.  Second, the disintegration of the Soviet Union -- it is natural  that under these circumstances everyone is free to choose his or  her fatherland. However, the most prevailing factor is low  salaries." Umanets says that his own salary amounts to around  $40, while his son-in-law, who is working as an engineer at a  nuclear power plant in Lithuania, earns over $300. He adds:  "In comparison with Russia, our salaries are six times lower."  He also points out that Russia provides nuclear specialists  with housing, while Ukraine has problems doing that. Umanets  states that "a brain drain has begun" and that "our personnel  reserves are almost exhausted, because about 2,500 men left us  in 1993." He says that Ukraine has made a move to train its own  "national cadres" by opening the faculty of power engineering at  the Sevastopol Naval Institute in September 1993, where 72  students have already begun their studies.    The moderator proposes to answer some questions from  listeners, which have been received during the program. The  first question raises doubt whether it is expedient for Ukraine  to produce its own nuclear fuel rods, which must currently be  supplied by Russia. Umanets states that, by using all of  Ukraine's technical and scientific potential to produce rods,  "the contribution of nuclear fuel to [energy] production costs  can be reduced by a factor of two, from 62 percent to about 30  percent." He also says that all the expenditures to produce  Ukraine's own nuclear fuel, according to preliminary estimates,  can be earned back in no more than four years.    The second question from a listener concerns the disposal of  nuclear waste. The moderator adds to this his own questions  about the ways to secure the technological processes in the  production of Ukraine's nuclear fuel. Umanets begins by saying  that "one has to be extremely frank on this issue." He states  that there is a need to create a system of nuclear waste  disposal in Ukraine. The most important issue, in his opinion,  is the disposal of nuclear waste from the Chernobyl disaster;  namely, "unit no. 4 at the Chernobyl plant and polluted zones  within a 30-km radius."    Answering the moderator's question about "the most probable  scheme" for storing nuclear waste, Umanets states that "there  should be intermediate depositories for 50-60 years, as well as  permanent depositories." Emphasizing that this is his personal  opinion, Umanets says that intermediate depositories can be  located in the 30-km radius around Chernobyl which "can still  play a positive role in Ukraine's national economy, namely in  dealings with nuclear waste." With regard to permanent  depositories, Umanets says that this issue should be examined by  geologists. He adds that he prefers to deal with nuclear waste  in England, where geologists have found suitable formations for  storing nuclear waste.    Next, the moderator asks Umanets to report on the  implementation of an international project to build a new  sarcophagus over unit no. 4 at the Chernobyl plant. Umanets  states that there is no such international project. In Kiev, he  explains, an international contest was held, which selected six  projects; the authors of these projects formed "a consortium" to  continue work on the "project's economic feasibility." This  consortium, Umanets adds, to get money from "foreign banks" for  the implementation of its project, has to win "a tender."  Umanets did not rule out the possibility that there will be a  special fund created for the Chernobyl plant. Talks toward this  end, he adds, are already being conducted "at the presidential  level." Asked to specify which countries will participate in  the project, Umanets names France, Germany, and Great Britain.  He adds that there will be no delay in the building of a new  sarcophagus if Ukraine gets the money for it.    Asked to comment on the possibility of introducing share  capital in Ukraine's nuclear power engineering system, Umanets  says that, in his personal opinion, this can be done following  the creation of a "nuclear fuel cycle" by Ukraine, the  completion of nuclear units, and arrangements for the disposal  of nuclear waste.    At the end of the program, Umanets states that his committee  will try to pass through the new parliament a law on  "privileges" for workers living in the 30-km radius around  Chernobyl. He also promises that the committee will do  everything to put the largest possible number of power units in  operation by next winter.</p>

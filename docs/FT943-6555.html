			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Lifeline to troubled shipbuilder reaches breaking point: Chris Tighe analyses the bargaining on which Swan Hunter's fate hinges This week should witness the making or breaking of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder which has clung tenaciously to life since it passed into receivership in May last year. By Wednesday Soffia/Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the only prospective bidder to emerge from a worldwide search by receiver Price Waterhouse, must commit itself to putting cash on the table after more than six months of negotiations. The prospects of selling the business as a going concern are extremely slim if, as seems probable, CMN does not come up with the money. In that case the receiver is likely to announce that Swans will close in the autumn once its last vessel, the Type 23 frigate Richmond, is handed over to the navy - barring the highly unexpected appearance of another bidder. The French-based, Lebanese-Christian Safa family who are the majority shareholders in CMN and its parent, Soffia, have spent the weekend in St Tropez discussing whether to pursue acquisition of Swans. On Friday Mr Iskandar Safa, Soffia's senior director, and Mr Fred Henderson, CMN's bid-team leader, blamed their review on doubts about whether the government and the Ministry of Defence wished to see shipbuilding continue on Tyneside. But others involved in the negotiations are becoming impatient with what they see as prevarication by CMN, presumably in an attempt to drive a hard bargain. Mr Dick Gonsalez, Swan Hunter union leader who has fought doggedly to keep the yard alive, said: 'CMN have got to make their minds up, they have got to put money where their mouth is. As long as the MoD sees them posturing, they're going to do the same. It's only when they put real hard cash up that it will make a difference.' The receiver's Wednesday deadline is for CMN to start paying the wages of the yard's remaining 100-strong design and technical team, which is vital to tendering. They will otherwise be made redundant immediately, ending Swans' prospects of winning the two-year order book which CMN is insisting on before buying the company. The MoD's decision on July 19 to award the Sir Bedivere landing ship refit to the Rosyth yard rather Swan Hunter had been expected to seal the Tyneside company's fate. CMN then came up with a complex proposal to take over Swans' existing MoD frigates contract and sub-contract the work to the receiver, using the balance to pay the design team's Pounds 200,000 monthly wage bill until the end of this year. This would enable Swans to compete for an MoD ocean survey vessel for which tender invitations were issued last week. If won, it would provide the two years' work CMN requires. Under the offer - made after the receiver said CMN's bid was well below Swans' Pounds 7.2m break-up value - the French company said it would also pay about Pounds 5m for the assets. It claims a tax-loss deal, subject to Inland Revenue agreement, could add a further Pounds 5m. CMN wants Pounds 57.7m for the frigate contract, the price agreed last month. The MoD, saying that passing time has reduced the risk, last week offered Pounds 57m, but then suggested meeting CMN half way. CMN says the issue is not the Pounds 350,000 gap, but the MoD's attitude. The MoD is unimpressed. An MoD source said: 'We think they've shot themselves in the foot.' For Swans' remaining 660 employees this will be a week of numbing tension. Mr Peter Hilton, a senior electrical designer who has worked at Swans for 30 years, said: 'Everybody is under no illusion. They're all expecting it to close.'</p>

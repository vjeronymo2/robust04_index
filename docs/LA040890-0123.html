			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAUDING LEHMAN  </P> <P> Re Robert Ward's April 1 review of Ian Hamilton's "Writers in Hollywood," I  hasten to decline my share of a well-intentioned compliment.  </P> <P> In my not-so-humble opinion, it was director Alexander Mackendrick who was the  chief creative driving force behind the film "Sweet Smell of Success." It was  his brilliance as director that gave the picture whatever qualities it has that  have elicited praise over the years. And apparently neither author Hamilton nor  reviewer Ward is aware that Mackendrick is the distinguished director of, among  others, two British film classics: "Tight Little Island" and "The Man in the  White Suit."  </P> <P> ERNEST LEHMAN  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

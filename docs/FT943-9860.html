			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Export ban illegal even if not applied  -European Court A clause prohibiting exports by its very nature restricted competition even if it was not actually implemented by the parties, the Court of First Instance held recently. The Court also found fines could be imposed on undertakings even if they were not aware they had infringed EC competition provisions. Finally, it was held that, when imposing such a fine, the Commission should only consider the turnover derived from products to which the infringement related, as opposed to undertakings' total turnover. These findings were made in two cases before the Court relating to a distribution agreement between Parker Pen Ltd and Herlitz AG of Germany. Herlitz had refused to supply a Dutch company with Parker products because of a distribution agreement clause banning exports outside Germany. The Dutch company complained to the Commission, resulting in the imposition of fines on both Parker and Herlitz. Both challenged the Commission decision before the CFI. Herlitz argued it was not dealing with Parker products on a wholesale basis but only sought to complete its own range of products of office equipment which it merely delivered to its own retail shops. Hence Herlitz never intended actually to trade in Parker products, which is why it had neither the interest nor the intention of preventing parallel imports by relying on the export ban clause. The sole purpose of this clause was to enable Herlitz politely to refuse unwelcome demands. Also, the ban had no practical effect as Herlitz's products suited only German-speakers. The CFI held an export ban, by its nature, restricted competition. The mere existence of such a clause could create a 'visual and psychological' effect sufficient to make it unlawful, even if it had not been implemented. On the facts, however, the Court found Herlitz had invoked the clause to refuse to supply the Dutch complainant. Finally, the CFI concluded that, for an infringement of EC competition law to be intentional, so allowing the Commission to fine the undertaking, the undertaking did not have to have been aware of an actual infringement of EC competition provisions. It was sufficient that it was aware that the object of the offending conduct was to restrict competition. In its own appeal, Parker argued further grounds: first, the export ban did not appreciably affect trade between member states; second, the Commission had no interest in proceeding against Parker because the former had declined, in the absence of any public interest, to pursue a related complaint by the Dutch complainant; third, the Commission had not fined other companies accused of similar practices and, by fining Parker, the Commission had infringed the principle of equal treatment; and fourth, the fine was disproportionate. The Court held on the first point that it was necessary to look at the position and importance of the parties in the relevant market. If sales of at least one of the parties constituted a not inconsiderable proportion of the relevant market, EC competition rules should apply. The CFI concluded from the files that the respective position of the parties on the market was, in principle, capable of affecting intra-Community trade. On the second point, the Court held the Commission had correctly used its discretion and not erred in law. On the third point, the Court reiterated European Court case law, which held an undertaking, having breached EC competition law, could not escape without penalty by arguing another trader had not been fined for similar conduct. On the final point, the Court held an appropriate fine could not be fixed by a simple calculation on total turnover, as had been done by the Commission in the present case. Rather, the Commission should only have considered the turnover of the goods to which the infringement related. Since Parker's turnover in those products accounted for only a relatively low proportion of this total turnover, the fine was disproportionate and so had to be reduced.

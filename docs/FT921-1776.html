			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Little benefit to managers in demise of closed shops THE NEAR-disappearance of the closed shop after more than a decade of Conservative government has produced neither great gains nor losses for managers, according to a paper prepared for a conference today to be held by the Centre for Economic Performance Industrial Relations Group. The report suggests that many closed shops are 'sleeping dogs'. They avoid legal problems because nobody gets sacked for not belonging to a union, but in other ways operate much as they did in the past. A poll commissioned by the Department of Employment in 1989 found that 2.6m people thought they were still in closed shops. That represented a fall of 50 per cent since the high point of the closed shop at the end of the 1970s. But, as the report points out, 2.6m is a high figure for an institution that is meant to be unlawful. They suggest that the 'real closed shop population' - closed shop agreements that continue to exist in spite of it being illegal to sack someone for leaving the union - may be 500,000. The report concludes that the managerial indifference which marked the rise of the closed shop in the late 1970s seems also to have attended its demise in the 1980s.</p>

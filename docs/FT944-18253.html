			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (9): BSkyB fights back - Interview with Sam Chisholm, chief executive Mr Sam Chisholm, the tough chief executive of British Sky Broadcasting, is in a typically pugnacious mood. 'ITV is going to run out of sand to stick their heads in,' he says. Mr Chisholm is referring to the fact that the ITV companies finance a regular independent survey of the satellite market by GfK, the market research group, whose findings in recent months have suggested that dish sales have slowed down and that BSkyB is running out of steam. 'We will let the results speak for themselves. We will just keep on and on,' he insists. There is no easy way to bridge the gap between the BSkyB numbers and those produced by GfK. The research group says, for instance that dish sales slumped to 20,000 in May despite an offer in April and May in which Sky Television services were on free trial. BSkyB says more than 100,000 dishes were supplied under the scheme and only around 10 per cent returned. 'There is no evidence that it (demand for dishes) is slackening off,' says Mr Chisholm, who adds that total sales this year should be around 1m, roughly the same as last year and the year before that. In August BSkyB, a consortium in which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has a 50 per cent stake and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has 17.5 per cent, did give hard numbers to City analysts when the satellite company announced results for the year to June 1994. Group profits before interest rose to Pounds 185.8m and profit going to shareholders to help pay off the more than Pounds 1.5bn invested rose from Pounds 54.1m in 1993 to Pounds 176.8m. Charts based on the company's own figures show that weekly dish sales for the year to June did not drop below 11,000 and reached a pre-Christmas peak of more than 36,000 and that the number of subscribers grew in a relatively straight line from about 250,000 in December 1989 to 3.45m by the end of June 1994. In its latest financial year BSkyB said its subscriber base increased by 1.1m - a rise of 46 per cent, the numbers of subscribers taking both movie channels and the sports channel growing by 750,000. Out of the total of 3.45m subscribers, 74 per cent were watching on individual dishes, 18 per cent were connected to modern cable networks and a further 8 per cent came from communal aerials and other 'bulk subscriptions'. BSkyB is Europe's leading satellite subscription television service - though the terrestrial subscription service of Canal Plus is still ahead in numbers with 3.7m subscribers. In the past two years, however, BSkyB has been living dangerously. In September 1993 the company began to scramble an extended package of basic channels so that only those who paid Pounds 6.99 a month subscription were able to watch. At the time a raft of non-BSky-B channels such as MTV, Bravo, UK Living, UK Gold and The Discovery Channel came into the Sky Multi-Channels package. The total cost of subscribing to them all was Pounds 19.99 a month. Last month BSkyB announced a Pounds 3 a month price rise which went equally on every form of subscription package. So though it now costs Pounds 22.99 a month to get all the BSkyB channels. the Pounds 3 increase has also been imposed on Sky Multi-Channels, a rise of 43 per cent. To sweeten the pill, the price rise has been accompanied in the past few days by the launch of five new services: VH-1, the music television channel aimed at 25-49 year olds; a second Sky Sports channel, only at the weekends; four hours a day of soaps; a travel channel produced for Sky by Thames Television; and a daytime slot for The Learning Channel from cable which will share a transponder with Discovery, the factual and documentary channel that will take over at 4pm. Of the additions, only VH-1, a channel aimed at the UK market and like MTV owned by Viacom of the US, is a full 24-hour channel. If BSkyB can hold onto its existing subscribers at the new rates and add to the total, then the 1994-95 profits could be substantially higher than this year's. It is unlikely that the extra cost of the modest increase in programme services will be anything like the increased subscription revenues. 'There is absolutely no objection to the price rise,' claims Mr Chisholm who adds that another seven channels could be on the way once the fourth Astra satellite is launched at the end of this month. The new channels are likely to be a mixture of pay-per-view films plus a number of other non-movie channels. Inevitably, they will further fragment the audience in cable and satellite homes, underlining the fact that satellite television is a business built not on ratings but on the number of subscribers paying for additional choice. More than 82 per cent of BSkyB's revenues at the moment come from subscriptions, though advertising revenues rose from Pounds 43.8m in 1992 to Pounds 78.1m in 1994. Despite a doubling of channel choice available, the overall share of viewing to the new media has not changed greatly in cable and satellite homes. According to official Barb ratings the share of viewing of the new channels has varied between 28 per cent and a high of 36 per cent when exclusive Test Match cricket from the West Indies cricket was being shown. And apart from Sky 1, viewing to the new channels tends to be dominated by movies, sport, cartoons and the library channel UK Gold, with some of the specialised, thematic channels attracting average weekly viewing figures of less than 15 minutes.</p>

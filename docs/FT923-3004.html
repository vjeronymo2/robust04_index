			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Warning over gold card frauds FRAUD LOSSES on gold cards have reached the point where banks could be forced to consider withdrawing them from the market, according to Mr Barry Fergus, head of fraud prevention at Barclaycard. Speaking on Channel 4 television today, Mr Fergus warns that gold cards have suffered counterfeiting of epidemic proportions. He says that much of the counterfeiting takes place in the Far East. 'If the losses are not brought under control, you have to question how much longer the products can be sustained,' Mr Fergus said. Losses on card fraud cost the banks Pounds 165m last year.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A Budget to boost Britain - Diary of a Private Investor WITH THE Labour and Conservative parties so close in the opinion polls, the Budget announced by chancellor Norman Lamont on Tuesday could easily decide the general election. So, what should he do? As a private investor, I am not exactly enamoured of Labour's proposals to reduce capital gains tax allowances and to tax such gains at 50 per cent - and possibly more. Except for the stupid, capital gains are not 'unearned' - it requires time and thought to select investments. Besides which, most people have had to scrimp and save from their incomes so they have some money available to invest. Surely they should be encouraged rather than penalised for not having spent it all on frivolous living. On the other hand, I fear the Conservatives will succumb to various pressure groups and make changes in inheritance taxation so that even more money can pass, tax-free, to people who have definitely not earned it. If such a change is announced in the Budget, then Labour will seize on it as 'evidence' of the Conservatives rewarding the lazy and rich at the expense of the hard-working poor. This could cost the Tories the election. In a recession, voters are more concerned with the here and now than what might happen in the hereafter. In 1990, the then chancellor (and now prime minister), John Major, announced that stamp duty on share transactions would be abolished when Taurus (the City's electronic share settlement system) was implemented. This was expected in 1991-92; but as Taurus is still some way in the future, stamp duty should be abolished immediately - not only on share transactions but on everything else (including house purchases) to which it applies. Stamp duty is an unfair tax on investment: it is incurred regardless of whether a profit is made. Its end is long overdue. The taxation system on investments in shares by private individuals should be changed to produce a more level playing field between them and institutional investors; and also to encourage more direct investment in shares, rather than having to invest via a personal equity plan or pension fund manager. A few years ago, under the heading 'chargeable assets acquired,' there was a section in tax forms where people were expected to list the shares they had bought. A similar section should be reinstated. Peps should be abolished, and people could be given a share allowance of around Pounds 10,000 a year. No tax would be required on any gains made from those shares, nor on the gains made from re-investing the proceeds in further share purchases. Similarly, people should be allowed to set aside an amount equivalent to their pension plan payments which they could invest directly in shares instead. They would pay no tax on any gains from such 'pension plan nominated shares.' Tax would be payable only when benefits were taken from this self-operated pension plan. These changes in the tax structure would do much towards shifting the balance of investment away from institutions and back into the direct control of private investors. To encourage fuel efficiency, the 10 per cent car tax should be abolished on all vehicles capable of 40 miles a gallon or more. There should be no increase in taxes on petrol as this raises the RPI and causes higher costs for everyone, especially the lower-paid. In the past, the chancellor has indicated that company cars might well attract more tax. He should look at another option instead. Drivers of these vehicles are more likely to have accidents than other motorists. So, instead of increases in tax on the cars, the chancellor should encourage better driving standards by taxing the actual benefit each driver gets from company-paid insurance. Thus, company car drivers with a poor road record who attract high insurance premiums would be taxed on the direct cost of those - regardless of their salaries. Rather than reduce income tax by one penny, the chancellor should raise allowances substantially. For example, the single person's allowance should be increased from Pounds 3,295 to at least Pounds 4,000; other allowances should go up similarly. The chancellor could then boast about removing hundreds of thousands of people from the tax net and a genuine reduction in taxation on the lower-paid. To demonstrate a 'caring attitude' and to reduce unemployment, the chancellor should allow people to deduct from tax the cost of employing nannies, home helps and care assistants. This would allow more single parents to return to work, and keep more people out of hospital. Indeed, it could well prove much cheaper than paying unemployment and other benefits and costly hospital fees. To reduce unemployment, increase low-cost housing and show that the government plans for the long term rather than just the period between elections, the chancellor should create an enormous new enterprise zone stretching from east London's Docklands along the river Thames to the Maplin sands at the mouth of the estuary. No rates would be paid for 25 years within that area - provided that many thousands of attractively-designed, low-cost houses also were built. This would enable a new, 24-hour international airport to be built on the sands (thus relieving the noise problems at existing airports). It would also allow a new theme park to be constructed to rival Euro-Disney; this would attract billions in foreign currency. There also would be encouragement for new, modern factories and other industries although, unlike Docklands, the roads and fast rail networks should be planned first. To discourage smoking, the chancellor could put a further 20p tax on a packet of cigarettes. Alcohol tax could be increased, perhaps with as much as 5p a pint on beer. In his last Budget, the chancellor taxed one of his personal annoyances  - mobile telephones. Perhaps this year he might impose a hefty tax on large, noisy dogs (small, quiet dogs would be exempt) and a tax on pipe addicts who insist on smoking in public rather than confining their foul-smelling activities to their own homes. Such a Budget would significantly encourage private investors, considerably assist the lower-paid, help to reduce unemployment, and show that the government has long-term plans.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bronfmans sell Labatt stake for close to CDollars 1bn CANADA'S Bronfman family has parted with a second prized asset in less than a week by selling its controlling stake in John Labatt, the brewer and entertainment group. Senior Bronfman officials insisted yesterday that the disposal, which will realise close to CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) was part of a plan to 'simplify and streamline' the vast industrial and financial-services empire. Mr Bob Harding, president of Hees International Bancorp, the Bronfmans' merchant banking arm, said that the Bronfman group has a 'very strong heart' which has been built on equity, rather than short-term debt. The Bronfman group's explanation was greeted with scepticism in the investment community. The disposal comes on the heels of the CDollars 970m sale earlier last week of the Bronfman's interest in MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forestry company. Companies in the Bronfman empire, which are intertwined through complex cross-shareholdings, have recently been rocked by investor uncertainty over the impact of financial problems at Bramalea, the real estate developer currently in bankruptcy protection, and Royal Trust, the financial-services group which is seeking an infusion of outside capital. Brascan, a Bronfman-controlled holding company, sold its 38 per cent stake in Labatt to a group of Canadian securities dealers, led by Wood Gundy, at a price of CDollars 28.25 per share. As in the case of the MacMillan Bloedel deal, the price will be paid in three instalments over the next two years, giving a net present value to buyers of less than CDollars 27 a share. Mr David Cohen, an analyst at Research Capital in Toronto, said that the Labatt shares 'were priced to sell'. Bronfman officials said that the Labatt sale was initiated on short notice by Wood Gundy following the strong response earlier this week to the sale of Macblo shares. The two deals are among the biggest equity offerings ever made by Canadian companies. Wood Gundy said the shares were snapped up yesterday, with 20-25 per cent being placed with European investors and the rest in Canada. Labatt has a 44 per cent share of the Canadian beer market and substantial brewing interests in Europe, including the Rolling Rock brand in the UK. Its entertainment interests include an all-sports cable-TV channel, and the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, which won last year's World Series baseball championship. Labatt's net income rose to CDollars 104m on sales of CDollars 2.3bn in the six months to October 31, from earnings of CDollars 89m and sales of just less than CDollars 2bn a year earlier.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 22 KYODO -- The tiny United Social  Democratic Party (USDP), which helped last August to oust the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after almost four decades in  power, formally dissolved Sunday [22 May], closing the book on  16 years of political activity.    The move, long anticipated as USDP Secretary General Shogo  Abe last December announced that the party's "historical  mission" has been fulfilled with the government change, was made  at a national party convention in Tokyo.    Abe and party chief Satsuki Eda, who served as science and  technology agency chief in the non-LDP coalition government  under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, has already joined  Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP).    The party's third Diet legislator, Yanosuke Narazaki, will  retain his House of Representatives seat as an independent but  is closely affiliated with the Social Democratic Party [of  Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ].    Many of the USDP's estimated 10,000 members in some 22 local  party organizations, some of which have voiced ardent opposition  to the dissolution of their party originally scheduled for  January this year, are expected to enter the JNP.    The USDP, founded in March 1978, evolved from the Socialist  Citizens' League, which was formed in 1977 by a group of  right-wing members of the then Japan Socialist Party (JSP), in  conformity with the wishes of Eda's deceased father, JSP  defector Saburo Eda.    The party saw itself as bridging the gap between the JSP and  its right-wing splinter, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP).    Since the 1985 party congress, Eda and Abe have been leading  the party. Though a small party, the USDP wielded a certain  influence through cooperation in supraparty bodies and  parliamentary alliances with the SDPJ and the DSP.    During its 16-year history, the USDP, struggling to find a  raison d'etre between two other socialist parties and disrupted  by intraparty differences, was more than once close to  disintegration.    In an effort to reinvigorate the party in 1992, Eda founded  the political study group "Sirius" together with reformers in  the SDPJ, but the body collapsed after the USDP suffered major  losses in the general election in July last year.</p>

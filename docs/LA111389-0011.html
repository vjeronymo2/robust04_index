			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURTS STAND TO LOSE A LOT  </P> <P> Unless the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors abandons its eleventh-hour  effort to amend an agreement negotiated and approved in good faith by the  Superior and Municipal Court judges, the county stands to lose $130 million in  state funds, along with the trust and mutual respect that ought to prevail  between co-equal branches of government.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the Brown-Presley Trial Court Funding Act -- a measure  passed to help local governments defray the expense of operating the state's  court system -- Los Angeles County is eligible to receive the $130-million  grant. In order to get the money, however, the county must have an agreement  between the supervisors and the judges on how the funds are to be spent. That  pact must be approved by Wednesday Until last week, the deadline seemed easily  attainable.  </P> <P> Representatives of the courts and county administrators struck a bargain that  would have divided $61.2 million between the Superior and Municipal courts,  while the other nearly $70 million would have gone to fund general county  services and programs. Presiding Superior Court Judge Richard P. Byrne said  that he is "satisfied with (the agreement)." Richard B. Dixon, the county's own  chief administrative officer, called the level of court funding agreed upon  "necessary," since the superivsors would have had to make most of the  expenditures even without state help.  </P> <P> The majority of judges in both court systems share those views, and last week  they voted to approve the agreement. The supervisors, however, have refused to  endorse the pact, insisting that it be amended to include three changes dear to  the hearts of the board's three conservatives. They demand that, in order to  get its money, the Superior Court limit attorney voir dire -- jury selection --  to 30 minutes or less in civil cases and "the greatest extent permisssable in  criminal trials"; that the Alternate Defense Counsel (ADC) -- a private  contractor who represents some indigents when the Public Defender is  unavailable -- have its program extended into all Superior courts by July 1,  and that the Superior Court expand its night court program.  </P> <P> All three of these proposals are of contested worth. The question of whether  Californians wish to surrender their right to trial before a jury in whose  selection their attorney participated deserves the most serious consideration.  Alternate Defense Counsel has yet to demonstrate its cost-effectiveness and  many trial judges privately express reservations about the quality of legal  representation that it provides. Night court is an interesting but not  unproblematic reform whose implications require further study.  </P> <P> Whatever the merits of these proposals, they touch on issues far too serious to  be resolved through what amounts to fiscal blackmail. The courts, acting as the  guarantors of all Angelenos' rights, are correct to resist such rash conduct,  even if it means losing the state aid. The supervisors have created this  confrontation, and they can end it by endorsing the existing agreement before  Wednesday's deadline.  </P></p>

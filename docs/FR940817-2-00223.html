			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.3.5. Consumer Product Safety Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CPSC is an independent Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory agency with jurisdiction over most consumer products. Most chemical hazards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) administered by CPSC. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FHSA requires appropriate cautionary labeling on all hazardous household products (hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include chronic toxicity such as neurotoxicity). While the FHSA does not require premarket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration, a manufacturer is required to assess the hazards of a product prior to marketing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and assure that it is labeled with all necessary cautionary information. The FHSA also bans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children's products that are hazardous and provides the CPSC with the authority to ban other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.3.6. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATSDR has a mission to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent or mitigate adverse effects to both human health and the quality of life resulting from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to hazardous substances in the environment. The ATSDR publishes a National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Priority List (NPL) of hazardous substances that are found at National Priority Waste Sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order of priority is based on an algorithm, taking into consideration frequency with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which substances are found at NPL sites, toxicity, and potential for human exposure; this list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is reranked on a yearly basis. So far, 129 toxicological profiles have been developed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority hazardous substances, and 92 substances have a profile with a neurological health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect endpoint (HAZDAT, 1992). Neurotoxicity has been selected by the ATSDR to be one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the seven high-priority health conditions resulting from exposure to environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.2. Basic Toxicological Considerations for Neurotoxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.2.1. Basic Toxicological Principles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A chemical must enter the body, reach the tissue target site(s), and be maintained at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient concentration for a period of time in order for an adverse effect to occur. Not all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals have the same level of toxicity; some may be very toxic in small amounts while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others may have little effect even at extremely high amounts. Thus, the dose-response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship is a major concept in determining the toxicity of a specific substance. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors in determining toxicity include the physical and chemical properties of the substance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the route and level of exposure, the susceptibility of the target tissue, and the health, gender,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and age of the exposed individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the toxic substance has entered the body, usually through the lungs (inhalation),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the skin (absorption), or the gastrointestinal tract (ingestion), it is partitioned into various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> body tissues where it can act on its target sites. The substance is eliminated from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bloodstream by the process of accumulation into the various sites in the body, with the liver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and kidney being major sites of accumulation of toxic substances. This is thought to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with these organs' large blood capacity and major role in elimination of substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the body. Lipophilic chemicals accumulate in lipid-rich areas of the body and present a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant potential problem for the nervous system. The nervous system is unique in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high percentage content of lipid (50 percent of dry weight) and may be particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vulnerable to such chemicals. The site or sites of accumulation for a specific toxic substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may or may not be the primary sites of action. Examples include two known neurotoxicants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon monoxide in the red blood cells and lead in the bone. It must be noted that some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances are not distributed throughout the body, partially as a function of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insolubility, polarity, or molecular weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effect that a substance has will generally depend on the body burden or level in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tissue and duration of exposure. The time course of the levels is determined by several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors, including the amount at time of exposure, duration of exposure, and metabolic fate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the chemical. The study of such metabolic processes, pharmacokinetics, has demonstrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complex patterns in the absorption, distribution, possible biotransformation, and elimination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of various substances (Klaassen, 1980).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many substances are removed by the kidney and excreted through the urine. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liver can detoxify substances like organic lead, which are excreted from the liver into the bile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and then the small intestines, bypassing the blood and kidney. Lipophilic toxic substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are primarily removed from the body through feces and bile, and water-soluble metabolites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are removed in the urine, through the skin, and through expiration into the air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Biotransformation is a biochemical process that converts a substance into a different chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compound, allowing it to be excreted more easily. Substances are more easily removed if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are biotransformed into a more hydrophilic compound. Biotransformation can either aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the detoxification of a substance or produce a more toxic metabolite. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original substance may not be the substance that is producing the toxicity on the nervous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system or any other system. Thus, several factors must be taken into consideration when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating the potential neurotoxicity of a chemical. They include the pharmacokinetics of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the parent compound, the target tissue concentrations of the parent chemical or its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bioactivated proximate toxicant, the uptake kinetics of the parent chemical or metabolite into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cell and/or membrane interactions, and the interaction of the chemical or metabolite with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumed receptor sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.2.2. Basic Neurotoxicological Principles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Neurotoxicity can be manifest as a structural or functional adverse response of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nervous system to a chemical, biological, or physical agent (Tilson, 1990b). It is a function  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of both the property of the agent and a property of the nervous system itself. Neurotoxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refers broadly to the adverse neural responses following exposure to chemical or physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents (e.g., radiation) (Tilson, 1990b). Adverse effects include any change that diminishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ability to survive, reproduce, or adapt to the environment. Neuroactive substances may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also impair health indirectly by altering behavior in such a way that safety is decreased in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of numerous activities. Toxicity can occur at any time in the life cycle, from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conception through senescence, and its manifestations can change with age. The range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responses can vary from temporary responses following acute exposures to delayed responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following acute or chronic exposure to persistent responses. Neurotoxicity may or may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reversible following cessation of exposure. The responses may be graded from transient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to fatal and there may be different responses to the same neurotoxicant at different dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels but similar responses to exposure to different agents. Displays of a neurotoxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response may be progressive in nature, with small deficits occurring early in exposure and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing to become more severe over time. Expression of neurotoxicity can encompass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple levels of organization and complexity including structural, biochemical,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physiological, and behavioral measurements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST THE FOUNDATION KIDS NEED  </P> <P> In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. In 1988, President  Ronald Reagan glibly concluded that poverty had won, and few challenged the  cynical assertion. But there were victories in the war on poverty -- noteworthy  achievements by Great Society programs that Johnson supported. A recent Times  feature story on the Mexican American Opportunities Foundation is a useful  reminder of that fact.  </P> <P> The foundation operates eight day-care centers for Spanish-speaking children in  Southern California. Recently, two centers in the East Los Angeles barrio broke  new ground by incorporating computers into preschool classes. Latino youngsters  use them to learn reading, writing and even Mexican history. The computers were  donated by private corporations that are trying to make up for dwindling  federal support of self-help programs.  </P> <P> At a time when two of the most serious problems facing this region -- youth  gangs and school dropouts -- affect so many youngsters who seem to be going  wrong, it is refreshing to hear of a successful effort to steer them in the  right direction. What may have surprised many readers is that MAOF has been  doing this kind of good work since the War on Poverty days. Its first day-care  center opened in 1973 with just 17 children; now it serves about 1,500. Imagine  how much more good the foundation and organizations like it could do with even  more financial support, not just from the private sector but from government,  too.  </P></p>

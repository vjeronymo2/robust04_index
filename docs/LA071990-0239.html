			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> RETTON SAVORS POST-OLYMPIC ERA  </P> <P> At 22, with Olympic gold behind her, gymnastics has finally become fun for Mary  Lou Retton.  </P> <P> "Now I perform, I don't compete and that makes a real difference," Retton said.  </P> <P> Retton was the sensation of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Her gold  medal, in the all-around competition, was the first ever for an American woman  gymnast.  </P> <P> "When we were practicing for the Olympics, we spent eight hours a day in the  gym," she said Monday. "The time in between practice, we were too tired to do  anything else."  </P> <P> "If you want to be successful you give up your social life. You give up  everything except gymnastics," she said.  </P> <P> Now, Retton performs six to eight times a year, travels as a motivational  speaker and does charity work. She also is engaged to be married in December.  </P></p>

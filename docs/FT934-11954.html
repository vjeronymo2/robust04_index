			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ferranti fervour Speculation that a bid for troubled defence electronics group Ferranti International may develop into a two-horse race swept through the market, producing a rally in the shares and record volume of nearly 9 per cent of the company's share capital. The group said on Tuesday that it was in talks that might lead to a bid at a penny a share. Market watchers pointed to defence electronics group GEC as the most likely suitor, with a few suggesting French group Thomson CSF as a possible candidate. However, early yesterday, talk that there could be an alternative offer did the rounds, although with no name attached to the latest speculation. Tuesday's dramatic slump in the shares was quickly reversed and they closed 1 1/2 up at 4p, after hectic trading which saw 82m shares dealt. Most of the selling was said to have come from the large institutions, with short-term speculators reported to be doing the buying. Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management said it had sold 9m shares on Tuesday, reducing its holding to 13.71 per cent from 14.6 per cent. GEC, which has made no comment on the rumours, rose 3 to 343p on 3.3m turnover.</p>

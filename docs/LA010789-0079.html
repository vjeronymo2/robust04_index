			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD IS ALL REVVED UP OVER PLAN TO CLOSE OFF STREETS  </P> <P> Santos Rodriguez, a retired aerospace engineer, spends at least a day a week on  the golf course with a few of his neighbors from Lafayette Square.  </P> <P> They play in Whittier or Montebello, laughing, joking and discussing any issue  that affects their lives and community -- anything, that is, except for a plan  to close off their streets, which has caused an undercurrent of tension even  among chums.  </P> <P> At the request of a slim majority of homeowners in the exclusive neighborhood,  the Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved plans to close the south,  west and east entrances to the square by blocking the ends of the streets to  create cul-de-sacs. If the plan wins final council approval on Tuesday, 237  homeowners would be assessed $40 per year for the next 10 years to pay for the  enclosures.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, a leading opponent of the enclosure plan, disputes the claims of his  golfing buddies that the cul-de-sacs will eliminate crime and traffic problems  in the area west of Crenshaw Boulevard between Venice and Washington  boulevards. Instead, he shares the concerns of transportation engineers who say  that closing the streets will make getting in and out inconvenient for  residents as well as for police, fire and other emergency vehicles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Way In and Out  </P> <P> The proposed cul-de-sacs will be Buckingham Road, Virginia Road, Wellington  Road and Victoria Avenue at Washington Boulevard. Cul-de-sacs will also be  created on St. Charles Place at Crenshaw Boulevard and at Buckingham Road.  Drivers will be able to get into and out of the area only from Venice  Boulevard.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of retired and elderly people in this neighborhood and one day  their lives may depend on paramedics being able to get to their home in time,"  said Rodriguez, who moved to Lafayette Square with his wife and eight children  36 years ago. "Besides, all the time we've lived here, we've never had any  problems with crime."  </P> <P> That is not the view of Rachel Lee, a leading supporter of the plan. She has  lived in her big stucco home since 1954.  </P> <P> When Lee first moved there, she said she never worried about crime. But in  recent years, she has become concerned about gang activity on her street,  evidenced by newly painted graffiti, and drug busts at a couple of nearby  homes.  </P> <P> "I want to preserve our neighborhood because it is being infiltrated by people  who frighten me," said Lee, a retired elementary school teacher. "People come  driving through here late at night, playing their music really loud."  </P> <P> But opponents of the plan insist that closing off the area is not going to  eliminate crime.  </P> <P> "If crooks want to get to you, they will get to you," said Loraine Mirza, who  moved into the neighborhood in 1975 and heads the Lafayette Community Alliance.  "They will either drive around to Venice Boulevard, or they'll walk right up to  your house."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Motive  </P> <P> Alleviating traffic hazards was another motive for the cul-de-sacs, which were  first called for almost 10 years ago by the Lafayette Square Assn.  </P> <P> Barbara Bourdeaux, president of the group, said, "People use our roads like  speedways. They come zooming through. . . . I've seen cars totaled right in  front of my house."  </P> <P> But 87-year-old Agnes Boston says that Lafayette Square has never had traffic  problems.  </P> <P> She moved into the exclusive enclave 55 years ago when it was crisscrossed by  country roads and inhabited only by wealthy whites because deeds to the  properties contained strict financial and racial covenants. There are blacks  and Latinos living in the area now, while some whites have moved out.  </P> <P> "There is barely any traffic on these streets," said Boston, a retired real  estate broker. "You can sit in your car all day and count the number of cars  that pass my house on one hand."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sees Traffic Increase  </P> <P> Mirza said the plan will actually increase traffic in the neighborhood because  drivers, unaware of the enclosures, will try to use the streets to avoid the  heavy traffic on Venice and Crenshaw boulevards, "but then they'll have to turn  right back around when they get to Washington (Boulevard) and drive back out."  </P> <P> Robert Takasaki, a city transportation engineer who has reviewed the plans,  agrees.  </P> <P> "Traffic within the square will probably be doubled, especially on the  north-south streets," he said. "Traffic on the streets right outside the square  will also be increased."  </P> <P> City Councilman Nate Holden, whose district includes Lafayette Square, has not  met with anyone from the neighborhood to discuss blocking off the streets.  </P> <P> "This is a highly emotional issue. If you spend too much time with one side,  the other side will get angry," he said.  </P> <P> Holden said he will rely on recommendations of the Department of  Transportation, which is expected to report on the plan Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I am going to let the facts speak for themselves," said Holden, whose  predecessor, David Cunningham, first brought the plan before the council. ". .  . I am not going to ask the council to rescind their vote, unless I find out  that the plans are unsafe."  </P> <P> Safety is not the real reason the plan was proposed, Mirza contends.  </P> <P> "People just want to be able to say that they live in an exclusive  neighborhood, and they think the enclosures will increase their property  values," she said. "I call it the snoot factor."  </P> <P> Lee called that notion absurd. "We love our neighborhood and we just want to  preserve it and get some good neighbors in here," she said.  </P></p>

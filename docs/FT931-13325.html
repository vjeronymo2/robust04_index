			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Likud candidate in sex scandal accuses rivals of dirty tricks ISRAELIS yesterday got the news they had been waiting for all week. It was not about Iraq, or the Palestinian deportees crisis. It was the naming of the 'other woman' in a scandal which has engulfed Mr Binyamin 'Bibi' Netanyahu and threatened his powerful bid to become leader of the rightwing opposition Likud party and, perhaps, Israeli prime minister. The scandal, inevitably dubbed 'Bibigate', is much more than a tabloid potboiler over Mr Netanyahu's self-confessed adultery. He himself has made it a central issue in his campaign to succeed retiring former premier Mr Yitzhak Shamir as party leader in March. Mr Netanyahu, a former junior minister, is best known as Israel's high-profile spokesman during the Gulf war. He says an alleged attempt by Likud rivals to blackmail him over an extra-marital affair symbolises the corruption within Israeli politics which he means to end in a new era of American-style open democracy. His opponents counter that his accusations belie an erratic man who they say is consumed only by personal ambition. The scandal emerged when Bibi , as everyone calls Mr Netanyahu, appeared on television to announce that his wife Sara had been telephoned with a threat to make public a videotape of Mr Netanyahu in a 'compromising romantic situation' if he did not withdraw from the leadership election. Mr Netanyahu admitted to an affair which he said had ended, but denounced the alleged blackmail as the work of supporters of an unnamed Likud rival who, Bibi said, surrounded himself with criminals. He reported the issue to the police, who are investigating the blackmail allegations. Yesterday, newspapers fuelled the row when they revealed that the woman in question was Mr Netanyahu's former public image adviser whose husband is now seeking to divorce her, citing her relationship with Mr Netanyahu. Mr Netanyahu's blackmail accusation was assumed to be aimed at the camp of Mr David Levy, the former foreign minister. Mr Levy dismisses the allegations as preposterous. His supporters say Bibi was angered that Mr Levy, in a tireless round of appearances at private events such as marriages, bar-mitzvas and circumcisions, had registered more party members for the leadership contest than Bibi. The outburst, they say, was an attempt to damage Mr Levy. Both Mr Levy and the other main Likud candidate, the po-faced Mr Binyamin Begin, scorn Mr Netanyahu's Americanisation of Israeli politics, with his well-financed, highly-personalised public campaigning. But Mr Netanyahu, educated at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, is far from beaten. His approach to politics does appear to be in tune with modern Israelis. He has several times been voted the country's most desirable man. Yesterday, a poll put him, at 34 per cent to 28 per cent, ahead of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in public popularity and streets ahead of both Mr Begin and Mr Levy. 'I believe I will become prime minister. My self-confidence is untouched,' Mr Netanyahu said in a newspaper interview.</p>

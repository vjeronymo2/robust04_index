			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / People: Change of direction at EIU Nico Colchester, deputy editor of The Economist who failed to secure the top job earlier in the year, is moving to the Economist Intelligence Unit at the end of this month as editorial director. At the same time, Helen Alexander, previously international circulation director of the Economist, becomes managing director of the EIU. 'I had long thought that it was rather an attractive job - not that I didn't already have a pretty attractive job,' says Colchester. Ironically, Bill Emmott, who beat Colchester to the editor's seat in what the latter refers to as 'that fateful selection process', had recently been on secondment for six months at EIU doing that very job. When it became clear he was not to become the next editor of the newspaper, 46-year-old Colchester, who was foreign editor of the Financial Times before moving to The Economist in 1986, says he looked around at other options, but admits that now is not 'a frightfully good time in the economic cycle'. He also put his name forward for the EIU. Now he is pleased to be running his own show - one with a turnover of Pounds 29m, compared with Pounds 67m at The Economist. He also thinks that 'there is a lot of scope for enhancing the public image of the EIU. It has rather hidden its light under a bushel, not having had much of a front man.' Alexander, who is understood to have turned down a highly lucrative outside offer to accept the EIU position, joined The Economist in 1985. She has recently been responsible for marketing and circulation in all regions outside North America.</p>

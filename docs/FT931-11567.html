			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Leading Article: ICI pays up STROKING Britain's recession- weary business community is likely to be a central theme in the government's forthcoming budget. But while Prime Minister John Major is keen to employ interest rate cuts and tax breaks as evidence that economic growth and an export-led recovery really are at the top of his agenda, British companies continue to resist the message. Mr Major's heart will have sunk yesterday morning on seeing details of the latest pay package agreed by Imperial Chemical Industries. Manual workers at three ICI plants can expect to receive double-digit pay rises this financial year followed by an extra 4 per cent a year for two more years on top of the annual pay round. The agreement should in time cover all ICI's 20,000 manual workers. Meanwhile, the government, struggling to control the growing fiscal deficit and prevent sterling's recent devaluation from feeding into wage settlements, has imposed a 1 1/2 per cent ceiling on public sector pay increases. Hold on a moment, ICI's management will say. Our pay package does look a little embarrassing for the government, but this comparison with the public sector really is not valid. This year's pay increase, agreed last June, was only 5.1 per cent, perhaps a little high compared with inflationary expectations but not out of line with average pay settlements at the time. The extra 6 per cent increase this year is in exchange for changes in shift patterns and other radical changes in working practices which will produce an equivalent saving. ICI knows its business and is updating its working practices in order to compete in the global market-place in the 1990s. ICI, they will argue, acknowledges that the end of a recession is not the best time to agree a real increase of 10 per cent; but the negotiations were started two years ago when an imminent recovery was confidently expected. Of course ICI would have preferred to achieve the changes without needing to offer this financial incentive to the workforce to co-operate; but the threat of industrial action in a capital-intensive industry is too harrowing to consider, however high the official unemployment rate. True, this pay package means the productivity gains will be used to increase workers' pay rather than to cut prices and increase exports to close Britain's gaping trade deficit; but the macroeconomy is the government's business. And yes, workers at Rover agreed last year to a radical change in working practices, in order to match Japanese productivity levels, while receiving no specific payments in return; but Rover is a special case. Offering large financial carrots in exchange for productivity increases is standard British practice. It must cease to be so.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Searing heat across most of the nation was punctuated by thunderstorms along  the Gulf Coast, from Lake Michigan to the central Appalachians and over part of  the Rockies, where temperatures hit record highs along the eastern edge. High  winds downed trees and power lines west of Philadelphia, Miss., and damaged  several farm buildings. South Bend, Ind., got 3.65 inches of rain, enough to  cause street flooding. Houston got a half-inch of rain in 20 minutes. Readings  were above 100 degrees over southeastern South Dakota, southwestern Nebraska  and the desert Southwest. Denver posted a record high of 98 and Cheyenne, Wyo.,  had a record high of 96.  </P></p>

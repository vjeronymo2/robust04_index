			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (4): Effects will be hard to predict - Britain's company car market, the largest in Europe, faces a new tax regime BRITAIN'S vehicle leasing and contract hire industry, thanks in no small part to the size of the company car market in the UK, is Europe's largest in terms of business volume and most sophisticated in terms of the variety of financial products on offer. While outright purchase remains the most popular method of acquiring new company vehicles, according to statistics collated in the Monks Partnership Company Car Policy UK 1993 report, nevertheless 11 per cent of new company cars are on finance lease or HP; 18 per cent on contract hire; 6 per cent on contract purchase; and 1 per cent on other methods. The reasons given by those companies that choose lease purchase, HP or contract hire are chiefly ease of administration, tax advantages and the fact that costs are largely fixed for the duration of the contract, so budgeting is made far more straightforward. The specialist contract hire and leasing companies also tend to argue that companies using their services often gain financially, because professional fleet management operations benefit from economies of scale and so can buy vehicles cheaper than individual companies may be able to, can negotiate lower servicing and repair labour rates, and can usually manage to achieve higher prices for the used vehicles at the end of the contract. However, widespread publicity about the new company car tax regime which comes into play next April - combined with the increases in personal benefit-in-kind scale rates announced by Mr Norman Lamont when chancellor last April - has prompted renewed debate on the thorny subject of cash v. cars. The difficulty is that without going in some detail into individual circumstances, it is virtually impossible to generalise as to whether employees would be better off choosing cash instead of a company car. Some will certainly face a hefty tax increase next April - but many more will find they are paying less tax. To make matters more complicated, there could well be instances in which an employee may wish to change his car in order to reduce his or her personal tax bill - but that change could end up costing the employer far more. Cowie Interleasing, the UK's largest company car leasing operator, provides a typical example: A Pounds 19,600 Toyota Celica 2.0GT could land its driver with a tax increase of Pounds 950 next year, so he may be tempted to choose instead an Alfa Romeo 155 2.5V6 which is over Pounds 1,600 cheaper, delivers a comparable performance and, after April 1994, will see a tax reduction of up to Pounds 260 a year for the driver. However, Cowie's figures show that when list price, maintenance, insurance and other running costs are taken into account, such a move would actually cost the company over 4p a mile more to run the Alfa than the Japanese car - or over Pounds 2,500 more if run over three years. 'The responsible fleet manager should always focus on the total running costs of any vehicle,' says Mr Neil Pykett, Cowie Interleasing managing director. 'There are several models which have an attractive list price and may be the preferred choice of tax-conscious company car drivers, but these could cost the company dear in the long run.' There are similar difficulties when one begins to discuss the level of cash to compensate an employee for turning in a company car: should the cash alternative be set at the cost to the company of providing the car, or the cost to the employee of providing a similar car privately? Indeed, the two figures can be many thousands of pounds per year apart. 'Offering a cash option could either cost companies a fortune or leave their drivers, if they take up the option, hopelessly out of pocket,' says Mr Geoff Becque, director of Leasecontracts. He quotes the annual operating cost, including insurance but excluding fuel, of a Ford Mondeo 1.6i LX, at Pounds 4,185, on which the typical driver would pay benefit-in-kind tax at the rate of Pounds 725 a year. 'But even if the employer paid him Pounds 4,613 extra a year (Pounds 4,185 less Pounds 725 grossed up to a before-tax figure), the employee could not afford the same new car. It is highly unlikely he could obtain insurance as cheaply as under a fleet policy, nor would he benefit from corporate buying and borrowing power, nor professional maintenance and disposal expertise,' says Mr Becque. The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association says there will be no clear advantage in opting for cash instead of a company car unless benefit in kind taxation is increased dramatically. It also makes the point that individuals are unlikely to be VAT-registered and so cannot reclaim VAT paid on petrol, spare parts and servicing. In addition, says Mr Terry Nunn, the BVRLA chairman, 'the ex-driver of the company car may find the income tax levied on the salary increment may leave him worse off and, more importantly, unable to finance a privately owned replacement vehicle.' However, the leasing industry is taking seriously the potential growth of private purchases by ex-company car owners. Such motor manufacturers as Vauxhall, Ford, Volkswagen and BMW have all launched private leasing schemes during the past year, aimed at keeping the monthly costs of car use at a sensible level. Generally, a deposit is paid and monthly payments are then made for two or three years, after which the driver can return the car, pay an agreed residual value to retain ownership, or change to a new car with adjusted monthly payments. There is also increasing interest in contract purchase schemes, though, explains Mr Norman Donkin, until recently chairman of A&amp;T Norfolk Finance and now an adviser to the BVRLA, the advantages are mainly enjoyed by fleet users which are exempt or partly-exempt for VAT purposes, and also for users of cars with a retail price over Pounds 12,000 where a proportion of rentals under leases and contract hire agreements is permanently disallowed for tax purposes. Under contract purchase the user pays instalments to the finance company covering repayment of the capital plus interest followed, at the end of the contract, by a predetermined balloon payment, after which ownership passes to the user. Some companies have also recently launched personal contract purchase products, aimed at individuals whose employers have switched to providing cash allowances in substitution for cars, often made available under arrangements set up in co-operation with the employer, to ease the financial problems of the transition to employee-provided cars. 'The take-up of personal contract purchase facilities has, not surprisingly, been very slow,' says Mr Donkin. 'For the vast bulk of company car drivers it does not make sound financial sense for cash to be substituted for their cars. 'Added to this, few employers are willing to face the substantial cost (grossed up for tax purposes) of ensuring that the driver is no worse off in net-of-tax terms than he was with his company car.'</p>

Cameroonian Government sources have refused to make any  comment on the purpose of the Nigerian foreign minister's visit  which has not been officially announced.    Since the Bakassi Peninsula border dispute broke out between  the two countries at the end of December 1993, both Cameroon and  Nigeria have sent out several diplomatic missions to their  neighbors in a bid to try to settle the dispute. In connection  with such diplomatic missions, Kingibe first went to Yaounde in  early January.</p>

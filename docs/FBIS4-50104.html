			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186) and XINHUA </F> reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)]    [Text] Beijing, 13 May (XINHUA) -- GATT Secretary-General  Peter Sutherland said today that China has, in his opinion, made  positive progress in its efforts to rejoin GATT. There is,  however, still considerable difficulties for China to rejoin the  organization within a specified time. He said that under any  circumstances China should, as a matter of principle, be a  member of GATT and the multilateral trading system.    Sutherland, who is in China to attend the international  symposium on China's strategy for foreign economy and trade in  the 1990's, told Chinese and foreign reporters that he came to  China at a time when negotiations on the global multilateral  trading system have entered a crucial stage. He has had an  opportunity to hear the progress China has made in its active  efforts to have its status as a signatory party to GATT restored  and he was deeply impressed by China's determination and courage  in this regard.    Sutherland said: In 1980, China ranked 31th in the world in  terms of trade volume. In 1993, it became the 11th largest  trading nation in the world. If we count the EC as a single  unit, China would have been the 6th largest trading nation.  Besides, progress in recent years in legislation and reform has  further opened up China's trade. A new global multilateral  trading system will be officially inaugurated on 1 January 1995.  As a major player, China should play a central role on the  world economic stage. The world trading system needs China's  participation.    Speaking of the "Foreign Trade Law" China just promulgated,  Sutherland said: Some of the top topics in negotiations on  reentry involved the transparency of China's trading system,  consistency of its trade policy, and a series of issues in  regard to quotas, licensing, and inspection standards in China's  import administration. Promulgation of China's "Foreign Trade  Law" will serve as a positive factor in the process of restoring  China's GATT status.    Sutherland pointed out: Negotiations on China's reentry into  GATT have entered a crucial stage. Although China has displayed  determination and flexibility in an effort to accomplish this  task, whether or not the talks can be completed quickly depends  on the attitude of the various signatory parties concerned. If  China wishes to have its status restored by year-end, if will  have to reach substantive agreements with the various signatory  parties by the summer. It is not impossible, but will be rather  difficult.    Gu Yongjiang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation who held the news conference with Sutherland, said:  Some of the obstacles to the restoration of China's GATT status  are technical, some are political. During numerous talks, China  has offered its answers to issues involving tariff reduction,  non-tariff reduction, and transparency of its trade system.  Some signatory parties, however, have set excessive conditions  on China's re-entry into GATT. As a developing country, China  is supposed to undertake the obligations of a developing nation  and, at the same time, enjoy the corresponding rights as such.  He said that many difficulties lie ahead in China's reentry  into GATT. China is, however, confident of reaching its goal  through bilateral and multilateral negotiations.</p>

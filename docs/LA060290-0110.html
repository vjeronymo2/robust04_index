			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COVERAGE OF THE NEA, CENSORSHIP  </P> <P> Credit where credit is due: Allan Parachini is doing a magnificent job covering  the National Endowment for the Arts censorship issue. He's presented the facts  and gotten material no one else has -- for example, the recent interview with  the NEA's top lawyer about the constitutional problem of prior restraint and  the story about debarment.  </P> <P> The New York Times doesn't seem to think that news about the politics of  culture belongs in its culture section; fortunately for us, the L.A. Times  does.  </P> <P> JON WIENER  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Proteus losses rise to Pounds 1.27m PROTEUS International, the start-up company specialising in computer-aided molecular modelling and rational drug design, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.27m for the six months to September 30. Mr Kevin Gilmore, chairman, said development had continued on target. The balance sheet remained strong with Pounds 1.5m net cash on deposit at the end of 1991, following an share issue in November which raised Pounds 1.23m. Proteus, founded in May 1990, incurred a loss of Pounds 520,000 for the five months to September 30 1990 and a Pounds 982,000 deficit for the six months to March 31 1991. Turnover was Pounds 2,000, following the decision not to market Prometheus, its proprietary software system. Mr Gilmore said the company had had difficulty providing support to licensees and had not wanted to sell off its most valuable asset for short-term cash flow considerations. He said there had been a substantial increase in workload during recent weeks representing progress beyond expectations. The company should start generating income this calendar year and reach profitability in 1993, he added. The most promising area was immunocastration, which involves castration of domestic and farm animals through injections. An HIV serum designed by Proteus is under evaluation by Repligen Corporation in the US. News of the agreement with Repligen lay behind a jump in the group's share price from 97p to 223p in the first three weeks of November. They closed 5p up last night at 183p. Losses per share were 5.92p compared with 2.44p for the period between May 14 and September 30 1990. No dividend is declared.</p>

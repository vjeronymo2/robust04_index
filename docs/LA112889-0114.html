			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> RESULTS OF GROWTH STUDY WILL BE GIVEN  </P> <P> Results of a yearlong study on growth management in the city will be presented  tonight to the Planning Commission.  </P> <P> A nine-member committee examined areas including open space, schools, sewers,  roads, water, libraries, parking, police and a new civic center.  </P> <P> In June, 1988, voters overwhelmingly passed Measure E, a slow-growth  initiative. But a Superior Court judge ruled the city measure unconstitutional.  That ruling is now being appealed by a citizens' group.  </P> <P> The City Council subsequently appointed a committee to create a legally  acceptable growth-management plan.  </P> <P> In 1986, voters passed Measure B, the city's first growth-limiting initiative,  which restricted home-building permits to 500 a year.  </P></p>

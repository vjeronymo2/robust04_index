			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng, during formal talks with Mongolian Premier Puntsagiyn  Jasray here today, annunciated five principles for developing  relations with Mongolia.    During the meeting, described by a Chinese spokesman as  "friendly and warm", Li spoke highly of Sino-Mongolian exchanges  and cooperation in political, economic, cultural, military,  scientific and technological fields.    Calling Mongolia "an important neighbor," Li said China  attaches great importance to friendly and good-neighborly ties  with Mongolia.    On developing relations with Mongolia, Li said, the Chinese  Government will abide by the following five basic points:    First, adherence to the five principles of peaceful  coexistence as a basis for the development of friendly  cooperation with Mongolia, which looks toward the 21st century.    Second, respect for Mongolia's independence, sovereignty and  territorial integrity, as well as the Mongolian people's choice  of their own path of development.    Third, developing trade and economic cooperation on the  basis  of equality and mutual benefit, in an effort to promote common  development and prosperity.    Fourth, the hope of maintaining peace and stability in East  Asia, appreciation for Mongolia's positive efforts to safeguard  regional peace and stability, and support of Mongolia's policy  to become a nuclear-free zone, not allowing foreign troops or  the deployment or transportation of nuclear weapons, or other  weapons of mass destruction, in or through its territory.    Fifth, a willingness to see Mongolia develop friendly  relations with other countries.    "The consolidation and development of Sino-Mongolian  friendly  relations is not only in keeping with the fundamental interests  of the two peoples, but also will be conducive to regional  peace, stability and development, as well," Li said.    Referring to the Sino-Mongolian treaty on friendship and  mutual help which was signed in 1960 and "laid a good foundation  for bilateral ties", Li said that since both the domestic and  international situations have undergone vast changes, "we have  amended and perfected the treaty", in line with the wishes of  Mongolia.    Li said that signing the new treaty on Sino-Mongolian  friendship and cooperation was "an epoch-making event" in the  history of bilateral ties, and will be formulated into legal  form as a new political basis for future growth.    "This treaty will make China and Mongolia even better  friends  and neighbors," he said.    Agreeing with Li's assessment of bilateral ties, Jasray said  that Li's significant visit coincides with the 45th anniversary  of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Mongolia and  China.    He said that Mongolia's foreign policy was based on the  principle of equality and mutual benefit regardless of the  beliefs or size of a country.    The development of friendly relations with China and Russia,  two large neighbors, is a priority of Mongolian foreign policy,  he said.    Mongolia will not only develop relations with the Western  and  developed nations, it also will strive to expand ties with Asian  countries, in particular those of East Asia, Jasray said.    Li welcomed Mongolia lending priority to its ties with China  and Russia, a spokesman said.    Jasray noted that China's respect for Mongolia's chosen  method of development is very important for the further  expansion of bilateral ties.    The signing of the new treaty will serve to form a legal  basis for developing long-term friendly cooperation, he said.    Jasray predicted "smooth growth of Mongolia-China  relations,"  which, he said, is in keeping with the fundamental interests of  the two peoples.    Li, turning to bilateral trade and economic cooperation,  said  that China, Mongolia's second largest trading partner, is ready  to continue developing mutually beneficial cooperation with  Mongolia.    He also called for expansion of such cooperation in  diversified areas, particularly between business circles in the  two countries, which will supplement inter-governmental ties.    Jasray said that trade and economic cooperation with China  are important to Mongolia, adding that great potential exist in  this area.    He also stressed the importance of border trade, saying he  expects to see further exploration along these lines.    Mongolia hopes to strengthen cooperation in terms of  investment with China, as well, so as to allow cooperation  between enterprises and localities to produce better economic  results, he added.    Calling transportation "another important factor" for  developing cooperation, he said Mongolia would continue to work  for further improvement in this field.    Furthermore, Jasray expressed appreciation for China's  support of Mongolia becoming a nuclear-free zone.    He reiterated that the Government of the People's Republic  of  China is the sole legitimate government of China, and that  Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. Jasray said  that the Mongolian Government will have no official ties of any  kind with Taiwan, a position for which Li expressed appreciation.</p>

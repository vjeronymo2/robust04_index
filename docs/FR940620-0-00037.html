			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Restrictions on Individuals Engaging in Limited Practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations generally required that all nonpractitioners who engage in limited practice before the IRS under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;10.7 uphold the same standards as practitioners and simplified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the structure of that section. In response to a comment, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations clarify ambiguous wording in &sect;10.7(c)(1)(vii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed regulations, which relates to representation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside of the United States. The change makes clear that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonpractitioner may represent a taxpayer before personnel of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IRS who are located outside of the United States, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the taxpayer is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commentator asked that &sect;10.7(c)(1)(viii), which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relates to representation before the Examination Division by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparer, be clarified by substituting ``as the preparer'' for ``on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behalf of the taxpayer''. This change, which is not substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in nature, is adopted by the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Expedited Suspensions From Practice Before the Service in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain Cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations added a new section permitting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Director of Practice to commence an expedited proceeding leading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a practitioner's suspension from practice before the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in those instances in which an independent authority already has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that the practitioner has engaged in serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misconduct. Some commentators recommended against adopting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expedited suspension provision. These commentators argued that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an expedited suspension violates an individual's due process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rights and constitutes an abuse of the Director of Practice's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority. Alternatively, it was suggested that: (1) An expedited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension be deferred if the individual requests a hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before an Administrative Law Judge; (2) the Director be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to take additional steps to ensure that the complaint in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expedited suspension proceeding is properly served; and (3) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondent in such a proceeding be given additional time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respond to the Director's complaint and not be deemed to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waived his or her right to a conference if the respondent's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> answer is not timely filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The acts giving rise to an expedited suspension, such as loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of professional license for misconduct or conviction of certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> felonies, constitute disreputable conduct under Circular 230.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title 31, section 330(b) of the United States Code requires only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a representative who engages in disreputable conduct be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given notice and an opportunity for a proceeding prior to being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended from practice before the IRS. The expedited suspension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures comply with these and general due process requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by providing a practitioner with reasonable notice of the grounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any proposed suspension and an opportunity to be heard by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Director of Practice before the suspension takes effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The expedited suspension provision has been carefully drafted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to apply only in limited circumstances, minimize any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities for abuse, and provide individuals with adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedural safeguards. For these reasons and considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury's interest in expeditiously handling these cases, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentators' recommendations on this section of Circular 230  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally were not adopted. However, in response to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, the time for responding to a complaint has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased to 30 days. In addition, the scheduling requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a conference with the Director of Practice are relaxed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarified. Under the final regulations, the conference with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Director of Practice may be held no sooner than 14 calendar days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the answer is required to be filed, rather than 30 calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days after the complaint is served, unless the respondent agrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an earlier date. The final regulations also provide that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practitioner's loss of his or her professional license solely due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a failure to pay a professional licensing fee will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute grounds for an expedited suspension. The section has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been renumbered and conforming changes made to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> V. Other Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. ``Return''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentator asked that the definition of ``return'' of tax  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;10.2(g) be revised to explicitly state that a return includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an amended return. To eliminate any confusion on this point, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations incorporate this recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. ``Reckless Conduct''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentator requested assurances that changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``reckless conduct'' in &sect;10.51(j) were not intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to substantively change that provision. Other commentators asked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the words ``highly unreasonable omission'' be eliminated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced with other words.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes to the definition of ``reckless conduct''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were intended to streamline that definition without changing its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance. Accordingly, there is no substantive significance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminating the words ``merely simple or inexcusable negligence''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or to substituting ``should observe under the circumstances'' for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``is either known or is so obvious that the competent practitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must or should have been aware of it.'' Because no substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change is intended, substantive wording changes suggested by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentators to the proposed definition were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Comments Outside the Scope of the Project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional comments were not adopted because they were beyond the scope of the regulations project. These included: (1) Altering the definition of ``practice before the Internal Revenue Service'' in &sect;10.2(e); (2) extending the practice standards to commercial return preparers; (3) requiring a return preparer who is representing a taxpayer on audit to withdraw from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation if a conflict of interest arises; (4) prescribing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdens of proof in disciplinary proceedings (which generally are governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. section 551 et. seq.); and (5) permitting a temporary or part-time employee who is not a practitioner to represent an employer, partnership, corporation, or trust under the limited practice rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

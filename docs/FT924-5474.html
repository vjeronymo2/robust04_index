			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: John Fairfax board comes under attack from shareholders THE board of John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group, was heavily criticised by shareholders at the annual meeting yesterday over plans for share options and housing loans to directors. Mr Conrad Black, deputy chairman, clashed with Mr Malcolm Turnbull, the Sydney merchant banker who helped organise the acquisition of Fairfax by the Tourang consortium led by Mr Black's UK Daily Telegraph group. The shareholder unrest followed the withdrawal of proposals for a senior executive share option scheme after criticism by the Australian Stock Exchange and legal action by Mr Turnbull. Mr Black said he was 'chastened' by the controversy surrounding the scheme, which he said had been caused by 'technical errors' in the drafting of the resolution. However, shareholders also criticised a separate distribution of options to a South African company to secure the appointment of Mr Stephen Mulholland as chief executive and a proposed ADollars 1m (USDollars 714,000) interest-free housing loan to Mr Michael Hoy, deputy chief executive. Employee shareholders said the remuneration packages were 'particularly offensive' against a background of cuts in staff numbers and reductions in editorial budgets. Mr Turnbull, who resigned from Tourang after a series of disputes with Mr Daniel Colson, deputy chairman of the Telegraph group, received prolonged applause after criticising the option schemes. He said that directors had tried to keep shareholders 'in the dark' about the 'excessively generous' options relating to the employment of Mr Mulholland, which represented 'a very poor reflection on the business acumen of the board.' Mr Black said that he was mystified by the support for Mr Turnbull's attack on the board, which had re-established Fairfax as a profitable company following several years in which it had been 'humiliated, degraded and rent asunder.' He added that there was nothing 'reprehensible or shifty' about the board's treatment of the options issue, and claimed the board's commercial judgment would be borne out by results. Mr Black also attacked a suggestion by Mr Turnbull that the Australian members of the board had failed to restrain the Canadian and US directors representing the Telegraph group and Hellman and Friedman, the US investment bank. 'Your attempt to discriminate between the Australian and non-Australian directors I find dishonourable and disgusting. 'For us to be treated in this way, harangued and discriminated against by you, is absolutely outrageous,' he said. A resolution approving the housing loan to Mr Hoy was heavily defeated on a show of hands, but is likely to be approved in a ballot of shareholders. The result will be announced tomorrow. Sir Zelman Cowen, chairman, said Fairfax had operated at budget levels in the first quarter of the current financial year. The group reported in August that pre-tax profits for the year to June increased by 9.8 per cent to ADollars 130m. Fairfax was acquired by the Tourang consortium in December for ADollars 1.4bn. The group publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Review and The Age in Melbourne.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUTTER, NOT GUNS  </P> <P> I came away from a recent excellent presentation of "Stand Up Tragedy" at the  Mark Taper saddened by the complexity of problems in the inner city. But when I  read "Should Defense Firms Switch From Swords to Plowshares?" (Viewpoints, June  11), it gave me new hope.  </P> <P> The problems of the ghetto, as large as they are, will take every resource we  can afford over the next decade or two. Since 1945, we have spent trillions on  defense -- enough money to rebuild every single city, road and railroad west of  the Mississippi. We now need to redirect a portion of these resources and the  tremendous brain power to more important issues.  </P> <P> What happens to my neighbors in our ghettos does affect me. With the cold war  behind us, it's time to put our tax dollars to use solving the survival issues  of our society and our planet.  </P> <P> MARJORIE ERWAY  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

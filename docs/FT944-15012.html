			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Taxes, benefits and jobs High pay is better than low pay; but low pay is better than no pay. Obviously we would all like good, well-paid jobs. But for many people these are not available, partly because the labour market has shifted to the disadvantage of workers with low marketable skills. Meanwhile, low-paid jobs bring some benefit to the national economy, and some gain in self-respect and morale to those who have them, in the way that dole payments do not. Every economic gathering proclaims that it should be made worthwhile for people to work rather than live on social security, but few explain how. The deterrents are sometimes summarised in terms of a 'tax wedge' between the gross wage and net payments after tax and social security contributions. In the UK, the wedge for low-paid workers has been much mitigated as a result of several past Budgets. But it does amount to nearly 30 per cent on to the cost of employing workers at about Pounds 200 a week - the lower end of the middle income distribution range, which is where many of the problems lie. Social security contributions are a tax on labour incomes. Indirect taxes such as value-added tax can be regarded as levied on wages plus profits. So there might be a modest effect on labour demand by switching from social security to VAT, but nothing like one-for-one. It is doubtful if a shift to income tax, which is another tax on labour, would have any notable effect at all. As far as employee disincentives are concerned, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is right to say in its Green Budget that the main deterrent to accepting a low-paid or part-time job is not so much anything in the tax system, but the withdrawal of benefits once earnings start. In Britain the Thatcher and Major governments have put a lot of emphasis on making it more worthwhile to work and more difficult to live on benefit. Yet the proportion of the non-employed (unemployed plus working-age people outside the labour force) has increased from one cycle to another. Labour's Commission on Social Justice, chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie, is bound to say something on these matters in its report due to be published on Monday. The worst disincentives are shown in the chart. A man with one child earning Pounds 6 an hour is no better off on a part-time job because of the withdrawal of Income Support, pound for pound, until he reaches a threshold of 16 hours worked. At this point Family Credit, specifically designed to make it worthwhile to take low-paid jobs, comes into effect. But much of the intended gain is negated because the withdrawal rate of Housing and Council Tax Benefit is added to the withdrawal rate of Family Credit. The table shows that the combined effect of withdrawing Housing and Council Tax Benefit amounts to an implicit marginal tax rate of 89 1/2 per cent for every extra pound earned. If Family Credit is also received, the implicit marginal tax rate also rises to more than 97 per cent. The worst affected are spouses of unemployed people who stand to lose Income Support pound-for-pound if they go to work. These interactions are made unnecessarily complicated because Housing Benefit is administered by local authorities for the Department of the Environment, while Family Credit is administered by the Department of Social Security; a fusion of the two benefits - which now serve a similar purpose - is surely overdue. The IFS also suggests a rent credit in place of Housing Benefit, which would pay the rent for a family working less than 16 hours a week. Above that a boosted Family Credit should take over the job. An additional advantage - which may be psychological - is that there would no longer be an obvious sum which offset rent for households with even a modest income from work. Thus people would be more inclined to bargain seriously over rents and to move out of over-extended accommodation. As for Council Tax Benefit, this is simply a bribe to local government voters alienated by the poll tax saga; and the sooner it is phased out and fed back into the general social security budget, the better. Even apart from the Housing Benefit complication, Family Credit has the defect of not being paid to single people or families without children. The least the Borrie Commission could suggest would be to amalgamate Family Credit and Income Support, thus bringing together benefits for those in and out of work. Once it occurs the absurdity of both the 100 per cent cut-off for the unemployed person taking work and the exclusion of childless families would become apparent. Borrie is almost certain to advocate the integration of benefits and taxes for pensioners. This should be a trial run for a wider amalgamation. But the acid test will be whether he advocates the amalgamation of working-age benefits. The Conservative government will shy away from this minimum reform because of its preoccupation with the so-called Job Seeker's allowance, which will amalgamate the contribution-related Unemployment Benefit with the means-tested Income Support on which most unemployed people in practice rely. Ministers did, however, come out at last week's party conference with a scheme meant to increase the incentives for the long-term unemployed to take a job in the non-black economy. Although they largely buried their initiative in a tide of anti-European rhetoric, they did envisage a 'claim-and-save' scheme under which somebody returning to full-time work would gain a bonus of up to Pounds 1,000. This will be the light at the end of a long tunnel. Part-timers will still have every pound they earn clawed back from benefit above the normal Pounds 5 a week minimum. The difference is that half the benefit initially lost will be put into a fund reclaimable when the person returns to full-time work. The scheme is typical of the minimalist reform that civil servants, with the Treasury breathing down their necks, produce for Conservative ministers. Apart from the obvious drawback of being long deferred for someone now in part-time work, the scheme has the further disadvantage of being once-for-all. In other words, those workers remaining at the lower end of the income distribution range will soon exhaust their gain. What conclusions emerge if one draws back from the mass of confusing detail? As the Green Budget points out, there is a choice. For any given level of basic benefits there can, at one extreme, be a cut-off rate of 100 per cent for every extra pound earned. The result would be an extreme work disincentive for a limited number of people. The other extreme would be a Basic Income for all, which would be withdrawn only at the income tax rate. The latter however would have to be much higher than it is now (or some other tax such as VAT would have to be very high in its place). The result would be a less prohibitive, but still very heavy, disincentive spread over far more people. The present system for income-related benefits is more like the 100 per cent cut-off rate than the Basic Income. Most reforms amount to moving slightly towards the latter, but still with high cut-off rates. There could also be a less inquisitorial administration. There is in any case no cost-free option. The art is to do the most good for any given transfer from the main body of taxpayers. Unfortunately the Tories have too many moralistic hang-ups about reform and Labour too many inhibitions about 'selectivity' to do this as well as they might.  ---------------------------------------------------------                    THE EARNINGS TRAP  --------------------------------------------------------- Gross earnings increase by                  Pounds 1.00  --------------------------------------------------------- Income tax rises by                               -0.20p National Insurance rises by                       -0.10p  --------------------------------------------------------- Net income                                         0.70p Housing Benefit withdrawal (at 65%)                                      -0.45 1/2p Council Tax Benefit falls by 20% of 70p                                     -0.14p  --------------------------------------------------------- Leaving                                        0.10 1/2p  --------------------------------------------------------- NB: If Family Credit is also being received, marginal tax rates increase to more than 97%  --------------------------------------------------------- Source: IFS Green Budget  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

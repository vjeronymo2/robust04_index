			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / End of the road for a dream ride: Japan's second-tier brokerages face cuts and losses in the wake of the Nikkei's fall When the Tokyo stock market surged in the late 1980s, Japan's 10 second-tier brokerages went along for the ride. They christened huge dealing rooms, invested in next-generation technology and employed the services of Pee Wee Herman and other celebrities in the confidence that the Big Four houses would become the Big 14. Those dreams went down with the Nikkei stock average. Nine of the 10 brokers are forecasting losses for the fiscal year just ended, and nearly all are cutting staff, closing domestic branches, and trimming their recently expanded international operations. Last week, Sanyo Securities closed three domestic branches, while New Japan Securities closed four, and plans to close its Sydney and Paris offices by the end of June. Kankaku Securities is closing offices in Milan and Bahrain, and 'five or six domestic branches'. The Big Four  - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities  - have suffered in the market collapse, but the second-division brokers have been harder hit. These companies are generally less skilled in new product areas, more reliant on equity commissions, less successful in generating profits on their own accounts, and rely on a smaller pile of still-shrinking unrealised gains on their securities holdings. Mr Brian Waterhouse, financial industry specialist at James Capel Pacific, says the leading four houses need a daily market turnover of about Y450bn (Pounds 2bn) to make money, while the second-tier houses need Y600bn. However, the daily Tokyo average has recently been around Y250bn, well below the 1989 average of Y1,308bn. 'These companies have been over-optimistic. We have seen a few branches closed, but they are really yet to bite the bullet. They have thought that the market would come good. There is a lot more pain ahead,' Mr Waterhouse said. That pain has its origins in the excesses of the late 1980s. Most second-tier companies were determined to expand, and the bull market fuelled unsustainable ambitions, resulting in a 41.6 per cent increase in securities industry personnel in the four years until December 1989, when the market peaked. Just before the peak, companies were still growing. Personnel at Cosmo Securities rose 12 per cent from fiscal 1988 to 1989, at Wako Securities by 7 per cent, and at Sanyo Securities by 11 per cent. Sanyo distinguished itself by opening an Y8bn, high-tech dealing room, which was the largest of its kind in the world. But, for the year to end March, Sanyo is forecasting a net loss of Y27.5bn, Cosmo Y29bn, and Wako Y17bn. Only Kokusai Securities, part of the Nomura group, expects a modest Y1bn profit, having developed business in bonds and derivatives, and focused on small company clients. Other second-tier brokers have not had Kokusai's success in developing niche markets, having presumed that revenue from underwriting, share trading, and investment trust sales would continue to rise. However, underwriting fees rose only about 5 per cent last year, and investment trust income is forecast to fall an average 51 per cent. The brokers' over-dependence on stock commissions has been highlighted  - commissions account for 79 per cent of revenue at Dai-ichi Securities and 80 per cent at Kankaku Securities, compared with 52 per cent at Daiwa. Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse Japan, said medium-sized brokers 'have overheads just as high' as the Big Four, but 'they don't make the same money from commissions and don't have a big enough capital base to be strong in arbitrage'. There is, she says, 'great excess capacity in the industry'. Most brokers now concede there will not be a quick end to the market's woes, and agree they must become more focused and cost-conscious. New Japan Securities, the fifth largest broker, has a four-stage plan to reduce costs: closing and merging branches; reducing floor space; cutting executive salaries; and transferring staff from administration to sales. 'We are hoping to increase our sales of foreign stocks to Japanese customers, especially stocks in high-growth Asian countries. We also want to improve our business in derivatives,' New Japan said. New Japan and other companies cut their annual intake of graduates last month. At Kokusai, the intake was down from 301 to 216, and at Dai-ichi from 450 to 200. Like New Japan, most brokers are bolstering sales staffs, and pruning research divisions which expanded during the 1980s, and had been a source of pride. Advertising campaigns to create first-tier images for second-tier brokers have also been shelved. Dentsu, Japan's largest advertising company, reports that advertising by the securities industry last year fell 43.8 per cent. The scandals prompted individual investors, on whom medium and smaller brokers are more dependent, to shun the market. Second-tier companies admitted compensating favoured corporate clients, and Cosmo and Yamatane Securities were involved in disputes over tobashi  - the transfer of loss-making securities from one client account to another to take advantage of different book-closing dates and to avoid the reporting of losses. Cost-cutting may not be enough. The prospect of continuing losses has raised the possibility that second-tier companies will have to merge, although links between these companies and other Japanese financial institutions would provide opportunities and complications. For example, Sanyo and Kokusai have links with Nomura, Yamatane has ties with Sakura Bank, Cosmo is linked to Nippon Life Insurance and Daiwa Bank, and Wako is close to the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ). National Securities is an affiliate of Matsushita Electric Industrial, the electronics company. The Ministry of Finance is reported to have told the friendly banks to keep watch over troubled brokers. Under financial reforms which may be introduced as early as next year, Japanese banks will be able to enter the stock business, although the banks' past enthusiasm for share trading has waned. The troubles of Japanese brokers could present opportunities for a foreign securities house looking to expand its retail operations in Japan. No deals have surfaced, but rumours of partnerships and distress sales are already doing the rounds.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE'S LUCKY IN LOVE, LUCKY IN 'BIG SPIN' TOO  </P> <P> A man about to take his turn at the California Lottery's giant "Big Spin" wheel  Saturday took a moment first to propose to his girlfriend, who was cheering him  on from the audience.  </P> <P> Steven Pack, 32, a construction worker from Ontario, slipped an engagement ring  on Sandy Silva's finger, then spun the wheel -- to win $1 million. Pack was  joined on the stage by Silva, who said "yes." Pack said he will use his money  to "pay off the ring, pay for the wedding and honeymoon and start on a house  next year."  </P> <P> "Right now, it hasn't quite sunk in," he said. "I was so excited about her  saying yes, the million hasn't sunk in."  </P> <P> Pack was one of four people who became millionaires. The others were Helen  Cunningham, 64, Long Beach; Richard Pruneau, 26, Thousand Oaks, and Norma  Arebalos, 26, Fresno.  </P></p>

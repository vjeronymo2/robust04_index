			<p>BFN     [Text] Seven Central American countries have just  participated in a brief summit with U.S. Vice President Al Gore,  in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, El  Salvador, Nicaragua, Belize, and Honduras, represented first by  their foreign ministers and later by their heads of state or  government, presented a united bloc in the meeting with Gore,  who had previously announced he would stay for only eight hours.  As a matter of fact, the brief dialogue that was conducted  spearheads the summit President Bill Clinton has called for  December in Miami, as well as the Cartagena de Indias summit in  Colombia on 14-15 June.    With the Miami summit, the United States hopes to initiate a  new era in its ties with Latin America to eliminate vestiges of  the Cold War. It has not invited Cuba, however, using the  pretext of a lack of democratization; or Haiti, although its  government is recognized by the United Nations and the OAS.    It was reported that during the talks between Vice President  Gore and the leaders of the region, economic and social issues  were discussed as well as the strengthening of democratic  institutions, the environment, the war against drugs, and issues  related to probable economic aid from the U.S. Government. The  main focus of the summit, however, was getting Al Gore to  clarify the true possibilities of Central American countries'  joining the North American Free Trade Accord. The accord, signed  by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, is bound to become the  most powerful commercial bloc in the world.    Still convalescing from the ravages of almost a decade of  armed conflict, and short of having consolidated true peace,  Central America has a population of 30 million people, over 30  percent of whom live in extreme poverty because the enormous  economic aid provided the region by the United States was mostly  consumed by the military in fighting the guerrillas.    Central America hoped the Clinton government would clearly  define its position regarding this region and explain the  conditions under which commercial negotiations might occur in  order to later analyze and decide on the prospects of whether to  move as a bloc or bilaterally, but still united.</p>

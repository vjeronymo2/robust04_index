			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Reclaiming losses I AM an American and a Lloyds's Name, with losses on the 1989 account. I reside in the UK but am domiciled in the US. My only sources of income available for offsetting the losses are dividends from UK companies. Under US tax law, the 1989 losses are offsettable against passive (investment) income arising in 1992 (not 1989, as is the case in Britain) and may be carried forward indefinitely against any income. I understand that, under UK law, they are offsettable against any income of 1989/90 which is now exhausted, and may then be carried forward only against future Lloyd's profits. I need to know how to reclaim from the US government the 25 per cent tax credits on UK dividends (and any higher-rate tax which I pay) arising in 1992/93 and subsequent years under the US/UK double tax treaty. Unfortunately, you have misunderstood what you were told about the tax relief available under US law. The IRS will give you relief for the Lloyd's losses against your potential US tax bill for 1992 (et seq): they will not give you any refund of UK tax or any UK tax credits in cash. Turning now to your UK tax position, perhaps we should mention the possibility of terminal loss relief (under section 388 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988). We can do no more than mention this possibility because we cannot tell from the limited data whether you are, in fact, eligible for relief under Section 388. If you have no accountant looking after your UK tax affairs, it might be that your Lloyd's agent can give you some guidance through the tax maze. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Smooth operator balked at the polls As a specialist communicator and a senior Conservative Central Office official, it is clear why Mr John Maples was handed the responsibility of finding ways for the government to turn back the tide of negative publicity, William Lewis writes. Following his defeat at the 1992 general election at Lewisham West in London, where he had been MP since 1983, he was appointed chairman and chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Government Communications Worldwide, the advertising agency's government lobbying offshoot. The subsidiary was set up after the election to 'deal with communications between governments and their people and people and their governments'. Mr Maples's move to Saatchi apparently came about after he impressed senior executives at the company. In the approach to the election Mr Maples, then economic secretary to the Treasury, emerged as one of the government's most effective television communicators. His performances, routinely described as smooth, made him one of the rising stars. He was tipped for immediate promotion to the cabinet after the election. Even after his defeat many in the party felt sure that it would not be long before Mr Maples returned. The path back has not been a wholly smooth one. He is said to have applied to become the Conservative candidate for the Newbury by-election earlier this year, but was rejected. This was widely blamed on support for his candidacy from Central Office, against which there was some animosity in the local party organisation. It remains to be seen whether he will find a safe seat before the next general election.</p>

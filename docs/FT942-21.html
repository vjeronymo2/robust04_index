			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (11): All-aluminium on the road - The lightweight metal that is challenging steel Audi's new all-aluminium executive car will be the first of many. That is the confident prediction of Mr David Schlendorf, president of Alcoa's automotive structures division. Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium group, and Audi have jointly developed the new Audi A8 - the German company hopes to sell 20,000 a year. Alcoa is supplying skeleton-like spaceframe bodies for the Audi from a new plant at Soest in Germany on which it spent DM140m (about Dollars 81m). Audi expects to take up the rest of the capacity at the Alcoa plant with another niche car, which will be produced in slightly higher volumes than the A8, as well as being less expensive. 'Five years from now in Europe you'll see at least 10 aluminium spaceframe-bodied niche cars, either in production or announced by a number of manufacturers,' says Mr Schlendorf. Audi, which spent about DM1bn (Dollars 600m) on the A8, and Alcoa, decided to find a new way of making cars. As aluminium is initially much more expensive than steel, they believed it would be too costly simply to substitute aluminium components for those traditionally made of steel. Instead, they designed a car that has many fewer individual components and structures than are used in a steel vehicle. They developed a spaceframe composed of fewer than 100 extrusions and castings compared with 300 for a stamped steel body. New manufacturing processes had to be developed to produce these spaceframes as well as new aluminium alloys, claimed to be safer than steel. For car makers the new technology offers several advantages: it cuts the weight of a car's body by about 35 per cent compared with steel bodies without reducing the vehicle's size; it reduces tooling expense by as much as 50 per cent; and cuts the number of parts to be stocked and the time taken from design to production. However, at present the process is economic only for production runs of up to 100,000 cars a year. But Mr Schlendorf says Alcoa is ready to spend another Dollars 1bn or so on a partnership with a car manufacturer wanting to produce the first high-volume (more than 100,000 a year) aluminium-bodied cars. He expects to set up at least two more plants in Europe within five years. By the end of the decade Alcoa may have installed a satellite production system to make aluminium bodies across Europe. Meanwhile, Alcan of Canada, Alcoa's biggest competitor, is taking a different route to high-volume, all-aluminium car production, in partnership with Ford, the world's second-largest automotive group. During the Alcan annual meeting in Montreal on April 29, Mr Jacques Bougie, the chief executive, was handed the keys to the first Ford Aluminium Intensive Vehicle. This was one of 40 experimental vehicles identical in appearance to the Mercury Sable, a popular mid-sized US car - but 400lb lighter. Ford and Alcan also believe that aluminium is suitable for building high-volume, rather than just niche, cars. Ford, it seems, has overcome most of the problems associated with producing aluminium cars from an infrastructure which was set up to build them from steel. From the start the car company wanted to use its existing equipment, including big steel presses, which represented a huge investment, and has spent Dollars 25m to prove this is possible. Mr Gian Frontini, until recently Alcan's vice-president, technology and engineering, but now director of fabrication and information technology, says the project involved two big challenges: how aluminium could be formed on steel presses and how to join aluminium. These have now been solved. Alcan proved it was possible for aluminium to be shaped on existing steel presses - even using the same tooling in some cases. Ford made a breakthrough with special light welding robots. Mr Frontini says he has not been given any inside information by Ford about its future production plans but he expects that the group will gradually add more aluminium body parts to certain models and in five or six years a car with an all-aluminium structure will be launched. Ford also plans a big expansion in its use of aluminium over the next five years to penetrate the sheet, or 'skin,' usages that have traditionally belonged to steel. This includes aluminium fenders, hoods, decklids and trim on the next generation of the Taurus car, likely to be launched in the autumn of 1995. The group is already the biggest user of aluminium in the US motor industry. Its experimental vehicle, Synthesis 2010, which is a rolling test bed for new automotive technology - including a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine made of aluminium - has a body made of aluminium. Synthesis achieves weight savings of about 1,000lb compared with the present steel Sable, while having about the same interior dimensions. Weight saving is the big incentive for the US and Japanese car industries to turn to lightweight aluminium. The US government is imposing ever-tightening fuel economy standards and aluminium enables carmakers to meet those standards by reducing weight without any loss of performance. However, the main incentive for European carmakers is a conviction that car recycling will become a big issue in future. European companies are also enthusiastic about the high-performance characteristics aluminium gives to cars. All the big aluminium companies now have co-operative programmes with either a carmaker or a vehicle components supplier. For example, Hydro Aluminium, part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group and Europe's biggest producer of aluminium extrusions, has a vested interest in the success of the spaceframe concept, which could be a big user of extrusions in future. Hydro has also been co-operating on car spaceframe concepts since the mid-1980s with Renault in France, Porsche in Germany and Pininfarina in Italy and recently signed a co-operative agreement with Sumitomo of Japan. Last year Hydro started supplying aluminium sub-frames from a Michigan factory for General Motors' new Corvette sports car. The sub-frame was previously produced from stamped aluminium sheet. Mr Ted DiGuiseppe, vice-president, sales and marketing, Hydro Aluminium Automotive Structures, says his company's sub-frame weighs only 11kg, or 2kg less than the stamped aluminium equivalent and also saves 75 per cent on tooling costs - an important consideration with a model to be produced at the rate of only 20,000 to 30,000 a year. In total, the extruded sub-frame costs 18 per cent less than the stamped one. Mr DiGuiseppe remains to be convinced that the Ford-Alcan concept of replacing steel car 'skins' with aluminium will not be too expensive. He admits, however, that companies such as Hydro which are offering aluminium spaceframes have the difficult task of persuading car companies not only to use a new material but also new manufacturing processes. Alcan's Mr Frontini says: 'The choice of technology is up to the auto companies. And Ford has firmly decided that the stamped unibody is the answer.' The debate will continue, but whatever the outcome, one way or another the automotive industry will use a great deal more aluminium in the future. 2000. A US Aluminium Association study showed the average 1991 US-built car contained 191lb of aluminium, 47 per cent more than in 1981. It is estimated 1994 cars will average about 235lb and Ford predicts that, by 2005, the average will reach 500lb.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOVATION: THERE'S A LOT MORE R&amp;D GOING ON THAN FIGURES INDICATE  </P> <P> Like Chicken Littles of global competitiveness, technology pundits are running  around the country shrieking, "The R&amp;D budget is falling! The R&amp;D  budget is falling!" Japan now spends more of its gross national product on  commercial research and development than we do, these gurus whine, and that  means America is losing its innovation edge.  </P> <P> While it's true that the R&amp;D numbers have long served as a surrogate index  for innovation, that only confirms Mark Twain's nasty little epigram that there  are lies, damned lies and statistics. America's R&amp;D stats hit a very large  nail not quite on the head.  </P> <P> Yes, industrial giants such as General Motors, IBM, DuPont and Merck spend  billions of dollars annually on R&amp;D (with wildly varying results). But what  about our post-industrial giants such as Citicorp, Federal Express, Goldman  Sachs and American Express? What does research and development mean when you're  in a service industry?  </P> <P> * Federal Express is "a very R&amp;D-intensive company," says Ed Clark, who  handles investor relations for the innovative shipping firm whose annual  revenue is approaching $6 billion. "We are so oriented towards developing  state-of-the-art technological solutions, that maybe we should consider  capturing that expense." In other words, Federal Express has no R&amp;D budget.  </P> <P> * Citicorp, America's biggest bank, spends hundreds of millions of dollars each  year developing and modifying its state-of-the-art telecommunications networks  and computer software to provide a host of innovative services for its  institutional and retail customers. The bank has consistently been a pioneer in  the application of technology to financial services.  </P> <P> * Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal and a top provider  of data services, spent more than $5 million to buy two Connection Machines --  state-of-the-art supercomputers -- as platforms for a next generation of  on-line information.  </P> <P> * Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. hires physicists and mathematicians to dream up new  financial instruments and build the software to implement them.  </P> <P> * American Express and its Shearson Lehman Hutton unit have pioneered voice  recognition technology on the trading room floor.  </P> <P> None of these market leaders have R&amp;D budgets. In post-industrial fact,  there are numerous examples of multibillion-dollar service sectors -- ranging  from publishing to movies to restaurants -- where research and development are  definitely taking place but in forms invisible to the statisticians.  </P> <P> Maybe a McDonald's McCaviar wouldn't be what most electrical engineers would  call a technological innovation, but it would certainly be a competitive  innovation in the right marketplace. The challenge is measuring it in a  meaningful way.  </P> <P> This new reality didn't completely escape the National Science Foundation and  the U.S. Census Bureau, the government agencies that track R&amp;D spending.  "We clearly weren't doing a good job" of tracking service sector spending,  acknowledges Melissa Pollak, a science resources analyst at the NSF. "So, we  increased the coverage of that group. It caused a flurry of phone calls from  those companies to the Census Bureau last year. They said, 'Why are you  surveying us? We're not industrial companies.' "  </P> <P> Of the 470 non-manufacturing companies surveyed, only 14 had R&amp;D data.  "Basically, their response was, 'We don't do R&amp;D,' " Pollak says.  </P> <P> Now this may be accurate, but it's also meaningless. Of course more than 3% of  these companies do R&amp;D, it's just that it may not be research and  development in the way the NSF traditionally thinks of research and  development. Clearly, crafting new software, whether it is an expert system or  a process simulation algorithm, involves both research and development. It also  costs money and manpower. But where do you draw the line? What qualifies as  innovation? New software? New packaging? New designs? New networks?  </P> <P> These numbers conceal more than they reveal. The latest NSF figures say that  there was $64.9 billion of research and development spending in the U.S. in  1987. The four largest companies accounted for 19% of all R&amp;D spending, and  the top 25 companies accounted for 40% of the total. Yes, the top 25 are  virtually all industrial companies.  </P> <P> NSF's Pollak notes that where non-manufacturing companies once accounted for  3.4% of R&amp;D spending in 1981, they now account for 9%. But "most of that's  reported by the emerging software companies," such as Lotus Development and  Microsoft. The software companies, like their industrial cousins, do have  formal R&amp;D budgets. That makes them easy to measure.  </P> <P> The point isn't to pick on the NSF and Census Bureau for taking the easy way  out. On the contrary, the NSF approaches the challenge of measuring R&amp;D  spending from a completely understandable science-and-technology-based  perspective. It makes sense for people who still view global markets in the  context of technologically flavored industrial goods.  </P> <P> And yet, while these R&amp;D numbers may work for traditional science and  technology investments, do they adequately capture what's going on in some of  the most critical segments of America's economy? If we're really concerned  about research and development, if we really believe that innovation is key to  global competitiveness, we have to redefine what those words mean. We have to  recalibrate the tools we use to measure them.  </P> <P> I don't want to diminish the importance of the more traditional industrial  R&amp;D in any way. But it's time that policy-makers understand that innovation  can be made of more than microchips and restriction enzymes. It's also time for  people who work in service sector companies to recognize that, whether their  budgets formally measure it or not, they also do research and development.  Managing that R&amp;D well will be key to their success in global markets.  </P></p>

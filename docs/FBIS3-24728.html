In his opening address to a special general  conference in Ulundi on Saturday, the IFP president said the  current constitution should be opposed and called for "the  courage to enter the politics of resistance".    "I say no to the present constitution and I say as this  constitution stands, I do not see how we can enter elections."  He said if the IFP capitulated and played the ANC/SA Communist  Party political ball game, this would lead to future violent  clashes between "the people" and an ANC government.    "This constitution as it now stands is an arena for struggle  to the finish. Within its provisions, there is no scope for  constitutional or political settlement." The IFP president said  he was prepared to compete with any political leaders or party  under a fair and just constitution.    He would not, however, subject IFP members to a constitution  which was "totally wrong" for the country He rejected arguments  that kwaZulu and the IFP would come to nought if they did not  contest elections. "I say there can be no governance of  kwaZulu/Natal without the active acceptance and participation of  the IFP.    "This is a region where we dominate. No foreign forces shall  come into it to rule over us."    The Inkatha leader again rejected the Transitional Executive  Council, saying he would neither recognise nor obey it.    On the future of the Zulu monarchy, Mr Buthelezi said his  position had to be constitutional entrenched, and anything less,  "I am just not prepared to accept".</p>

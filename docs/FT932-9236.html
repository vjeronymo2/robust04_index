			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Shell pleases City with rise to Pounds 971m ROYAL Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, took the City by surprise yesterday with first quarter profits significantly higher than forecast. The company's shares rose 20 1/2 p to 612 1/2 p. Net income for the opening quarter of 1993 on a current cost basis, which strips out the effects of holding oil stocks, rose 12 per cent to Pounds 971m. The company registered gains in all of its divisions in spite of lower oil prices, declining refining margins in Europe and continued over-capacity in the chemicals sector. 'These results clearly show how well Shell's regional diversification is paying off,' said Mr Nick Clayton, energy analyst at Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker. Shell is seeing most growth in its Latin American and Asian businesses where the company has targeted investment in the past 10 years. Mr Clayton pointed out that Shell's assets in the Far East had grown from a value of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) in 1985 to Dollars 22bn last year as it had switched its emphasis away from the US. Shell has seen volumes continue to rise in the Far East while Europe has seen a downturn. In the first quarter, sales volumes in Europe were down 6 per cent but in the Far East they rose by 5 per cent and were up 7 per cent in Latin America. Mr Clayton estimated that Shell earned a 12 per cent return on its investment in the Far East compared with 5 per cent in the US. The company reported a rise in earnings from its exploration and production division to Pounds 584m (Pounds 465m) even though oil production slipped by 3 per cent to 2.16m barrels a day. The division benefited from a lower tax rate, the depreciation of sterling against the dollar and higher gas prices in the US. Downstream earnings from Shell's refining and petrol sales operations rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 455m with oil product sales increasing by 3 per cent overall. Chemicals lost Pounds 22m compared with profits of Pounds 20m in the same period last year, but showed an improvement from the fourth quarter when the loss reached Pounds 183m. The company's metals division which it is currently negotiating to sell to South Africa's Gencor lost Pounds 3m. Shell's financial position remained strong during the quarter with the debt-to-equity ratio falling to just over 3 per cent. The company had a net cash inflow of about Pounds 1bn after cashflow from operations of Pounds 2.1bn and capital expenditure of Pounds 1.2bn.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK 'in final stage' of trade talks Britain is in the final stages of negotiating an investment promotion and protection agreement with Cuba in an effort to raise its trade and investment profile in the Caribbean's largest island, writes Pascal Fletcher in Havana. 'I hope we will be able to reach an agreement . . . we are in the final stages of discussions,' Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, said late on Sunday at the start of a three-day visit to Cuba by a delegation of businessmen and trade officials. The last official visit by a British minister to the communist-ruled island was almost 20 years ago. Mr Taylor said that despite the two countries' different political and economic systems and the recession gripping Cuba, the British government saw good prospects for increased trade and investment. He said he was concerned Britain was lagging behind Europe and Nafta nations in developing economic links with the island. Mr Taylor said he would be evaluating the economic reforms in Cuba since the collapse of its ties with the former Soviet bloc. Reforms to the state-controlled agriculture system were critical, he said. He would also discuss the issue of Cuba's outstanding debt to the Paris Club and to British companies. The latter is estimated to total Pounds 60m. Mr Taylor drew a distinction between Britain's attitude to Cuba and the US trade embargo against the island. 'My view about our trade with Cuba is that it's less influenced by what America does, and more influenced by how strong Cuba's opening towards market forces is,' he said. UK exports to Cuba totalled Pounds 14m last year, a 50 per cent drop from 1992, caused by the recession and a shortage of foreign exchange. But exports for the first half of 1994 were up 180 per cent, mainly due to a rise in cereal sales.</p>

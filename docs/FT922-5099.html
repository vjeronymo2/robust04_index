			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (13): Big companies are keen to look green - The business community is anxious about the  threat of 'green taxation' and over-regulation THE business world has mixed feelings about Rio. A number of large companies which think of themselves as responsible on green matters are glad to see the state of the planet high on the global agenda. But many others view Rio with apprehension: could it lead to tougher green rules and new taxes? Can business' quest for profits be reconciled with a clean environment? One man who thinks the answer to that question is yes, and has been prepared to spend some of his considerable personal fortune to back it up is Mr Stephan Schmidheiny, a private Swiss businessman who chairs the Business Council for Sustainable Development. He argues that business should see the environment in the same light as research: something you spend money on without the prospect of immediate gain, but in the hope of securing long term benefits. In this case, the benefit would be greater efficiency, in addition to whatever moral or public relations value a company acquires through being green - 'companies should see this as another opportunity for competitive advantage-gaining.' Mr Schmidheiny recently published a kind of businessman's green manifesto, 'Changing Course', which argues that business can make a contribution to solving the world's ecological problems, provided there are free and open markets, and regulations treat everyone fairly. The alternative to business' willingness to co-operate would be a draconian regulatory crackdown which would harm everybody, the book warned. The business viewpoint will be put at Rio by the International Chamber of Commerce. The ICC, with members in 112 countries, has drawn up a business charter for sustainable development which has the backing of 750 leading companies around the world. They undertake to recognise environmental management as a high corporate priority, but they will also be advancing the message that competition must be free and fair. Despite the desire of top industrialists to portray themselves as environmentally concerned, Rio comes at a time of mounting frustration within the business community over the growing regulatory burden. Only three weeks before the start of Rio, a survey by Price Waterhouse of manufacturing companies in the UK's industrial north showed them chafing under environmental regulations. And in the US President Bush lifted certain species controls which were obstructing the lumber business. One of the results that the business community is seeking from Rio is closer co-operation between governments on environmental matters, so as to ensure that some countries do not adopt tougher rules than others, and put their exporters at a disadvantage. 'We need an umbrella being put up at Rio,' says Mr John Collins, the chief executive of Shell UK, and chairman of the UK government's Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment. He says Shell is ready for measures like a carbon tax which might suppress demand for oil, provided it is applied to all industrial countries. Although such a tax would hit at Shell's products, Mr Collins says his company would be ready to reposition itself to supply cleaner fuels - 'we've already taken that step mentally,' he says. He accepts that governments will have to make what he calls 'fiscal tweaks' to encourage environmental shifts. But he also believes that the prices of goods and services must increasingly reflect the environmental costs in production, use and disposal. In Japan, the big corporations have recognised the needs of the environment, but are now confronting the realities of dealing with it, says Mr Michio Hashimoto, an expert adviser to Japan's Environment Agency. Although the financial services industry is less exposed to environmental issues than industry because it does not process raw materials, environmental pressures are beginning to make themselves felt there too. A group of 31 leading European and Japanese banks recently endorsed a UN accord on sustainable development. The document committed them to pursue best environmental practice in the management of their own affairs and also to take account of their clients' environmental risks when assessing them for loans. Bankers are worried that they might be made liable for the environmental infringements of their borrowers.</p>

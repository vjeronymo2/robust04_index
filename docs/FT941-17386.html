			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK to send warship to S Africa A British warship is being sent to South Africa this month for the first time in 27 years, symbolising the revival of official military contacts between the two countries, writes David White, Defence Correspondent. One of the Royal Navy's latest frigates, HMS Norfolk, is to visit Cape Town and Simonstown from January 27. UK officials said the visit was not directly linked to military sales, although Britain has begun sounding out opportunities and South Africa is known to be interested in offshore vessels.</p>

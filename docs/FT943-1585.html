			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Arts: Berlin tunes in to Goldschmidt - The 91-year-old composer's work is being recognised at last Germany has finally made its peace with Berthold Goldschmidt. Forced to flee the Nazis in 1935 for London, where he has lived ever since, the 91-year old composer has been the toast of this year's Berlin Festival. Both his operas have been performed - Der gewaltige Hahnrei in a slick, hyper-active Harry Kupfer staging at the Komische Oper (which put on a special Goldschmidt exhibition), and Beatrice Cenci in a concert version linked to a commercial recording. The nearby city of Magdeburg organised a parallel set of events, including the stage premiere of Beatrice Cenci. Goldschmidt's three concertos and other symphonic works have also been played. The response from the German press, public and music establishment has been ecstatic. There have been full houses, standing ovations and a touching ceremony at which Goldschmidt was presented with some early manuscripts, previously thought to be lost. The warmth of his reception can be put down partly to genuine delight at such performable music, and to the sight of a nonagenarian enjoying every minute. Goldschmidt's time has come, and he deserves a medal for surviving to witness it. For many Germans, he is a living link with a golden age in their country's musical history, a symbol of what might have been if Nazism had not intervened so decisively. But the Goldschmidt revival is also a mark of collective guilt - a chance to atone for all Jewish artists whose creative spark was extinguished in the gas chambers. Would Goldschmidt's music have survived if he too had died? Would there be the same interest today if it had been played 60 times in the 1930s? But that is playing with history. To hear staged performances of his two operas in quick succession last weekend was to be confronted by a composer who takes care over word-settings and chooses juicy topics for the theatre. The music itself may not blaze with originality or natural drama, but it is well-made and easily assimilated. The two operas deserved to be heard, and the evidence suggests they would repay further investigation. Der gewaltige Hahnrei (The Mighty Cuckold), first staged in Mannheim in 1932, was the last opera by a Jewish composer to be premiered before the Nazis came to power. Along with hundreds of others, Goldschmidt's music was quickly categorised as 'degenerate'. By the end of the war, the trends of the 1920s and early 1930s had sunk without trace, buried in the rubble of the Third Reich. It was time for a fresh start. Serialism was the new orthodoxy, and anyone who did not subscribe to it was old hat. Like thousands of other German Jews who escaped, Goldschmidt had to pick up the pieces of his career elsewhere - becoming a British citizen in 1947 and, as a conductor, playing an important role in the British Mahler vogue. Hahnrei had to wait 62 years until this month's revival, borne along on the recent surge of interest in Germany's 'lost' interwar era. It is a precocious work for a 28-year old. Based on a play by the contemporary Belgian dramatist Fernand Crommelynck, and subtitled a 'musical tragi-comedy', it tells of the man who believes in his wife's love but cannot trust her. Bruno is so convinced that Stella is unfaithful that he forces her to do what he fears most - to take other men to bed. She believes she is demonstrating her love for him by obeying. He ends up disguising himself and seducing her. Here is a kinky story - but psychologically fascinating, full of sexual neurosis and very much a product of its time. Goldschmidt's score is equally a period piece. He comes across as a German Poulenc or Ibert - a master of pastiche and a brilliant orchestrator, with lots of expert doodling. There are echoes of his teacher Schreker, of Weill, Krenek, Shostakovich, Mahler, jazz, cabaret. Over a 100-minute span, you just sit back and watch the styles change. The drama itself goes nowhere. The Komische Oper's production did nothing to counter that impression. Kupfer, with his designers Hans Schavernoch and Reinhard Heinrich, underlined the work's surrealist fantasy, keeping the visual framework as abstract as possible. The set - an undulating pink cat-walk looped round a stylised see-saw and climbing rack - fell somewhere between wedding-cake and playground. Costumes and make-up were pure pantomime. The air was thick with irony, but anyone ignorant of the plot would have been lost. The more Kupfer spun the stage turntable, the more tedious the performance became. An earthier, less artful approach would have done the work greater service - so it is good to hear another staging is planned for Bern. In every other respect, this was a strong ensemble performance. Under Yakov Kreizberg, the Komische Oper's new music director, the orchestra negotiated the different styles and rhythms with commanding verve. The cast was headed by Yvonne Wiedstruck, who captured Stella's innocent beauty, and Gunter Neumann's tormented Bruno. Hearing Beatrice Cenci 24 hours later in Magdeburg was to discover a composer who had found his own style - an amalgam of incisive themes and Busoni-like counterpoint. Commissioned for the 1951 Festival of Britain, but unperformed for various unsavoury reasons until a 1988 concert in London, Cenci gives compact operatic form to Shelley's sordid tale of the Italian Renaissance. As in Hahnrei, the theme is sexual violence and the exploitation of women, but in more sinister vein. Unlike Hahnrei, it benefited immeasurably from the stage setting. The Magdeburg production was given at the Theater am Jerichowerplatz, a converted cinema at the former Russian barracks. Despite an unhelpful acoustic and crude lighting, Max Hoffmann's staging told the story clearly and honestly, leaving plenty of room for the imagination. Eberhard Matthies's realistic set combined simplicity and grandeur, while Renate Schmitzer's costumes had a 20th century flavour, without being too specific. The cast, singing in the original English, was headed by the Canadian soprano Heather Thomson as Beatrice. She acted sensitively and brought character to Goldschmidt's unvarying vocal moderato - not least in the beautiful Act 3 lullaby. Irena Sylya was the sympathetic Lucrezia, and David Cumberland made a properly tyrannical Count Cenci. Under Mathias Husmann, the rest of the cast, chorus and orchestra gave fulsome support. The concert performance of Cenci in Berlin (which I heard on the radio), featuring Roberta Alexander, Della Jones and a coarse-sounding Simon Estes, may have had greater musical polish, but Magdeburg gave the opera theatrical life. It is now time for a British company to follow suit.</p>

Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> THREATS TO HONECKER REPORTED  </P> <P> Former East German leader Erich Honecker may be moved to a monastery to protect  him from a possible lynching by enraged citizens, a newspaper said today.  </P> <P> In a front-page story, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper said "Lynch Danger  -- Church Wants to Grant Honecker Asylum."  </P> <P> Since Honecker was ousted Oct. 18, the former Communist Party leader and other  party officials have been investigated on charges of corruption and living in  luxury at the cost of the state.  </P> <P> In December, seven former Politburo members were arrested, and Honecker was  placed under house arrest in the government housing area of Wandlitz outside  East Berlin.  </P> <P> The Wandlitz homes, including the one in which Honecker still lives, are being  converted to a medical rehabilitation center for children. Honecker is expected  to be forced out of the compound in February.  </P></p>

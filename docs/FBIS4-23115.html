			<p>Former      and current Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) officers have  reportedly entered the 26 June election for the city council  chairman seat in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol (Krasnaya  Zvezda, 4 June).  While the chances of any of the BSF officers  winning appear slim (Interfax, 9 June), their candidacies  nevertheless could further exacerbate Russian-Ukrainian and  Crimean-Ukrainian tensions by fueling Ukrainian suspicions of  Russian meddling in Krym (Crimea).  BSF officer candidacies  appear to be an effort to secure a stronger voice for BSF  interests in the running of Sevastopol, the fleet's main basing  facility.  The registered candidates reportedly include Reserve  Admiral Aleksey Kalinin, former BSF commander, Colonel Aleksey  Melnikov, deputy head of BSF air force communications, and Rear  Admiral Aleksandr Penkin, deputy BSF commander (Krasnaya Zvezda,  4 June).

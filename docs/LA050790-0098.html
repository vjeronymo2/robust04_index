			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BOUND PROJECT GIVEN ROUSING START  </P> <P> In New York and Kansas City, philanthropists successfully have tested the  premise that the promise of a college education can keep many children in  school and out of trouble. Los Angeles soon will try this experiment, too --  with a twist.  </P> <P> Project College Bound, a new foundation, hopes to inspire inner city  seventh-graders with greater educational prospects but it will differ from  other programs of its ilk because it will seek the support of a variety of  small donors, not just the wealthy, according to organizer Ophelia Long.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles effort also will enlist the city's entertainment and business  communities.  </P> <P> The project got under way Saturday night with a Wiltern Theater benefit,  underwritten by the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks. The  society, which conducted its fifth annual conference this weekend in Long  Beach, underwrote Project College Bound with $60,000.  </P> <P> The program will require participants to sign a pledge to stay off drugs and  away from gangs and to avoid pregnancy or impregnating someone, said Long, a  hospital administrator with Kaiser Permanente and a charter society member who  helped organize the benefit. In exchange, the program will pay for students'  college tuition and "any mentoring or tutoring they may need and expose them to  cultural experiences."  </P> <P> The weekend benefit featured a silent auction followed by a show with  performances by actors Marla Gibbs, James Earl Jones, and Cleavon Little;  stand-up comedy from Byron Allen; and music by Freda Payne and Peter Yarrow of  Peter Paul &amp; Mary. The Ambassadors of Compton, a singing and dancing youth  group, performed, as did the D.A.R.E. Up With Life singers.  </P></p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Rifkind blocks Pounds 2bn defence cuts MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, the defence secretary, appears to have fought off demands from the Treasury for deep defence cuts in Thursday's public spending review. A proposal which would have reduced the department's Pounds 24bn annual budget by about Pounds 2bn over three years has been abandoned, civil servants said yesterday, though a smaller cut had not been ruled out. Ministers decided that a Pounds 2bn reduction was 'not possible', said sources. Mr Rifkind is said to have warned that thousands of jobs would be lost and some companies might not survive if cuts were deep. A modest cut should keep the MoD on the course set by the Options for Change defence review in 1990. It might also allow the government to keep its election manifesto promise not to cut the defence budget below Pounds 24bn a year. Last year's Autumn Statement on spending plans envisaged a 1992-3 defence outlay of Pounds 24.1bn rising to Pounds 24.8bn by 1994-5. A small cut or a freeze this year should avoid the need for another defence review, said the sources. But equipment, which takes the biggest slice of the defence budget at 37 per cent, should still bear the brunt of cuts in the medium-term. Projects under threat of postponement or cancellation include: An upgrade to Challenger 1 tanks, which the MoD said performed only 'adequately' in the Gulf war. Vickers is the contractor and BAe, through Royal Ordnance, would make a new gun. The Pounds 700m Tornado GR1 aircraft mid-life upgrade, involving many companies including GEC-Marconi and BAe. The project has begun, but the heavy spending does not begin until 1996. A Pounds 500m medium-range surface-to-air-missile to replace the already retired Bloodhound. The procurement decision has been delayed several times already and is now due in June next year. BAe and GEC-Marconi are among the competitors for the contract. The Trigat anti-tank missiles (Pounds 425m). The production phase has already been cut from spending plans. The Treasury believes that the UK has too many anti-tank systems. Possible savings of up to Pounds 2bn to the UK with the European Fighter Aircraft, arising from recent talks over how to cut the cost of the four-nation project, would be made only in the second half of the decade. Short-term savings will be hard to find. Cash has already been committed to pay for staff cuts under the Options for Change review, while most large capital projects do not call for heavy spending until the middle of the decade.</p>

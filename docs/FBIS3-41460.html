Around 467,000 tonnes of petroleum products  have leaked out of the airbase, and the ``deposit'' lies at a  depth of seven meters, with individual lenses of pure kerosene  between three and five meters thick.    The contaminated area lies not far from the bank of the  Volgograd reservoir and is only 500 meters from the Engels city  water supply. Over 20 years around 60 tonnes of rocket fuel  have also been lost from the fuels and lubricants depot.    The damage to the environment, according to the preliminary  figures, is assessed at 24.5 billion rubles. Meanwhile,  kerosene ``prospectors'' are wasting no time: Each morning they  drive up and fill their tanks for free. One truckful of illicit  fuel earns at least 1 million rubles.</p>

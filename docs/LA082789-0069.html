Officials of the state-run Pakistan  International Airlines in Islamabad said the search was suspended overnight for  the PIA Fokker-27 that disappeared early Friday shortly after taking off from  the resort city of Gilgit on a 190-mile flight to Islamabad. On board the  missing plane were 49 passengers, including five infants, and five crew  members. Among the passengers were two foreigners, American journalist Paul  McGorrian and a woman identified on the passenger list only as Sibrys,  nationality unknown.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>   [Text] The session began, as usual, with people's  deputies' speeches delivered during the miscellaneous section.  In general, the floor was taken by members of the parliamentary  opposition -- Syamdzyanava, Novik, Dzeyka, Navumchyk, and  Holubew. They sharply criticized the current political  situation in the republic. Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw  Hryb reported that the Supreme Soviet Presidium had received  proposals to include certain other issues on the agenda. For  example, draft legislation on archives, which was proposed by  People's Deputy Aleh Trusaw, was included on the agenda. The  issue of science and technical activities, on the other hand,  did not receive the required number of votes and was not  included on the agenda, as well as certain other issues.  People's Deputy Ihar Demyanchuk approached the microphone and  proposed to include on the agenda the issue of violating human  rights in the Republic of Belarus. However, the issue was not  included, because only 66 people's deputies supported this.  Belarusian Attorney General Vasyl Shaladonaw came forward with  a proposal to strip People's Deputy Syarhey Antonchyk of  parliamentary immunity and bring him to administrative account.  One hundred eighty eight people's deputies voted to include  this issue on the agenda. Therefore, the issue will be  addressed at the current session. People's Deputy Uladzimir  Novik suggested that the financial credit policy of the Republic  of Belarus be discussed first. This was the course of the  morning session. During the recess, I held an interview with  People's Deputy Inesa Mikhaylovna Drabyshewskaya.    [Begin recording] [Rutkowski] It was not a coincidence that  the issue of implementing the Chernobyl program was also  excluded. Inessa Mikhaylovna, what is your opinion on the  attitude of people's deputies toward resolving problems of  Chernobyl?    [Drabyshewskaya, in Russian] I was really dumbfounded when  they excluded the debate on implementing the Chernobyl program,  because I live in the Chernobyl zone, and I was elected to serve  as an advocate for this program. We know that the aftermath of  the Chernobyl disaster is evident in our oblast, with regard to  the rate of diseases among adults and children, the  deterioration of people's immune systems, and the rate of birth  defects. The number of cases of oncological diseases increased  by 6 percent last year, including among children.    [Rutkowski] What, in your opinion, are the reasons behind  this specific attitude of people's deputies toward the Chernobyl  problems?    [Drabyshewskaya] The Chernobyl problem is one of the most  important economic problems. There is no money to implement  this program. [Words indistinct] another, strictly political  issue. The legislative body violated the law, having  misinterpreted it.    [Rutkowski] Do you have in mind Syarhey Antonchyk?    [Drabyshewskaya] In this case this concerns Antonchyk,  Drabyshewskaya, Kamay, and all people's deputies. This become a  precedent. This precedent should be discussed by the  legislative body according to a law that is called the rules.  [end recording]    Now, I am talking with People's Deputy Stanislav  Stanislavovich Shushkevich [former Supreme Soviet Chairman].    [Begin recording] [Rutkowski] Stanislav Stanislavovich, with  what opinions and feelings did you come to today's session, and  what is your assessment on the political situation in the  Republic?    [Shushkevich] I came to the session to work. The point is  whether we will discuss economic issues. I do not know if we  are going to address them first. If these issues are not  discussed, other things will not have any sense. Let us say  frankly that the government is unable to manage the state, and  that its goal is to give up our state to Russia under any  conditions. We must resist this, because there are enough  people in Belarus who are able to lead the state, and we must  make room for them. The elections must be held. I believe that  it is a felony to delay the elections until November. [end  recording]    At the end of my report I will add that people are gathering  at Independence Square and in front of the House of Government.</p>

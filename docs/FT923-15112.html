			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Tokyo looks for closer relationship with a stronger Europe: On the eve of tomorrow's Japan-EC summit in London, Mr Tomohiko Kobayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the EC, gives his personal view of relations between the two JAPAN and the European Community are both searching for a world role, and in this quest there is much they can do jointly to help each other. This is the broad background to tomorrow's summit in London between Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, Prime Minister John Major, the new president of the European Council, and President Jacques Delors of the European Commission. The EC is, in timely fashion, heading towards its 'single market', and with the Maastricht treaty, towards a real economic and monetary union, as well as the embryo of a political union enabling possible common foreign and security policies. The road to this goal may be arduous and full of ups and downs, as Denmark's recent rejection of Maastricht clearly showed. But the EC has no choice but eventually to succeed in its titanic enterprise. We Japanese are confident that, in spite of the strong reservations and sensitivities on the part of many Europeans about abandoning their respective national sovereignties, most of Europe's political, economic and intellectual leaders know this road is the realistic way of coping with serious challenges in the world of today and tomorrow. They surely know that, only with the unification of Europe, can they be responsible leaders in managing world affairs and contributing to the stability and prosperity of others as well as their own. This explains why so many European countries (even, most recently, Switzerland) have applied to join the Community. Japan, too, is in search of a new role to play in this rapidly changing and highly unstable world. In the Asia-Pacific region, Japan intends to be a political stabiliser and stimulator of the regional economy. Worldwide, she is actively joining with her partners in the Group of Seven (G7) to manage major economic and political problems. Japan is even giving aid to Russia, which still continues illegally to occupy part of her territory. But we know very well that, however economically powerful she may have become, Japan alone cannot assume heavy leadership responsibilties. In economic affairs, the world system rests essentially on a triangle described by the EC, Japan and the US. We definitely need active co-operation between these three major poles. But we have to recognise that one side of this triangle - the EC-Japan relationship - is, or at least used to be, much weaker than the other two. Fortunately, both the EC and Japan have awakened to the need to change this. So, they agreed on July 18, 1991 to a joint declaration, inaugurating formally the new era of 'sound competition and constructive co-operation' between the EC and Japan. Since then, we have stepped up our dialogue with the EC in many areas ranging from nuclear energy, science, technology, telecommunications, industrial management, to development aid and protection of tropical forests. Of increasing importance is our 'political dialogue' with the EC, in regular meetings between foreign ministers and their leaders. Tomorrow's meeting will be the second of what are now to be regular annual summits. Indeed, we need to consult each other more, not only on aid to Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States but also in other areas. Japan welcomes the EC's growing political role in the world, and wants to impress on the EC the need to consider the problems of security world-wide, paying more attention to North East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. The EC should understand that, while communist totalitarian regimes have disappeared in Europe, remnants of Stalinism are still strongly present in Asia, as evidenced by continued Russian occupation of our northern territories. We wish to see the EC more involved in our region, and as a first step we welcome the EC's involvement in our efforts to arrange international help for Mongolia and Cambodia. Noticeable progress has been made in promoting business co-operation between the Keidanren and Unice, the employers' federations of Japan and Europe, as well as at a sectoral level in consumer electronics and cars. Two-way investment is increasing, particularly by EC companies in Japan, though it is still small (Dollars 3.5bn at end-1990) compared to Japanese investment in the EC (Dollars 59.7bn by mid-1991). Japanese manufacturers are doing their best to become welcomed as 'corporate citizens' of Europe, contributing to employment and technological progress. But one serious problem remains - the trade imbalance. After marked improvement in the late 1980s, the EC's trade deficit with Japan began to increase again, mainly due to Japan's economic slowdown and Germany's unification boom. In 1991, the imbalance amounted to around Dollars 30bn, although Japan imports more per capita (Dollars 260) from the EC than the Community buys per capita (Dollars 180) from Japan. In the conclusions recently adopted by the EC Council of Ministers, the European Community has placed this problem in a balanced global context. Our headache is that, with the best of intentions and efforts, we cannot find any quick and short-term remedies to what is largely a structural problem. The Japanese government is doing its utmost to ease the problem - by taking fiscal measures to boost domestic demand, by introducing new incentives for foreign investors and traders in Japan, by enhancing competition policy to give newcomers easier access to the market. We strongly hope these measures will bear fruit. In the meantime, we are ready to make every effort not to hurt, unduly, our European competitors - the 'car arrangement' is just one example. We want a really 'harmonious symbiosis' with the EC economy. At the same time, we hope for the disappearance this year of some 49 humiliating quotas applied by certain EC states specifically against Japanese products. Our relations with US are of vital importance to us both. But in this turbulent world, the EC and Japan which share the same value system of democracy, human rights and market economy need to strengthen ties of active co-operation with each other.</p>

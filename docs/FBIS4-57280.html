			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with FSLN member Ernesto Castillo by Walter </F> Lacayo Guerra; in the library of his home; date not given; first  three paragraphs are EL SEMANARIO introduction]    [Text] Upon the victory of the Sandinist revolution he was  appointed and sworn in by the JGRN [National Reconstruction  Government Junta] as attorney general. He then became the "great  confiscator" from the Somoza family and their allies with the  promulgation of the now internationally famous Decrees 3 and 38.  He will never regret having applied them vigorously.    He is the father of eight, one of whom--Ernesto Castillo  Salaverry--died during the September 1978 uprising, fighting the  National Guard with the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation  Front] guerrillas. He was a member of the old Sandinist Assembly  that was dissolved at the end of the first FSLN Congress in July  1991.    Ernesto Castillo, who for five years (1985-90) served as the  Sandinist government's ambassador to the USSR, now teaches at  the UCA [Central American University] Law School, as he did from  1960 to 1970. In the library of his home he answered our  questions, one by one.    [Lacayo Guerra] You signed the document "For a Sandinism  Restored to the Masses." Is not that faction a sort of Sandinist  intellectuals' movement?    [Castillo] Not so. Both documents, ours and the one released  by the Democratic Left, were prepared by intellectuals. Julio  Lopez Campos, for example, is an intellectual who is a member of  the Democratic Left, just as Sergio Ramirez is an intellectual.  It is by no means correct to say this is a movement of  intellectuals. These are people with different views on the  Front's leadership. Now, of course, to discuss and draft a  document, you have to know how to read, write, and think. So in  that sense, every document is prepared by intellectuals.    [Lacayo Guerra] Your faction represents social democracy in  the FSLN?    [Castillo] I believe such labels are a source of ridiculous  embarrassment. Some people are now embarrassed to be reminded  that they were Marxist-Leninists or communists, when in the past  they shouted that with great pride. Those are only terms that  become fashionable and then suddenly people are stigmatized with  those labels. We should see who will be more offended, a person  called a Marxist-Leninist or a social democrat. Those purely  formal terms should not concern anyone.    [Lacayo Guerra] It has been said that your faction was born  with an electoral goal in mind: to launch Sergio Ramirez as a  presidential candidate, and the other supporters want to be  candidates for deputies and municipal officials.    [Castillo] That all seems ridiculous to me. A person simply  has to read the document to realize that it represents a large  number of revolutionaries who are questioning internal  situations in the Sandinist Front. At no time do they support  the candidacy of Sergio or anybody else, even though they have  that right, for we all have the right to make decisions about  candidacies. But that is not what we are concerned with now.    [Lacayo Guerra] So what are you concerned with?    [Castillo] The internal situation of an FSLN that is  paralyzed. And I would not call the document a platform. For me  and all of us who signed it, it is a way to force a logical  review of the FSLN, to adapt it to today's circumstances,  independently of candidacies and whether or not the concepts and  contents of our document, like the Democratic Left document, may  be revised. These are not absolute proposals at all. Instead,  this is a way of questioning a party that does not want to  change.    [Lacayo Guerra] What were your motivations for signing that  document?    [Castillo] Well, I saw it as an opportunity to force the  FSLN  to review its internal situation and try to find among all of  us, including the Democratic Left and any other sector of the  Front, a party that can respond to the people and to the ideals  for which we fought and got involved in this Sandinist Front.    [Lacayo Guerra] We are on the eve of an Extraordinary  Congress of the Sandinist Front. What do you expect from that  Congress?    [Castillo] I expect very little. Very little. The documents  I  have read and the way the process is being carried out give me  the impression that there is going to be very little space for  people to try to rediscover the Sandinist identity and to find  an FSLN restored to its values. I believe we are not going to  have much of an opportunity, since the congress is being  organized by those who are trying to keep the Sandinist Front  from changing.    [Lacayo Guerra] Are you pessimistic?    [Castillo] It is not a matter of being pessimistic. It is  rather that I have no confidence that from this congress,  arranged in a hasty and forced manner, there may emerge what we  really want from the Sandinist Front. There has been little  time, or rather, they have left little space where the FSLN  could be in charge of a group of people who truly want to open  up the party, both to face new challenges and also to recover  the honesty and morality of the true FSLN of the past.    [Lacayo Guerra] The Extraordinary Congress is going to  reform  the statutes and prepare a new program. If the results are as  you say you believe, will this mean something like "an election  defeat announced in advance"?    [Castillo] I do not think the congress is going to deal with  the 1996 elections, nor do I think the Sandinist Front should  consider the next elections. The 1996 elections are a deadline  for which we must be prepared, but not a goal. Sandinism needs  to seek in this congress, as it should always do, more universal  aims than elections, even though elections do have a great deal  of importance.    [Lacayo Guerra] What specific situations make you have  doubts  about this Extraordinary Congress?    [Castillo] The essential thing is to recover the moral  authority of the FSLN. Even though the document that I signed is  called, "For a Sandinism Restored to the Masses," that will not  happen if we do not start by restoring moral authority. I can  say that if we are unable to overcome this moral decline, a more  or less moderate FSLN may arise, but it will not be the true  FSLN, but instead a political party just like any other  political party.    [Lacayo Guerra] What is your reason for saying the FSLN has  lost its historic morality?    [Castillo] What I am saying is that some people in the  Sandinist Front are presenting the face of an FSLN that no  longer has the moral authority it used to have. I say that  essentially because of the abuses committed after 1990. There  was enrichment, some people became businessmen, which is not bad  in itself. What is bad is being a crooked businessman who  expands his capital with other people's money. The mansions and  property that those people now control--which they obtained  illegally--the revolution had intended these properties to  benefit the people, and not to benefit certain individuals.    [Lacayo Guerra] What if the Congress does not define a party  that identifies itself with what you consider the Sandinist  Front should be? Would you resign your membership?    [Castillo] In my case, what motivates me in political action  is a revolutionary concept that always remains when one really  is a revolutionary. Being in one party or another is a question  of whether that party responds to revolutionary interests. From  its origin up to the present, the FSLN has unfailingly provided  the most opportunity to develop revolutionary ideas and do  revolutionary work. But if one day the FSLN is no longer  revolutionary, then logically a person must go his own way.  Something else will arise where that work may be pursued.    [Lacayo Guerra] Do you describe yourself as on the left?    [Castillo] Intellectually, I think the left has not  exhausted  its potential. The next generation must continue to seek a more  collective, more just society. And not only because I am on the  left, but also because that is more consistent with  revolutionary beliefs. Even with Christian beliefs for those who  have them. Those hopes for a less egotistical, less  individualistic society must not be lost.    [Lacayo Guerra] There is so much social inequality,  unemployment, poverty.... What is the role of a revolutionary  party in these circumstances?    [Castillo] Its role is to learn how to interpret correctly  those circumstances and work so that, wherever possible, it can  stop the savage and voracious advance of economic policies that  do not respect any system of ethics, do not consider human  dignity, and also use the right tools to regain power and from  there make the changes that are needed.    [Lacayo Guerra] Should the party lead the people's  struggles?    [Castillo] The Sandinist Front should be at the head of the  popular struggle. This needs to be understood. If people ask me  about violence, I say that I support the violence we used in  1979. If I am asked about confiscations, I support our  confiscations in 1979, for we wanted a change and we made the  utmost use of that opportunity. Did we know how to organize and  make that permanent? That is something else.    Now, in these circumstances in which the historic situation  tells us that we can only reach the government through  elections, we must use this opportunity to bring about change.  But that does not mean we are no longer revolutionary.    [Lacayo Guerra] What is your opinion of violent methods of  struggle?    [Castillo] That depends. Let us suppose that in 1996 the  elections are won by a political sector that defends the  interests of the masses, and the present government says: "I  will not turn over the government." Then it would be legitimate  to take up arms to recover power that was won in clean  elections. There should be no scruple about taking up arms. But,  of course, taking up arms unnecessarily does not make sense when  we have a system that should be used first.    [Lacayo Guerra] The issue of relations between the Sandinist  Front and U.S. administrations is fairly controversial. What do  you think?    [Castillo] There must be honorable and respectful relations  on both sides. The United States has been responsible for  injustice, for poverty; it still is, and so we have to see. But  that does not mean we should break off relations or be in a  state of permanent confrontation. Instead, there must be a  flexible response to its positions. If those positions are  logical, then there should be logical responses. If they are  positions of violence or abuses of our sovereignty, we must  defend ourselves with all our dignity and with firmness, no  matter what great power it may have.    [Lacayo Guerra] Is the concept of anti-imperialism still  valid?    [Castillo] That concept is now a little out of date, for  empires themselves are out of date. Instead, it is the concept  of sovereignty that should be understood and clarified. Our  decline has been so great that now, even our relations with  Costa Rica, which is not an empire, are not relations of equal  to equal, especially with this government. The meaning of  sovereignty is that it must prevail against any country.    [Lacayo Guerra] What are your ideas about revising the FSLN  statutes?    [Castillo] The principal axis of the FSLN should not be so  much the statutes, for the FSLN is still in a phase of  structural search and programmatic adjustment. Instead, it needs  to change its internal mindset and way of thinking. The  essential is a change in leadership; first of all, it has to  decide to break with this clinging to power....    [Lacayo Guerra] Are you talking about a change in mentality  of the present leaders or a change in leaders?    [Castillo] I am talking about a change in the leaders in the  top leadership and at intermediate levels that are clinging to a  structure without any reason, rather than to power for the sake  of power. I think that is more important than the program  itself. It is the same with constitutions. You can have a  wonderful constitution, and if it is poorly used, people can do  whatever they want with it.    [Lacayo Guerra] What do you think about the National  Directorate as an organization? Should its name be changed?  Should it be expanded?    [Castillo] It should cease to exist as a structure and all  the members of the National Directorate should be removed. New  people have to take over the leadership. Hierarchy has been a  serious problem in the Front, as we have still not lost our  concept of vanguard. We needed a vanguard at one time. In a  political and military leadership a vanguard was necessary, but  now it is not, for that concept brings with it a mistaken  hierarchy. We need to set Sandinist forces free to seek their  own leadership, and the discussion we are now having about  methods of struggle, about the program, should be left to the  free workings of the people who need that change. For in  essence, these become discussions of the inner circle.    [Lacayo Guerra] On a personal level, do you have any  aspirations to belong to a leadership organization of the  Sandinist Front?    [Castillo] No, no, absolutely not. I am terrified of that  type of thing because it is the easiest way to get entangled and  caught up in complications. Other people can do that, people who  have a type of discipline that I do not have. I think there is  more freedom to question when you are on the bottom, especially  in a phase of search and renewal.</p>

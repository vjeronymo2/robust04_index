			<p>BFN     [Text] A deputy of the Russian State Duma, ex-chairman of  the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) Supreme Soviet  Anatoliy Lukyanov said he believed that there was no alternative  to a renewed Union.    On Tuesday he took part in the meeting in the Belarussian  Academy of Geo-Politics which was holding an international  conference "Russia and Belarus - the way to the future" in  Minsk.    Lukyanov told Interfax that his visit to Minsk was aimed at  expressing support to those forces standing for expansion of  Russian-Belarussian cooperation and defending the idea of  restoration of a renewed Union.    "My visit has absolutely nothing to do with the coming  presidential elections in Belarus," Lukyanov stressed.    He said that the mechanism for restoration of the Union was  created when 19 communist parties were set up in the ex- Soviet  republics. Lukyanov said that the congress of the USSR peoples  planned for this September was also expected to contribute to  establishment of a mass movement for restoration of the Union.    Lukyanov spoke in favor of participation of Russian and  Belarussian parliamentarians in the hearings on the results of  the implementation of the Belaya Vezh agreement which will be  held in the State Duma Committee on CIS in early July.</p>

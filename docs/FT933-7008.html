			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Decline in Japan slows World Index At one point last week, five Pacific Rim equity markets, three senior bourses in Europe, Wall Street in the US and Toronto in Canada were all hitting 1993 highs; yet the FT-Actuaries World Index ended the week with a rise of just 0.5 per cent. Some high-profile investment destinations, such as Germany, France, the UK and Hong Kong, saw profit-taking last Friday; but Japan was the real drag on the World Index with a fall of 1.4 per cent in local currency terms. Nomura's global strategy team in London, headed by Mr Nicholas Knight, put out a sell recommendation on Japanese equities last week, noting that the market at that point was still 46 per cent higher than it was a year earlier. Given that, say the team, the key priority now may be the wish to avoid a repetition of the 'bubble' economy of the mid to late 1980s; the authorities may seek to reflect the economy to the exclusion of the stock market, and a 'wall of money' might come out of Japan to cap the rising yen. Opinions are divided on whether Japanese money has been feeding gains elsewhere on the Pacific Rim. Mr David Bates at Asia Equity says his clients have been thinking positively after a bullish National Day in Singapore, Malaysia expected to produce a repeat performance at the end of this month, and Hong Kong moving from exuberance to caution - the latter over China worries and the Hang Seng Bank results - at the end of last week. However, Ms Pauline McAtamney at Ord Minett thinks that New Zealand, certainly, must have seen some new source of funds as turnover boomed last week, and its World Index constituent index climbed by a heady 9.7 per cent. Fletcher Challenge lit the touch paper with results better than market expectations, indicating that forestry returns had touched bottom, and with its plans for a separate vehicle for its forestry assets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change   % change                  % change in local currency*      sterling*  in US dlrs*             ------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week  4 Weeks    1 Year  Start of   Start of   Start of                                             1993      1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +0.41    +5.43    +30.58    +26.11    +21.03      +20.78 Belgium       -0.56    +2.16    +24.04    +21.07    +14.10      +13.87 Denmark       +3.47   +11.10    +23.07    +33.08    +22.29      +22.04 Finland       +1.89   +19.90   +154.95    +84.22    +67.17      +66.84 France        -0.74    +6.97    +24.36    +17.62    +11.46      +11.22 Germany       +0.81    +4.95    +25.45    +24.09    +19.86      +19.62 Ireland       +1.13    +8.48    +40.47    +45.79    +26.59      +26.34 Italy         +4.80   +12.02    +73.11    +51.52    +40.87      +40.59 Netherlands   +1.14    +6.10    +26.87    +23.25    +18.91      +18.68 Norway        -2.93   +10.34    +52.60    +33.21    +26.96      +26.71 Spain         +3.70   +12.32    +43.21    +36.71    +15.73      +15.50 Sweden        +0.11   +10.86    +60.25    +29.62    +15.40      +15.17 Switzerland   +0.31    +4.83    +39.70    +20.40    +19.62      +19.38 UK            +1.43    +8.28    +33.43     +9.45     +9.45       +9.23 EUROPE        +1.10    +7.56    +33.73    +18.77    +15.00      +14.78  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +3.20    +5.48    +18.63    +19.27    +17.67      +17.44 Hong Kong     +1.61    +9.82    +31.92    +34.74    +34.86      +34.59 Japan         -1.39    +3.11    +41.18    +25.70    +49.98      +49.67 Malaysia      +4.09    +8.26    +70.09    +40.63    +44.33      +44.04 New Zealand   +9.69   +18.97    +41.52    +35.45    +46.29      +46.00 Singapore     +4.11   +10.23    +54.36    +29.55    +32.02      +31.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        +1.40    +6.32    +10.57    +13.66     +9.53       +9.31 USA           +1.36    +2.00     +9.51     +4.79     +5.00       +4.79 Mexico        +5.43   +12.35    +28.61     +3.43     +3.94       +3.73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +1.70    +0.67    +29.53    +28.59    +34.53      +34.25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.50    +3.99    +24.29    +15.00    +20.17      +19.94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on August 20th 1993.

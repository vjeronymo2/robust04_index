			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro, Texaco in marketing venture Norsk Hydro and Texaco yesterday announced plans to form a joint-venture marketing company to bolster their position in the Scandinavian petroleum products market. By combining their service station networks, the companies say they will hold 20 per cent of the Norwegian gasoline market and 17 per cent of the Danish market. They will also have a significant presence in the diesel and heating fuel markets. Each partner will hold 50 per cent of the new company, which is expected to become operational on January 1 1995. The venture aims to draw on Hydro's strong Scandinavian presence and Texaco's international experience and marketing expertise. It excludes the companies' other Scandinavian interests, including the North Sea and Scanraff refinery in Sweden. Texaco will continue to market its aviation and marine fuels and lubricants in Scandinavia separately. Mr Torstein Bergem, Norsk Hydro executive vice-president, said: 'The proposed joint venture will enable us to successfully meet the challenges of the increasingly competitive Danish and Norwegian markets.' Texaco said the project was in line with its worldwide plan to cut costs and strengthen core businesses.</p>

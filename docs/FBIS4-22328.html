			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Belyanov, candidate of economic </F> sciences: "A Decline Without Signs of an Upswing: What Monthly  Surveys of Industrial Enterprise Leaders Showed in 1993"    [Text] DELOVOY MIR regularly acquaints its readers  with the results of the monthly surveys of industrial enterprise  directors, which the editors of the independent ROSSIYSKIY  EKONOMICHESKIY BAROMETR bulletin have conducted since December  1991. This publication is now offering the aggregate results of  these surveys during 1993. The editors accumulated the material  from two years of statistical samplings. Readers, who are  interested in the dynamics of the data obtained, can go to the  final publication of the data for 1992 (DELOVOY MIR dated 25  March 1993) and the 1993 quarters (DELOVOY MIR dated 28 August  1993 and 11 January 1994).    We would remind you that the respondents are approximately  150 industrial enterprise directors from various regions of  Russia. The enterprises are mid-size (the number of workers is  800-1200 people) and the percentage of state ones among them  decreased from 50 percent to 25 percent during 1993. They  operate basically in the domestic market. Speaking briefly, they  are typical Russian enterprises devoid of monopoly benefits  which found themselves one by one in the market.    One should emphasize the reliability and high accuracy of  the  directors' evaluations. A good knowledge of actual economic  practices, competence and responsibility for their judgments are  displayed in the appraisals.    Let us compare the directors' appraisals of management  results in 1993 with their forecasts of the expected results for  last year and the first six months of 1994 (see Table 1).    Table 1.

Differing somewhat from the actual results (this is completely  normal), these forecasts reliably reflect general development  trends. On the whole, these appraisals are not noted for  optimism although they contain details of no small importance,  which deserve attention.    There is, perhaps, only one noticeable deviation from the  indicators in official statistics. The directors' appraisals of  the actual volume of products, work and services practically do  not state their decline (as it follows from the State Committee  for Statistics data) but rather reveal a marking time. A  previous survey made the assumption that this is explained by  the specific nature of the responding enterprises: Being  mid-size, they display greater stability than large and small  firms. Spot conversations with the enterprise directors  apparently confirm our version.    Other indicators correspond to the description of the  situation as a typically crisis one. The number of workers is  frozen or is being reduced. A general increase in prices, in  whose structure purchase prices are outstripping sales prices,  is continuing. The financial condition of the enterprises is  worsening. The labor costs (wages) are lagging behind price  increases in their growth.    A certain slowdown in the growth rate of prices (and this  means of inflation also) is reassuring to some degree: During  the second half of 1993, these rates decreased and, during the  first half of 1994, the directors expect a further, although  small, slowdown in price increases. It is also impossible not to  see that the percentage of those, who expect a worsening of the  financial situation in their enterprises by the middle of 1994,  has decreased 1.5-fold.    However, the situation with investments, which are rapidly  being reduced, is extinguishing this weak spark of hope. In such  a case, where can one expect an upswing if there is no growth in  capital investments and no modernization of the production  system?    According to the survey data, the actual volume of capital  investments in June 1993 was 61 percent of the December 1992  level and in December 1993 it was 52 percent of the June 1993  level. The directors expect that it will equal 41 percent of the  December 1993 level in June 1994. These data correspond to the  long-term estimates of demand for production capacities and  manpower (see Table 2).    Table 2. Availability of Production Capacities and Complete Manpower Staffing  Relative to the Demand for Enterprise Products, Expected in the Next 12 Months  (as a percentage of those surveyed)   Possible answers        When answer obtained                           June 1993       September 1993       December 1993   A. Availability of production capacities:   1. Surplus              21              32                   38   2. Normal               55              40                   47   3. Insufficient         25              28                   15   B. Complete manpower staffing:   1. Surplus              16              29                   32   2. Normal               57              49                   56   3. Insufficient         26              22                   22      As we see, the percentage of those enterprises, which  possess  surplus material and labor resources, increased during 1993 and  the percentage of those enterprises, which experienced a  shortage of them, decreased.    A conclusion about the non-typical nature of the Russian  crisis suggests itself. The fact is that the prolonged slump  (despite a certain slowdown in it) is not displaying the  beginnings of an upswing. The directors steadily predict that  approximately another five years are required before the crisis  ends. This is very similar to the fact that an upswing is  generally not expected on the Russian economy's present path. It  is simply slipping down to another, narrower and primitive,  level of development -- to another, narrower, orbit of economic  life from which, as the historical experience of developing  countries confirms, it is practically impossible to set off for  the heights of civilization.  <H5>  The Tenacious Noose of the Financial Crisis </H5>   Table 3 reflects the answers to the question on the causes  hindering production growth. It was proposed that the  respondents name 3 of the 12 possible types of reasons.    Table 3.

Other reasons             8          7        3       6          7      The answers received do not contain any justification for  other interpretations: The crisis in the financial area and the  sales crisis connected with it hindered production during all of  1993.    Let us point out that, among the financial reasons reining  in  the economy's normal functioning, it is not strictly market  factors but an administrative smothering of growth that is  showing through more and more clearly. Indeed, whereas the  impact of the price factor (59 percent of those answering in  January 1993) occupied first place at the beginning of 1993,  this factor moved to second place in the middle of the year  despite the continuing increase in prices, yielding first place  to the shortage of financial assets in the enterprises. It had  moved to third place by the end of the year, having been passed  by high taxes. Moreover, the impact of the two leading factors  (in the opinion of 65 percent of those responding) was so strong  by the end of 1993 that it began to restrain the role of the  price factor (it decreased to 52 percent). This aggravated the  sales problem and made the effect of the resource factors  (equipment, manpower, raw materials, etc.) as well as that of  management and the privatization process practically  insignificant.    Thus, from the middle of 1993, the centralized establishment  of high prices and refinancing rates became the main reason  slowing down economic growth, especially investment dynamics.    An unpleasant fact like the intensification of the trend  toward in-kind exchange, was also detected (especially during  the second half of 1993). The percentage of barter deals in the  enterprises' turnover grew during the second half of the year  from 9 to 11 percent. The proportion of enterprises marked by an  increase in this percentage rose from 18 to 34 percent. There is  a basis for assuming that these data are objectively  underestimated even if only because mutual deliveries in  accordance with clearing agreements are normally not stated as  an in-kind exchange.    I will repeat the conclusion contained in the previous  survey: The primarily monetarist approach to stimulating the  market is beginning to kill the market itself. In this  situation, one cannot exclude an alternative where the growing  uncontrolled nature of the economy will make a shift to strictly  centralized regulation inevitable.  <H5>  Stress on Stimulating Production </H5>   Table 4 sums up the directors' appraisals of ways to adapt  to  the management conditions that have taken shape and,  consequently, of ways to get out of the crisis (here, it was  also necessary to select 3 of the 12 suggested answers).

Everything   0             3             1         2           1  is normal      In this table, the concentration of factors is less rigid  than in Table 2; however, we see even here the priority of the  money factor -- primarily, nonpayments by buyers and the  difficulties in repaying loans to suppliers and banks.    At the end of the year, a strengthening in the requirements  of commodity markets appeared: The percentage of respondents,  who mentioned finding new sales markets and changing the  composition of produced products as the leading ways to adapt to  actual conditions, grew somewhat. At the same time, the problems  in finding raw material suppliers slackened off. Unfortunately,  these changes hardly signal a sudden change in the economy's  dynamics. Rather, the present sales problems connected with the  search for solvent buyers is having an effect here.    It is regrettable that the problems in the production area  are still being moved to one of the last places: In November  1993, only 14 percent of those surveyed saw the way out of the  situation to be the expansion of production capabilities. This  indicator had significantly decreased in comparison with August  when it was 22 percent. The actual economic situation is not  disposed to expanding production.    Only one percent of the respondents said: "Everything is  normal." These same people, when they were asked: "In your  opinion, what is most important now for the Russian economy?"  replied almost unanimously: "Stimulating production" (see Table  5).    Table 5. In Your View What Is Most Important Now for the Russian Economy? (as  a percentage of the number answering)   Possible answers             When answer obtained                                October 1993             November 1993   1. Stimulating production    66                       73   2. Slowing inflation         27                       18   3. Difficult to say          7                        9      The following generalization suggests itself. The answers  contained in Table 4 show short-term and tactical estimates of  ways for enterprises to get out of the serious condition in  which the crisis and volitional variants of the economic reforms  have placed them. The data in Table 5 state the long-term and  strategic plans of true experts on economic activity, whose  confidence in the priority of a concern for stimulating  production is rapidly growing: In October 1993, 66 percent of  the respondents thought this and, after only a month, in  November -- 73 percent. Of course, they are not supporters of an  inflationary element. They simply do not believe in the  miracle-working nature of monopolizing the manipulation of  monetary levers.  <H5>  The Main Danger Is the Destruction of the Production System </H5>   Alarming phenomena in the area of production characterized  last year. An increase in the irreversible processes destroying  the production system became more and more evident. The  prolonged decline is holding out fewer and fewer chances for the  system's rapid rebirth in an ultra-modern form.    An absolute decrease in production capacities occurred  during  the entire year: In December 1993, their volume was 10 percent  less than in December 1992. Approximately seven percent of the  existing capacities will never be used in the opinion of the  respondents. Those who answered listed another 15 percent of  operating production capacities with those incurring losses  during the second half of 1993. This means that they are  candidates for retirement. Even the remaining, more effective,  labor weapons are functioning in a weakened condition. According  to the data of the monthly surveys, the workload level of  production capacities was within the 70-75 percent range of the  level which the directors estimated as normal. This indicator  decreased to 69 percent in December from 76 percent in  January-February and 78 percent in March. The percentage of  enterprises, where the workload level of production capacities  increased, varied little by quarter: 8-13 percent in the first  quarter, 9-14 percent in the second, 6-13 percent in the third,  and 7-9 percent in the fourth. The percentage of enterprises,  where this indicator decreased, grew from 25-31 percent in the  first quarter to 38-52 percent in the fourth.    However, the trouble lies not only and not so much in such  crisis phenomena. It is known that obsolete and inefficient  equipment, technologies, etc., should disappear naturally during  an economic decline, yielding their place to new and efficient  ones. However, the trouble is that the old ones are growing old  and new ones are not being born.  <H5>  The Paralysis in Investments Is Robbing the Future </H5>   In comparison with the corresponding period of 1992, the  directors estimated the total volume of capital investments  during the first half of 1993 at 59 percent, and during the  second half -- at 55 percent. They explain this by the following  reasons (see Table 6 where it was necessary to select three of  the suggested answers).    Table 6.

Other         6           8         3        8             6  reasons      As is evident from the data cited in the table, the  financial  crisis has fettered the dynamics of capital investment. Again,  we observe how the paralyzing grasp of administrative monetarist  measures has grown from month to month. The pressure of bank  interest rates has increased literally by fits and starts: In  January 1993, only 16 percent of the respondents saw in it a  barrier on the investment path but, in December, they were 42  percent of all those completing the questionnaire. Before the  fourth quarter, the effect of such a market factor as high  prices for equipment, construction, etc., dominated. However,  the shortage of ruble assets was literally treading on its  heels. It won: The answers received in December 1993 put the  primacy of the monetary famine into the minutes. Undoubtedly,  this is the result of the present tax and credit policy. If one  adds to this the pressure of existing debts (75 percent of the  enterprises' nonpayments are explained by their lack of assets;  the enterprises' debt to banks grew by 64 percent during the  second half of 1993), we receive practically a complete set of  the main barriers to growth. All of them are related to the  monetary area (excluding hard currency relations, about which  many spoke but which do not play a substantial role in the  national economic mechanism but which are parasitic on it,  diverting financial resources to speculative mergers). The  effect of the other reasons, including the fashionable  privatization processes, are completely insignificant.  <H5>  The Making of the Economic Structure a Primitive One Is </H5> Intensifying    Last year did not bring any positive changes in the  structure  of investments (see Table 7).    Table 7. Some Indicators of the Structure of Enterprise Capital  Investments During the Last Six Months (as a percent of total capital  investments)                      When answer received                      January     March     June     September     December                     1993        1993      1993     1993          1993   Capital investment financing structure:   a)Enterprise       79          66        72       65            75  internal assets  (profit,  amortization)   b) Attracted       15          42        19       28            25  assets (credits,  assets from  issuing stock  shares, etc.)   Relationship between production and nonproduction (social, cultural and  everyday living establishments) capital investments:   a) Production      -           56        65       60            75   b) Nonproduction   -           32        30       36            25    3. Model technological structure of production capital investments:   a) Passive         43          42        46       54            46  elements  (buildings,  structures)   b) Active          49          46        54       46            54  elements  (machinery,  equipment)   4. Reproductive structure of production capital investments:   a) Expanding       25          30        32       33            33  production  capacities   b) Reimbursement   63          56        59       65            67  for retirement  of equipment,  modernization,  repairs      As is seen from the data in the table, only 25-33 percent of  the capital investments went to expand production capacities,  and all the rest -- to patching up the obsolete production  system. The proportion of expenditures on the passive elements  of production capital (42-54 percent) is high. The percentage of  investments in nonproduction capital is declining (from 30  percent in the first half of 1993 to 25 percent in the second).  This means that social problems are increasing in enterprises.  The credit policy has hobbled the possibility for using  attracted assets, whose percentage in the form of credits and  income from the issuance of stock shares during the first half  of the year was only 25 percent among the sources of capital  investments. According to the monthly survey data, 47-57 percent  of the enterprises, on the whole, did not make any equipment  purchases.    All of these are serious symptoms of a grave illness fraught  with losing the capability for receptivity to advanced  technology -- a reduction in the need to use new and the latest  scientific and technical solutions.  <H5>  Economic Reforming </H5>   The answers to the December questionnaire, which contained a  number of questions included for the first time, yielded some  new information. The absence of its dynamics still does not  permit making any generalization; however, the information  itself can be of definite interest.    Among the enterprise respondents, 69 percent have already  undergone the privatization process. The majority (55 percent)  prefer its second version, 20 percent selected the first  version, and only 2 percent -- the third; 23 percent were  inclined to different versions.    Among the holders of the sold shares, labor collectives (66  percent of those responding) are in first place; next come the  local branches of the Federal Property Fund (38 percent),  enterprise administrations (26 percent), investment funds (16  percent), other enterprises (15 percent), banks (3 percent), and  other owners (12 percent). A total of 27 percent of the  enterprise respondents hold shares of other enterprises, and 47  percent --shares of banks. General stockholder meetings have  already taken place in half of the privatized enterprises (49  percent).    The majority of privatized enterprise (55 percent) have  formed councils of directors. Almost everywhere, their  composition includes representatives of the administration (98  percent of the surveyed enterprises) and labor collectives (82  percent) as well as representatives of the Fund for Federal  Property (75 percent), other enterprises (36 percent), banks  holding shares of enterprises (18 percent), investment funds (16  percent) and other enterprise shareholders (32 percent).  <H5>  Dissatisfaction With the Government's Economic Policy </H5>   In conclusion, we will cite the answers of enterprise  directors, which describe their attitude toward the government's  economic policy (see Table 8).

What have been the results from implementing the government's economic policy for  your enterprise relative to other Russian enterprises?   1.

The        -       35           46          41          35      46        47  enterprise  has held  its own   3. The        -       18           10          8           20      12        8  enterprise  gained (or  lost less  than  others)      We have deliberately included in this table the results of  all the replies that we have (these questions were on seven  questionnaires during the last two years of sampling). This  selection over a protracted period convinces us of the  persistent constancy of the opinions characteristic of the  director body.    During the two years that the statistical survey has been  conducted (these years embrace the entire period following the  price liberalization), less than a tenth of the respondents  declared their understanding of the government's economic  policy. In the middle of 1992, they were eight percent, and at  the end of 1993 -- only four percent. An even smaller part of  the directors considered this policy correct: five percent in  the middle of 1992 and only one percent at the end of 1993.  Almost half of the respondents habitually state that they  suffered losses from implementing this policy (in 1993, they  ranged from 42 to 51 percent); in turn, those maintaining the  opposite were significantly fewer (from 8 to 20 percent).    We took the data of the entire period of the statistical  survey because they are practically not connected with the  change in the composition of the government and with the change  in its leaders. Rather, an appraisal is given not of some former  or current members or other of the government but of its policy  itself.    Of course, one cannot ignore the extensive criticism  addressed to the director body, whose representatives are the  respondents. However, we have no other production directors and  they will not appear by magic. Whether one wishes it or not, one  must take the opinion of experienced practical workers into  consideration. Generally speaking, can one seriously maintain  that several dozen and even hundreds of the directors' critics  are keeping pace but that thousands and tens of thousands of  functioning managers (along with other enterprise management  personnel -- hundreds of thousands) are not keeping pace?  <H5>  Brief Conclusions </H5>   1. The results of the surveys of directors during 1993  revealed alarming trends in the prolonged decline that are  acquiring the features of an irreversible loss, among which the  most dangerous are the signs of the destruction of the  production system and the privatization of the economic  structure.    2. The directors' replies do not reveal any signs of an end  to the crisis and the approach of an economic upswing. The  continuing reduction in capital investments and the total  paralysis of the investment process primarily testify to this.    3. It looks as if the economic reforming, which is being  carried out, is beginning to give birth to anti-market  tendencies: in-kind exchange, the strengthening of directive  financial measures, an increase in feeble monopolistic efforts,  instead of a movement toward a market economy.    4. The directors are convinced of the priority of  stimulating  production and, correspondingly, of the low effectiveness of  purely monetary levers.    5. The survey results obtained reveal quite clearly the  unpopularity of the government's economic policy among the  directors -- an unpopularity with the policy of this or that  composition of the government.</p>

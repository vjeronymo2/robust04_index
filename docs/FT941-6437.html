			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels challenges Hollywood moguls - Protection of EU film industry urged Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European cultural commissioner, yesterday called for greater protection of the European film industry to counter the power of big Hollywood studios. Mr Pinheiro said the European Commission was considering possible changes later this year to the 'television without frontiers' directive which sets quotas on foreign broadcasting material and films. He also called for 'positive measures' to promote European programming and films. The Portuguese commissioner suggested that these measures would create a breathing space for European industry as it struggles against US competition, and could be dropped 'once Europe has a healthy film and TV production sector again'. His comments are certain to fuel controversy about the future of European broadcasting policy and increase tensions with the US. Only last week, Mr Pinheiro caused a stir by calling for an end to the system which has allowed the Hollywood studios to pool their resources to distribute films in Europe without falling foul of EU competition rules. The Commission will shortly produce a green paper on a strategy for the audio-visual industry based on two central figures: that 50 per cent of programmes on European channels are of US origin, and that US films now account for at least 80 per cent of box-office revenue in every EU country, except France, where it is around 60 per cent. In his speech to US film producers yesterday, Mr Pinheiro said it was time to redress the 'serious imbalance' which existed in the European film market. 'Given that admissions in movie theatres in Europe on the average stagnate, would it not be in the interests of us all. . . to develop policies developing this market? I believe the answer is Yes.' Hollywood, which has strong support within the Clinton administration, is likely to be wary of calls for market-sharing dressed up as co-operation. Speaking in Vienna last Monday, Mr Stuart Eizenstat, US ambassador to the EU, said that European quotas on US films were 'repugnant' and infringed the principle of freedom of speech. Mr Pinheiro is vying with French politicians for the title of champion of European culture. In his speech, he attributed the US movie industry's success to the existence of a sound domestic market. 'American films deal with standard stories for a linguistic and culturally unified public,' he claimed. The commissioner, a former Portuguese foreign minister, suggested it was time to create a similar broad European market. 'The mistake to avoid could be the creation of 'culturally confused' productions.' Last year, Mr John Birt, director general of the BBC, warned the European Union against attempting to create a 'synthetic Euro-culture with a harmonised media industry'.</p>

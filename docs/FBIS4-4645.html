			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu will leave here Saturday morning for  Tokyo, where he will consult with Japanese Government leaders on  the North Korean nuclear issue. Han is scheduled to meet with  his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata Sunday afternoon to  explain the results of President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China  and discuss the U.N. Security Council president's statement on  North Korea adopted Friday. Han and Hata are expected to  discuss follow-up measures on the nuclear dispute.    The South Korean foreign minister will call on Prime  Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday to express Seoul's appreciation for  Japanese cooperation in the Security Council's adoption of the  presidential statement. They will discuss ways to maintain  closer consultations on the North Korean question.    Prior to his departure, Han held intensive discussions with  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry on resumption of the  military exercise Team Spirit and beefing up joint defense  capabilities in South Korea. Han and Perry agreed that the two  countries will decide on Team Spirit's timing in subsequent  discussions considering developments in the nuclear impasse, and  when Perry visits South Korea in mid-April, according to Foreign  Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho.    In the hour-long meeting, Han and Perry shared the opinion  that Friday's unanimous adoption of the Security Council  statement would exert enormous pressure on North Korea.    Earlier, Han attended a policy debate attended by Peter  Tarnoff, undersecretary of state for political affairs, Winston  Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific  affairs, and Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for  political and military affairs.</p>

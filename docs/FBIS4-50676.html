			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin and his Surinamese counterpart Ronald R. Venetiaan today  agreed to further mutually beneficial cooperation between the  two countries.    During a two-hour talk at the state guesthouse here this  afternoon, Jiang said that both China and Suriname -- which lies  on the north coast of South America -- are developing countries,  shared similar sufferings in the past and have a solid basis for  future friendly cooperation.    Jiang said that under the leadership of the Surinamese  president, the Surinamese people have made unremitting efforts  to safeguard their domestic political stability and boost their  national economy.    In regional affairs, he said, in recent years Suriname has  been actively involved in promoting the progress of Caribbean  integration and playing an important role in promoting regional  stability and development. "The Chinese Government appreciates  this."    Jiang said the establishment of a peaceful, stable, fair and  reasonable international political and economic new order is an  urgent demand of the world community, especially of the  developing countries.    He noted that the developing countries are longing for peace  and state development and progress. The developing countries  making up a large proportion of the world were the main forces  for maintaining world peace, he said.    Venetiaan, after reviewing the traditional friendship  between  the two peoples, expressed his appreciation of the rapid  development of China's economy and his desire for strengthening  bilateral economic ties and trade.    He said that to enhance bilateral cooperation in every field  conformed to the interests of the two peoples, and Suriname was  willing to do so, he said.    Referring to the Caribbean regional situation, Jiang gave a  high appraisal of the roles of the countries in this region,  saying that the Caribbean region is an important component part  of the Third World and also a "bridge" linking the south and the  north of America.    Over the past few years, he said, remarkable achievements  have been made by the Caribbean countries in promoting the  regional peace and stability and pushing forward economic  cooperation.    Jiang said: "What we appreciate is that the Caribbean  countries are united and positively promote the progress of  Caribbean integration."    He said China is concerned about the development of the  Caribbean regional situation and desires to strengthen its  friendly ties and cooperation with the Caribbean countries,  contributing to safeguarding world peace and development.    Venetiaan said Suriname, as part of America and the  Caribbean, and a non-aligned country and member of the United  Nations, stands for Caribbean integration and non-alignment, for  safeguarding state sovereignty and the principles of equality  and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and  also for the principles of peaceful co-existence between the  nations and solving international conflicts through negotiation.    Venetiaan reaffirmed the "one-China" policy. Jiang expressed  his appreciation of this.    Wang Zhibao, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception  Committee and vice-minister of forestry, and Liu Huaqiu,  vice-minister of foreign affairs, participated in the talks.    Also present were S.Ch. Mungra, minister of foreign affairs,  F.R. Demon, minister of natural resources and energy, and J.  Sisal, minister of agriculture and fisheries, who are  accompanying the Surinamese president on his China visit.    Following the talks, the two presidents attended the signing  of four cooperative documents between the two countries.    They were: a loan agreement between the two governments; a  document detailing that the Chinese Government will present the  Surinamese Government with goods; a document detailing that  China has agreed to extend the repayment period for loans given  to Suriname; and a contract for China to provide agricultural  machinery and tools to Suriname.    This afternoon, Jiang hosted a ceremony to welcome Venetiaan  and his wife and their party. Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of  China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, attended  the ceremony.    Jiang gave a banquet here this evening in honor of the  president and his entourage, who arrived here at noon today on a  state visit.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLAIN BOY'S DAD AWARDED $5.7 MILLION IN W. COVINA SUIT  </P> <P> Ronald Allan Tolleson Sr. never believed that all those responsible for  murdering his 10-year-old son were brought to justice.  </P> <P> Although the police and district attorney have closed the case, Tolleson thinks  that others who either knew of or participated in the 1980 kidnaping and  killing were never identified.  </P> <P> Last week, the jury awarded Tolleson $5.74 million in his wrongful death  lawsuit against West Covina police, who Tolleson maintains bungled the original  kidnaping investigation. Tolleson argued that police were negligent by not  completely searching the main suspect's house. A thorough search, Tolleson  argued, could have saved his son.  </P> <P> In ruling against the city, the jury rejected testimony from Danny Jerome Young  that he killed the boy immediately after abducting him. During the trial,  medical examiners testified that Ronald was alive for up to four days after his  abduction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City's Position  </P> <P> In its defense, the city argued that Young -- who was convicted in 1982 of  second-degree murder and kidnaping -- alone killed Ronald the day he was  kidnaped and that others living in the Young household knew nothing of the  crime because the body was hidden.  </P> <P> But Tolleson never believed that.  </P> <P> "I don't buy it that a child was in that house for four days and nobody  noticed," he said. "There were more people involved -- I want them all behind  bars."  </P> <P> Police Chief Craig Meacham said investigators are certain Young acted alone.  </P> <P> "We're satisfied in our own minds that Danny Young did it," Meacham said. "We  really have no reason to suspect that anyone else was involved."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conspiracy Strategy  </P> <P> Young was convicted after two trials in 1982. The first ended with a hung jury.  At the second trial, the prosecution presented no evidence that Young killed  the boy, but argued that he was involved in the conspiracy that led to murder.  </P> <P> Young's brother, Orville Young, was tried as an accomplice in the case but was  acquitted.  </P> <P> In ruling against the city, the jury found that a "special relationship"  existed between the Tolleson family and the Police Department, which did not  live up to its assurances and responsibility to do everything possible to  ensure the boy's safety. "Special relationship" is a legal term that expresses  the duty of police to protect citizens under certain conditions. City officials  say the jury misapplied the law.  </P> <P> Tolleson said he anticipates an appeal by the city, but vows to take the case  up to the state Supreme Court, if necessary. "Whatever it takes," he said.  "I've been through two criminal trials and now this. We've come too far."  </P> <P> Tolleson said he was surprised by the size of the jury's award, but that he  does not expect to see much of it, given the appeals and his mounting legal  costs.  </P> <P> Thomas J. Feeley, the city's attorney, said the city will file motions within  two weeks to set the jury's verdict aside or force a new trial. A court hearing  on those motions would probably come within a month, and any decision on filing  an appeal would come later, he said.  </P> <P> Tolleson first filed the case against West Covina in 1981. On a motion from the  city, the case was ruled a "non-suit" in 1986 by a trial judge, meaning  Tolleson had insufficient evidence to warrant a trial. Tolleson appealed, and  the 2nd District Court of Appeal -- finding possible fault with the police  investigation -- reversed that decision, a ruling that the state Supreme Court  allowed to stand last year.  </P> <P> Nine years after the murder, Tolleson, 42, continues to live in the house he  shared with his son, just a few yards away from the household where Young lived  and his son died.  </P> <P> Sometimes, Tolleson said, he will see a baseball game and think of his son, who  was abducted while waiting for a ride to Little League. Pursuing the case has  been a debt that he owes his son, he said.  </P> <P> "I've had my ups and downs," Tolleson said. "I've hit the wall a few times."  </P></p>

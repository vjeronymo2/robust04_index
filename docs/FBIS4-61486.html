			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- "The accusations have nothing  in common with reality; such actions were not planned", stated  the press-centre of Russia's Black Sea Fleet on Thursday. The  naval representative was reacting to a declaration issued by the  Ukrainian Defence Ministry that the Russians had "plans to seize  at least 20 Tu-22 military aircraft during the Black Sea Fleet's  upcoming military maneuvers".    The press-centre representative told ITAR-TASS that the  Ukrainian assertion that "pilots of the Black Sea Fleet based in  the Crimea received orders to land the rocket-carrying aircraft  at the military base of Krymsk in southern Russia" cannot stand  up to criticism if only for techical reasons. All pilots,  including Ukrainian ones, know that the airfield in question  cannot handle such planes, the representative said.    The naval press centre is sure that, upon carefully reading  through the Ukrainian Defence Ministry's statement, one can  conclude that Kiev is hastily making public unchecked  information to confuse the public. This, unfortunately, is not  the first time such things have been done, the representative  noted.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Vow to resist lawsuit on Halcion drug claims A RETIRED Scottish professor said yesterday he would continue to warn about the dangers of Halcion, Upjohn's best-selling sleeping drug, in spite of the US company's threat to bring a lawsuit against him before the end of the week. 'I shall tell everything,' said Dr Ian Oswald, head of psychiatry at Edinburgh University for seven years before retiring in 1989. His findings were instrumental in the UK authorities' decision to ban Halcion in October last year. He said he planned to defy Upjohn's virtually unprecedented threat of legal action and talk next month at a public meeting on Halcion's safety held by the German Ministry of Health. Dr Oswald claims Halcion's serious adverse side effects were discovered by Upjohn as early as 1972 but were omitted in submissions to the US Food and Drug Administration. Dr Oswald spent more than 1,000 hours studying confidential Upjohn reports on the drug as an expert witness in a US action against the company. Upjohn settled the suit out of court. It involved a woman, Mrs Ilo Grundberg, who had shot her mother eight times while allegedly under the influence of Halcion. Dr Oswald was paid by Mrs Grundberg's defence lawyers for his role as an expert witness. Dr Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chairman and chief executive, said this week that Dr Oswald's claims of fraudulent concealment were false and reckless. He added: 'We've been caring for patients now for more than a century, and it's not fair for our employees to continue to be smeared by Oswald or for patients to be frightened and misled by this kind of junk science.' The Committee on Safety of Medicines, the UK government's drug safety watchdog, banned Halcion after Upjohn refused to withdraw the product voluntarily. French and Spanish authorities subsequently insisted the drug should be sold in 0.125mg pills rather than 0.25mg. Dr Oswald, however, questions whether the drug is effective in such low doses. An Upjohn submission to the FDA in 1985 said that only a 0.5mg dose was effective in the treatment of insomnia in non-geriatric patients. Dr Oswald said: 'It's incongruous that the only dose allowed in France and Spain is in doses that are regarded by Upjohn as frequently ineffective.' Although Halcion may not be effective as a sleeping treatment at low doses for most patients, it may nevertheless still be dangerous, according to Dr Oswald. He points out that in 1987, Upjohn told the FDA that adverse psychiatric reactions with Halcion were of uniform frequency whatever the size of the dose. He added: 'This means Halcion is just as likely to induce mentally ill effects in small doses as large. There is no dose dependency.' An Upjohn executive argued in a US newspaper this week that Dr Oswald could in no sense be considered an unbiased, neutral reviewer of the data. Dr Oswald yesterday challenged Upjohn to make confidential data from clinical trials public if it wanted to clear its name. 'I am an academic medical research scientist,' said Dr Oswald. 'I am only interested in the truth. That is my only concern.'</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Observer: More whirlybirds No sooner has Michael Heseltine returned to the inner circle of the cabinet than he has found himself mucking around with helicopters again. Let's hope he's luckier than he was last time. Back in 1986, during the infamous Westland row, he lost his job and the strategic battle. Yesterday, he referred two bids for Maxwell's British International Helicopters to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Although President Heseltine has not chosen sides, it would be surprising if he was not secretly rooting for a victory for the only unreferred UK bidder, the management buy-out team operating under the unglamorous name of Vidhop Ltd.</p>

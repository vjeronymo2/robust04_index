			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CABARET REVIEW;  </P> <P> LUFT MELDS GARLAND TOUCHES INTO OWN STYLE  </P> <P> Lorna Luft's return engagement at the Cinegrill in Hollywood was billed -- with  classic hyperbole -- as a triumphant return. One suspects that the  hard-working, ever-practical Luft may have blanched somewhat when she saw the  marquee's overblown announcement.  </P> <P> Her performance Tuesday night, however, was somewhat less triumphant than it  was reminiscent. Singing with a far more relaxed and assured manner than had  been the case with her earlier Cinegrill engagement, Luft looked and sounded  strikingly like her mother, Judy Garland.  </P> <P> The similarity seemed especially fascinating in the light of a recent  performance by Jim Bailey at the Cinegrill in which he devoted an entire  evening to a Judy Garland "illusion." But Luft's appearance was the real stuff.  Her moves, her manner, even the occasional crack in her voice, were the very  essence of Garland.  </P> <P> To her credit, Luft has molded this natural resource into a variation which is,  despite the familiarity of its source, uniquely her own. On songs like "Who  Will Buy" and "Right as the Rain," her warm, jazz-like phrasing and powerful  ability to tell a story begged comparison with no one. A medley of "I'm  Nobody's Baby" and "My Buddy" -- a familiar item in her show -- was once again  a highlight.  </P> <P> Luft's only problem was an occasional tendency to overestimate the dimensions  of the room. Too many numbers climaxed in brassy, oversized endings that were  appropriate enough for a Las Vegas venue, but far too large for the intimate  confines of the Cinegrill.  </P> <P> Luft continues at the Cinegrill tonight through Saturday. She returns next  Tuesday, Wednesday and Oct. 14.DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

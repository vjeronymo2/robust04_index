			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sheraton Hotel sale marks disposal of Polly Peck's largest Turkish asset ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International, the collapsed UK fruit and electronics group, yesterday completed the sale of the Sheraton Hotel in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya to a local Turkish group. The hotel, the largest of PPI's Turkish assets to be disposed of, was sold for an undisclosed cash sum to Dogus, a local construction group. The administrators declined to reveal the value of the sale, although it is believed to be about Dollars 45m (Pounds 29.8m), considerably less than the Dollars 65m the hotel cost to build. The administrators are also negotiating with a series of companies, including Singer, the Hong Kong electronics concern, for Vestel, PPI's brown and white goods manufacturer. Three weeks ago negotiations were concluded on the sale of Media print, PPI's printing operation, to the local Uzan family. Land near Izmir acquired for the planned joint venture between PPI and Peugeot, the French car concern, has also been disposed of. Philip Morris bought the site for its recently agreed cigarette manufacturing investment. However, the administrators' attempts to recover the PPI assets in northern Cyprus have been obstructed by a series of law suits filed by the former lawyer of Mr Asil Nadir, the former PPI chaiman. The administrators also suffered a blow when the Kyrenia View, one of PPI's three hotels on the island, was acquired by the north Cypriot government in lieu of a debt to the island's social security fund.</p>

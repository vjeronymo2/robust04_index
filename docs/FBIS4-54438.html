			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 28 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik admitted today to the existence of "working tension" in  the government where privatization issues were concerned.  However, he told journalists, the government's capacity for  action was thorn-free. "This tension has a working nature only,"  he stressed, asked about relations between Privatization  Minister Milan Janicina and Economy Minister Petr Magvasi.    Janicina favors the rapid transfer of state property into  private hands, chiefly by means of the coupon privatization  method, while Magvasi, a Democratic Left Party (SDL) candidate,  is for standard methods. In the background of the dispute,  however, can be felt the influence of the left-wing in the  leadership of state companies and that of the right in the  privatization funds.    Moravcik admitted that the privatization funds and the large  state companies were a factor in privatization policy, but said  he would not be inclined to directly relate the conflict of  these interests to the relations between Ministers Magvasi and  Janicina.    The government has not yet made a definitive decision on how  much of the state property, valued at over 200 billion crowns  ($6.6 billion), would be privatized by the coupon method, which  could gain votes before the autumn elections. At present a  media debate is going on between supporters and opponents of the  method.    Asked whether the SDL was blocking the bankruptcies of loss-  making state companies, Moravcik replied that the government had  not yet decided what part bankruptcies should play in dealing  with the problems of the Slovak economy. The government had to  take the whole situation into account, he said, adding that an  acceptable level of employment had to be maintained.    Unemployment in Slovakia stands at 15 percent. In some  areas,  one in four of the working-age population is without work.    On another controversial point -- the approval of conditions  set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the provision  of loans -- Moravcik said that the government was still  considering specific inroads into the expenditures and revenue  of the state budget.    Last week Moravcik said that negotiations with the IMF had  shown the necessity of increasing several taxes, and of limiting  agricultural subsidies, in order for the budget deficit to  remain below four percent of the gross national product.    However, Agriculture Minister Pavol Koncos today rejected  any  sort of reduction in subsidies to farming, stressing that only  parliament could decide on changes in individual parts of the  budget. "On this point I differ with the premier," Koncos told  CTK.</p>

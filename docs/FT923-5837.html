			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: CSI seeks time to refocus after diving into red MR TOM Long, chairman of the highly-geared Cannon Street Investments, yesterday pleaded for time to restore the troubled industrial holding company's balance sheet and businesses. 'We need time and we need patience,' said the former BAT director who became Cannon's chairman in March. 'The group . . . needs much tighter focusing and you do not do that in five minutes.' The plea came as Cannon Street unveiled a sharp drop into the red at the operating level, with interim losses of Pounds 2.1m, compared with a profit Pounds 9.78m last time. The dividend is omitted (3.3p). Mr Long blamed the severity of recession for the sharp turnround. The hardest hit businesses were building services and part of the electronics division. The pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.5m for the six months to June 30, against a profit of Pounds 2.8m, had been caused by new accounting standards on goodwill. The charge against profits for businesses sold in the first half came to Pounds 23.4m. This led to losses per share of 21.8p, compared with earnings of 2.4p. Cannon Street took a net exceptional gain of Pounds 7.8m for profit on the disposals. Turnover fell by Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 127m. Mr Long said the three businesses which had been sold accounted for some Pounds 19m in sales. Disposals had also helped to reduce interest payments, which fell from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 3.8m. Net debt dropped from Pounds 92.4m at the year-end to Pounds 55.3m. Gearing remained 'too high' at almost 200 per cent. Turnover of on-going operations was slightly ahead, Mr Long said. However, the chairman was cautious about the immediate outlook: 'The rest of the group is keeping its head above the water, but it is struggling.' Mr Long, said Cannon intended to make further disposals. Cannon's shares held steady at 4 1/4 p.</p>

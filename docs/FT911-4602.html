			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / MMC to investigate Isle of Wight ferries FERRY SERVICES between the mainland and the Isle of Wight are to be investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the government announced yesterday. The Office of Fair Trading said it had received complaints over a long period about the prices charged by cross-Solent ferry operators. Islanders on the Isle of Wight are wholly dependent on ferry services which, they claim, are among the world's most expensive in relation to the length of the crossing. The biggest operator in the market is Wightlink, part of the Sea Containers group, which operates three car ferries between Lymington and Yarmouth, two passenger-only catamarans between Portsmouth and Ryde, and three car ferries between Portsmouth and Fishbourne. Wightlink's main competitor is Southampton-based Red Funnel Ferries, which operates three car ferries and four car-carrying hydrofoils between Southampton and Cowes. The only other operator is Hovertravel, based on the Isle of Wight, which runs two passenger-only hovercraft between Portsmouth and Ryde. Wight-link yesterday quoted Pounds 22 to take a Ford Fiesta and two adults one way across the Solent. Red Funnel Ferries quoted Pounds 23.20 for Southampton-Cowes on a car ferry. The Office of Fair Trading said its main concern was the dominant position of the ferry operators in a market where there appeared to be limited scope for new entrants. Sir Gordon Borrie, the OFT's director general, said: 'I am not convinced that there are no barriers to other entrants to the market and I have received complaints over a long period. 'The companies do have a dominant position, and regular travellers between the Isle of Wight and the mainland are almost totally dependent on ferries. 'I have therefore concluded that the issues can be resolved only through an investigation by the MMC.' The commission has until December 17 to report.</p>

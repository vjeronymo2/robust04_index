			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Boise Cascade ends year in red BOISE Cascade, the US paper and forest products company, yesterday unveiled a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 29.6m, or 97 cents a share, compared with a deficit of Dollars 15.8m, or 51 cents, last year. For the year, it incurred a loss of Dollars 227.5m, or Dollars 6.73, which included a Dollars 73m, or Dollars 1.94-a-share, after-tax charge for required accounting changes. In 1991, Boise Cascade recorded a deficit of Dollars 79.5m, or Dollars 2.46. The result had been widely expected on Wall Street, where the stock traded up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 21 before the close. Weak prices for the company's key paper grades offset the positive impact of cost-cutting and strengthening timber prices on the annual results, the company said. Sales for the fourth quarter fell to Dollars 905m, from Dollars 963m a year ago, while for the year sales were Dollars 3.7bn, down from Dollars 4bn in 1991. The company attributed the sales declines to falling paper prices and the January 1992 divestiture of the company's wholesale office products distribution operations. Mr John Fery, chairman, said he expected Boise's building products operations to benefit in 1993 from strengthening demand, and office products sectors to improve as a result of cost-cutting and recovering markets. He added that market conditions for the company's paper products were improving, but 'very difficult'.</p>

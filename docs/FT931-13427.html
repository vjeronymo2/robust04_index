			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Capital to pay Pounds 18m for Midlands CAPITAL, Britain's largest independent radio group, yesterday announced a major expansion into regional broadcasting with a Pounds 17.7m agreed takeover of Midlands Radio, writes Tim Burt. Midlands, which operates BRMB in Birmingham and six smaller stations, said Capital had made a cash offer of 130p per share which had been accepted by shareholders holding 51.7 per cent. As an alternative, Midlands' shareholders can take shares in Capital on the basis of one new share for 181p cash. The takeover will give Capital its first wholly-owned station outside London, although it already has stakes in several other radio companies. Mr John Parkinson, who will remain Midlands' chairman and is expected to become a non-executive director of Capital, said the company would flourish as part of the new group. Both companies have seen a sharp increase in their share price since takeover discussions began last November. Capital's interest prompted a jump of almost 15 per cent in Midlands' share price, which peaked at 119p before being suspended yesterday at 112p. Since announcing its results in November, Capital's shares have rose from 132p, peaking at 183p earlier this month, to close at 178p yesterday. Midlands announced an Pounds 8,000 fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 679,000 in the year to September 30 1992, while Capital's pre-tax profits declined 9 per cent, from Pounds 9.48m to Pounds 8.84m, in the same period.</p>

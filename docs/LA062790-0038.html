"It  was like walking through history. They have a great baseball program and offer  a great education. It seemed like the best opportunity for me."  </P> <P> McMackin posted a 12-2 record with a 1.98 earned-run average this year and set  school records for wins in a season and a career (22). He also batted .402 with  28 runs batted in this year and shared the 4-A Division player of the year  award with El Camino Real's Pat Treend.  </P> <P> Chatsworth defeated El Camino Real, 3-2, for the 4-A title.

Speaking in the open session of the Majles, he said the  problem of Palestine was not a merely Palestinian question but  rather "an ideological issue for the whole Islamic ummah".    He called on world Muslims to actively take part in the Qods  day rally which is staged worldwide on the last Friday of the  fasting month of Ramadan. "Our message to other Muslims and  other Islamic states is that they should take to the streets and  express their indignation against the recent crime of the  Zionist regime at the Ibrahim (peace be upon him) mosque in the  town of Hebron".    Referring to the crime of Zionists against a group of  Palestinian worshippers, he said the event must have cleared it  for world Muslims that if they took a step back, the occupiers  would be encouraged to continue their crimes.    The Gaza-Jericho accord made Israel so impudent that it  embarked on letting the blood of the children of Islam in the  fasting month of Ramadan.    "The fact that we can not come to terms with the United  States today is that the U.S. as the ring leader of the  hegemonic powers has the same nature that the Zionsits have,"  the speaker remakred.    The United Nations and the Security Council and the  so-called  advocates of human rights who interfere in the internal affirs  of other countries under any pretexts, have kept silent on the  massacre of Palestinians in al-Khalil, he regretted.    He said that without a unified and all-out movement on the  part of world Muslims the "cancerous tumor" (Israel) cannot be  removed from the heart of Palestine. The Muslim people of  Palestine should get rid of the Zionists, he stressed.</p>

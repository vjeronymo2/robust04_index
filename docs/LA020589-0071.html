			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'STANDING FIRM ON MEDICARE'  </P> <P> We hope congressional leaders do stand firm on the Medicare expansion laws.  </P> <P> We cannot understand the blindness of our fellow-Medicare recipients. The  additional services, added to the comparatively generous Medicare coverage,  should be financed by the beneficiaries themselves. And this is being handled  in an equitable manner based on ability to pay, and will not unfairly burden  the indigent.  </P> <P> If these dissenters would stop and compare costs of the new law against prior  Medicare coverage along with private supplementary insurance, or even the total  private medical insurance without Medicare, they would realize what a bargain  this plan is.  </P> <P> In addition, we hope that the American Assn. of Retired Persons, who initially  instigated this legislation, does not back down because of the yammering of  some malcontents who demand too large a slice of the shrinking American  economic pie.  </P> <P> FRED and LOUISE HAUTER  </P> <P> La Canada  </P></p>

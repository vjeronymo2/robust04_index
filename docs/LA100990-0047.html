He will flanked by Larry Maxey and Kipp Jeffries. Receiver  Merton Harris had been a member of the kickoff return team.  </P> <P> Aztec notes: Running back Tommy Booker, who has missed the last three games  with an ankle injury, ran well in practice and should play Saturday at UCLA.  Luginbill said he is still not sure who will start at running back: Booker,  T.C. Wright, Maxey or Curtis Butts. DAVE McKIBBEN  </P></p>

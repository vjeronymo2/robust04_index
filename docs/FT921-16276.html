			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Gunmen open fire on Tbilisi demonstrators MASKED gunmen from a Georgian opposition group opened fire with automatic rifles on an unarmed crowd demonstrating in support of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia in Tbilisi yesterday, killing at least two people and wounding 27. Two of the gunmen were captured by demonstrators and one was beaten to death. The armed attack triggered fierce fighting in the centre of the capital after nightfall, and there were fears that Georgia might be edging towards civil war. At least 73 people have been killed, and about 400 injured, since the latest round of fighting broke out on December 22. Earlier, Mr Gamsakhurdia, who has been besieged in a bunker beneath the Georgian parliament for 13 days by opposition forces denouncing him as a dictator and demanding his resignation, made repeated broadcasts to the nation by short-wave radio. Mr Gamsakhurdia, a nationalist and former anti-Soviet dissident who was elected as Georgia's leader by a landslide in January last year, called for a general strike and campaign of civil disobedience against the opposition, which declared on Thursday that it was seizing power. Some reports said the president, who has been widely condemned for arrogant and divisive policies, also appealed to Georgian men aged between 20 and 45 to come to the capital and defend his government. Mr Gamsakhurdia was yesterday given until midnight last night by opposition leaders to resign or risk an all-out assault on the government building. But the president showed no sign of complying with the demand. Rumours and panic spread through Tbilisi after the shooting outside the Didube railway station in the city's eastern suburbs. More than 2,000 demonstrators had been listening to speeches and lighting candles in tribute to Mr Gamsakhurdia, in defiance of an opposition ban on public meetings. About 13 men, wearing black masks and armed with Kalashnikov rifles, arrived in three unmarked vehicles. The gunmen are believed to have been members of the Mkhedrioni, or Knights of Georgia, which describes itself as a patriotic group devoted to the defence of human rights and ethnic minorities, and is one of the largest groups in the loose opposition alliance. They first fired a volley of shots into the air, apparently Continued on Page 22 intending to frighten and disperse the demonstrators. However, when one section of the crowd started to move towards them, pelting them with rocks, the gunmen panicked. One group left by car as another fired a smoke bomb and, when the demonstrators continued to advance, opened fire into the crowd with their automatic weapons. One of the captured gunmen was thrust into the back of a nearby minibus. However, the crowd continued to hurl stones at him inside the van and eventually he was dragged out through the broken windows. The incensed mob then beat him with their bare hands and trampled him underfoot until he was dead. A second gunman was severely beaten and carried away by a near-hysterical crowd chanting the name of the president. Yesterday's clash demonstrated both the strength of support that still exists for Mr Gamsakhurdia, and the potential for an escalation of the fighting that has raged in the city since December 22, when Mr Gamsakhurdia's forces opened fire on a group of opposition demonstrators. It was also a severe blow to the credibility of an opposition which claims to be fighting in the name of democracy. An opposition military council, headed by Mr Tengiz Kitovani, the commander of the rebel national guards and a former member of Mr Gamsakhurdia's government, and Mr Dzhava Iosseliani, leader of the Knights of Georgia, claims to be in control of the republic. It has appointed Mr Tengiz Sigua, the former prime minister who resigned from his post in August to become an opposition leader, as caretaker prime minister.

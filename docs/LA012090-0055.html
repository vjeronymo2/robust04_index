			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DORNAN COLUMN  </P> <P> The anti-Robert Dornan column (Opinion, Jan. 14) was classic name-calling by a  true liberal Washington carpetbagger meddling in Orange County politics.  </P> <P> Christopher Matthews knows all the pejoratives: "John Wayne politics of Orange  County," "most hawkish," "peripatetic ex-Los Angeles talk-show host,"  "arch-conservative" and, of course, "B-1 Bob."  </P> <P> But, for his darling Ron Kovic: "paralyzed war hero," "combat veteran,"  "someone who speaks in grand phrases" and "Marine sergeant who endured the  horror of Vietnam and the inhumanity of a V.A. hospital." Please, give us a  break!  </P> <P> Ron Kovic is the perfect choice for a Democratic Party now dominated by every  manner of crazy on the left fringe of America: a disturbed Viet vet backed by  Hollywood. I can't wait for the inevitable Jane Fonda fund-raisers!  </P> <P> MICHAEL V. STRATTON  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

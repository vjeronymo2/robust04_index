			<p>BFN     [Text] Taysir al-Himsi, secretary of the Supreme Command  of the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, yesterday held a  press conference at his party's headquarters to announce the  resolutions of the party's second congress, which was held  recently, and the outcome of the elections to the party's  leadership.    Al-Himsi stressed that the congress discussed a number of  important issues on the local, Arab, and international levels  and determined its view over these issues in accordance with the  party's pan-Arab principles and firm position on the central  causes of the Arab nation. The party, he said, emphasized the  need for pan-Arab solutions to any regional issue since  solutions to any regional political or economic issues will be  incomplete if not discussed and addressed within the framework  of the comprehensive Arab solution.    Al-Himsi said the congress urged all Arab and world  organizations and parliaments to act to lift the unjust blockade  imposed on Iraq and stop the bloodshed in fraternal Yemen on the  basis of preserving its unity and fighting any secessionist  trend regardless of any motives and reasons.    He added that the congress also reviewed the settlement  plans  proposed to liquidate the Palestine question, including the  Gaza-Jericho First plan, the Majdal Shams First plan, and the  Jordanian-Israeli agenda. The congress reaffirmed the party's  rejection of the capitulationist trend represented in the Madrid  and Oslo process and underlined the Ba'th Party's position,  which states that the Palestine question is the Arabs' central  cause and no one has the right to a unilateral decision over it.  The congress further noted that the proposed liquidationist  plans target the Arab identity and serve as an instrument for  the attainment of the Zionist dreams.    He said the congress also stressed the importance of  activating and entrenching the democracy process in Jordan as an  irrevocable alternative and the need to allow all political  forums -- including parties, organizations, and professional  associations -- the opportunity to participate in the  decisionmaking in order to activate and entrench popular  participation. The congress also stressed the need to provide  opportunities for others to express their opinion in order to  strengthen the concept of pluralism and freedom. This, the  congress says, requires the provision of further freedoms for  the party newspapers since they represent the views of the  opposition political forces whose presence provides a safety  valve in any multi-party democratic march.    At the conclusion of his press conference, al-Himsi declared  the names of the members of the party's supreme command who were  elected by the congress, These are: Taysir al-Himsi, Adam  al-'Abdallat, Ahmad al-Mitliq, Jamal al-Rahaminah, 'Abd-al-Majid  al-Qarari'ah, Sulayman Abu-'Adilah, 'Ayid 'Amayirah, Ahmad  Irshayd, Akram al- Himsi, Muhammad al-Dakhlallah, and Akram  al-Nimri. Three reserve members were also elected. These are:  Samu'il Fakhuri, Khalid al-'Arif, and Faruq al-Za'n.</p>

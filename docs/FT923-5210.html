			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar at new historic low THE DOLLAR slipped to eclipse a recent historic low against the D-Mark in late European trading yesterday, worsening tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. After closing at DM1.4028 in New York on Monday night, the US currency gradually declined in European trading to test the record low of DM1.3940 set last Tuesday. In the European afternoon, the currency bottomed out at DM1.3895 and closed in London at DM1.3935, nearly a pfennig down on the day. In New York the dollar fell further to finish at DM1.3900. Again, the pressure on the dollar had little to do with speculation by interbank traders. It was the result of steady selling in a thinly traded market by institutional investors, who are concerned by the big difference between German and US interest rates. The US Federal Reserve and European central banks were either unable or unwilling to stem the tide. As the dollar tested the old low, there were rumours in the Frankfurt market of Fed intervention, which temporarily pushed the dollar up by nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs. But dealers said the market was still not short of dollars and that if intervention had been considered it would have been unlikely to work. Yesterday's August index from the US National Association of Purchasing Managers was slightly softer than expected at 53.7 per cent, compared to 54.2 per cent in July, and also triggered some selling of the dollar. According to Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London, yesterday's report damped hopes of a good figure in this Friday's non-farm payroll report for August, which influences the market more than most other US indicators. 'The implications are that, at best, we will still see an underlying increase in unemployment this Friday,' he said. The dollar could well test new lows this week. Mr Hawkins said that if it opens below DM1.40 in London today, it will be on a downward path to DM1.35. A technical analyst at Deutsche Bank was looking for the dollar to reach a target of DM1.35 based on technical analysis. 'If we break DM1.3460, it could go as low as DM1.29,' he added. The dollar's weakness kept sterling close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark as investors exchanged dollars for the German currency. At one stage, the pound was seen to be trading at DM2.7830, its lowest since Britain joined the ERM in October 1990. Further pressure on sterling came at the official close of ERM trading at 4pm in London and the Bank of England was under no formal obligation to intervene to support the currency. The pound closed nearly  1/2 pfennig down at DM2.7825.</p>

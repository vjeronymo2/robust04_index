			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Brazil buys British warships Brazil's navy is to buy seven warships from Britain for about Pounds 100m in the second large arms deal between the two countries this year. Brazil is buying four type 22 frigates and three river class minesweepers which the British navy put up for sale earlier this year. The frigates, built between 1976 and 1980, are no longer needed following the post-cold war fleet reduction. In January Westland, the UK helicopter maker, won a Pounds 150m order for nine Super Lynx helicopters from the Brazilian navy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero from the "ACIR Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Excerpts] The timetable and responsibilities of each  government entity to implement the agreements reached during the  peace talks held in Chiapas State were established today,  Friday, at the official Los Pinos residence. President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari and Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for  peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, read each one of the 32  resolutions of the San Cristobal table. Plainly speaking, the  work was parceled out, Camacho Solis explained at an interview  held after he left this meeting, which was also attended by  secretaries of education, health, agriculture and hydraulic  resources, social development, government, and finance and  public credit. As Camacho reported it, the president has given  instructions that the agreements made by the government in this  pacification process be faithfully complied with. This private  meeting lasted approximately two and one-half hours. The  secretaries left Los Pinos one by one, but did not make any  statements. Camacho drove out and got out of his car, which was  surrounded by about 50 reporters, photographers, and cameramen  who were waiting for him to explain what had happened at the  meeting. [passage omitted]    He also made a very interesting comment when asked how the  negotiation problem was going; he said one must not look at this  matter as a problem. Let us listen to his answer to this  question.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] This is not a negotiation  problem because we are not even talking of negotiation. We are  talking about a dialogue. This is something I would like to tell  you and the citizens of Mexicans, through you. Instead of  regarding this as a problem, let us look at it as an occasion to  provide better political, economic, and social solutions to a  reality as complex as Chiapas. The more we have of this....  [pauses] The better we keep our commitments and the greater our  seriousness is during the whole process, the more positive it  will be. This is not a problem of giving and taking. This is a  problem of raising to the social and political circumstances and  of clearly understanding that some things need a different  approach. Therefore, we are not talking about money but of  reforms, institutional changes, coordination, and most of all, a  republican attitude, which entails two things, namely,  acknowledging problems and meeting with the people so we can  provide government solutions based on that reality. [end  recording] [passage omitted]    I think the interview was interesting. He was very  courteous,  as always. He tried to answer all the questions. Of course, some  [pause] He noted: I have been asked, through different means,  what my political future will be, but I will not speak of  politics now, nor will I speak of my aspirations or personal  life. I have a major responsibility.    To conclude, he has always been willing to answer the  reporters' questions. He was that way today. He also indicated  there had been false reports that Article 27 of the Constitution  would be amended. He affirmed that this Article will not be  amended. He mentioned two points that were discussed with the  Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. One has to do with the  possibility of submitting a bill on Indian communities rights,  which will touch on some aspects dealing with land. The other is  the possibility of enacting an agrarian justice law. This would  be a state law based on Article 27, which is in force. During  talks with the EZLN, there was no mention of amending this  article, as some news media have reported.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today the Saeima resolved to put aside discussion of  the bill from the faction For the Fatherland and Freedom (?owing  to its content). This bill entails not giving authority to the  Latvian delegation to sign agreements which allow the operation  of the Skrunda Radar station after 31 August this year. As  Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs said in the debate, because of  the secrecy and importance of the information, he could not  refute the opposition's arguments in an open plenary session of  the Saeima. Andrejevs emphasized that the government does not  doubt that the further operation of Skrunda radar does not  correspond to Latvia's interests, but the real political  situation does not allow the government not to sign the  agreement on the radar's operations for another five and a half  years.</p>

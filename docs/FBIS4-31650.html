			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Perica Vucinic: "On the Scene: Kosovo Canards"] </F>   [Text] The Albanian businessman pays taxes to two  states, in general he is a merchant or manufacturer and has more  money, while the Serb businessman is most often an intermediary  between the Albanians and the state, for which he takes a  commission.    After the blanket assessments to the effect that the crisis  of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia began in Kosovo  with the conflict between Kosovo Albanians and the Yugoslav  authorities and that it will also end there, the political  prognosis according to which "Kosovo's turn is coming up" is  becoming increasingly widespread. This latter notion is  convincing, if for no other reason because of the passage of  time and the weight and ripeness of the problem. The fact that  the time to solve the problem of the southern Serbian province  is coming up is indicated by the visit to Belgrade and Pristina  arranged by Douglas Hogg, British secretary of state for foreign  affairs, on 5 and 6 May. The British diplomat departed.  Speculation by commentators, based primarily on his comment that  Albanians must be given broad autonomy within the framework of  Serbia, has already run full course. Hogg's visit also served as  an agent for circulating "information" about how negotiating  teams of the Serbian authorities and of the Kosovo Albanians  have already been formed. This "information" is refuted by the  very "composition" of the negotiating teams, which contain, for  example, the deputy prime minister of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, Zeljko Simic, and the chairman of the Democratic  Party of Serbia (DSS), Vojislav Kostunica, who cannot reconcile  himself with the authorities.    Reports on the negotiators presented by Radio Cologne and  the  Pristina Albanian-language weekly KOHA, which were also carried  by Belgrade media, are classic "canards" from a journalistic  viewpoint. Their motivation, however, is purely political in  nature and contains the message that it is time to move beyond  the deadlock once and for all.    This is because after Hogg's visit, which provoked a bit of  political agitation, Kosovo is returning to its prior state,  which means that the unrecognized, self-proclaimed republic of  Kosovo--recognized only by Albania--and the Republic of Serbia  are functioning in parallel in the same territory. Moreover,  both of them are trying to assert their rights and avoid  obligations if they can. The Serbian state has imposed its  police structure and left it up to the Albanians to organize  autonomous education, culture and sports, social and  administrative institutions, and even autonomous tax  authorities, but without neglecting to collect the taxes owed to  it. The Albanians, although they ignore Serbian administration  wherever they can, do not refuse rights to health care and  hospital treatment. In the area of national defense, it appears  that a tacit agreement has been reached--the Albanians do not  join the armed forces of the country that they do not regard as  their own, while the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia (VJ) does not  need disloyal guardians of territory. That is how two national  communities live in parallel in Kosovo. Now and then, they meet  only in the area of business interests. And thanks to those  interests, at the "Businessmen's Club" in Pristina one can learn  from the conversation of a pair of new businessmen, newly rich  Serbs and Albanians, that they are fascinated with the flights  of "various airplanes and DC 9's and DC 10's" and that in such  airplanes "you do not even feel that you are being transported  and you can comfortably have drinks on them." They were on the  trail of material interest, and in so doing the Albanian is not  bothered by the fact that the "Businessmen's Club" is a Serb  bar, just as Serbs are not bothered by doing business in  Albanian bars. They differ in that the Albanian pays taxes to  two legal states, both the "Republic of Kosovo" and the Republic  of Serbia. But the Albanian has more money and is generally a  merchant or manufacturer, while the Serb, thanks to the absolute  domination of Serbs in the bureaucratic structure, is most often  an intermediary with the state, and if he holds a position, then  he is an intermediary with himself and takes a commission, or a  bribe.  <H5>  Adjustment in Process </H5>   In other fields, Kosovo's Serb and Albanian worlds seem  irreconcilable. In the Albanian pastry shop "Elida" and the Serb  cafe "Donatelo," establishments in the "Boro i Ramiz" sports  hall separated only by a corridor, these worlds, relaxing in  almost the same atmosphere, regard each other with indifference.  But that is a story that has already been told.    The two worlds of Kosovo live their lives in the political  cocoons of "the independent Republic of Kosovo" and "unified  Serbia." Postponing the political conflict, albeit only conflict  in the form of dialogue, gives rise to illusions, but also to  tension.    "This is the status quo, a balance of fear, a state of  neither war nor peace, and it will continue as long as it suits  both sides," says Skeljzen Malici, ex-politician and founder and  former chairman of the Social Democratic Party. Malici, who is  now a journalist, repeats the theory that the Kosovo war is  being waged in Bosnia, that the Serbs in Bosnia, "in fighting  for their own ethnic rights, are also fighting for the ethnic  rights of Albanians. Because if they had enough territorial  jurisdiction in Bosnia, perhaps Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic would agree to a formula of broad  autonomy--territorial, political, cultural--and that in practice  would lead to independence for Kosovo." The common platform of  all significant parties who captured seats in the parliament of  the "Republic of Kosovo," which has yet to constituted, is an  independent Kosovo, but it appears that a consensus has also  been reached on the view that such a thing is unrealistic for  now. Such a position can also be heard in the leading party of  Kosovo Albanians, the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo (DSK), which  received 76 percent of the votes in the Albanian-only elections  on 24 May 1991.    However, mention of the broad autonomy guaranteed to  Albanians under the 1974 SFRY Constitution is true heresy, and  immediately after the visit by the British Foreign Office  official with the leader of the Kosovo Albanians, Ibrahim  Rugova, the DSK Information Center tried to relativize the clear  suggestion by the high-ranking guest that the solution for  Kosovo should be sought in autonomy on a wide scale and within  the framework of Serbia. Dr. Fehmi Agani, the vice chairman of  the DSK and Ibrahim Rugova's right-hand man, said in an  interview with VREME that the British diplomat is still in the  process of adjusting his views. However, there are still no  results of that adjustment. Another Albanian ex-politician,  Veton Suroi, the founder and former chairman of the  Parliamentary Party and now publisher of the weekly KOHA,  rejects the solution in the 1974 Constitution, but for entirely  different reasons. "We have gone beyond 1974 and must be more  creative than Kardelj," Suroi says succinctly.    The definition of Kosovo under the Constitution of 20 years  ago as a point of conflict, but also of encounter, between Serb  and Albanian interests is an unpleasant framework for talks for  the Serb side as well. The chairman of the provincial committee  of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Vojislav Zivkovic,  elaborates on the part according to which the province is  defined as an integral part of Serbia. "Kosovo is not an open  question; rather, the problem is how to persuade the Albanians  to sit down and talk. When Europe says, as Great Britain has  done, that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia, I am convinced  that the majority of Albanians will ultimately accept that,"  says Zivkovic.    The problem with Serb politicians--as indeed with Albanian  ones if they are in positions of power--is that their  authorities are very minimal, so that the political discourse is  reduced to the well-known approach of justifying the national  strategies contained in political slogans. With the prefix "ex"  they are authentic, but they exert no great amount of political  influence.    Momcilo Trajkovic, the former deputy prime minister of  Kosovo  and then the SPS deputy heading the departmental group on  solving Kosovo's problems, and then a renegade from the party  and founder of the Social Democratic Party, will say, not  without cynicism, that he "cannot believe that Serbian President  Milosevic declared that `there is no problem' with giving  autonomy to the Albanians." "Milosevic has no right to say such  a thing, and I really doubt that he could have said that  publicly. That would have meant the beginning of the end of his  authority, which is in fact based on Kosmet [Kosovo and  Metohija]," says Trajkovic. He believes that the Albanians'  contribution to solving the Kosovo problem is to publicly  renounce pretensions to a Kosovo republic, while the Serbs  should recognize that Albanians "are here in real numbers, in  order to create the trust necessary to live together and permit  talks on the organization of that life."  <H5>  Serb Differences </H5>   In the last election campaign, Trajkovic ran under the  slogan  "Vote for the ones who have linked their destiny to Kosovo and  Metohija" and lost. The former SPS figure and subsequent social  democrat has now linked his destiny to the "Ratar" collective  farm in Laplje Selo, where he is director, and it could be said  that this latest role suits him. With pride he emphasizes that  all 1,100 hectares of the farm have been planted, saying: "That  is how to fight for Serb land in Kosovo."    Reflecting on the times to come, Trajkovic says that Serbia  has done nothing in this interregnum to keep the Serbs from  being outvoted again. He regards the civic state as a solution;  however, in order to achieve that, the national state model must  be given "free rein." He concludes that this is a process.    The political biography of the current director of the  "Ratar" collective is somewhat characteristic of the present-day  Serb divisions in Kosovo. Trajkovic, who began his political  career in the 1980's by standing up against the "autonomist  policy" of the (Serb) Kosovo government, is accused of being an  autonomist. He responds in kind, reminding the current holders  of power where they were and whom they supported 10 years ago.  Thus, the Serb political scene in the province is divided into  two types of autonomists, which leads us to the current Serb  division into "newcomers" and "old-timers," whereby the  "Trajkovic school of politics" corresponds to the old-timers.  According to this terminology, the current okrug government is  in the hands of the newcomers.    Although it is impossible to strictly categorize the types  of  political thought, it is indeed possible to establish a  fundamental difference. The group designated "old-timers"  supports a practical policy that would integrate Albanians into  the structures of provincial government. "They must be given  something, because they make up 90 percent of the population  here. They will participate in government sooner or later, and  for that reason there must be a mechanism to keep the Serbs from  being outvoted," is the private reflection of one Kosovo  politician, a member of the ruling Serb party. His name remains  "underground," as does the reflection through which he risks  being labeled an "autonomist," i.e., "old-timer."    In the Albanian political bloc there is discord not  concerning goals, but rather concerning strategy. No one  questions Dr. Ibrahim Rugova's authority, and the strength and  influence of his DSK are not questioned either, but there is  criticism of his monopoly on power, the attitude of some  important Albanian intellectuals outside the party, and the  politically passive approach. The most vocal critics are  academician Redzep Cosja, an ideologist of the Albanian national  question, and Adem Demaci, chairman of the Forum for Human  Rights, political dissident and longtime political prisoner, and  publisher of the journal FORUM. Demaci is known as a person  ready to make political concessions, but also as a harsh critic  of the DSK and its structures for their lack of resolve in  defending the achieved Albanian institutions that the  authorities have abolished: the Albanological Institute, the  Kosovo Academy of Science and Art, and Albanian-language  newspapers and journals. During Douglas Hogg's visit, Adem  Demaci was in Italy, from where he sent word via Television  Tirana that Kosovo is relying too much on the foreign element  and that it is the duty of "those concerned with politics to  seek out and search for various ways to solve the problem. It is  not enough to say that our option is this and that, and thus to  stand and watch.... I think we have had more than enough of  Albanians talking among themselves. It is very necessary that  Albanians in fact speak with Serbia, because like it or not,  Serbia is a factor with which we must reckon, with which we must  come to terms," Demaci said.  <H5>  "Honorable Solution" </H5>   At the DSK congress that will almost certainly be held in  late May or early June after several months of postponement, no  spectacular changes in the party--and thus in Albanian policy as  well--are expected. Almost no attention was given to the report  from Tirana that Dr. Ibrahim Rugova and his host, Albanian  President Sali Berisha, expressed their support for mediation of  the Serbo-Albanian dispute by a third party. That report casts  something of a shadow of legitimacy over the maximalist goal of  a Kosovo republic. It also holds out the promise that the  Albanian side has something to offer other than political  maximalism, which "is not realistically feasible at this  moment." In the trench warfare--fortunately, only of political  options--between an independent Kosovo and a Serbia "that will  be unified or will not exist at all," it seems that the real  moment is raising an almost purely terminological problem: In  what sort of lexical foil should concessions be wrapped while  still emerging as virtuous before voters who have been promised  the much-repeated slogans in this article.    The chairman of the Kosovo Helsinki Committee for Human  Rights, Dr. Gazmend Pulja, proposes a federal republic of Kosovo  within Yugoslavia as an "honorable solution" that would not  threaten the territorial integrity of the FRY and that would  allow the Serbs to preserve their political and practical  interests. "It is not natural to aspire to a lower level of  constitutional structure. Kosovo was a constituent unit of the  federation, and the international community cannot accept a  curtailment of the rights of 2 million Albanians when 500,000  Montenegrins have a republic," Pulja explains.    Naturally, the shadow of possible war always hangs over  Kosovo, but nevertheless it is increasingly pallid. Partially  because many, such as Skeljzen Malici, feel that the war option  was used up in Croatia and then in Bosnia, partially because the  prevalent opinion is that Serbia is not capable of waging war on  several fronts, that its wartime ambitions have been exhausted,  especially under strong surveillance by the international  community, and, among other things, because no one is ready to  risk a war that would inevitably spread to the entire Balkan  peninsula. In this sense, the possibility of partitioning Kosovo  is considered completely superficially to be, by necessity, a  war option. Malici thinks that in that case there would clearly  be war as an alibi for demarcation. "The Serbs and Albanians  could not do that on their own, without international  mediation." Skeljzen Malici illustrates the unconvincing nature  of the war option by pointing to the military weakness of  Albania, as well as the unwillingness of the United States of  America to support its militarily weak ally.    Besides the parallel system and parallel life, all in the  same territory, the Serbs and Albanians are also demonstrating a  common infirmity and inability to sit down at the negotiating  table without international mediation. Naturally, this third  party would also have to bear responsibility for the results of  any concessions, because their political figures are not willing  to do so.    Nevertheless, something is changing in Kosovo. Fields left  uncultivated for decades are now greener than they have ever  been. The "ordinary" Albanians and Serbs regard this land that  they are working as their own, and there are no problems  whatsoever here; such problems invariably arise when the  question of who land in Kosovo belongs to is shifted to the  level of politics. Problems also emerge when the state raises an  issue like land redistribution, which is already very delicate,  because in Kosovo each normal issue has specific Kosovo  deviations.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Study sets out model scheme to close gap THE pharmaceutical companies' study sets out the features of a healthcare system that could use competitive market forces to close the gap between demand for health services and the funds available to pay for them. They describe this model (see picture on left)as a prototype, which countries seeking to reform their health systems could work towards. At its heart is a basic package of health services, available to all regardless of ability to pay. Every citizen would be required to sign up for healthcare insurance from competing insurers. To stop insurers from selecting only the healthiest customers, they would have to accept all applicants. Each individual would pay a two-part health insurance premium. The first, related to income, would go into a central 'risk adjustment' fund, and redistributed to insurers, with more going to those with most unhealthy members. The other part would be paid directly to the insurer by the member, as a sort of membership fee. Insurers would be allowed to set their own premium rates for the basic package, so the more efficient would be able to undercut their rivals. The insurers would buy the services from competing healthcare providers such as hospitals, doctors and pharmacists.</p>

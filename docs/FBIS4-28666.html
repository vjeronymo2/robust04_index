			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa was reelected as chief of the Japan New Party  (JNP) on Saturday [11 June] and urged the party to be ready to  dissolve itself for the sake of political reconfiguration and  reform.    Addressing the JNP's national convention, Hosokawa said the  party should "play a pioneering role in the second stage of  political realignment even with a resolution to dissolve the  party for the sake of reform."    Hosokawa also vowed the party's utmost efforts to bring the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) back to the ruling coalition as  part of efforts to jointly tackle a number of issues of  immediate concern.    "If the SDP decides to join hands with us, we will not spare  any effort to lay the groundwork for its return to the  coalition," said Hosokawa, who resigned the premiership in April  to take the blame for his alleged financial improprieties.    The national gathering, the first since the JNP set up shop  in May 1992, brought together over 70 members of both houses of  the Diet and representatives from local chapters of the party.    At the convention, the JNP approved its action plan for 1994  in which the party promised to seek the dissolution of the  parliamentary group Kaishin, of which the JNP is a member, while  groping for a strong political power base with other parties.    The SDP, now the second-largest opposition force, walked out  of the coalition in April in protest against the formation of  Kaishin by other coalition partners without the SDP. The SDP's  departure forced Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to form the first  minority government since 1955.    The JNP also approved the new leadership under Hosokawa.  Satsuki Eda, former leader of the United Social Democratic  Party, a minor political force that disbanded in May, and Yuriko  Koike were elected the party's deputies, while Masuo Matsuoka  was retained as representative secretary general.    At a news conference held after the party meeting, Hosokawa  spoke of the need for coalition parties to take a united front  in achieving administrative and economic reforms by setting  aside key policy differences.    "We are now in a state of emergency," he said. "We must ride  out the stormy weather at sea."    Hosokawa expressed hope the Diet testimony by his former  aide  Masatoshi Miyama will help dispel allegations that he received  100 million yen in illegal donations from a scandal-tainted  trucking firm. Hosokawa says the money was a loan he repaid  later.    He also said he will testify before the Diet himself if the  legislature decides to summon him as a sworn witness.    Miyama is to testify under oath on the money scandal at the  House of Representatives budget committee on Wednesday.    Hosokawa has repeatedly denied charges that the money was an  illicit political contribution, saying he accepted the 100  million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin group in 1982 and had repaid  it with interest by 1991.</p>

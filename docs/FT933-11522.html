			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Lenders seize fewer homes THE NUMBER of homes repossessed by mortgage lenders has fallen for the third consecutive six-month period. However, the number of households with arrears of 12 months or more has increased from 147,040 in the second half of last year to 158,000 in the first half of this year. Figures issued yesterday by the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed a fall of 11 per cent in repossessions in the first half of this year to 31,780, compared with 35,750 for the same period last year. The total number of repossessions last year was 68,540, down from the 1991 peak of 75,540. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the council, attributed the fall to cuts in interest rates and to economic recovery, which he said had contributed to a reversal in the upward trend in unemployment. He also said that the government's decision to pay income support for mortgage interest direct to lenders had contributed to the improvement. Mr Coles added: 'The worst of the arrears and possessions problem now appears to be over.' But he warned that 'it would be unrealistic to expect a rapid reduction in the figures over the next few months'. He added that there was 'no euphoria' on the part of lenders, who recognised that 'there is still an important problem out there'. In the first half of this year there were 349,560 households in arrears of six months or more. That figure is down fractionally on the 352,050 in the last half of 1992, but up on the first half of 1992, when the figure was 305,140. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at UBS, said he had cut 5,000 off his forecast for the total number of repossessions for the year, to 65,000, but said he expected repossessions to average 60,000 to 65,000 for up to three years because of the large number of households in mortgage arrears. Mortgage lenders held 54,330 unsold repossessed properties at the end of June against 64,970 last December. Separate figures released yesterday by the Lord Chancellor's Office for court orders to repossess properties confirmed that there were 53,436 court orders for repossession in the first half of this year - down 22 per cent from 68,638 in the same period last year.</p>

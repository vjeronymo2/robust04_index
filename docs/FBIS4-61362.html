			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 26, RIA -- The Russian Federation will  pursue a policy of protecting and supporting Russians on the  territory of the former USSR by carrying out a package of state  programmes, which stipulate political, diplomatic, information,  economic, social and cultural measures. This was stressed at a  conference in Moscow, organised by the Commission on  Citizenship, attached to the president, and the Russian Foreign  Ministry.    The report of the committee chairman Abdullah Mikitayev says  that special attention will be paid to the situation of ethnic  Russians in Latvia and Estonia, many of whom have been denied  citizenship. He said that he advocates the granting of the  Russian citizenship to them, if they want it, and stressed that  the settlement of the problem of ethnic Russians in ex-soviet  states as soon as possible meets the interests of both Russia  and newly-independent states.</p>

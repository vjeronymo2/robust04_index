			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Striving for stability through supervision THE BANK of England's powers are greatest in two areas which normally attract very little public interest - and about which Mr Eddie George talked only in passing yesterday. These two areas are defined in the Bank's statement of principles as: Preserving the stability of the banking system through the work of the Bank's supervisory division operating under the 1987 Banking Act; Encouraging the competitiveness and efficiency of markets in the City of London. There has been a widespread debate in the City and in Westminster recently about whether it is appropriate for the Bank to retain these roles. The Bank's effectiveness as a supervisor has been called into doubt by criticism of its performance in monitoring the activities of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt international bank which was closed in 1991. Lord Bingham's report said the Bank should have been more aggressive and methodical. In response the Bank has set up a specialist investigations unit and a legal unit within the supervision department, both headed by outsiders. Mr George has never worked in the supervision department and therefore escaped criticism in the Bingham report. He said yesterday that for now he perceived there was a strong case for retaining the supervisory functions within the Bank. However, his replacement as deputy, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, argued forcefully in a recent Economist editorial that the supervision department should be separated from the Bank. Some bankers believe that if the supervision department were separated from the Bank, it might adopt a tougher approach to the banks it regulates. They also say there is an argument for streamlining the supervision of banks with the supervision of other financial institutions, now carried out by the Securities and Investments Board and several self-regulatory organisations whose functions are under review by Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman. There have also been concerns among some bankers and regulators that the Bank is often reluctant to take punitive action against leading City institutions for fear of damaging the City's reputation. They have argued that the Bank's effectiveness as a supervisor is reduced by its allegedly conflicting goal of promoting the efficiency of London markets. Critics feel there is only a fine line between encouraging the efficiency and effectiveness of markets on the one hand and acting as a sponsor of the City as a place to do business. In practice, the governor has often played a public relations role on behalf of the City. Mr Leigh-Pemberton has for example campaigned vigorously for any future European Central Bank to be located in London. Mr Pennant-Rea's chief argument for separating the supervisory department is that the bank would suffer from a severe conflict of interest if it were given independent powers to set interest rates. The argument is that a central bank's responsibility for ensuring the soundness of banks might deter it from raising interest rates to combat inflationary pressures, if it feared doing so would damage commercial banks. However, most Bank executives are convinced that such a conflict is most unlikely in practice. On the other hand, Mr Pennant-Rea points out that most independent central banks, such as Germany's Bundesbank, do not have direct responsibility for the supervision of banks. He believes a narrowly focused central bank is a more efficient central bank.</p>

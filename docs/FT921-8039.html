			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Howard Pounds 211,000 in the red Continuing depressed conditions in the construction industry, with particular reference to housebuilding and plant hire, led to Howard Holdings turning in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 211,000 for the half year to October 31. That came from turnover of Pounds 2.71m and compared with a profit of Pounds 155,000 on sales of Pounds 3.94m last time. The success in reducing borrowings was reflected in interest charges down from Pounds 504,000 to Pounds 271,000. Losses per share were 0.69p (earnings 0.4p).</p>

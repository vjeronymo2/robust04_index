			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Heineken gives profits warning HEINEKEN, Europe's largest brewer, cautioned investors yesterday against excessive expectations for short-term profits, but said it remained confident about the outlook for long-term profitability. The statement sparked a 3.1 per cent decline in Heineken's shares, which have hit a series of record highs recently to become one of the Amsterdam stock exchange's top performers over the past 12 months. They closed down Fl 16.10 at Fl 190.90 yesterday. Mr Gerard van Schaik, chairman, said at the annual report presentation that the company's short-term caution reflected sluggish economic growth in Europe - where Heineken generates 75 per cent of sales - as well as higher duties on alcohol in a number of European countries, both of which could exert pressure on major beer markets. Its second most important market, the US, appears to be developing favourably, though alcohol duties may also be set to rise. 'However, our company has strong brands and sufficient financial strength to see it through a period which may be less favourable economically,' Mr van Schaik said. 'Our expectations for long-term profitability remain positive,' he added. Last month, Heineken reported a 12.9 per cent rise in 1992 net profit to Fl 463m. If extraordinary gains from a property sale are included, the improvement was even more marked, with net profit up 27.4 per cent at Fl 564m. Mr van Schaik added that Heineken's volume sales rose by 2.3 per cent in 1992 to 53.7m hectolitres, a performance which he said none of its international competitors had been able to match.</p>

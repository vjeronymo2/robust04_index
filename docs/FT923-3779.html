			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Organic growth lifts Avonmore to IPounds 9.63m Avonmore Foods, the Kilkenny-based dairy foods company, reported profits of IPounds 9.63m (Pounds 9.14m) pre-tax for the half-year to July 4 1992. The increase from the comparable IPounds 6.62m was achieved on turnover of IPounds 335m (IPounds 293.5m). Mr John Duggan, chairman, said the increases 'in difficult markets' reflected organic growth in the company's international division and 'significant developments' in its meat division. The pre-tax line also benefited from a reduced interest charge following the IPounds 31.8m raised in an open offer last November. Earnings per share emerged at 4.74p (4.3p) and the interim dividend per 'A' share goes up from 1.35p to 1.45p.</p>

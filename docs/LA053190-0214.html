			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL / TOURISM;  </P> <P> CARL'S JR. REPLACES OLD GLORY DECALS WITH A FLAGPOLE AND THE REAL THING  </P> <P> Carl Karcher Enterprises is a company known for wearing its patriotism on its  sleeve -- or at least its windows.  </P> <P> For years, the company has stuck large decals of Old Glory on the front windows  of its Carl's Jr. restaurants.  </P> <P> And now, the stickers have all but disappeared.  </P> <P> A sign of flagging interest in the American dream? Hardly.  </P> <P> The Anaheim-based chain has installed a flagpole at 349 of its older locations  in Southern California. Now it has begun making the same improvement at 60  restaurants in Northern California, said Patricia Parks, a company spokeswoman.  Each will fly two flags from its new pole.  </P> <P> "It's the American flag on top and Carl's flag below," Parks said, adding that  the company has always strived to show its support for the free enterprise  system.  </P> <P> The flag-waving spirit at Carl's goes beyond just the flagpoles. The company  still opens its annual shareholders meeting with a recitation of the Pledge of  Allegiance, Parks added.  </P></p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early share gains wiped out in nervous trade - Market Report The shadow of the US securities markets fell across London yesterday afternoon, when share gains achieved in the first half of the session were speedily eliminated. UK stocks came back sharply as Wall Street opened lower and bond markets showed nervousness while awaiting reports of a speech by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to bankers in California. Trading volume in equities was disappointing in a market now back to genuine investment activity after completion of tax year-end activity. However, many investment managers continued to concentrate on preparing reports for their trustees on fund performances over the first quarter of the year. The market opened slowly behind a stable trading day in New York and remained close to overnight levels following news of higher increases than expected in both industrial production and manufacturing output. However, initial firmness in UK government bonds helped the Footsie to move ahead by 12 points to 3,143.5. This early confidence vanished as soon as the New York markets opened. With the Dow Average down 14 points and US Federal bonds also lower in early trade, the gain on the Footsie was quickly replaced by a modest fall. Selling was light but buyers withdrew. At the close, the FT-SE Index was 2.5 off at 3,129, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index down 13.9 at 3,764.2. Total Seaq volume of 715.1m shares was down by nearly one quarter from the previous session. But on Wednesday, the first day of the new tax year in the UK, share volume was inflated by heavy tax-related trading. Stock Exchange statistics showed that Wednesday's equity business was worth Pounds 2bn in retail, or customer, worth; this puts the session among the most active, in terms of underlying customer business, of the past 12 months. Traders expressed disappointment with London's reaction to Wall Street, which was sharper than seen in other European markets. The session appeared to indicate that London is finding difficulty in de-coupling itself from worries about the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve. The rise of 0.8 per cent in domestic manufacturing output and of 0.6 per cent in manufacturing output last month, although taken quietly in equities, further challenged confidence in prospects for an early cut in domestic base rates and left UK stocks to react to easier trends in UK bonds later in the session. With the Bundesbank policy council not due to meet until next week, markets have little choice but to focus on the US Federal Reserve. Hence last evening's nervousness ahead of Mr Greenspan's speech in San Francisco. The final dip in the FT-SE Index was greater than appeared because the Index took in strong performances from the blue chip oil stocks as well as several other big names, including ICI and Reuters. The oil sector benefited from a welcome rally in crude oil prices and a very positive annual meeting of shareholders in British Petroleum. But utility stocks fell heavily as the market continued to look for strong dividend growth in the manufacturing sectors. Interest-related sectors also found themselves left on the shelf yesterday, reflecting doubts on base rate hopes and easier trends in some consumer stocks reflected disappointment with the progress of high street spending.</p>

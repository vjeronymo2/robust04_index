			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> A Havel Renaissance: In Britain, interest in the work of Czech  playwright-turned-president Vaclav Havel has taken a dramatic upswing. Saturday  night the BBC is airing "Sorry," the television film based on Havel's stage  play, that stars Michael Crawford and was last broadcast in London in 1978.  Havel's London-based literary agent said there have been at least 20 requests  in the last month from people throughout the United Kingdom for the work of  Havel, Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist president in 41 years. Next  September, his play "Redevelopment" will be staged in Manchester at the Royal  Exchange, a major regional theater. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> P.V. GIRLS WIN CROSS-COUNTRY TITLE  </P> <P> Winning the CIF State Division I cross-country title should be old hat for  Palos Verdes High Coach Joe Kelly by now, but his latest crown could be the  most satisfying.  </P> <P> "This is without a doubt the best I've ever seen a Palos Verdes girls team  run," Kelly said.  </P> <P> The Sea King girls exploited their closely bunched running to nip favored  Agoura by seven points, 68-75, and capture the school's third consecutive state  team title Saturday at Woodward Park.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes placed five runners in the top 20 of the team competition to  offset the championship run of Agoura's Deena Drossin who won the individual  title in 17 minutes, 27 seconds on the hilly, 5,000 meter course.  </P> <P> In the Division I boys race, three South Bay runners placed in the top 12.  Torrance Junior Israel Pose finished eighth overall in 15:30, a personal best  for 5,000 meters.  </P> <P> Greg Gonzalez also contributed to this story.  </P></p>

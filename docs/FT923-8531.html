			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Romania confirms CIS contravention of embargo THE ROMANIAN government yesterday confirmed that 'tens of ships' displaying Commonwealth of Independent States' flags were passing up the Danube towards Serbia in apparent contravention of United Nations sanctions. However, Mr Traian Basescu, minister of transport, said Romania has no authority to stop vessels travelling on the Danube, even if there is strong evidence they are breaking the UN embargo on trade with the former Yugoslavia. 'Romania is in exactly the same position as the European Community in the Adriatic: we have no right to stop shipping in international waters.' Mr Basescu's comments follow reports that Romania has permitted sanctions-breaking and that the chief offenders are CIS-flagged ships embarking from Ukrainian ports. The Romanian port of Galati, last week recorded around one CIS vessel a day heading for the Serbian port of Pancevo, carrying cargoes of coal, metals, cars and spare parts. Romania, traditionally a Serbian ally, has consistently said it is respecting UN regulations. Both Mr Theodor Stolojan, the prime minister, and President Ion Iliescu have invited western observers to check Romania's compliance with the embargo, which they estimate will cost the country, up to USDollars 3bn this year. Western diplomats in Bucharest say they do not doubt the Romanian government's willingness to co-operate. Rather, they believe the country, which has a weak customs infrastructure, is incapable of policing adequately either its borders or the Danube. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, has written to Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, urging him to reconsider the issuing of a licence to a Marks and Spencer's supplier to import clothes from Serbia, write David Owen and John Thornhill. UN resolution 757, which was adopted on May 30 but did not come into force in the UK until June 5, prohibits the importation of goods from Serbia and Montenegro.</p>

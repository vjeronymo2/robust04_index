			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T breaks ties with De Benedetti One of the longest, but ultimately least fruitful, cross-border partnerships in high technology has been wound down after the sale by AT&amp;T of its remaining share in Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company. AT&amp;T has placed 54.75m Cir shares, representing 10.1 per cent of the ordinary share capital, with a group of unidentified financial intermediaries. The transaction, at L1,398 a share, followed a gradual reduction in its stake earlier this year. By late July, AT&amp;T informed Italy's stock market authorities it had sold about 7 per cent of its Cir stock. Yesterday's transaction was at a 5 per cent discount to the L1,477 closing price of Cir's ordinary shares on the Milan bourse on Tuesday, before Wednesday's national holiday, when the market was closed. As with the July transaction, the deal coincided with a period of relative strength for Cir stock, which has risen sharply from depressed levels in early 1993. AT&amp;T had for some time indicated it considered the Cir stake as a purely financial investment, with no industrial overtones. The biggest asset of Cir, in which the De Benedetti family is the main shareholder, is a large stake in Italy's loss-making Olivetti computers group. The sale eliminates the last link between AT&amp;T and companies associated with Mr De Benedetti after almost 10 years of high - and then unfulfilled - expectations. AT&amp;T first invested in Olivetti in April 1984, when it bought 100m ordinary shares, representing about 21.8 per cent of the group, for L430bn (Dollars 257.5m). Under the deal, AT&amp;T acquired almost 500,000 Olivetti personal computers during the mid-1980s, allowing the Italian company substantial economies of scale. The US presence also allowed Olivetti researchers access to AT&amp;T's famous Bell Laboratories, and reinforced the Italian group's financial standing. The advantages for AT&amp;T, which has taken a substantial loss on its investment, were always less obvious. One observer suggested yesterday the link gave the US company its first taste of international collaboration. It may even have helped to create the understanding of the computers industry that eventually led to AT&amp;T's acquisition of NCR. With hopes for a high-tech partnership between a US company - then exclusively in telecommunications - and Olivetti never reaching fruition, AT&amp;T in October 1989 swapped its Olivetti stock for 17.1 per cent of Cir. The investment has not been particularly successful in view of the recession and trading problems at Cir, which has been forced into loss owing to the difficulties at Olivetti. After indicating its desire to sell its shares, AT&amp;T reached agreement with Mr De Benedetti on a broad timetable for disposal until mid-1994. The sale should help Cir's share price by removing an element of uncertainty, in view of the publicity given to AT&amp;T plans to sell its stake. Investors may still be concerned, however, that the stake is being held by various brokers, pending a longer-term placing.</p>

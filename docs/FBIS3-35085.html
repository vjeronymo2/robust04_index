Deputy  Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin also told reporter David Essing  that Israel has decided not to participate in international  peacekeeping missions abroad.    [Begin recording] [Beilin] Our only decision is to take  part in humanitarian efforts in Angola. We are ready to do  that, and I will inform the UN secretary general about that  decision. Maybe later on, in due time, such a decision that you  are referring to will be taken, but time is not ripe now to take  it.    [Essing] What kind of participation will Israel be giving to  this Angolan project?    [Beilin] We are speaking about establishing and controlling  a hospital in Angola, sending doctors and some other medical  services to Angola, and to keep this hospital for a while.    [Essing] Any time frame for this? When will this be taking  place?    [Beilin] There are still many conditions, and the first one  is that there will be peace in Angola. This is far from being  the reality, and the fighting between Savimbi and Dos Santos in  Angola still takes place, so we cannot know exactly the timing  of such a decision, but it won't be tomorrow. [end recording]    In an address last night, Beilin said also that two  representatives of countries he declined to name recently  visited Israel seeking advice and training in the resolution of  disputes. He did not elaborate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Endean and Victor Smart: "Bold Berlusconi </F> Aims To Exploit His Euro Power"]    [Text] Rome -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi,  exultant after his massive re-endorsement in the Euro elections,  has begun a systematic campaign to assert his country's  influence in European Union [EU] policy-making.    Other European leaders are now acutely aware that not only  does Berlusconi have the freshest and most enthusiastic mandate  of any European leader, but that he may not abide by the  time-honoured rules of the old "European establishment."  Although he clearly intends to keep other heads of government  guessing about his true intentions, strong diplomatic signals  emerging from Rome indicate that Berlusconi will play his cards  ruthlessly in Italy's national interest.    Far from being able to write Berlusconi off as a  non-politician who may have only temporary support and some  uncomfortable neo-Fascist allies, Europe's established leaders  have suddenly recognised that the populist chord he has struck  may have implications for them as well. Most significant are  the overtures made by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to woo Berlusconi  into the political mainstream.    After a meeting in Bonn with Kohl scheduled on 15 June, the  tycoon-turned-politician can be confident that his maverick  party, born only a few months ago from a network of football fan  clubs, can count on a warm welcome into the political  establishment.    With 27 Euro seats, Berlusconi's Forza Italia would  constitute one of the most prominent national contingents within  the dominant right-wing grouping at Strasbourg, the European  People's Party (EPP). Traditionally this has been the home of  moderate Christian Democrat parties across Europe.    Senator Livio Caputo, Rome's deputy foreign minister, told  The European: "I know that Kohl is very keen on Forza Italia  entering the EPP. Berlusconi wants to adhere to the EPP to  maximise its power in Parliament, and so far we have received no  negative signals."    Berlusconi's men would outnumber the discredited Italian  Christian Democrats in the European Parliament by nearly three  to one. And they would help close the gap at Strasbourg between  the EPP and the Socialists, the largest single party.    Caputo explained: "With one-sixth of the Right's vote in  Strasbourg, we carry a certain weight. The latest election  result shows other governments and public opinion that  Berlusconi did not win by chance but thanks to exceptional  popular support. This will reinforce his position at next  week's Corfu summit."    Bringing Forza Italia in from the cold, however, will throw  up several obstacles. Certainly the biggest will be the  necessity to accommodate the Italian government's new, more  nationally assertive tone on European affairs. For many years  Italy has been an uncritical supporter of the ideal of a federal  Europe, inclined to press its own national interests within the  EU only weakly. But that is changing rapidly, with some top  ministers in Rome championing the EU predominantly as a  free-trade zone. Antonio Martino, the foreign affairs minister,  a founder member of the anti-federal Bruges Group, said  recently: "We want a new direction on Europe -- something more  market-oriented."    Since the EPP is an avowedly federalist party, to avoid  embarrassment the Berlusconi forces may ally themselves rather  than joining the group outright. This ploy was adopted in the  last parliament by the British Conservative MEPs, who are  expected to resort to the same tactic again now that British  premier John Major has assumed a distinctly Eurosceptical tone.  Caputo admits that Forza Italia is "likely to see eye-to-eye"  with Britain's Euro-sceptics on several issues, notably the  Maastricht treaty's social chapter.    "The social chapter must be handled with care," he said.  "Excessive social policies, including more pensions and state  handouts, could become a great burden in the future. Instead  Europe must look to become more competitive vis-a-vis the United  States and southeast Asia."    In a sign of its growing influence in Europe, Berlusconi's  party is already being courted by contenders for the presidency  of the EU Commission. Caputo makes it clear that the new Rome  government will shed few tears when Jacques Delors leaves the  post. "The new Commission will not be led by a socialist -- and  I believe that the new European Parliament will oppose the  dirigisme which has emanated from Brussels in the past few  years," he declared.    Since its election in May, Berlusconi's administration has  suffered a series of snubs from senior EU politicians worried by  its alliance with the neo-Fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement].  Caputo dismisses this as a smoke-screen by the French socialists  and the Belgians to mask their own domestic failures.    Even so, Forza Italia will not be allying with the handful  of  MEPs [Members of the European Parliament] the MSI is sending to  Strasbourg. Before Forza Italia makes a deal with the EPP, both  sides must be satisfied on institutional appointments. There  are more than 40 top jobs to be handed out under a system of  party patronage, and Forza Italia may argue it should have at  least one key post.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Talk" by Singhasai: "Is There Anything Else Behind the </F> Plan To Set Up Radio Free Asia?"]    [Text] International public opinion has appreciated the  United States' lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam which  lasted 30 years. Everyone has praised the decision of President  Clinton as it is considered appropriate, conforming to the  common trend of the final decade of the 20th century, the era  regarded by various industrialized countries, including the  United States, as one of achieving cooperation and mutual  understanding in all fields. In light of this, why has the  U.S. Senate recently approved the establishment of Radio Free  Asia again with the intention of beaming news broadcasts to  China, Myanmar [Burma], Tibet, the DPRK, Cambodia, Vietnam, and  the Lao People's Democratic Republic? It has said with a  straight face that the residents of these countries have not had  full freedom to express their views. It has also noted that  Radio Free Asia will serve as a tool to gather views in  different fields from the people of those countries. This may  not be the true purpose of Radio Free Asia. There must be others.    It is difficult to answer this question. The questioner  himself has not mentioned a correct answer. Nevertheless, radio  experts are of the view that the new Radio Free Asia broadcasts  will create interference on frequencies used by broadcasters in  various countries in this region. Radio Free Asia has also  reprimanded various nations in the region by saying that they  have not maintained full rights and freedom of people to express  their views.    The Lao people, like the peoples of other Indochinese  countries, China, Myanmar, Tibet, and the DPRK, already enjoy  full rights and freedom of expression. They can freely speak on  whatever they want without needing Radio Free Asia. They have  also exercised the rights to effectively safeguard their  sovereignty and territorial integrity by opposing outside  intervention and aggression under various forms.    Economically, the United States has announced the end of the  trade embargo against Vietnam. It has done a precious thing.  Why has it now announced the establishment of Radio Free Asia?  Spiritually, this contradicts the economic interest of the  peoples in the region.    BBC radio, in its broadcast of 29 January, expressed the  view  that the United States wants to set up Radio Free Asia because  of its experience with its Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty  contributing to the collapse of communism in Europe four to five  years ago. If the BBC is correct, the new Radio Free Asia will  not be characterized at all by creativity. Its purpose also  runs counter to the earnest aspirations of the nations in this  region, which want to create mutual understanding and promote  and expand cooperation in various fields with all countries in  the world, including the United States.    Generally, no matter what is behind the establishment of  Radio Free Asia, if the owner of a radio station fails to  understand the essential requirements, the true purpose of the  establishment of the station will certainly be clear to the  world in the future. The peoples in the region--the targets of  the broadcasts--will even enhance their spirit of self-mastery  and the spirit of being the owners of their countries,  strengthening their cooperation in various fields to check all  acts of outside intervention regardless of the form.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Clinton begins to hit his stride AFTER six months in the White House, President Bill Clinton has developed an unfortunate reputation for repeatedly allowing himself to be sidetracked from his primary policy goals. But fresh from a success at the Group of Seven economic summit, Mr Clinton is showing signs of hitting his stride. He quickly and effectively took charge of relief efforts in the flood-stricken upper Mississippi basin. Federal emergency operations appear to have improved considerably after the criticism that followed last year's Hurricane Andrew. Back in Washington, however, Mr Clinton finds a Congress almost as rebellious as the floodwaters of the Mississippi. Heading the congressional agenda is the budget bill, with negotiations beginning in earnest next week on a compromise between the different versions already passed by the House and the Senate. However, two two irksome side issues remain: a controversial appointment and the issue of allowing gays to serve in the military. The president has on several occasions annoyed some of his most faithful supporters by abandoning black and female nominees in the face of Republican opposition. Dr Joycelyn Elders, his choice for surgeon general, is both black and female. She is also, because of her outspoken and colourful advocacy of sex education and abortion rights, anathema to right-wing politicians, who have dubbed her 'the condom queen'. Republican senators acknowledge they have little chance of blocking her confirmation on these grounds alone, but hope they may have more success on other grounds. After backing away from Ms Lani Guinier, a prominent black lawyer who was his original choice to head the civil rights division of the Justice Department, Mr Clinton cannot afford another betrayal of the black caucus in Congress. Fellow Democrats are expected to back Mr Clinton on Dr Elders, but cannot be counted on over the issue of gays in the armed forces. Mr Les Aspin, the defence secretary, submitted to the White House on Thursday a proposal to allow homosexuals who do not reveal their orientation to continue to serve in the military. The proposal has already been dubbed unacceptable by gay activist groups. If Mr Clinton can succeed in juggling these issues, he appears to have some chance of success with his main preoccupation, the budget bill.</p>

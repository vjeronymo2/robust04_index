Has Been Left With  Nothing"]    [Text]  <H5>  To Reduce Like We've Never Reduced Before?! </H5>   Nuclear Submarine Commander Captain 1st Rank A. Shchurenko,  a  generally unworried and smiling man, looked tired and tense  during these last days before putting to sea. Among the  multitude of commander's concerns, one especially did not give  him any peace: An important piece of equipment had recently  malfunctioned during operations. Under conditions of the large  amount of work required to repair this mechanism, it would be  best of all to replace it or, in the worst case, to call in the  repairmen. But it turns out that the base does not have the  required spare parts and the specialists are far away. Well  commander, rely just on yourself and also on your subordinates  who have been exhausted by evening watches.    "By the way, the submarine is under warranty but it is  currently practically impossible to eliminate the defect through  the efforts of specialists," you couldn't even sense the  irritation in Aleksey Grigoryevich's voice and, obviously, how  much he hated everything. "And this while the guarantee  enterprises have special maintenance teams. However, try to  summon these specialists, especially from other republics!"    "We receive the following telegrams in response to our  requests: They say, so, the warranty is still in effect but,  since we can't send specialists, do the repairs yourselves,"  Submarine Task Force Deputy Commander Captain 1st Rank V.  Kotomkin entered the conversation. "Excuse me, what kind of  strange warranty is that?", Vladimir Ivanovich shrugs his  shoulders in bewilderment. "And the fact is that, having found  themselves in a difficult economic situation, the enterprises  have stopped paying temporary duty assignment expenses to their  specialists. These people even receive their salaries on an  irregular basis. The navy is simply incapable of assuming  responsibility for all of the expenses, including the mandatory  prepayment although that is what the guarantee enterprises  insist on. In a word, a dead end..."    Unfortunately, right now no one can say: Ultimately, how  long  will this "self-service" maintenance continue? Today it is  senseless to count on appeals for order that aren't backed up or  for the accomplishment of obligations. The current  military-industrial complex's main argument is the economic  slip-knot that is being increasingly tightened by the  government. Moreover, many of its enterprises have turned out to  be isolated from each other by the impenetrable fences of the  sovereign states. And if we can still somehow solve the problems  that arise using Russian producers and repairmen, matters are  significantly more complicated with the "near-abroad". Indeed,  the unregulated market relations in Russia also engender  paradoxes. A simple example. A plant that specializes in the  manufacture of fluorescent bulbs unilaterally reduced deliveries  to the navy. It seems like a minor detail but try to find a  replacement for them! A similar situation exists with spare  parts kits and with many other things.    The traditional question: "How can that be?" -- still  requires a legitimate answer. It's quite obvious that neither  the navy nor the Ministry of Defense can independently untie  that knot. But we think that this problem is quite solvable at  the intergovernmental level. Conclusion of the necessary  agreements is the only rational solution to the situation today.  Only, will we be able to find the resources to carry out those  agreements?    We recall that, after the "Komsomolets" tragedy, there were  many conversations and many decisions were made to improve  warranty maintenance of submarines that remain unfulfilled. As a  result, the state of affairs has deteriorated even further  today. Yes, and how could it be otherwise if the resources that  are currently being allocated do not cover even minimal  requirements? In our country at each step we have examples of  borrowing experience from the West but for some reason this  approach is not being employed with regard to the navy. For  example, in the U.S. Navy, the strength of support subunits  exceeds the number of shipborne specialists by a factor of 5-6.  In our country, where we traditionally follow our own path,  previously we did the opposite and even more so right now. In  one nuclear submarine task force, while following the regulation  to reduce so-called noncombat subunits, they eliminated the  coastal base and are disbanding two maintenance crews. Well it  turns out that sentries, the guard, galley details, policing the  area, alert duty at the entry control point, patrols, and so on  and so forth -- all of this will lie on the shoulders of  submarine combat crews and one more or less important plan  --preparation for winter -- hangs in the task force commander's  office in a visible place alongside the BP [operation order]  plan. And yet hope flickers within me that maybe matters are  somewhat better in other garrisons? Alas....    "The situation is serious and there is an extreme shortage  of  material resources and financing," Rear-Admiral M. Motsak,  commander of another task force, told me. "We are trying to  allocate those crumbs that we do have in such a manner as to  support at least the most combat capable ships. But that is  difficult to do. We are increasingly delaying routine  maintenance and the number of submarines with overdue periods  between repairs is increasing. Today, only one of four warranty  equipment repair and maintenance organizations is in  full-fledged operation. But on the other hand, commercial  structures and small enterprises are growing like mushrooms  after the rain. These commercial structures and small  enterprises are splitting off from the ship repair plants that  are also experiencing hard times. They are enticing the best  specialists to their organizations. The navy has been compelled  to turn to their services in order not to remain without any  repairs at all. And although they are asking high prices for  work, the quality of repairs is not increasing because of this  and the time periods for repairs are being continuously dragged  out. Judge for yourself, under these conditions is it easy to  maintain the required level of technical readiness of ships?    "The duration of submarine service is drastically declining  as a result of the disruption of their operating cycle (the most  important element of which is maintenance). We are `doing  everything we can' to maintain submarines at the combat capable  level for as long as possible..."    "Objectively, the navy's qualitative level has  deteriorated,"  Nuclear Submarine Task Force Chief of Staff Captain 1st Rank V.  Avlastimov said. "New models of weapons and equipment have  nearly stopped entering the inventory. Those that were in the  developmental stage at one time have remained drawings. Test  ranges and NII [scientific research institutes] are being closed  and high-tech production is being shutdown. Promising  developments and experience and unique specialists are being  lost. Before our eyes, we are retreating from formerly leading  positions in this sphere. What will the navy be like tomorrow?"    That question is far from rhetorical. According to some  data,  in recent years the number of technical developments has been  reduced by nearly a factor of ten. The most important priorities  have been lost, for example, in the sphere of the utilization of  titanium, where domestic shipbuilding had far outstripped  foreign shipbuilding. We continue to finish building certain  series of nuclear submarines probably because that is cheaper  and easier than to completely shutdown production.    As for strategic submarines, here the situation is even  worse. Existing future developments of submarines have  practically been frozen when the time for medium repair is  approaching for the submarines that we have in operation and for  which we do not yet have resources nor do we have resources for  their modernization. Meanwhile, in accordance with the START  treaties, the strategic forces naval component is emerging in  first place. Won't it turn out that Russia will be left without  its nuclear shield?  <H5>  ... But We Have Nowhere To Go </H5>   "How do you like the wardroom?", Captain 2nd Rank S.  Fedorychev, deputy task force commander for personnel,  sympathetically asked me. Having noted my embarrassment, he  cleverly added from the reply: "Of course, the food is terrible  and, as they say, we are switching over from millet to pearl  barley. Standards are not being maintained but it's difficult to  blame the supply people for that -- there's nothing in the  warehouses. Even if some submarine or other is being prepared to  put to sea, it is a problem to supply its crew with the most  basic necessities. There is also a certain "innovation": There  are frequently shortages in the boxes of provisions that are  packed at the plants."    We sat in a small cabin, we drank tea, and we talked "about  life" at a leisurely pace. Sergey Anatolyevich has devoted 25  years of his life to the navy. He has primarily served in the  surface fleet -- on combatants, on diesel ships, and later -- on  nuclear submarines. He has performed 12 combat tours.    "I have something with which to compare this," continued  Fedorychev. White-haired, good-natured, and kind, he completely  corresponded to the customary model of a man whom life has made  wise. "In general, the people have not changed during this time  but the attitude toward them has become worse. Many junior  officers frankly say: You have no place to go, you have already  served for so long, but we do not want to repeat your path. They  see quite well in people like me the example of what prospects  await them. If I am released into the reserve -- where will my  family and I end up, without housing? Crowd ourselves in with my  elderly parents? And the majority are finding themselves in that  situation... That is why people are increasingly leaving the  navy.    "We had Senior Lieutenant Nikolay Matrosov -- commander of  the mine-torpedo department -- on our submarine. A hard to find  kind of specialist. And he served well and he showed great  promise but, having written his request for release, he  departed. Acoustic Team Commander Captain-Lieutenant Sergey  Vasilevich is also planning to leave for the civilian sector.  You could say he is going nowhere, he doesn't have any rear  services support but even that, in his opinion, is better than  continuing to serve. Right now it is not prestigious to be a  submariner and the material position obviously does not  correspond to the labor spent and to those dangers and  deprivations that seamen experience. It's not surprising that,  at the slightest opportunity, officers and warrant officers are  leaving the navy for business. Yes, that's what I'm saying! My  son finished school but he doesn't want to hear about any  advantage whatsoever about becoming a submariner and I myself do  not wish his fate to repeat mine with the possibility of finding  himself left with nothing..."    Having been silent for a while, Sergey Anatolyevich  considered it necessary to add: "But then again, no matter how  much we in the crew argue or are indignant, or how much we  discuss, when the ship puts to sea -- everything else becomes  secondary. For the time being, duty and the Fatherland is not an  empty sound for people. The question is -- for how long? The  social experience of the older generations is not passing  without a trace and if today much is being maintained in the old  mode, it's hard to say what will happen tomorrow..."    The cause of that concern is understandable; already right  now the cadre shortage is tenaciously grasping the throat. The  loss of the Baku and Sevastopol naval schools hit the Russian  submarine fleet especially hard. The shortage of people  naturally is reflected in the combat readiness of ships; before  putting out to sea, they have to be brought up to full strength  with the required specialists, having immediately activated  several crews. The number of temporary duty personnel sometimes  reaches one fourth of the assigned strength! And, in violation  of the requirements of guiding documents, replacements and  transfers are being conducted until the very last moment.    Commenting on the situation, Nuclear Submarine Task Force  Commander Vice-Admiral A. Shevchenko stated in that same vein:    "No matter where you go now, we are being held to that old  strength reserve. But if the state does not change its attitude  toward defense in the near future, the decline will continue.  And this will be reflected most of all in cadres -- a real  collapse can occur in a couple of years. We, military personnel,  have completely performed our duty but the politicians must also  understand: If there will be a reliable defense -- there will  also be strong statehood..."    I agreed with Anatoliy Ivanovich that it seems that this  understanding is already beginning to force its way through. For  the first time in many years, officers have sensed a real  increase of their monetary salary. Although also relative --  with the current insane inflation! -- but still an improvement.  The long-awaited law "On the Status of Servicemen" has been  adopted. The law is good but (literally everyone has talked  about that!) the overwhelming mass of its provisions still  remain only on paper.    "Why is this occurring? Well, because the law does not have  the proper legal and financial support," thinks Northern Fleet  Deputy Commander for Personnel Rear-Admiral M. Sviridov. "Let's  take a specific example like supplying garrisons. If you believe  the law, servicemen and their families can obtain goods and  foodstuffs at beneficial prices through the military sales store  system. But to do that, it seems the appropriate state  subsidies, credits, and the state order are needed, in a word --  financial support. In the absence of that, we have what is  available: Commercial sales have inundated the navy with  alcoholic beverages, chewing gum and expensive, low-quality,  consumer goods. In order to survive, the military sales store is  also increasing prices which are becoming even higher than in  ordinary state stores. What are the benefits here?    "Or," continued Mikhail Ivanovich, "one more problem --  transportation. According to the law, servicemen are supposed to  get free travel on all types of city and municipal public  transportation. But in our area, people are paying full price on  inter-garrison routes to get to their duty locations: We don't  have our own buses and we have to lease them from oblast  transportation organizations. Where do we get the money to pay?  There is only one solution -- pass the hat."    I will be frank: Only the lack of housing and the illusory  hope for improvement of their situation holds many of the  officers whom I've managed to meet on this temporary duty  assignment in the service. But increasingly after release into  the reserve, officers have been compelled to leave the military  garrisons where their service that was full of concerns and  deprivations occurred...  <H5>  A Little Bit Goes a Long Way </H5>   I drove with apprehension into this military garrison where  the submariners' families live: I had spent quite a bit of my  childhood here. Much had changed in a little over 20 years. The  garrison had deteriorated since that time and had become sort of  lacking in comforts. Alongside the apartment buildings that had  still not been subjected to the test of time are empty  five-story buildings with gaping windows without panes, piles of  garbage on untidy small streets, the dilapidated Officers' Club,  and the boarded up swimming pool. There was the mark of  desolation and neglect on everything. But there was a time when  Party and state leaders were brought here on "tours", to a  village that shined with cleanliness and tidiness. Since that  time, as the village was transferred to the balance sheet of the  local Soviet, it has not become a real caring owner. More  precisely, there aren't resources for its full-fledged  maintenance. Maybe the seamen could also help but they  themselves, as they say, have deficiency after deficiency. What  resources can reach the village right now, say, if we can't  always manage to paint the submarines?    Degrading poverty, like rust, is eating away all of the  pores  of the navy organism. It would seem that the nuclear submarines  that are at the piers would be provided with the complete  standard of high pressure air, feed water, steam and  electricity... That is in theory. In fact, the submariners  frequently have to count on only their own resources, more  precisely, on the ship's service life. Mechanisms are wearing  out much earlier than they should and numerous breakdowns are  becoming inevitable.    "There are submarines," says Nuclear Submarine Commander  Captain 1st Rank M. Ivanisov, "that have fired `bubbles' for an  entire year due to the shortage of practice torpedoes. Torpedo  training schools and the struggles for survival of the ship are  being lost..."    "Recently, the intensity of cruises, including combat  service, has been reduced by a factor of 2-2.5," says another  Nuclear Submarine Commander Captain 1st Rank O. Gorelov. "The  cruise time per year for any crews does not exceed 2-3 weeks.  And actual sea cruises are the primary type of training for us."    "Today we are striving to resolve on shore part of the  problems associated with the limited number of times ships put  to sea -- by training crews in simulators. But we need to  improve the MTB [logistic and technical support facilities];  that is, to once again invest resources to do that," Northern  Fleet Headquarters Department Chief Captain 1st Rank M. Kolbunov  comments on the situation. "But where do we get the resources?  There is primarily obsolete equipment at the task forces'  training centers and we can't even talk about computers. And in  order to acquire them -- you yourself can imagine what kind of  resources we need to invest. We don't have money for ordinary  light bulbs. Previously there was a powerful training center in  Estonia's Paldiski where crews underwent between-cruise training  twice a year. Now the center is not functioning. They plan to  withdraw all of its equipment which is very complicated and  terribly expensive."    Currently all the problems of basic support of the navy's  vital activities have deteriorated to the maximum extent  possible. Say, we need to reload torpedoes but, as frequently  happens now, there isn't a crane. But the neighboring  construction unit has one. Well, the nuclear submarine commander  goes over to beg to use it. Of course, they simply won't give  him the crane just for that but they can probably come to an  agreement for a couple liters of alcoholic beverages or for two  or three boxes of food. It can also be carried to absurdity. The  one and only tugboat, and it is not always in working order,  serves an entire task force of attack submarines. But according  to the standard, three tugs are required to moor other  submarines. But then again, if there were three, it still isn't  known which KPD [efficiency] they would manage to utilize: Right  now diesel fuel is worth its weight in gold. An important  problem is to tow a nuclear submarine to the neighboring bay (to  do that, in turn you need to refuel the tug). It's sometimes  easier and faster to start the nuclear reactor which they  occasionally do. A truly Russian scale!    It's not surprising that everyday life has also turned out  to  be in an extraordinarily neglected state. The temperature in  some barracks did not rise above 10 degrees all last winter. All  of the crew's officers have one cabin to work in and the warrant  officers don't even have one. Essentially, the barracks has been  turned into an ordinary flophouse. Poverty "has been able to  touch" even here. They don't even have any cleaning supplies.  When one of the submarines left on an endurance cruise, a  surprise awaited its crew: The base had allocated a total of 1.5  boxes of soap! They intended, as they say -- to make a little  bit go a long way...    Before leaving the military garrison where the submariners'  families live, I came to pay my respects at the monument erected  on the summit of a small hill in honor of the seamen who died on  the nuclear submarine "Komsomolets". Just like the crucifixion,  it's as if it floated in the cold sky that was covered by storm  clouds. I thought that the submariners, true sons of the  Fatherland, had ascended to Calvary on behalf of it. Their  comrades serve today for the sake of the Homeland's welfare.  Will Mother Russia make it so that this service requires not  titanic efforts from Northern Fleet seamen to overcome  frequently unresolved problems but would make them happy and  would nurture pride in the fact that they are defending a truly  great state?

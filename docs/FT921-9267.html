			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Post Office will allow managers to take sabbaticals SABBATICAL leave, unusual outside academic circles, is to be introduced for post office counter managers. The move is likely to be followed by pressure from other Post Office workers for sabbaticals to be extended to all grades. Managers will be able to save up annual holiday entitlement, starting this year, towards a sabbatical and combine it with a period of unpaid leave. A minimum block of 13 weeks would normally be taken. Sabbaticals are common in the academic world, where they are frequently for one term in seven and are intended mainly for travel and writing. They are also more widespread in the US, where about 13 per cent of companies offer some form of paid sabbatical leave. Extra paid leave may be allowed by the Post Office in special cases, for example where an employee needs it for study relating directly to the job. The Communication Managers' Association, which represents the 3,000 counter managers, said it would press in the next pay negotiations for the scheme to include further paid leave. Some UK companies offer extra blocks of holiday for long service, special projects or compassionate reasons, or as workers approach retirement. The Post Office scheme is unusual because it will be an entitlement. Employees will not have to explain what they want the time for, and there will be no qualifying period. Mr Terry Deegan, general secretary of the CMA, said he expected a trend towards unions including bids for sabbaticals in pay negotiations. For many groups 'the point has been reached where, in pure pay-bargaining terms, there is not much further to go,' he said. Sabbaticals were also attractive to employees because, unlike many other perks, they were not taxed as a benefit in kind, he added. The Union of Communication Workers, which represents the bulk of Post Office employees, said it, too, would press for sabbaticals. 'They have always seemed to be the privilege of an elite. It's preposterous that no one thinks that people in manual grades would have much to do with the time off,' it said. Staff taking part in the scheme for Post Office counter managers will have to take at least three weeks and three days of their holiday each year.</p>

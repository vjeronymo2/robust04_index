			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Specialeyes deficit reduced Specialeyes, the USM-traded retail optician, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 481,000 for the 12 months ended November 27 on a turnover from continuing activities of Pounds 20.54m. The figures compared with Pounds 2.27m and Pounds 25.94m respectively for the 78 weeks to November 28 1992. The second half, normally the stronger period, was seriously affected by a downturn in sales in the run up to the Chancellor's autumn Budget. However, for the opening 14 weeks of the current year sales were ahead of budget. A 'clear programme' for the next stage of recovery in 1994 was also in hand. Losses per share for the year emerged at 3.11p (14.16p for the 78 weeks).</p>

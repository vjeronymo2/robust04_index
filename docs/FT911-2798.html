			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Books: The Latin America story THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA: VOL VII Edited by Leslie Bethell Cambridge University Press Pounds 70, 800 pages BRITISH INTEREST in Latin America when compared with other regions has been minimal during recent years. Yet by a perverse paradox a British publishing house and a British editor are in the process of producing the finest complete history of the region. The Cambridge University Press' ten volume History of Latin America, edited by Professor Leslie Bethell, is now within sight of completion. Taking as its starting point the colonisation of the Americas, the series should be complete in time for for next year's 500th anniversary of the 'discovery' of the Americas. The monumental undertaking was begun back in 1976 and the publication of Vol VII confirms the consistency and dispassionate readability of the previous volumes. This in itself is a tribute to Professor Bethel, who continues to direct the project although he has become director of the Latin American Institute at London University. It also confirms the value of having one scholar as the editor even though the project covers so many countries spanning such a long period of history. Each volume consists of a collection of essays either on individual countries or on themes, with a particularly welcome emphasis on aspects of culture. This is complemented by a section at the end of each volume with a chapter by chapter series of excellent bibliographical essays which direct the reader with authority where to pursue the subject in greater detail. The previous five volumes published have covered the region from the time of colonial conquest up to 1930s. The remainder (including Vol VI which appears shortly) will extend up to the end of the 1980; while the final volume (Vol X) will be an updated and expanded version of the existing bibiographical essays. The present Vol VII covers Mexico, Central America and the Spanish Caribbean. This is a tumultuous period embracing the consolidation of the Mexican revolution, Sandino in Nicaragua, the effects of the depression on the commodity-based economies of Central America, the rise of Panamian nationalism, the Cuban revolution, the Sandinista revolution, civil war in El Salvador and the effects of the debt crisis in Mexico. Local historiography perhaps not surprisingly tends to treat such episodes in terms of heroes and villains. But the balance here is kept by five British authors, five North American and three Latin American. The authors have made their essays as up to date as possible. Such immediacy is well-intentioned; but on occasions this makes them seem a little breathless and uncertain in their final conclusions. Academics do not like being seen to be wrong and contemporary events in Latin America move with extraordinary speed. Arguably, when these essays were written there was not quite the same sense of perspective regarding the collapse of Soviet power, the advent of more democratic government in Latin America and the move towards generalised acceptance of market-oriented economies. This is a pity because with the benefit of hindsight, the end of the 1980s and the Reagan administration clearly marked a watershed in the development of Latin America and US policy towards the region with the collapse - the most remarkable development being Mexico reversing its long-held prejudices towards the US and agreeing to become part of a North American Free Trade Area. Of the two Mexican essays, the surest touch concerns the Cardenas presidency which highlights the improvised nature of much of his reform including the oil nationalisation. The overview of Central America during the 1930s draws an elegant broad brush, making a telling point that where there is a rise in wealth in societies with great social inequalities, there is the reverse of a trickle down effect - it creates even greater disparities. Finally, it is a pleasure to see Victor Bulmer-Thomas, one of the leading authorities on Central America, compressing almost 60 years of Nicaraguan history into only 50 pages. With all the recent attention devoted to Nicaragua, historians may well note this gives the space and perspective the Sandinista Revolution deserves.</p>

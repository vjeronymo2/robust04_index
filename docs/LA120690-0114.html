			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> COMMISSIONER PIPER NAMED TO 6TH TERM  </P> <P> Michael W. Piper, who has served on the Simi Valley Planning Commission for 10  years, has been reappointed by the City Council to an unprecedented sixth term.  </P> <P> "I like the job," Piper told the council after his reappointment Monday night.  </P> <P> "I don't know what else I would do on Wednesday nights." Piper said one of the  primary reasons he reapplied for the job was his desire to work on plans for a  proposed regional mall in the city.  </P> <P> In addition to Piper, who was nominated by Mayor Greg Stratton, the council  approved three new appointments to the commission. They are Dave McCormick,  nominated by Councilwoman Sandi Webb; Barbara J. Williamson, nominated by  Councilman Bill Davis, and Sherida Simmons, named by Councilwoman Judy Mikels,  who previously served as chairwoman of the commission. Bob Barrett retained his  post on the five-member panel, which advises the council on development  matters.  </P> <P> Each council member is responsible for the nomination of one planning  commissioner. The terms of the commissioners are concurrent with the term of  the nominating council member.  </P> <P> Because Mikels had been Davis' appointment to the commission, he was required  to select a new commissioner.

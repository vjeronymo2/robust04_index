			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Price advantages are slipping away: Exporters fear the recession in Europe is cutting into gains made from a weak pound BRITISH industrialists are warning that the full potential for an export-led recovery in the UK is starting to be undermined by the widespread recession affecting European markets. Last year's devaluation of sterling has already provided a sharp boost to UK exports outside the European Community, government statistics show. But in spite of evidence of strengthening sales for many companies in continental Europe - an area that accounts for one-third of UK exports - there are fears that export growth is starting to be hit by weakening demand. Some UK companies are managing to achieve larger market shares because of increased competitiveness, although they warn that any further appreciation of sterling could remove the price advantage for British products. Other businesses say higher sales are being accompanied by lower selling prices and smaller margins. Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'There are clouds on the horizon. The prospects for exports to Europe are now suffering a severe squeeze as the main European economies fall into recession.' Nine months after sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism businesses believe improved competitiveness is being increasingly offset by poor trading conditions. The sharp fall in sales of new vehicles in continental Europe, for example, is hitting exports by UK car producers such as Ford and General Motors' subsidiary Vauxhall. The impact on the overall UK car export effort will be softened, however, by the rapid increase of UK production by the three Japanese carmakers Nissan, Honda and Toyota. All three producers are aiming to export about three quarters of their UK car output. The UK operations of GM and Ford are more exposed to falling European sales as they have recently started exporting a significant share of their output. In spite of improved UK demand, Vauxhall's UK assembly plants have introduced short-time working in the face of the steep decline in European demand. But with UK plants providing the lower cost base, the deeper cuts are more likely in Europe. Ford, which last year exported more than half of the output from its Dagenham, Essex plant, is becoming increasingly concerned that the fall in new car sales in Germany, France, Italy and Spain will hit UK production. Rover believes that the devaluation of sterling has given it a strong competitive advantage in continental Europe this year and that gains in market share will cushion the fall in the overall European market. Mr Richard Robson, managing director of Fermec Holdings, the construction equipment manufacturer that exports to Europe, says that on balance his business has gained from recent events. 'If the gain is 100, the offset is about 70, which comes equally from the weakness in Continental markets, particularly France and Germany, and from the higher cost of imported components from Denmark and Germany.' Mr Malcolm Taylor, managing director of Bridgeport Machines, one of the UK's largest machine tool makers, said devaluation and the internal problems of the German machine tool industry handed his company 'a tremendous advantage'. He added: 'Our German sales had grown significantly over the past three years and it was becoming our best European market. The problem is that nobody there is buying machine tools now.' The chemicals sector reports the same experience. Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at Imperial Chemical Industries, said: 'The slowdown in demand, particularly in Germany, has been partly offset by the benefits of devaluation. But weak demand is having the effect of undermining prices in all the basic chemicals. Exports are getting through but not in the quantities they ought to be.' Textile and clothing exporters to Europe report that recession is already outweighing the benefits of price competitiveness. Mr Ronald Miller, chairman of Dawson International, the luxury knitwear manufacturer, reported a 20 per cent fall in sales in France in spite of a distinct price edge from devaluation. The company has managed to raise sales in Germany but at the expense of margins. Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, Britain's largest textile manufacturer, said European profits were likely to be lower this year, with the climate in Germany and France 'very difficult'. Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer through which Britain's clothing manufacturers export almost Pounds 150m-worth of goods to Europe, said heavy competition for sales was forcing price cuts - of up to 30 per cent in Holland, for example. For the UK-based spirit companies profit margins are under pressure as consumer spending dips across Europe. Grand Metropolitan's growth in Europe has slowed since last autumn in the face of recession in important markets such as Spain, France and Germany. Mr Colin Hope, chairman of T&amp;N, the UK automotive components groups, echoed many industrialists in calling for a period of exchange-rate stability so that gains in market share could be consolidated. He said: 'Our German competitors are losing money and still they are cutting prices to compete with us. The Germans are fighting a big rearguard action. In this situation it would be a shame if the pound were to harden against the D-Mark because that could stop the build-up of orders.' The CBI said that for the moment its members were not unhappy about the value of the pound. But if it went much higher industry would again be banging on the Treasury's door demanding action.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: New trust offers 8.5% yield A NEW investment trust offering a yield of 8.5 per cent will be launched later this month by Grahams Rintoul, a small fund management group. The High Income trust will invest in convertible stocks - fixed-interest securities which can be converted into ordinary shares. The theory behind convertible investing is that the high yield gives a decent income and, if share prices rise sharply, there is a chance of extra profit by exercising the conversion option. The theory has not worked too well in recent years, though. The average convertible unit trust rose just 19.4 per cent (offer-to-bid with income re-invested) over the five years to March 1, according to Finstat. High Income's manager, Nick Coombes, says that unit trusts specialising in the area can be hit by redemptions, which require them to sell their most liquid - and often their most attractive - stocks. Furthermore, many of the convertibles issued in the mid-1980s were by companies on acquisition sprees; many deals turned sour late in the decade and the early 1990s. Coombes says there are still plenty of good stocks available in the market, such as Tarmac, Amec, Rank, BAe, BICC and Hanson. His main aim is to ensure that the trust can continue to make its dividend payments, which will be paid quarterly. If that is achieved, he says, the capital will look after itself. The trust's capital structure is that 70 per cent will be in ordinary shares with the rest in zero dividend preference shares, which will be on a redemption yield of 8.5 per cent. The build-up of the zero's value will be charged against the trust's income account, which has tax advantages. But, as with other split capital trusts, if the manager fails to perform, the demands of the zero will eat into the value of the ordinary shares. The chairman of the trust will be John Short, the former manager of BZW Convertible trust, the only other investment trust in this field. It is top of the UK General sector over three years, with a rise of 64.1 per cent, and its shares stand at a premium to asset value. High Income trust will have a restricted six-year life, which should limit the danger that the shares will fall to a discount. Under the present rules, the trust does not qualify for personal equity plan status. So, income-seeking investors might consider it as an add-on to a Pep, such as those on offer from Cazenove, Fidelity, Foreign &amp; Colonial or M&amp;G. The minimum investment will be Pounds 1,000; annual management charge will be 0.8 per cent; and issue expenses will be no more than 4 per cent. The broker is the London-based Greig Middleton. The launch is scheduled for March 25, so details may alter if there is a change in economic and financial conditions before then.</p>

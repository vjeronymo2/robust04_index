			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nortel charge pushes BCE to CDollars 520m loss BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, incurred a second-quarter loss of CDollars 520m (USDollars 406m), equal to CDollars 1.77 per common share, after absorbing its share of a USDollars 940m writedown by 52 per cent-owned Northern Telecom. The loss was in line with analysts' estimates, following last week's news from Nortel that its second-quarter loss equalled USDollars 4.13 a share, including the writedown. BCE recorded a 1992 second-quarter profit of CDollars 246m, or 72 cents. Its consolidated revenues in the latest quarter were CDollars 4.92bn, against CDollars 4.98bn, mostly from Bell Canada. BCE's first-half loss was CDollars 299m, or CDollars 1.13 a share, against a profit of CDollars 544m, or CDollars 1.60 last year.</p>

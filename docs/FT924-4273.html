			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mines closed prior to privatisation should be offered to employees MINES CLOSED by British Coal prior to its privatisation should be offered to employees to allow them to mine them under licence, Mr Roy Lynk, representing the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, told MPs yesterday, Michael Smith writes. Mr Lynk, who lost the election for the union presidency this week, told the trade and industry select committee that the mines should be offered as going concerns before any action to close them. The UDM told the committee that the coal market at power stations could stabilise at 70m tonnes next year and 60m if action were taken to boost demand.</p>

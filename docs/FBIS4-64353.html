			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Giovanni Spadolini, former Senate Speaker, </F> by Giovanni Valentini in Rome; date not given: "Spadolini,  Champion of the Rules"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Valentini] From your  special vantage point at Palazzo Madama [Senate], how have you  viewed Italian politics over the past seven years?    [Spadolini] In 1987 I passed from a position in the  political  battle, as a party secretary, to the position of an impartial  arbiter, which is what the Senate speakership is, or, rather,  should be. An arbiter during some very exciting years. It was  a sharp break, a new way of approaching issues. A radical  change of lifestyle, of outlook -- approaching every issue in  accordance with my impartial role, at the very time when the  crisis of the parties became more acute, the system of party  domination became more invasive, and corruption -- which I  condemned back at the time of P-2 [outlawed Masonic lodge] --  grew worse.    [Valentini] What is your personal and political assessment  of  this experience?    [Spadolini] It is the assessment of someone who never  adapted  to the patterns of what is now being called the "First  Republic," though that is a misleading term. I realized the  need for innovation and consistently devoted myself to modifying  parliamentary rules during the 10th legislative period. I also  broached the issue of the reform of the Senate, the first  example in Italian history of an assembly correcting itself.    [Valentini] What could the Senate role be in the future?  Some people argue that it should become the Chamber of the  Regions....    [Spadolini] Under my speakership, there was a debate on the  rationalization of relations between the two houses, in which  the theory of so-called procedural bicameralism prevailed. That  is, the theory that envisages a limited number of necessarily  bicameral laws and, apart from that, an acceleration of the  progress of bills through parliament by means of "silent  assent." I see that there is talk now about major  simplifications and major innovations in the Senate too, which  depends on its traditions. Well, there are hundreds of acts of  the Constitutional Affairs Committee to be assessed. There are  the conclusions of the Bicameral Committee on Institutional  Reforms, including the idea of increasing the powers of regional  government, without the Senate's becoming something like  Germany's Bundesrat, since Italy is not a federal state. What  is certain is that it will not be necessary to start from  scratch. Nothing in history is invented.    [Valentini] What role do you intend to assume now? Will you  be leader of the opposition in the Senate?    [Spadolini] No. Leader of the constitution. I intend to be  the leader of the forces that identify with a sincere and  profound constitutional reformism, but without overturning or  disrupting the Constitution. This, always within a European  outlook: the Italian nation as part of the European nation.    [Valentini] Does that mean that you are opposed to any  institutional revision?    [Spadolini] There has always been confusion between the  commitment to institutional revision -- concerning the form of  government -- and an outright subversion of the form of the  state. The former path can be pursued; the latter cannot. It is  one thing to talk about a parliamentary, presidential, or  semi-presidential republic, or one based on a chancellorship.  It is quite another matter to question the form of the state.  There must be no ambiguities about this. There is only one  republic and it is indivisible. The same applies to the  fundamental principles of the first articles of the Constitution.    [Valentini] But the new majority does intend to modify it,  by  means of the twofold reading by the two houses, as envisaged by  Article 138. How legitimate do you think this is?    [Spadolini] Article 138 originated under the proportional  system. Under a first-past-the-post system there should have  been, and there must be, more guarantees. It was a mistake not  to have provided them. Be that as it may, as things stand, any  modification of the Constitution must take place through  scrupulous observance of the constitutional charter. And that  includes Article 138.    [Valentini] Can the government alignment do this on its own,  by dint of parliamentary votes?    [Spadolini] Any plan for the reform of the Constitution must  necessarily be the result of a debate that cannot be confined to  the narrow parameters of a majority. No coups d'etat. The  Constitution is an asset belonging to the entire country, to the  forces of both the majority and the opposition. The ideal forum  within which to develop institutional reforms is parliament.  And that alone.    [Valentini] But on the basis of the new first-past-the-post  system, the winning alignment is claiming the right to decide  autonomously.    [Spadolini] Let us be clear about this: When we refer to  the first-past-the-post system, we do so entirely incorrectly.  The first-past-the-post system presupposes the presence of  consistent and compact forces that sought votes in order to  govern together. Here we have a completely different kind of  alliance. Three parties brought together with all kinds of  reservations which are tantamount to differences, contrasting  stances, and splits, some of them deep. The first events on the  parliamentary agenda will show us whether a numerical majority  -- which does not even exist in the Senate -- also constitutes a  political majority. This is the real test.    [Valentini] You have always been a defender of national  unity. Do you think that the plan for federalism put forward by  the League could jeopardize our country's identity?    [Spadolini] I have not yet seen any federalist blueprint  worthy of the name. I have seen scribbles, notes, and  fragments. If anything, I have seen a confederal-type plan  which outlines a voluntary association of independent states.  This negates the first and second Risorgimento.    [Valentini] With regard to presidentialism, some support the  direct election of the chief of state, while others advocate  that of the prime minister. What do you think is the most  efficient solution for ensuring greater governability?    [Spadolini] The presidential republic is an entirely  respectable idea. But I think that the German system of the  chancellor is preferable, the best antidote to the instability  of governments. The direct election of the prime minister,  however, could bring about a situation in which the prime  minister elected directly by the people is not matched by an  adequate and corresponding parliamentary majority, with all the  easily imagined problems that this would entail. I would call  this quite irresponsible.    [Valentini] Having been defeated by a single vote [for  Senate  speakership], do you consider yourself the first victim of the  Second Republic?    [Spadolini] I do not consider myself defeated at all. I did  not want to win, either by one vote or by five. I merely  accepted the idea of an agreement on my candidacy on the part of  the future government parties and the future opposition parties  -- what is known as an institutional majority. There was no  majority in the Senate. So it is very rash to regard the Senate  on the same basis as the lower house. We tried to avert a  laceration (or something even worse) and were successful. Now I  am regaining complete freedom of action and resuming the same  civilized battle that I have always waged.    [Valentini] In this transition from old to new, do you not  think nevertheless that you have disregarded the fact that you  represented the previous system?    [Spadolini] But what is new? I am not a professional  politician; I did not emerge from any apparatus. I joined the  Senate at the age of 47, as an independent within the Italian  Republican Party, having made my way in life through my  historical research and journalism. It takes some nerve for  those who, out of respect for the system of party domination,  are deciding everything -- even whether or not a ministry should  be subdivided (what a mistake to think of splitting the Interior  Ministry in two!) -- behind closed doors, for them to talk in  terms of "the new." The so-called First Republic -- an  expression that I do not like -- never went that far. No, quite  frankly, I really do feel that I represent the new.    [Valentini] Will it prove possible to correct the electoral  law? Which would be better: a plain single-candidate system or  two rounds?    [Spadolini] I am in favor of two rounds, which would  facilitate the establishment of homogeneous majorities and  enable the people's will to be fully expressed, within the  complexity of our political life. A plain single-candidate  system presupposes an entirely different history. It should be  pondered extremely carefully before adopting it.    [Valentini] In recent days you have been mentioned as a  possible guarantor, or super-guarantor, to be set alongside the  next prime minister....    [Spadolini] Yes, the newspapers have spoken about it. I have  received no proposals in this regard, and I would not even have  discussed them unless they had been accompanied by adequate  instruments. Be that as it may, there is an issue regarding the  private television companies owned by the prime  minister-designate, and no one should think that it can be  avoided by means of humorous rejoinders.</p>

Capt. Paredes, who retired from the Navy a few years ago,  became known for his public charges of corruption in the Navy  when he presented Congress copies of videos on connections  between political leaders and drug traffickers. He confirmed  that "the DEA works with drug traffickers outside U.S. and  Bolivian laws."    "I say it, I confirm it, and I can prove it" said Paredes  Sempertegui, a MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] member who is  currently as adviser to the Chamber of Deputies Defense  Committee, in asserting that DEA agents and Bolivian policemen  carry out "their well-known extortion operations."    He said the criminal acts "are made in the so-called  security  houses located all over the national territory. These acts are  known by the public. For example, in Santa Cruz I would like to  point out the house of a Bolivian Navy member rented for that  purpose. It is the house of Colonel Alberto Latelier Ortiz."    Paredes explained that his charges refer to specific people  and facts that in no way compromise national institutions, for  which he said he has respect and consideration, mentioning the  Armed Forces and National Police primarily.    He said the investigation announced on this case by  legislative committees will certainly confirm his charges and  will clarify the real operation of the "security houses," which  are completely outside the country's legal order.</p>

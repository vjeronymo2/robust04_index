			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: Earnings to rise by 10% at Henkel Henkel, the German chemicals and consumer products group, expects pre-tax earnings to increase by more than 10 per cent this year following a 3 per cent rise in the first quarter. Such an increase was possible even though the costs of restructuring in the current period could not yet be accurately forecast, Mr Hans-Dietrich Winkhaus, chairman, said. Reporting a 1 per cent decline in turnover in the first three months, the company based its optimism on its balanced product portfolio and geographical spread. Meanwhile, there had been few signs of a convincing recovery in Europe, particularly in consumer goods. Turnover and earnings in chemicals and special chemicals had improved, while the detergents business had become more difficult partly because of reduced consumer spending power. Previously-announced plans for the loss of 1,000 German jobs would go ahead, as would the progressive closure of five factories and other sites. Restructuring costs this year would be markedly lower than in 1993, the chairman said. The main current project, a DM20m (Dollars 11.6m) investment in a 70 per cent stake in a chemicals joint venture in Shanghai, is on the verge of completion.</p>

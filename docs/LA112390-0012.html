			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> COLLECTION KEYS ON SEPARATIONS;  </P> <P> DISTANT FRIENDS BY GREG JOHNSON: ONTARIO REVIEW PRESS, $17.95, 169 PAGES  </P> <P> Virtually every one of Greg Johnson's haunting stories in "Distant Friends"  explores and confronts a traumatic form of separation. The gulf opened between  old friends Lex and Marty in the final story of the collection is only the most  obvious of the lot.  </P> <P> Lex has no home, exactly, merely a home base in Boulder, Colo., which is not  quite the same thing. He earns a modest income from a small apartment house and  keeps his trust fund for luxuries. Marty has moved to a restored brownstone in  New York, where he is overwhelmed by responsibility to his family and clients.  Marty is a successful accountant, a devoted husband, and the father of a  chronically ill child.  </P> <P> Marty's little girl is in desperate straits when Marty phones his old buddy.  Lex, as always, is available. You could actually call him a professional  friend, since his only job seems to be providing support and good cheer. On  this occasion, atypically, he drags his feet, driving cross-country instead of  flying, stopping in Philadelphia for a one-night stand with a woman as  fancy-free as he is. By the time he gets to the hospital, it's too late. The  friendship between the two men, having survived time, distance and tremendous  personality differences, is finally undone by death. The man who has grown up,  married, and lost a child no longer has anything in common with Lex, whose main  problem is how to spend his inheritance. Still, Lex doesn't quite get home  free. "Later he would think that his sudden urge for flight, for distance, had  shocked him as much as anything else that had happened."  </P> <P> In "Passion Play," Randall Trenner is also an escapee, but while Lex has done  neither harm nor good, Randall's case is more complex. He's just lost his job  and the woman with whom he lives is pressing for marriage. When he opens a  letter from the handicaped sister he left behind in Georgia, he impulsively  decides on an overdue visit. He returns to Georgia to find Melissa no longer a  sweet tractable child but a willful, unmanageable woman of 40, complaining of  ill-treatment and general anguish, neither so disabled that she cannot assert  herself nor competent enough to live on her own. The elderly aunt left in  charge can no longer cope. Melissa imagines herself in love with a married man  who apparently beats her, and finally, sadly, Randall agrees that an  institution is the only answer. Before this unnerving story ends, however, he  finds a more satisfactory solution.  </P> <P> "The Metamorphosis" takes separation to its extremity. We encounter a terrified  performer about to go on stage; we soon realize that he is a female  impersonator suffering from a terror that has caused a previous mental  breakdown. Here the theme of the outsider is carried to a Grand Guignol finale,  a border only tentatively approached in the other stories.  </P> <P> "Grieving" returns the reader to a more familiar world, in which a recent widow  meets a strange, waif-like girl at her husband's grave. Curious, the widow  befriends the mourner, only to discover that the girl was her husband's lover,  and that the quiet, well-ordered life the couple had enjoyed was a sham. By the  time this brief interlude is over, the widow's vision of herself is irrevocably  altered and her superficially happy marriage revealed as a pathetic charade.  </P> <P> "A Summer Romance," like "Crazy Ladies," deals with mental illness. Like the  physical suffering in "Distant Friends" and "Wintering," psychosis serves the  same purpose, providing the author with his most dramatic metaphors. Though the  plot is classic, the resolution is contemporary, turning "A Summer Romance"  into a tragicomedy of modern manners. Johnson's ironic, disturbing stories  speak directly to the generation reaching middle age -- post-rebellion,  post-selfishness, post-prosperity, post-everything.  </P> <P> Next: Carolyn See reviews "Breaking Ice: An Anthology of Contemporary  African-American Fiction" edited by Terry McMillan (Viking).  </P></p>

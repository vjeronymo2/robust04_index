			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL WOULD LET CUSTOMERS BLOCK CALLER ID SERVICE  </P> <P> A Senate bill was introduced Monday that would require telephone companies to  allow customers to block Caller ID, a new service that displays a caller's  phone number before the receiver is picked up.  </P> <P> Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.) said he was in favor of the new technology but that  customers also should have the option of not giving out their phone numbers.  </P> <P> "A privacy balance must be struck," Kohl said in introducing the Telephone  Privacy Act of 1990.  </P> <P> "Who decides whether the caller will reveal his or her number?" Kohl said. "I  think the decision must rest with the caller."  </P> <P> Caller ID, which has been available in New Jersey for more than a year and is  just beginning to be offered in Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia,  Pennsylvania and Maryland, uses a small terminal that displays the numbers of  incoming calls.  </P> <P> The number display device costs $50 or more to purchase, and the Caller ID  service costs about $7 a month.  </P> <P> Privacy rights advocates claim it is an Orwellian intrusion on individual  privacy unless a blocking option is offered. Phone companies such as Bell  Atlantic, which is phasing in Caller ID in the mid-Atlantic states but not  offering blocking, say a blocking provision would defeat the purpose of the  service.  </P> <P> California has passed legislation requiring blocking be offered with Caller ID,  and Pennsylvania allows police and domestic violence agencies to block it.  </P> <P> Some telephone companies have said privacy concerns have delayed their plans to  introduce the service.  </P> <P> Kohl sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which, according to congressional  sources, will consider Caller I.D. as part of hearings on a number of privacy  issues this year.  </P></p>

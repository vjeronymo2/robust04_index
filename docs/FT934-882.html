			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Moulinex stake for Glen Dimplex Glen Dimplex, the Irish household electricals group, is negotiating to buy a minority holding in Moulinex, the French domestic appliances company, as part of the latter's emergency financial restructuring. Moulinex, one of the best known names in European household goods, has been struggling to stabilise its finances. It has been hit by recession and by intense competition from multinational manufacturers. The company carries heavy debt incurred during the 1991 acquisition of Krups, a German competitor. The Krups deal strengthened Moulinex's presence in key product sectors, notably coffee machines, but triggered a steep rise in costs. Moulinex fell into the red in 1992 with a net loss of FFr115m (Pounds 13m), on turnover of FFr8.22bn, against net profits of FFr171m. It stayed in deficit during the first quarter of this year. The group was left with net debt of FFr3.25bn at the end of March. However, attempts to reorganise its finances have been complicated by its intricate corporate structure. It has been run by a co-operative board since the death in 1991 of Mr Jean Matelet, its founder, and is controlled by Finap, which is owned by Moulinex employees. In October the board approved proposals to raise new capital to reduce borrowings. The company has since developed a plan for a cash injection of FFr500m. Banque de Financement et de Tresorerie, a subsidiary of the Credit Agricole banking group, is looking for institutional investors to take stakes in Moulinex. The talks with Glen Dimplex form part of the restructuring plan. Glen Dimplex, which is already present in the household appliances market through Morphy Richards, its UK subsidiary, has started discussions to buy a holding either in Moulinex itself or in Finap. Glen Dimplex is privately owned by Mr Martin Naughton and Mr Laughlin Quinn, the latter being the brother of the Irish minister for enterprise and employment, Mr Ruari Quinn. The company was founded in 1973 as Glen Electric, and bought Dimplex from the receivers in 1977. Concentrating on the manufacture of industrial electric heating equipment and domestic electrical appliances, it has since expanded through in Europe and North America.</p>

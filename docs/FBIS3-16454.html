We have a historic mission, whose  nonfulfilment would be a betrayal. If our border guards leave  the border, bloodshed will begin and innocent people will be  killed," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told  correspondents here today.    The minister visited a border post of the Pyandzh border  unit  during a break in the current Dushanbe conference of foreign  ministers from Central Asia, Kazakhstan and Russia.    Kozyrev told ITAR-TASS that Russian presence in former  Soviet  Republics was discussed in this very light during his meeting  with U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher on Monday [14  March] in Vladivostok.    "The Russian special mission is not our caprice, it is a  fact  one cannot avoid. We do not need any imperialism, but we will  fulfill our duty. I think that our Western partners come to  understand this. It will be fine if they help us, if not we  will make it ourselves," stressed the official.    Asked whether inter-Tajik dialogue will be held in Moscow in  due time, the minister said that the dialogue has begun,  including that with the Russian mediation. "It is important to  understand that the dialogue may have diverse forms. It is the  result that is important, and in order to achieve it, it is  necessary to find out who's who: Who has the guns and who has  real control over armed people. It is they whom one should  speak to first," he added.    Asked what the reason is for his frequent meetings with the  military, Kozyrev said: "We have a common cause although  different means. This cause is consolidation of statehood and  protection of Russian interests."</p>

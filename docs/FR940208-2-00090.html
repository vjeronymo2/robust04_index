Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the Regional Exchanges' proposals to extend their respective pilot programs, until April 10, 1994, to provide price protection of limit orders executable after the close of regular trading hours is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposals are reasonably designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, further investor protection and the public interest in fair and orderly markets on national securities exchanges. For these reasons, as discussed in more detail below and in the original approval orders, the Commission finds that approval of the proposed rule changes, for a temporary period ending on April 30, 1994, is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with the requirements of Section 6 of the Act. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Commission's release approving the NYSE's OHT facility, the Commission noted the benefits that would accrue to investors through the development of an after-hours trading session. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Although the Regional Exchanges' proposals did not establish after-hours sessions identical to that of the NYSE, the Commission believes that they provide a reasonable competitive response. By allowing GTX orders that would be executed on the NYSE to receive a similar fill on the Exchanges, the proposal is providing a mechanism for maintaining its own individual marketplace on a competitive level with the primary market. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29237, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to extending the after-hours GTX pilot programs, the Commission today is also approving proposals submitted by the NYSE and Amex to extend, through April 30, 1994, their respective pilot programs which provide for executions of securities during after-hours trading sessions. Each of these pilot programs were scheduled to expire on January 31, 1994. See File Nos. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;51 (filed on December 23, 1993) and SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;15 (filed on April 21, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

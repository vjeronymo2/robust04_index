			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Copenhagen, Feb 15 (AFP) -- A unit of tanks that  has been trying to reach UN troops in the Bosnian enclave of  Tuzla for five months will not be diverted to Sarajevo, Danish  Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said Tuesday [15 February].    Speaking at a meeting with party leaders on the situation in  the former Yugoslavia, Rasmussen said if the United Nations  wanted to change its plans for the Danish Leopard tanks the  question would have to be referred back to parliament here.  [passage omitted]    Rasmussen said that in any event Sweden wanted the Danish  troops in Tuzla so it could move some armoured troop carriers to  Sarajevo.    The Leopards will first head for Tomislavgrad in southwest  Bosnia, which is under the control of Bosnian Croat militia.    Rasmussen said he expected that the Croats would let the  tanks through.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Russian President Boris Yeltsin hints that  Finland may win big economic projects with Russia. Yeltsin  expressed his view to President Martti Ahtisaari who started his  visit to Moscow this morning. Matti Torma reports from Moscow:    [Torma] [passage omitted] Both Ahtisaari and Yeltsin  attended  a meeting of the delegations from the two countries. After the  meeting ended, Yeltsin and Ahtisaari gave a joint news  conference, at which both Yeltsin and Ahtisaari announced that  there are no political problems between the countries.    As for actual matters of substance, Yeltsin expressed hope  that Finland and Russia will rapidly achieve an agreement on  avoiding dual taxation as well as on investment protection for  Finnish investments. As regards the economy, Yeltsin also  hinted that new big projects may be forthcoming, but he would  not specify what they might be. Ahtisaari also said that  economic relations between Finland and Russia have developed  well in the last few years. Already trade has increased to 70  percent of the 1990 level and the economic commission's work has  gotten off to a brisk start. According to Ahtisaari, Finland's  possible EU membership will also further consolidate cooperation  with Russia.    In the economy, there is room for improvement in the  financing of trade -- which was indeed raised during the talks,  Ahtisaari said.    In answer to a question about whether Yeltsin condemns the  Soviet Union's seizure of Karelia during the Stalin era, Yeltsin  replied playfully that "We don't allow that." Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, for his part, at the end of the press conference  put an end, at least for the time being, to the debate  concerning Finland's possible mediation in settling the disputes  between Russia and the Baltic countries. The mediation is not  needed, Kozyrev said.</p>

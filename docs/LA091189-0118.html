			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD BANK COMMITS FUNDS TO ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> The World Bank, long criticized for funding environmentally damaging projects,  today announced increased lending to population-control projects and forestry  development to help combat global atmospheric warming.  </P> <P> Bank President Barber Conable told a conference on the environment that the  bank "is committed to environmental issues and, what is more, this commitment  does not detract at all from our primary mission of global development."  </P> <P> The American president of the leading institution for funding Third World  development spoke at the opening of a conference called to address how to raise  living standards in poor countries while preserving the environment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sponsored by Japan  </P> <P> Sponsored by the Japanese government and the U.N. Environment Program, the  conference has drawn dozens of officials and experts from many countries and  international organizations.  </P> <P> At the end of the conference Wednesday they are expected to issue  recommendations on ways to combat the main problem on the agenda: global  warming. Scientists warn that the so-called greenhouse effect could scorch  parts of the Earth and raise sea levels unless checked.  </P> <P> Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, whose country is under  environmentalists' attack as the biggest importer of tropical forest products,  pledged increased assistance to research on sustainable development of tropical  forests.  </P> <P> Kaifu, welcoming the conferees, said Japan intends to raise its foreign  environmental aid to $2.25 billion in three years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Positive Vigor'  </P> <P> "Japan is ready to take on global environmental issues with positive vigor," he  said, reporting that he discussed such issues in depth during his  just-completed series of summit meetings in the United States, Canada and  Mexico.  </P> <P> Conable said the world's population, currently about 5 billion, will grow to 6  billion by the year 2000, adding to the use of fossil fuels that is blamed for  the greenhouse effect and atmospheric warming.  </P> <P> He announced that the bank is establishing a gas development unit to promote  use of natural gas because it is the least polluting of fossil fuels.  </P> <P> "I am also pleased to announce a tripling of our lending to forestry in the  next few years," Conable said.  </P> <P> On population-control projects, he said lending has amounted to over $500  million in the last five years and that level will increase to more than $800  million in the 1990-92 period.  </P></p>

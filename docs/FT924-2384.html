			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Markets: Softly, softly approach wins the day - Wall Street FIVE weeks after he was elected, Bill Clinton this week finally announced the top economic appointments for his first administration. The reaction of the financial markets, which in the immediate aftermath of the election had been consumed with speculation about who would make the president-elect's first team, was predictable - they ignored it. With good reason, for the news was hardly new. All the big appointments  - Senator Lloyd Bentsen as treasury secretary, representative Leon Panetta as head of the budget office, and investment bankers Robert Rubin and Roger Altman as chief White House economic adviser and deputy treasury secretary, respectively - had been telegraphed well in advance, leaving the markets plenty of time to price their reaction into stocks and bonds before the formal announcements were made. This is probably exactly what the Clinton camp wanted. The gradual leaking of the top appointments seemed a deliberate policy to avoid frightening Wall Street. The game he has played over the past five weeks shows that the president-elect and his advisers have realised the importance of winning the confidence of the markets. The US has not had a new Democratic president in 16 years so, for many people in the business and financial world, the arrival of Bill Clinton in the White House will be a step into the unknown. Fortunately, the president-elect seems to have chosen wisely, at least in terms of whether the appointees would command the respect of the markets. All the big names are pragmatic veterans of either Capitol Hill or Wall Street, essentially conservative Democrats who are unlikely to push for excessively Keynesian, growth-oriented economic policies of the type that so worried the bond market during the final stages of the election campaign. Fortunately for president-elect Clinton, signs that the pace of the economic recovery has been quickening over the past few months have allowed him and his advisers to soften their stance on economic policy. If treasury investors feared that tough talk from Democrats on the campaign trail about spending their way out of recovery would translate into an inflation-fuelling package of fiscal stimuli, those fears have been partly assuaged by both the evidence of renewed economic growth and Thursday's political appointments. While much attention over the past month was focused on the composition of the first Clinton administration, the stock markets were quietly building up a considerable head of steam. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average has never threatened its high, the blue-chip index has gained almost six per cent since hitting a low in early October. Over a similar period, secondary indices have been busy setting new records amid exceptionally busy trading, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite setting near or actual double-digit gains. The market's mini-rally, however, may have now run its course. Although the losses of the last two days represent only a minor setback in percentage terms, sentiment seems to have shifted. The advances of the past month or so stemmed primarily from investors selectively searching for cheap or growth stocks. It has been what analysts like to call a 'stock-pickers market', with considerable variations in demand within industry groups. The choicest bargains have been snapped up, leaving only the expensive or distressed stocks for the stragglers. The lack of a truly market-wide rush into equities explains why the Dow has lagged the other indices. The market as a whole is beginning to look fully, if not over-priced. Wall Street securities house Salomon Brothers notes that the S&amp;P's 500 is currently trading at 16.9 times estimated 1993 earnings, and is yielding a meagre three per cent based on dividend forecasts. Consequently, Salomon's chief equity strategist, David Shulman, envisages only modest returns for equity investors in 1993. IBM had another bad week, even if some market watchers believe the selling of the stock has been overdone. Predictions from a couple of analysts of further restructuring moves that could endanger the dividend, and reports that the company was about to call an unusual board meeting, took their toll of IBM mid-week. The news that Standard &amp; Poor's is considering lowering its ratings on some IBM debt did not help either, and in four days of trading, the share price dropped another 7.5 per cent to below Dollars 62.  ------------------------------------------- Monday       3307.33    +    18.65 Tuesday      3322.18    +    14.85 Wednesday    3328.81    +     1.63 Thursday     3312.19    -    11.62 Friday       3304.08    -     8.11  -------------------------------------------</p>

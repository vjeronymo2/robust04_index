			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Zhao Lianqing </F> (6392 6647 1987)]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- Minister of Agriculture  Liu Jiang emphasized the necessity to promote rural economic  development by deepening reforms and adopt reformative measures  to solve new problems during the course of establishing a  socialist market economy.    Liu Jiang said at a national conference on agricultural work  here: In order to further deepen rural reform to cultivate  markets, all localities should seriously explore the following  this year:    -- It is necessary to accelerate the reform of the  circulation system and the construction of markets for  agricultural products. Beginning this year, the state will adopt  a series of policies and measures to promote reform of the  agricultural product circulation system, with emphasis on reform  of the grain purchase and marketing system. All localities and  agricultural departments should step up investigation and study  and promote the implementation of these policies. The emphasis  in building markets for farm products should be put on the  wholesale markets and on making the central wholesale markets,  regional wholesale markets, and urban and rural farm product  markets become gradually better coordinated. All localities  should integrate the implementation of the "shopping basket"  program with the development of wholesale markets for selected  farm products in production areas. At the same time, it is also  necessary to build wholesale markets for agricultural and  sideline products in marketing areas. In addition, all  localities should actively explore the cultivation and  construction of markets for production elements. In particular,  attention should be paid to building a rural workforce market to  ensure a rational and orderly workforce flow.    -- It is necessary to promote an integrated operation of  trade, industry and agriculture. The integrated operation of  trade, industry and agriculture is an inevitable trend of  agricultural development and rural economic development. When  an agricultural institution runs an economic entity, it should  do all it can to become an integrated trade-industry-agriculture  operation. It should constantly expand its area of service and  set up various stations and workshops to serve farming  households. In running village and town enterprises,  particularly those processing agricultural and sideline  products, we should develop integrated  trade-industry-agriculture operations and set up economic  associations and enterprise groups featuring strong industries,  famous-brand products, or backbone enterprises. We should  popularize development by letting market forces guide production  bases and linking production bases with farming households, and  we should gradually develop one socialized service for  regionalized crop cultivation, specialized production, and  integrated operation. In short, we should develop various forms  of integrated trade- industry-agriculture organization to link  the small-scale production of farming households with the big  markets.    -- It is necessary to perfect the basic rural operation  system. The central authorities have decided to extend current  agricultural land contracts for 30 more years and permit  compensated transfer of the right to land use according to law.  All localities and agricultural departments should provide good  guidance in this regard. At present, we should pay attention to  two problems. One is that we must not use any pretext to cancel  or change the contracts before they expire. The other is that  we must not arbitrarily increase fees for contractual  operations, nor increase the peasants' burden in a disguised  form. We should also promote timely reform of the animal  husbandry system this year, with the emphasis on implementing  the compensated grassland contract responsibility system.    -- It is necessary to actively develop the rural  share-holding cooperative system. The share-holding cooperative  system is a new form of property right created by peasants in  recent years. We should actively support it, provide correct  guidance for it, and gradually standardize it.    -- It is necessary to promote healthy development of the  rural cooperative foundations. Agricultural management  departments at all levels should, as always, guide and support  the development of rural cooperative foundations. Correct  guidance should be provided to solve problems accompanying the  development of some rural cooperative foundations. Existing  regulations should be applied to govern the development of the  rural cooperative foundations.    -- It is necessary to accelerate the reform of state-owned  agricultural enterprises. At present, state-owned agricultural  enterprises generally have problems such as inflexible  operational mechanisms, weakness in adapting to market demand,  and low economic efficiency. We should increase the weight of  reform. All localities should pay more attention to the central  link -- invigorating operational mechanisms -- and enhance the  self- development and ability to compete in the market of those  enterprises. It is necessary to broaden the concept of reform  in accordance with the requirements of the modern enterprise  system, and to take greater steps to reform the system of  property rights. In reform of small enterprises which operate on  small profits or even losses, we should boldly introduce the  leasing system, reorganize them into share-holding cooperative  firms, or sell them through auction. State-owned land  reclamation enterprises should continue to stabilize and improve  the agricultural operation system of "small farms within big  farm." At the same time, they should actively practice the land  lease system on a trial basis.    Liu Jiang also emphasized: To meet the needs of deepened  rural reform, we should enrich the contents of the experiment on  rural reform experimental zones, properly readjust their  geographical distribution, and do an even better job in  integrating experimental reform with economic development.</p>

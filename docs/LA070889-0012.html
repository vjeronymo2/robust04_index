			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR CUTS FREELY AT FUNDS FOR COUNTY  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's blue pencil fell heavy on San Diego County Friday as  he vetoed millions of dollars in local projects before signing the state's  $49.3-billion budget.  </P> <P> Despite the cuts, Deukmejian left intact legislation sponsored by Assemblyman  Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad) to set aside $500,000 to help build migrant  farm-worker housing in North County, a proposal that the governor disallowed  last year.  </P> <P> "I'm extremely pleased that there is recognition that the homeless problem is  much greater than the usual view of people wandering on the streets in the  inner-city," Frazee said Friday.  </P> <P> Last year, Deukmejian vetoed the $500,000 migrant housing request after  explaining that "there did not seem to be community support for the program,"  Frazee said.  </P> <P> That observation prompted Frazee to pull together community activists and other  local governmental officials in a task force to address the problem and send a  message to the governor that San Diego County needs the housing to help farm  workers now living in makeshift huts in North County ravines and canyons.  </P> <P> "They are economic contributors to our society, and there's a recognition that  there needs to be participation by all levels of government in solving the  problem," he said, adding that the one-time $500,000 appropriation is intended  to be used as "seed" money for housing projects.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lost Out on Parks, Education  </P> <P> While the county picked up money for farm-worker housing, it lost several key  park and higher education projects in Deukmejian's quest to trim $489 million  -- or 1% -- of the spending plan sent to him by the Legislature last week.  </P> <P> Gone is $375,000 set aside by the Legislature to pay for restoration of Mission  Bay, which has been bedeviled by a series of sewage spills in recent years.  Also gone is $4.7 million lawmakers set aside for a new chemistry and geology  building at San Diego State University.  </P> <P> Another cut erased $2.7 million for the purchase of the Bohannon Pottery  Village as part of the Old Town State Park, described by Assemblywoman Lucy  Killea (D-San Diego) as one of the biggest losses in this year's budget wars.  </P> <P> Killea and other legislators wanted to purchase the village property to create  a formal entrance to the popular tourist attraction. "That's something we can  come back on and recoup next year," Killea said. "I intend to work on it."  </P> <P> Deukmejian also deleted $1.2 million that state Sen. William A. Craven  (R-Oceanside) wanted to buy 2.15 acres close to the Torrey Pines State Beach  and Reserve.  </P> <P> An aide to Craven said Friday that the money was not a new appropriation, but  was actually money left over from another, unsuccessful San Diego County park  project that was included in the governor's proposed budget earlier this year.  </P> <P> "We just wanted to keep the money in San Diego and he turned us down," said  Scott Johnson, the aide. "We asked for a little and got less. We're disgusted."  </P> <P> The scenic property, owned by former San Diego Charger Lance Alworth, is at  Camino del Mar and Carmel Valley Road and has been openly coveted by  environmentalists ever since Alworth announced plans to develop a restaurant  and office building there.  </P> <P> Other San Diego County items cut from the budget include:  </P> <P> * $75,000 for the Regional Water Quality Control Board to help coordinate a  multi-agency effort to clean up San Diego Bay.  </P> <P> * $55,000 to establish a temporary San Diego field office for the state's  Public Utilities Commission, which will be considering the fate of the proposed  San Diego Gas &amp; Electric merger with Southern California Edison.  </P> <P> * $500,000 set aside to help the PUC pay for "public education, understanding  and participation" in the proposed merger deliberations. The governor said the  PUC's division of ratepayer advocates should handle such a task. "It would be  inappropriate for a government entity to collect funds for the type of  informational activities specified in this provision," Deukmejian wrote in his  veto message.  </P> <P> * Two appropriations to UC San Diego, one for $428,000 to research alternatives  to animal experiments and the other for $300,000 to conduct aquaculture and  fisheries research.  </P> <P> The governor also slashed two-thirds of a proposed $75 million in extra money  to go for mental health programs statewide.  </P> <P> In terms of San Diego County, that cut means local mental health programs will  receive an estimated $3.2 million instead of the nearly $6 million in extra  funds set aside by the Legislature.  </P> <P> But Deukmejian also took steps to help San Diego County -- and others that have  been traditionally under-funded for mental health programs -- in the long run  by making sure a special formula is used to help them catch up.  </P> <P> The formula was written into state law three years ago and directs that at  least half of all increases in the mental health budget go toward those  under-funded counties. But a legislative conference committee, at the behest of  Los Angeles lawmakers, changed that language to minimize the so-called  equalization.  </P> <P> Deukmejian deleted the conference committee language and restored the special  formula that favors the under-funded counties such as San Diego.  </P></p>

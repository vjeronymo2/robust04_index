			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares turn higher on interest rate optimism - Market Report The London stock market's new 10-day rolling settlement system got off to a smooth start yesterday, with no sign that trading volumes were affected to any great extent. Share prices traced an uncertain pattern, taking their lead from the bond markets, which turned higher in the second half of the session. At the close the FT-SE 100 Index was 7.2 up at 3,082, and responding to activity in stock index futures, where the September contract on the Footsie was within 3 points of 3,100. London markets turned higher in the second half of the session after comments from a member of the Bundesbank council raised hopes that the German central bank may decide to reduce its key interest rates when its policy council meets on Thursday. Equities opened nervously at the opening of a week which brings a heavy list of economic data from the UK, Germany and the US. With investors still nervous over the performance of the dollar and European bonds, markets are likely to focus on tomorrow's testimony to Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, as well as on the German M3 money supply news expected this week and the meeting at the Bundesbank. In early trading, the Footsie was down by about 14 points, unsettled by falls in British government bonds as they awaited details of the bond auction which was announced late on Friday. Traders commented that the big securities houses, having established some excellent paper profits over the previous three trading sessions, were inclined to hold back and watch the European bond markets for a lead. Shares began to steady after a member of the Bundesbank council suggested that inflation forecasts might be lowered. Later, the Bundesbank said it would hold a press conference after its Thursday policy meeting, which is the last before the summer break. Both developments were taken optimistically by the bond markets and equities soon followed suit. The improvement in share prices was very modest but the Footsie crawled to a net gain of 10 points in the early afternoon before slowing down as Wall Street made an equally sluggish start - the Dow Jones Industrial Average showing a 5-point fall in UK hours. However, support spread across the broad range of the market, lifting the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 9 points to 3,560.3. The final picture was still somewhat erratic, with media stocks standing out strongly as expectations of an upturn in advertising revenues brought determined buying in relatively thin markets. Optimism over the outlook for interest rates helped some retail stocks, as well as bringing sharp rises in those building and construction shares with exposure to the German economy. Banking shares, too, continued to respond to hopes that domestic interest rates can at least be kept at present levels until the end of the year; lower interest rates have helped the banks' bad debt lists as well as taking some of the pressure off their customers. The insurance sector appeared unaffected by press suggestions of further problems with pension transfer policies, which already threaten the industry with significant compensation liabilities. Trading volume, as measured by the Seaq electronic network, totalled a respectable 518m shares, with around 58 per cent of the figure coming from non-Footsie stocks. On Friday, 856.4m shares moved through Seaq, returning net worth of Pounds 1.57bn, comfortably at the higher end of daily averages. Following the opening yesterday of the Stock Exchange 10-day rolling settlement system, the Account Dealing Dates table, previously carried in this column, has been discontinued.</p>

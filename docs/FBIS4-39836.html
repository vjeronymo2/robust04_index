			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/6/1994 -- The negotiations  between the Moldovan and Romanian Ministries of Foreign Affairs  on changing the status of the [border crossing] points of  Cahul-Oancea, Sculeni-Sculeni Giurgiulesti, and Costesti-Stanca  began today in Galati, Romania. The Moldovan delegation, headed  by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexandru Burian, is  comprised by representatives of customs departments. Sources  from the government told BASAPRESS that these negotiations are  held according to the 15 February 1994 Governmental Agreement.  According to it, some passage points would be granted  international status. The same source mentioned that the,  Cahul-Oancea, Sculeni-Sculeni Giurgiulesti, and Costesti-Stanca  passage points were opened in 1991 to facilitate border traffic  and serve only Moldovan and Romanian citizens and economic  companies. At the same time, Ukraine and other East European  countries want to cross their goods and passengers at these  points, at Giurgiulesti, in particular. The negotiations in  Galati will not alter the passage regulations for Moldovan and  Romanian citizens. Economic experts assert that one of the most  difficult problems arising with this change of the passage  points' status would be the creation of conditions corresponding  to European standards for which Moldova is unprepared.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by H. Iwamoto, S. Hangeishi, M. Kaneko, S. Ogawa, </F> and M. Hosomi, Toyota Motor Corp.]    [Text] In order to investigate the vibration  characteristics of exhaust pipes, we developed a computer system  that uses the finite element method (FEM). This system enables  the production of simple FEM models whose numerical calculations  agree quite well with actual measurements. In this paper, we  give an overview of the system and discuss some applications of  the system in design.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   As automobiles have gotten more sophisticated and higher  quality over the past few years, there have been more and more  demands for vibrational sounds to be reduced. The large degree  to which the exhaust system contributes to vibrational sound  makes it necessary that even small measures be taken to reduce  vibration. Due to earlier studies to make the automobile  lighter, cheaper, and faster, a lot of hope is being placed on  simulation technology.    The vibrational sound produced by the exhaust system of a  car  can be divided into three types, namely, emission noise,  radiation noise, and vibration transmission noise. A study was  launched to analyze vibration transmission by the finite element  method.[.sup](1,2,3)[/] The method that had been used until  now involved a stress analysis using a plate model of the  tailpipe joined to the muffler. An actual exhaust system,  however, uses both a catalytic converter and flexible pipe, so  it takes an enormous amount of time to create a computation  model when trying to make a plate model of all the elements.  Furthermore, since doing analysis requires specialized  knowledge, the average design specialist finds it difficult to  use such systems.    That being the case, in trying to reduce internal car noise  caused by the exhaust system and improve the tailpipe's ability  to withstand engine vibration, we developed a vibration  characteristic analysis system for exhaust systems that the  ordinary design engineer could use. A system such as this  enables a series of work operations starting with the  preparation of the computation model to the display of results  to be performed effortlessly on a CAE terminal. The system also  enables models of catalytic converters and flexible pipes to be  done simply and accurately. In this paper, we provide an  overview of the analysis system, and discuss ways of practically  reducing vibration in cars by studying the computational  accuracy of the exhaust system which includes a catalytic  converter and flexible pipe.  <H5>  2. System Outlined </H5>   In order to analyze the vibration transmission  characteristic  of the entire exhaust system, we built a system in which the  ordinary design engineer could do on a CAE terminal without much  difficulty. In Figure 1, we show the configuration of the system  and the computational flow. The system consists of CAD,  preprocessing, postprocessing, a characteristic data unit, and a  solver.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-18A>      Figure 1. Calculation Flow </FIG>    The computation model is concerned with the area directly  after the exhaust manifold from the flange to the end of the  exhaust system, but also includes various support elements  mounted to the body. As seen in Figure 2, the model is made one  component at a time and a standard mesh pattern is used to  automatically separate the components in the database. The model  separates the different pipes into beam elements, and the  muffler, flange, and supports into plate elements. In developing  the model, consideration is given to reducing the rigidity of  the curved pipe, and to reducing the Young percentage in  materials. The engine vibration data, which is input externally,  and the actual data on things such as quality, dynamic spring  constant, and attenuation constant, which are the  characteristics of the flexible pipe and catalytic converter,  are input from a CAD terminal.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-19A>      Figure 2. Modeling Image </FIG>    In Figure 3, we illustrate a computation model. This  particular model consists of 3,000 nodal points and 2,100  elements, and took more than 16 hours to create. This was,  however, five times faster than conventional systems when it  comes to making a model of this type.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-19B>      Figure 3. Structure and FEM Element Division of Exhaust System </FIG>    Merely by separating the input into eigenvalue and response  calculations, we eliminated the need to set analysis conditions  which require a lot of time and special expertise. The computer  used for the calculations was a Cray Y-MP supercomputer. The  analysis program used was called NASTRAN.    The calculated results were displayed so that reconfigured  diagrams, animation, vibration, stress frequency  characteristics, and stress distribution could be processed with  minimal operation.    This type of system allows an ordinary design specialist to  create a computation model, display the results, and analyze the  vibration transmission characteristic of an exhaust system.  <H5>  3. Study of Computational Accuracy </H5>   Using the FEM system, we did an analysis of the exhaust  system and compared the results obtained with actual  measurements based on hammer excitation. The areas of comparison  were the frequency responses obtained from the resonance mode  and No. 1 support unit in the exhaust system.  <H5>  3.1 Basic Exhaust System </H5>   The basic exhaust system shown in Figure 3 is comprised of a  sub-muffler, a main muffler, and pipes and supports that link  them together. In Figure 4, we show a comparison between  calculated and actual measurements. There was good agreement  between actual and calculated values for both the frequency  responses and resonance modes. In terms of computation accuracy,  the resonance frequency fell within +/- 10 Hz and the vibration  level to within +/- 5 dB, providing a level of accuracy good  enough for commercial use.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-20A>      Figure 4. Base of Exhaust System </FIG>  <H5>  3.2 Exhaust System With Catalytic Converter </H5>   We added a catalytic converter to the exhaust system used in  the previous section and studied computation accuracy. We input  the actual mass and moment of inertia along three axes of the  catalytic converter, and as shown in Figure 5, constructed a  model in which the mass points were linked by solid body and  spring elements. In Figure 6, we show a comparison between  calculated and actual measurements. There was good agreement  between actual and measured for both frequency responses and  resonance modes, and due to the addition of the catalytic  converter, we were able to estimate the changes in the vibration  characteristic of the exhaust system. In terms of computation  accuracy, resonance frequency fell within +/- 10 Hz and the  vibration level was within +/- 10 dB, providing us with a level  of accuracy good enough for commercial use.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-20B>      Figure 5. FEM Model of Catalytic Converter </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-20C>      Figure 6. Exhaust System With Catalytic Converter </FIG>  <H5>  3.3 Exhaust System Built With Flexible Piping </H5>   We added flexible pipe to the exhaust system used in the  previous section and studied computation accuracy. We input the  actual mass and dynamic spring constant along three axes of the  flexible piping, and as shown in Figure 7, constructed a beam  model. In Figure 8, we show a comparison between calculated and  actual measurements. There was good agreement between actual and  measured for both frequency response tendencies and resonance  modes. There was a big gap of more than 90Hz between actual and  measured in the vibration level, but this was because the  calculated results produced a frequency response diagram in  which there was a uniform applied damping constant throughout  the entire excitation mode compared to actual measurements in  which the damping effect on the flexible piping was irregular.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-20D>      Figure 7. FEM Model of Flexible Pipe </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-20E>      Figure 8. Exhaust System With Flexible Pipe </FIG>    As we have seen above, using this system, we are now able to  satisfactorily estimate the vibration transmission  characteristic of an exhaust system.  <H5>  4. Applications for Reduced Exhaust System Vibration </H5>   The main compelling force acting on the exhaust system is  the  vibration of the power plant, which includes the engine among  other things. Generally speaking, when the resonance frequencies  of the exhaust system are vibrating at the same frequency as  these, the exhaust system vibrates severely. This causes sound  problems such as poor idling or loud internal noises, and  strength problems as well, including the inability to withstand  resonating vibrations. To resolve these problems, we installed  flexible pipe, a mass damper, and dynamic damper to help reduce  the points of resonance and resonance levels, and reduce the  body transmission force by tuning the support system (cf. Figure  9).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-21A>      Figure 9. Conceptual Scheme for Reducing Exhaust Vibration </FIG>  <H5>  4.1 Effect of Bending Rigidity in Flexible Piping </H5>   We examined the effect that the bending rigidity of the  flexible pipe has on the overall vibration characteristic of the  exhaust system. For the computation model, we used the same  exhaust system as was used in Section 3.3 above which had a  catalytic converter and flexible pipe, and input the bending  rigidity of the pipe as initial -20% and -40%  changes. In  Figure 10, we show the frequency response results for the No. 1  support unit. We can predict from this that changing the bending  rigidity of the piping to more than 50Hz is an effective means  of reducing the resonance frequency of the exhaust system.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-21B>      Figure 10. Effect of Spring Constant </FIG>  <H5>  4.2 Effect of Support Positions </H5>   Next, using the same computation model as in the previous  section, we examined what effect the position of the No. 1  support unit, which is a response point, has on the overall  vibration characteristic of the exhaust system. We moved the  position of the support unit backward relative to the exhaust  system at 100mm intervals. In Figure 11, we show the frequency  response results for the No. 1 support unit. This has a 50Hz or  more effect on the exhaust system, so we can estimate what the  effect will be relative to the resonance mode. For example, in  contrast to resonance frequencies in the 60Hz resonance mode, we  can estimate that the peak characteristic of the vibrations will  all but disappear by moving the support unit back by 200mm.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-21C>      Figure 11. Effect of Flexible Pipe Position </FIG>  <H5>  4.3 Practical Applications in Cars </H5>   Finally, we look at some examples of how this system can be  applied practically to actual car exhaust systems that have  adopted flexible pipe as shown in Figure 12. This exhaust system  had an exhaust system resonance of about 25Hz when first  developed. In Figure 13, we show the actual and measured  frequency responses of the No. 2 support unit before any  corrective actions had been taken. By studying numerous cases,  we determined that adding a No. 2 support mass damper would be  an effective corrective measure. In Figure 14, we show the  numerical results from adding the damper. In the actual car,  adding the damper was effective in reducing resonance vibration  by 2Hz and the vibration level by 5 dB.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-22A>      Figure 12.

Effect of Damper </FIG>   <H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>   (1) We developed a vibration characteristic analysis system  for exhaust systems that any ordinary design specialist would  not find difficult to use.    (2) We studied making models of a flexible pipe and  catalytic  converter, and in so doing, were able to predict the vibration  characteristic of the exhaust system with good accuracy.    (3) Using this system, we were able to estimate the  vibration  characteristic of the exhaust system and effectively reduce  vibrations.  Bibliography    1.

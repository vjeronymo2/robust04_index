			<p>BFN     [Text] Private-sector representatives recently submitted a  package of proposals to the government calling for deregulation  of 71 items to open Japanese markets wider. But it was only two  items for which relevant government offices decided to "take  action" for deregulation.    This was disclosed in a report compiled by a working group  of  the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters [ARPH] (headed  by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata) for the government, which is  currently engaged in the task of compiling a package of  deregulation measures before the end of June. The group  gathered opinions of ministries and agencies concerned on the  private sector's deregulation package and included them in the  report.    At a meeting with Prime Minister Hata on 13 May, Keidanren  [Federation of Economic Organizations] Vice Chairman Isao  Nakauchi (chairman of supermarket giant Daiei) strongly demanded  promotion of deregulation. He is an influential member of the  ARPH's "import promotion, improvement of market access, and  distribution" working group. It seems that behind his strong  demand lies the apathy of government offices to deregulation.  His demand also suggests bureaucrats' strong resistance to  deregulation.    The report compiled by the working group summarizes opinions  of relevant ministries and agencies on the private sector's  package of proposals for deregulation of 71 items. In the  report, these items are classified into three groups -- one for  which "actions will be taken in line with proposals," one for  which "taking action will be considered," and the other for  which "no action will be taken because the proposals are based  on misunderstandings."    Of the 71 items, only two fall into the first group. They  are "shortening the term for granting a license for food  businesses" and "easing regulations on foreign capital inflow  into the first-class telecommunications business." Twenty-nine  items, including "simplifying procedures for obtaining a license  for dealing in antiques," fall into the second group; 25 items,  including "allowing the establishment of holding companies" and  "introducing a self-service system in service stations," are in  the third group. Another 15 items are considered a group for  which "actions have already been taken."    At a meeting on 12 May, working group experts, including  Nakauchi, severely criticized response of the government offices  to the proposals. On 18 May, Nakauchi submitted a letter to  government offices complaining against their reluctance to  deregulation. In the letter, he said: "Although deregulation  is urged by the people and other countries, government offices'  attitude of trying to protect their authority remains unchanged.  This is very regrettable."</p>

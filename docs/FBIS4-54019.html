			<p>CSO     [Text] The International Marine Satellite Organization  (INMARSAT) whose membership includes communications companies of  74 nations will establish a satellite-based mobile  communications operating firm by the end of 1994. The  organization had launched a goal to establish a global  satellite-based cellular telephone service project called  "INMARSAT P" by the year 2000 and had been conducting a review  as to whether it should handle the project as a parent-company  function or under the control of a subsidiary. Kokusai Denshin  Denwa (KDD) which is Japan's only member of the organization  intends to invest in the new company.    The decision to establish the new company was made at  INMARSAT's recent board meeting held in London. Further, an  informal decision has been made to operate the satellite at a  "medium orbit" of 13,155 kilometers altitude.    The new company will first be established with capital  completely paid for by businesses that are currently members and  investors in INMARSAT, and its monopolistic characteristic will  be lessened by subsequent capital contributions of 30 percent by  businesses that are not members of INMARSAT. INMARSAT P will  provide telephone, facsimile, and data communications services  using palm-sized cellular instruments. Its goal is to begin  services in 1999 or 2000 after an investment of about $2.4  billion.    Several private-sector projects such as Motorola's "Iridium  Project" are under way to provide global cellular communication  services. It appears that INMARSAT decided to establish a  separate company for fear that operation of the proposed system  by INMARSAT itself might lead to criticism of "unfair  competition."</p>

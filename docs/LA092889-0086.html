			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> AUTOMATED TRASH PICKUP  </P> <P> An additional 8,000 homes will be converted to curbside automated trash service  under the second phase of a four-year conversion plan, approved Tuesday by the  Pasadena Board of Directors.  </P> <P> Service to the second group of homes will begin July 1, 1990, bringing to  11,000 the number of homes using the service.  </P> <P> The city provides trash pickup to 27,000 homes in Pasadena, most of which still  receive back yard trash-pickup service. Collectors ride scooters into  residents' back yards, dump the trash into the scooters, then drive the loads  out and dump them into a waiting trash pickup truck.  </P> <P> Increases in landfill and labor costs have forced the city, however, to change  to the cheaper curbside service. The new service uses trucks with specially  equipped mechanical arms to lift and dump trash cans placed at the curb by  residents.  </P> <P> Residents using the new service receive a $6 reduction in their monthly trash  pickup fee of $18.70.  </P></p>

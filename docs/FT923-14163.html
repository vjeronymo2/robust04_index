			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hafnia wins time in survival bid  -A look at the problems confronting the Danish insurance-based financial services group which came close to receivership last weekend 'WE HAVE won the first battle, and we have gained the potential to win the next ones as well,' said Mr Olav Grue, recently-appointed chief executive of Hafnia, the insurance-based financial services group which came perilously close to going into receivership last weekend. The next battles will include cuts in staff and disposal of subsidiaries which could lead to the company cutting staff by about 1,000 from 3,700. Sale of Hafnia's UK subsidiary, Prolific, the life assurance and pension management company, bought by Hafnia in 1989, is thought to be high on the list of priorities, but Mr Grue would not comment on either this or the size of staff cuts. Mr Grue, formerly managing director of an industrial finance fund, was brought in on June 2, when the company was in serious financial trouble. Within days the situation worsened. Denmark's June 2 referendum rejecting the Maastricht treaty caused share and bond prices to fall, further undermining the group's equity capital. Then, last week, there was a fresh shock for the group. It was revealed that a senior manager, since dismissed, had made irregular commitments in the spring to buy shares forward at a fixed price, with a total estimated loss to the group of about DKr350m (Dollars 60.8m). These commitments were not known to the directors and were not correctly entered into Hafnia's books. By July 2, the group's equity capital was a negative DKr450m. Over the weekend auditors worked round the clock to see whether there were any other hidden losses, which could have forced the group into receivership. The auditors cleared the group, which meant its banks and the guarantors of a vital new rights share issue to raise DKr2bn, continued to support Hafnia. Subscriptions to the rights issue went ahead on Monday. 'We have now gained the necessary time and freedom of manoeuvre,' said Mr Grue. A bizarre aspect of the irregular share purchase commitments involved the country's only stock exchange-listed soccer club, Brondby. The club held 73 per cent of the shares in a small Copenhagen niche bank, Interbank, but as the club's fortunes on the football field declined the club decided to sell the shares. The option deal with Hafnia meant the club was able to raise temporary finance while it tried to sell the shares. The first that Hafnia's board knew about the deal, priced at DKr288m and giving Hafnia a loss of DKr35m to DKr45m, was when the two broking firms which had arranged the option called last week to ask for their money. Yesterday, however, Hafnia informed the stock exchange of new irregularities. Disclosure is obligatory for share holdings of over 5 per cent, but Hafnia had not disclosed a 41.99 per cent holding in Dansk Traelast, a large timber and building materials group. The basic reason for the group's difficulties is not the share deals, but the sorry story of what happened when the group tried to adapt itself to an increasingly competitive European insurance market. After failed merger talks with domestic rival Baltica in early 1990, Hafnia mounted a hostile raid, buying up over one-third of the shares in Baltica Holding. Baltica held out against the pressure, and when the price of Baltica's shares fell, Hafnia's financial position was seriously weakened. Hafnia's next move was to try to establish a Nordic insurance group. Last winter, together with Norway's UNI Storebrand, it tried to gain control of Sweden's Skandia, the largest of the Nordic insurance company's. This venture, too, fell through. In the process of acquiring 14.8 per cent of the shares in Skandia, Hafnia Holding illegally borrowed money from its insurance subsidiaries, which precipitated the dismissal of Mr Per Villum Hansen, the group's chief executive, in April. These transactions, as well as the share dealings, are subject to police investigations. Over the past 18 months, Hafnia's share capital has slumped from DKr6bn to a negative figure, mainly because of the decline in the value of the Baltica and Skandia shareholdings and the cost of financing these investments. As recently as December 31, the equity capital of the group was worth DKr3.1bn. Crucial to Mr Grue and his chairman, Mr Holger Lavesen's, strategy for the group is the disposal of the shares in Baltica and Skandia. Preliminary discussions are taking place with Skandia, Baltica and Storebrand, but as yet they do not have the character of negotiations, Mr Grue said.' We are engaged in mutual discussions, but not negotiations. At the moment that is all I can say.'</p>

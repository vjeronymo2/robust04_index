			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Major focuses pact hopes on Ulster Unionists MR JOHN MAJOR is keeping open the option of a post-election deal with Unionist MPs in Ulster after his flat rejection at the weekend of Liberal Democrat terms for a pact in a hung parliament. In his speech to Tory activists at the launch of the Conservative election campaign in Torquay, the prime minister dismissed any suggestion that he would agree the move to proportional representation which Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, has set as the price of his party's support. Mr Major also set out an uncompromising stance against devolution for Scotland, warning that an assembly in Edinburgh would lead inexorably to the break up of the UK. However, efforts to re-establish an assembly at Stormont could form the centrepiece of a strategy designed to win the support of Unionist MPs if the prime minister fails to win an outright majority on April 9. There are currently 13 MPs representing the unionist cause in Ulster. Senior ministers said last night that they had not drawn up formal proposals to present to the Official Unionists (who hold nine seats) or to the smaller Democratic Unionists (three seats) and Ulster Popular Unionists (one seat). The cabinet agreed last week that there should be no public discussion during the campaign of any deal that might be struck with minority parties. Mr Major underlined that stance in an interview with BBC Radio's The World This Weekend, when he stressed repeatedly that he was confident of winning an overall majority. But ministers believe that if the Conservatives fall just short of the 326 seats needed for a majority, a deal could be struck at least with the nine Ulster Unionists. The suggestion now being canvassed by cabinet members is that the current all-party talks in Ulster would be accelerated with the aim of re-establishing a measure of self-rule in the province. If the creation of an assembly could be agreed with the Dublin government, the Anglo-Irish agreement would fall into abeyance. Mr Major's apparent flexibility on Ulster contrasts starkly with the hard-line position he established in Torquay on both electoral reform and devolution. Pouring scorn on suggestions that the abolition of the first-past-the-post voting system would lead to a fairer system, he said: 'There will be no deals with those opportunists who stand for nothing except their own political self-interest.' He added that instead 'we are going to show up their PR campaign for the sham that it is'. Mr Major was equally adamant in his opposition to the proposals for devolution in Scotland advocated by the opposition parties. He said these could put the UK on the road to a 'Disunited Kingdom'.</p>

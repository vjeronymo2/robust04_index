			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVEN PRIDE IS LOST IN 112-79 BEATING BY JAZZ;  </P> <P> CLIPPERS: STILL STUCK ON 26 VICTORIES, LOS ANGELES IS BATTERED AT SPORTS ARENA.  </P> <P> Something had to give, and Saturday night it was Clipper pride -- boosted by  recent solid showings, albeit in losses, but now in need of mending.  </P> <P> Complete reconstruction, maybe, after the way the Utah Jazz gave them the  fold-spindle-and-mutilate treatment, 112-79, at the Sports Arena, the Clippers'  second-worst loss of the season.  </P> <P> This after saving face despite defeats at Denver, Utah and the Forum. Back  home, though, the Clippers' heads were handed to them.  </P> <P> "We had feelings that something like this would happen during this stretch,"  Clipper Coach Don Casey said. "But not at home."  </P> <P> That's the confounding part, especially for a team that makes its best  impressions at the Sports Arena and struggles on the road. Suddenly, it's like  that pattern has changed.  </P> <P> "It is confusing," forward Ken Norman said after the Clippers scored 11 points  in the fourth quarter -- their fewest in a period this season -- and set  another team low for points in a game. "We have played well on the road, even  if we haven't been getting the results."  </P> <P> Maybe the Clippers were tired because of the tough stretch of schedule?  </P> <P> "Me, personally, no," Norman said. "I can't speak for the other guys. But  something is definitely wrong."  </P> <P> There usually is when one player has more assists than your entire team, 20-16.  John Stockton, yes, but one player.  </P> <P> Karl Malone complemented Stockton's efforts with 31 points and 18 rebounds as  the Jazz (50-19) set a franchise record with their 18th road victory.  </P> <P> Benoit Benjamin had 20 points and 12 rebounds, both team highs, for the  Clippers, who dropped to 26-43 and were swept in a season series for the first  time by the New Orleans/Utah Jazz.  </P> <P> In facing Denver, Utah and the Lakers in consecutive games, the Clippers didn't  get a break with the schedule, which shouldn't be a surprise. The usual lineup  these days is something like a playoff preview, with the Clippers, though not  mathematically eliminated from postseason play, best suited for the role of  spoiler.  </P> <P> If they don't wilt first, at least. Though playing well on the recent  three-game trip, the Clippers began the night stuck on 26 victories and losers  of four in a row.  </P> <P> "We're going to get to the 30-win mark even if it kills us," Casey said after  Friday's loss to the Lakers at the Forum. "Or me. Whatever comes first."  </P> <P> Casey smiled, but the immediate future does not hold much promise. The Clippers  are in the midst of a streak of 14 games against 11 different opponents with a  combined .563 winning percentage going into Saturday night's games. And that  includes Minnesota (17-50) and Sacramento (21-46).  </P> <P> This was the second time in four nights they'd played Utah, leaders of the  Midwest Division and threatening the Lakers for the best record in the Western  Conference. Wednesday at Salt Lake City, the Clippers stayed with the Jazz for  three quarters before being dominated the final 12 minutes.  </P> <P> In the rematch Saturday, it was much different, Utah waiting only until the  second quarter to take control.  </P> <P> The last six minutes settled that. The Clippers, down by 12 points in the first  quarter, had climbed back to within 37-31. But after the teams traded baskets,  the Jazz went on a 19-4 run the final 5:47 of the first half, making it 58-37  at intermission. That included an 11-0 run the last 3:13.  </P> <P> After shooting 58.8% the first quarter, the Clippers, who next face Minnesota  before playing the Lakers again, converted only 31.6% the second period. They  didn't score the for final 3 1/2 minutes and got just three baskets in the last  9:10 of the half.  </P> <P> Of Utah's 21-point halftime lead, 19 came off Clipper turnovers.  </P> <P> The Clippers couldn't make a run in the third quarter, not even after Mark  Eaton, a big factor inside, was ejected with 10:39 remaining. The Jazz center,  who had four points and four rebounds, was tossed by referee Earl Strom after  arguing over his fourth foul, leaving the bench with a sarcastic bow.  </P> <P> Charles Smith made one of the two free-throw attempts on the double technical.  That cut the Utah advantage to 60-40.  </P> <P> The Clippers committed only six turnovers in the second half, but the damage  was done. Whatever hope remained went out with a three-of-17 shooting  performance in the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

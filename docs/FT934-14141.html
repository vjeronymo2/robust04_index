			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Japan's MPs begin debate on reforms: Hosokawa stakes his reputation on getting four bills passed JAPAN'S lower house of parliament yesterday began its first full-scale debate on the new government's plan for the most radical reform of the political system since the 1940s. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, has staked his political reputation on passing the four reform bills by the end of the year, widely interpreted as a pledge to resign if they fail. Political observers agreed yesterday that Mr Hosokawa's chances are finely balanced, despite his high popularity. The bills, prepared by the seven-party coalition, aim to end the corruption which contributed to last July's election defeat of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party after 38 years in power and after several failed attempts at reform. Under the present system, the lower chamber has a multi-seat constituency system, discredited for pitting candidates of the same party against each other, so encouraging them to use money and influence, rather than policies, to attract votes. The government proposals would create a 500-seat lower chamber, in place of the present 511 seats, of which 250 would be in single-seat constituencies and 250 chosen by proportional representation. Voters would cast two ballots. Corporate donations to individual politicians would be banned, though companies would be allowed to give cash to political parties. There would be a state subsidy of Y41.4bn (Pounds 254m) a year to parties, to distribute to politicians, under the government's plans. Mr Hosokawa said yesterday he wanted to push the reform plans through the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, by November 5 to leave enough time for them to get through the House of Councillors, the upper chamber, by the end of the year. His chances of success are complicated by the fact that an unknown number of members of the Social Democratic Party, the largest coalition partner, plan to vote against the bills. The SDP is unhappy with single-seat constituencies, because it feels it would do less badly under proportional representation. Some LDP rebels could vote with the coalition, but it is not yet clear whether there will be enough defectors to give the government a majority. Soon after the election defeat, many in the LDP felt the reform debate would be a chance to bring down Mr Hosokawa quickly. However, his subsequently high popularity ratings (more than 70 per cent in recent polls) indicated that the LDP might suffer if it were publicly held responsible for derailing Mr Hosokawa and political reform, political observers say. Instead, the LDP's interest has now switched to influencing the content of the reform bills to its advantage. It wants to shift the balance towards single-seat constituencies, in which big, well-funded parties such as the LDP are expected to fare best. Accordingly, the LDP has tabled a counterplan for a 471-seat house, of 300 single-seat constituencies and 171 under proportional representation, chosen by a single ballot. Individual politicians would be allowed to receive corporate donations, through fund-raising organisations, under the LDP plan.</p>

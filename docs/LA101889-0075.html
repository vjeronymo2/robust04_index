			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE OKS FUNDS FOR NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA: PRESIDENT BUSH DOES A SELLING JOB ON CONSERVATIVE SENATORS  WORRIED THAT A VOTE FOR THE MEASURE COULD BE USED AGAINST THEM IN CAMPAIGN  COMMERCIALS.  </P> <P> The Senate on Tuesday approved $9 million to help the Nicaraguan opposition in  that country's elections, but only after President Bush persuaded conservative  senators to put aside fears that the vote could be used against them in  negative campaign commercials.  </P> <P> The senators' anxiety was laced with irony: several of them, including North  Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, were among the earliest and most unrestrained  users of the 30-second political rabbit punches they now fear.  </P> <P> The conservatives favor helping Nicaragua's anti-Communist opposition, but  under Nicaraguan law the U.S. government must pay a $2-million tax to  Nicaragua's Sandinista government to give money to the opposition.  Conservatives fretted all day that the vote could be used by future challengers  in Senate races to accuse them of voting to aid the leftist Sandinista regime.  </P> <P> And Democratic liberals who oppose the aid plan did their best to heighten that  anxiety.  </P> <P> "I'm staggered at the number of people willing to face those 30-second spots,"  Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) said during the debate.  </P> <P> For years, conservatives have called Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega "an avowed  Communist tyrant." Now, Bumpers asked conservative colleagues, how will they  explain that they "gave that scoundrel $2 million of taxpayers' money?"  </P> <P> At the White House, Bush tried to reassure the conservatives, telling a group  of seven Republican Senate leaders at a morning Oval Office meeting that  "senators don't want to give aid to the Sandinistas and neither do we, but we  have no choice," spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> The bill, which passed the Senate 64 to 35, already has passed the House. Bush  is expected to sign it quickly in an effort to get the first money to Nicaragua  before Sunday -- the deadline for voter registration efforts.  </P> <P> The handling of the bill, several senators said, was a dramatic illustration of  how negative campaign blitzes based on controversial votes have altered the  legislative process.  </P> <P> Bumpers, in an interview, laughed as he called the conservative discomfort  "poetic justice" -- a payback for the many times conservative Republicans in  the Senate have put liberals on the spot with roll-call votes that opponents  later featured in negative advertisements.  </P> <P> Others found the day's events more troubling.  </P> <P> "It's the way that campaigns have evolved," said Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum  (R-Kan.). "It becomes very difficult to get the public to see the full scope of  the debate.  </P> <P> "We have a responsibility to lay that to rest," she said, then quickly added,  "but I'm from Kansas," where a relatively small population has limited somewhat  the role of television ads in political campaigns. "It's not a state like  California."  </P> <P> Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), the Republicans' deputy leader, was more blunt.  "There's a lot of duplicity here," he said. "There's not a thing you do here  that can't be turned into a 30-second ad."  </P> <P> The bill approved by the Senate would provide $5 million to a variety of  Nicaraguan groups to use for nonpartisan election assistance -- training for  poll watchers, for example. Another $2 million would go to the main Nicaraguan  opposition coalition to directly support the election of its candidate, Violeta  de Barrios Chamorro, the editor of the La Prensa newspaper, in her race against  Ortega to be president of Nicaragua.  </P> <P> But under Nicaraguan law, any candidate or party receiving money from a  non-Nicaraguan source must pay a tax equal to the amount of the outside  contribution. The tax goes to the government's Electoral Tribunal, which has  been designated to run the election. By comparison, U.S. law flatly forbids any  candidate for federal office from receiving campaign contributions from  foreigners.  </P> <P> The Administration has made the aid a centerpiece of its current Central  American strategy, which seeks to overturn Sandinista power through elections  rather than through the armed conflict that the Reagan Administration had  fostered.  </P> <P> Opponents of the plan have argued that the money is excessive, an effort to  "buy the election."  </P> <P> "This is too much money; it's flooding dollars into Nicaragua," said Sen. Tom  Harkin (D-Iowa), who noted that the money that will go to Chamorro's campaign  will amount to more than $5 for every registered voter in Nicaragua, one of the  world's poorest countries.  </P> <P> Opponents also denounced sending more money to Nicaragua at a time when the  federal government is cutting domestic spending programs to ease the budget  deficit. Led by Harkin, they proposed an amendment forbidding any U.S. money  from going to pay the Nicaraguan tax, which would effectively have killed the  aid package. The amendment put the Administration in the position of asking its  supporters to go on record as voting to give money to Ortega's government.  </P> <P> "We've got this strange coalition of far right and far left" opposing the  Administration, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said before the Senate vote. "When  you get close to entering an election year, people get nervous." Thirty-seven  Senate seats are up for election next year.  </P> <P> Supporters of the aid sought to reassure nervous senators with a letter from  Bush calling the aid "the only means we have to help ensure that democracy  asserts itself peacefully through a free and fair election" and a letter from  Chamorro saying that the "election represents a historical opportunity for  Nicaragua."  </P> <P> After a day full of squirming and maneuvering, the Senate defeated Harkin's  motion, 59 to 40.  </P></p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Two more against Volvo-Renault link The momentum sought by Volvo for the proposed merger of its car and truck operations with France's Renault slowed yesterday when two shareholders announced their rejection of the deal. Fund 92-94, a state-owned investment institution which holds 2.5 per cent of Volvo's voting capital, and Foreningsbanken's investment fund, which holds 0.7 per cent, both cited concerns about the privatisation of Renault in their decisions to vote against the merger at a special shareholders' meeting on December 7. Their stance still left the opposition camp trailing well behind the votes in favour following the decision on Thursday to support the deal by the Fourth Fund state pension fund and the Folksam insurance company, two of the biggest institutional shareholders. Last night, Volvo could count on about 30 per cent of the voting stock, including Renault's 10 per cent and 9 per cent held by Volvo sister companies. Institutions definitely committed to voting against the deal hold 4.5 per cent. Aktiespararna, the small shareholder's association and a critic of the merger, estimates its members have 6 per cent of the votes, but it is unclear how many proxies it will hold. A group of eight Swedish institutions, controlling close to 30 per cent of the votes, have yet to make their final decisions. Three of these, the insurance groups Skandia, Trygg-Hansa and SPP, which together hold 9.6 per cent, previously expressed opposition. Their final positions are expected next week. Volvo wants to achieve a clear majority, partly to fend off the threat of a legal challenge from Aktiespararna which says the merger requires a change in Volvo's articles of association, a move that would need a two-thirds majority rather than a simple majority. Fund 92-94 and Foreningsbanken said their concerns about the uncertainties surrounding the privatisation of Renault had not been allayed by assurances from the French government that it intended selling off its 65 per cent share in the merged company by the end of next year and would not use a planned golden share to dilute Volvo's 35 per cent share. A split within the trade unions at Volvo deepened yesterday when SIF, the white collar union whose 5,000 Volvo members are strongly opposed to the Renault merger, quit the joint union negotiating committee it sat on with the blue collar unions, which support the deal.</p>

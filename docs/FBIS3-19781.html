In Tula, several hundred kilometres to the south, a  television services company is taking a similar credit to expand  its activities, which include advertisement production.    Both borrowers are part of a programme launched by the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], at the  behest of the Group of Seven nations, to foster small  enterprises in Russia.    The EBRD has set aside $300 million and launched pilot work  in Nizny Novgorod, Tula and Tomsk, in western Siberia. The aim  is to deploy small amounts of EBRD money -- financing individual  loans of $50,000-$75,000 -- through local financial institutions  to introduce lenders and borrowers to the ways of the market.    It is a landmark development for the EBRD, which has been  lending to, and taking equity stakes in, the active and  developing private sectors in Central Europe. It has also  participated in development projects in the remote republics of  the former Soviet Union where hardly any private sector exists.    But nothing has been done, either by the EBRD or other  international financial institutions, to fuel the growth of  Russia's small businesses or entrepreneurs.    These have difficulties in borrowing from their own local  banks, which are highly conservative and, in the main, staffed  by former state employees. Emerging small businesses, the seed  corn of any private sector, need to borrow to survive and  prosper.    "We are working to our comparative advantage, focusing on  the  private sector and local enterprises as much as, if not more  than, on joint ventures with foreign partners," says a senior  EBRD official. "You can only really reach them through local  financial institutions."    The EBRD provides all the money, but insists that local  banks  shoulder half the risk. It wants to involve both lender and  borrower in the market, and to encourage the banks to reach out  to more local businesses. The idea is to build on these pilots  and, over the next year or so, to fan out across Russia.    It is one of the changes taking place in an institution once  dubbed "the glistening bank" after the high-spending antics of  Jacques Attali, former president. His successor, Jacques de  Larosiere, shuns the oxygen of publicity as much as Mr Attali  thirsted after it. But the former governor of the Banque de  France has quietly begun to ring changes at the bank.    The Russian programme, for instance, reflects a shift from  the EBRD's previous practice of almost always engaging in joint  venture projects, where local firms have had a foreign investor  as partner, in borrowing countries. But an internal task force  report, set up by Mr de Larosiere to establish the EBRD's  strategic objectives, urged improved country strategies,  focusing credits and investments on local companies, not just on  joint ventures.    More controversially, the report urges the bank to cut back  on public sector loans, boosting lending to the private sector  instead. But like everyone else who has addressed the issue, the  report is silent on whether the bank should seek a changed  mandate freeing it from the obligation to lend 60 percent to the  private sector and fully 40 percent to the public sector.    Though public sector lending was inevitably higher when the  EBRD began operating in 1991, private sectors have mushroomed in  East Europe and the former Soviet Union.    By reorganising the EBRD, Mr de Larosire has gone some way  to  addressing this issue. He has merged the development and  merchant banking arms of the bank, and established a "north" and  "south" region, splitting the bank's operations along geographic  lines.    A senior G-7 official said: "As it grew, the development and  merchant banking teams became embarrassing. Teams moved around  the same country without knowing the others were there."    Mr de LaroSiere, according to this official, has made "an  extremely impressive start." Alongside the reorganisation,"the  new president has imposed a more austere regime, eliminating the  freespending expense account ways of the Attali bank."    He is also encouraging the gradual decentralisation of the  bank, most of whose operations are run from its London  headquarters in Broadgate, by boosting the number of EBRD local  representatives.    This is even being considered as part of the Russian small  business project. If it is successful and local officials  eventually gain decisionmaking powers, this scheme might one day  supersede the regional reorganisation.    But considerable challenges lie ahead. The EBRD rightly  adopts a cautious attitude to loans for "industrial  restructuring" -- converting, for instance, defence plants to  peaceful use or scaling down the communist-era industrial  monoliths -- because these are inherently high risk.    Strategically, it prefers new business creation because in  the medium term this will probably become more important. The  bank's task force report emphasises the quality of lending over  quantity. While this may be the correct course, it could prove  controversial.    One of the charges levelled against the Attali regime was  the  slow pace of lending compared with spending on the bank's new  headquarters. Yet placing the weight on quality loans will  ensure that continues.    The total value of projects approved by the end of last year  amounted to ECU3.759 billion (2.9 billion pounds) (mobilising,  in theory, some ECUll.405 billion in investments when private  and insitutitional Western investment in EBRD projects is taken  into account).    But only ECU556 million was disbursed at end-l993. Although  the pace of loan, credit or equity agreements is quickening, the  total still looks a drop in the ocean to participants in the  emerging market economies in East Europe and the former Soviet  Union.    Yet it is against this backdrop that the task force report  audaciously urges shareholding governments to begin  consideration of an EBRD capital increase next year. But it  acknowledges that the emphasis on quality lending will slow the  pace of agreements, and hence postpone the day of  recapitalisation.    This policy, the report admits, could delay the point at  which the EBRD, launched in 1991, breaks even from a current  small loss. However, under Mr de Larosiere's austere and more  focused management, the bank has just announced a profit of ECU4  million for 1993 -- the first recorded. Emphasis on quality may  delay decisive profitability by about two years into the latter  half of the 1990's.    The EBRD annual meeting in St Petersburg in April is likely  to prove uneventful, which is no doubt how Mr de Larosiere would  like it. But since the volume of loan disbursements may grow  only slowly, debate over a possible capital increase in three or  four years may prove controversial for Western governments  cutting back heavily on budget deficits.</p>

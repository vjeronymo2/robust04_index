			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Saab-Scania profits tumble to SKr1.69bn SAAB-SCANIA, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, suffered a 22 per cent fall in profits (after financial items) to SKr1.69bn (Dollars 286m) last year. This compares with profits of SKr2.2bn in 1990. The group said yesterday it lost SKr1.12bn from its half share in Saab Auto which it owns jointly with General Motors of the US. But Mr Lars Kylberg, president and chief executive officer, said the group's operating units had performed well last year, despite the continuing recession. Consolidated operating income after depreciation amounted to SKr1.8bn, only 12 per cent less than in 1990, while consolidated sales rose slightly to SKr29.3bn from SKr29.0bn. In his forecast for 1992 Mr Kylberg said he hoped the company would achieve a better result. 'Despite lower income due to tougher price competition, an increased proportion of deliveries to lower margin markets outside Europe and considerably lower income in South America, Scania's profit of SKr2.2bn stands up well in comparison with other producers,' he said. There was also an improvement in Saab Aircraft's profit (after financial items) to SKr200m, from SKr111m in the previous year. It has started a SKr153m rationalisation programme to reduce costs and it is to be divided into two parts: one, military aircraft, the other, commercial with the aim of achieving greater efficiency and market impact. Investor, Sweden's largest investment company which owns 100 per cent of Saab-Scania, yesterday reported profits (after financial items) of SKr1.02bn. Investor was formed by the merger last November of Investor and Providentia, the two investment companies that formed the core of the Wallenberg family industrial empire. With total assets of SKr79.42bn and a share portfolio valued at SKr21.33bn, it proposed a 22 per cent increase in its dividend to SKr5.25 a share.</p>

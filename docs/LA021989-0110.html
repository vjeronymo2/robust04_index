			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOLLOWERS SOUGHT FOR A NEW 'REVOLUTION'  </P> <P> Our country has gone through a lot of different kinds of revolutions in its  history. I truly believe it is time for us to have another one: an  environmental revolution! We are losing our beautiful natural resources to the  land developers, oil companies, industrialists and corrupt politicians.  </P> <P> Our water is polluted by industrial waste, our oceans by oil spills. Our hills  and canyons are disappearing in alarming numbers to the greedy developers, our  air is unbreathable much of the time and our elected officials are selling us  out to the highest bidder. Our wildlife is endangered and so are we human  beings.  </P> <P> We can stop this if we join together.  </P> <P> I have always had great sympathy for the American Indians. Now I can feel  empathy with them. The sick, helpless, powerless feeling I get when I see giant  bulldozers and land movers on the prowl must be what the Indians felt like when  they saw the wagon trains and buffalo hunters approaching. Must such a shameful  history repeat itself over and over again?  </P> <P> Once our canyons, hills, water and animals are gone, it will be too late to  save them. The time is now. I urge you to join our environmental revolution  today. There are many groups already formed and more being formed daily. Please  get involved. We need you!  </P> <P> JUDY ROSE  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

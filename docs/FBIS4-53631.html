			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 21 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata touched on the outlook  for economic recovery at a 20 May House of Councilors Budget  Committee session and said: "We would like to watch the  economic situation carefully while hoping to see a certain,  clear sign of recovery this fall or after." Prime Minister Hata  indicated that the economy would be on the track for  full-fledged recovery as early as fall. In reply to Diet  interpellations, government officials have so far reiterated  that "the economy is expected to be on track for full-fledged  recovery by the end of fiscal 1994" (as stated by Yoshio  Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning Agency).  Prime Minister Hata's remark was the first government view that  this fall is the goal of full-fledged economic recovery.    Touching on concrete measures to stimulate the sluggish  economy, Prime Minister Hata also stated that "it is important  to deal with" the execution of the budget "while studying the  possibility of front-loading spending" after the Diet passes the  budget. Moreover, he stressed the need for promotion of  deregulation and the stability in the yen's exchange rate to the  dollar.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Observer: Milking time Fancy being a gentleman, or gentlewoman farmer? All you need to go with your green wellies is a bigger than average garden and Pounds 27.50, and the National Farmers Union will welcome you to its flock with open arms. The aim of its new 'countryside' membership is to milk subscriptions worth Pounds 2.75m a year from an estimated 100,000 holders of land 'somewhere in size between a garden and a small farm'. If they breed the odd sheep or pig, harvest fruit or run a riding school, so much the more authentic. Mind you, not being properly commercial, they won't get a vote when the union's real farmers are deciding policy. 'Maybe we are grabbing a tiger by the tail, but who knows, maybe we can harness the tiger to work with us,' the NFU's David Hellard says.</p>

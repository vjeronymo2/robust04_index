			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: A fierce, adult fairytale - The Coliseum's new production of Konigskinder THE ENGLISH National Opera production of Humperdinck's Konigskinder is a brave, powerful, imaginative, and rather worrying achievement. It approaches a late-Romantic operatic masterpiece long and unjustly neglected - for reasons which I attempted to outline in Thursday's newspaper - with the 'interventionist' seriousness that has come to characterise this company's artistic policy. It is visually bold, often brilliantly vivid in detail, and musically impressive: anyone who cares about inventive opera-theatre would be mad to miss it. But on Thursday it seemed less than the hoped-for vindicatory triumph: an investigation of the opera's prominent themes that in its later stages clutters the already complex story-line, concentrating hard on specifics at the expense of the all-important overall continuity. The third act, one of the most piercingly beautiful and finely sustained elegies in all of Romantic opera, summarises the achievement. The emotional climax of the opera comes with the death in the winter snow of the young lovers, Goose Girl and King's Son, outsiders of 'royal' lineage (in the spiritual as well as genealogical sense) who have been driven out by the local town populace. Their long 'Liebestod' duet, which refreshes the plangent influence of both Tristan and Parsifal with a limpid sweetness of vocal and instrumental sound all Humperdinck's own, is staged with sympathy and tenderness by David Pountney (who also provided the lively rhymed translation), conducted with steady mastery by Mark Elder, and sung and acted by Cathryn Pope and Joseph Evans (a handsome American heard earlier in the season as Rodolfo) with deeply affecting simplicity. Earlier in the evening - during the forest-in-spring and town-in-summer acts of this extraordinary adult fairy tale - one has had cause to wonder whether either soprano or tenor voice is quite substantial enough - Humperdinck wrote the parts for the 'youthful heroic' category, for singers of, say, Elsa and Lohengrin rather than Melisande and Lensky. One has also longed for Mr Elder and the ENO orchestra to throw first-night caution, however understandable, to the winds and adopt a far headier approach to the dramatic unfolding of Humperdinck's musical structure. But these are minor qualms, which will no doubt be confidently addressed later in the run. It is when the lame Fiddler (Alan Opie) returns with his attendant troupe of children - outsiders too, and in their own way no less maimed by local-community xenophobia - to provide the opera with its celebrated scene of mourning and farewell that the difficulties caused by Mr Pountney's production focus reach crunch-point. The children are dressed as concentration-camp victims; instead of marching off in dignified procession as the libretto requires, carolling their refrains of 'Royal martyrs]', they drop melodramatically dead one by one. A work whose tragic pessimism about human nature should be tempered in closing moments with a warming ray of hope for the future has its warmth brutally snuffed out - and this is in spite of Mr Opie's eloquently mellifluous singing of the opera's most wonderful music. The full force of this fierce production stance builds up only gradually during the evening. Mr Pountney and his designer, Sue Blane, give us a first act of enchanting Disney-like wit, fantasy, and theatrical acumen. Sally Burgess's Witch, sung with the punch and clarity of her recent Fricka, is sultry, weirdly glamorous, a tour de force. But then in Act 2 the doings down in the town of Hellabrun prompt a sustained send-up of Bavarian coarseness. I laughed a lot at the shorts-wearing, thigh-slapping, goose-stepping routines while starting to fret about their rib-nudging effects and, with them, the reduction of such important minor parts as Broom-maker and Woodcutter to cartoon dolts. As always, there is a sharp point to Mr Pountney's purpose. The opera is, among many other things, an early 20th-century warning against specific German tendencies; we all know where those led (the opera's librettist, Elsa Bernstein-Porges, survived internment in Theresienstadt). It is also a profoundly compassionate fable about the interdependence of man and nature, society and the individual, parents and children. I'd rather have these themes too forcefully examined than not at all. In the end, though, Mr Pountney's way of doing so threatens to get in the way of fullest Konigskinder appreciation.</p>

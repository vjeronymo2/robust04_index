			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These factors have led the FAA to establish an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commuter-class aircraft policy that requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporating a known design change when it could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace a critical repetitive inspection. With this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy in mind, the FAA recently conducted a review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing AD's that apply to de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes. Assisting the FAA in this review were (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> de Havilland; (2) the Regional Airlines Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (RAA); and (3) several operators of the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From this review, the FAA has identified AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;1658, as one that should be superseded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a new AD that would eliminate short-interval and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical repetitive inspections. AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03 currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires repetitively inspecting the wing rear spar cap  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for cracks on certain de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes, and replacing any cracked part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> De Havilland, Inc. (formerly Boeing of Canada,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ltd.) has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 6/295,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revision D, dated December 20, 1991. This service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bulletin specifies procedures for installing wing rear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spar attachment caps that are manufactured from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material having improved stress corrosion resistant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properties. This installation is known as Modification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> 6/1301.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the previously discussed AD review,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Canada considers Modification 6/1301  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory and has issued Transport Canada AD CF&hyph;73&hyph;03R1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes in Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is type certificated for operation in the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kept the FAA informed of the situation described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and after reviewing all available information, the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has determined that AD action should be taken to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate the repetitive short-interval inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;1658, and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent cracking of the top flange of the wing rear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spar attachment caps, which could result in loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is likely to exist or develop in other de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplanes of the same type design that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have Modification No. 6/1301 incorporated, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD would supersede AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03 with a new AD that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) initially retain the requirement of repetitively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspecting the wing rear spar cap for cracks and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacing any cracked part; and (2) eventually require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installing wing rear spar attachment caps that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured from a material having improved stress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosion resistant properties (Modification 6/1301) as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with de Havilland SB No. 6/295, Revision D, dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 20, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 82 airplanes in the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would take approximately 22 workhours per airplane to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish the proposed modification, and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost approximately $6,350 per airplane. Based on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. operators is estimated to be $629,432. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figure is based upon the assumption that none of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected airplane owners/operators have incorporated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Modification 6/1301.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of the FAA's aging commuter airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is to ensure safe operation of commuter-class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes that are in commercial service without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely impacting private operators. Of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 82 airplanes in the U.S. registry that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be affected by the proposed AD, the FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that approximately 45 percent are operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in scheduled passenger service. A significant number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the remaining 55 percent are operated in other forms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of air transportation such as air cargo and air taxi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following paragraphs present cost scenarios  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for airplanes where no cracks were found and where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain category cracks were found, utilizing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average remaining airplane life of 15 years and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average annual utilization rate of 1,600 hours TIS. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> copy of the full Cost Analysis and Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Determination for the proposed action may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be examined at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 91&hyph;CE&hyph;21&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> City, Missouri.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No Cracks Scenario: Under the provisions of AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, an owner/operator of an affected de Havilland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DHC&hyph;6 series airplane in scheduled service who operates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an average of 1,600 hours TIS annually would inspect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every 26 weeks. This would amount to a remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane life (estimated 15 years) cost of $14,058;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this figure is based on the assumption that no cracks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are found during the inspections. The proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would incur the inspection at one 1,200-hour TIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval and then, at 2,400 hours TIS, the operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to replace the top flange of the wing spar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attachment caps (eliminating the need for further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repetitive inspections). This would result in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present value cost of $8,331, which would be a present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value cost savings of $5,727 or $4,154 annualized over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1.5 years it would take to accumulate 2,400 hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TIS. An owner of a general aviation airplane who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operates 800 hours TIS annually without finding any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cracks during the 1,200-hour TIS inspection would incur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a present value cost savings of $6,430. This would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount to a per year savings of $2,450 over the 1.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years it would take to accumulate 2,400 hours TIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Category I cracks found scenario: These are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spanwise cracks that are inboard of the third rivet, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spanwise cracks that exceed 50 inches, or any chordwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cracks: Under the provisions of AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, an owner/operator who found cracks under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario would have to immediately repair the cracked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part and repetitively inspect every 26 weeks. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD would require immediate replacement as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminating action for the repetitive inspections,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would result in present value compliance costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $8,355. The present value cost savings for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario would be $6,300 for airplanes in scheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service and $6,295 per general aviation airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

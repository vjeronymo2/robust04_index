			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN DIES IN SUNSET STRIP SHOOTING;  </P> <P> ATTACK LINKED TO ROBBERY ATTEMPT; THREE OTHERS ALSO SLAIN  </P> <P> A would-be robber walked up to a vehicle parked near the Sunset Strip early  Saturday, ordered the driver to roll down his window and shot him to death when  he refused, Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> Anthony John McCubbin, 32, an English national who resided in Los Angeles, died  at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center minutes after the incident -- one of four fatal  shootings being investigated by Los Angeles County authorities during the early  part of the weekend.  </P> <P> Police said McCubbin -- a special effects technician who worked at rock  concerts and other staged events -- and two friends were leaving the North  Kings Road home of a business associate, where they had spent the evening.  </P> <P> McCubbin and his friends -- a man and a woman -- had just entered his Jeep  Cherokee, parked on the east side of the Hyatt Hotel, at about 1:50 a.m. when a  man carrying a handgun walked up to the driver's window, Detective Russell  Kuster said.  </P> <P> "The gunman . . . ordered the victim to roll down the window," Kuster said.  "When the victim refused, he was summarily shot (through the window) by the  suspect."  </P> <P> The gunman fled in a small yellow vehicle, Kuster said, adding that detectives  believe he had intended to rob his victims.  </P> <P> In a separate incident, a 17-year-old youth was shot to death while on his way  to visit a friend late Friday night, police said.  </P> <P> Richard Timothy Wilson, 17, was gunned down moments after parking his car on  54th Street in South-Central Los Angeles, in what investigators said was a  gang-related incident.  </P> <P> Wilson had left his car and was crossing Central Avenue at 54th Street about  11:05 p.m. when a man -- armed with a shotgun -- shouted a gang greeting  mockingly, and then fired several shots at him, Detective Bernie Skiles said.  </P> <P> Wilson was hit in the chest and left side of his head. He staggered to a nearby  alley, where he collapsed and died, police said.  </P> <P> The gunman ran from the area.  </P> <P> Wilson's sister and a friend, both 14, witnessed the shooting from the car.  </P> <P> A few hours later, sheriff's deputies were called to Will Rogers Memorial Park  in Watts to investigate a shooting and found the bullet-riddled body of a young  man. Deputies said the victim, who was shot in the upper torso, was Payton  Johnson, 18.  </P> <P> No motive had been found for the slaying and there were no arrests. The  shooting did not appear to be gang-related, Deputy Van Moseley said.  </P> <P> A teen-age boy was killed Saturday in a burst of gang gunfire from a car in  South-Central Los Angeles, minutes before an anti-gang task force arrived in  the area, police said.  </P> <P> The victim, whose name was not released, and a teen-age companion, were shot in  the 300 block of East 78th Street. The surviving victim was taken to Martin  Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, Sgt. Randy Minini said, adding that there  were no further details.  </P> <P> About 250 Los Angeles police officers fanned out Saturday evening for another  "Operation Hammer" anti-gang task force operation in neighborhoods plagued by  gang violence.  </P> <P> "We will enforce every law we have available to us," Detective Tony Celli said.  </P> <P> The last "Hammer" operation, during the July 4 weekend. netted 412 arrests,  Celli said. Arrest figures involving Saturday night's operation were not  available, the detective said.  </P> <P> A similar operation is scheduled for tonight, police said.  </P></p>

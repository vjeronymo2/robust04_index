Public Law 103&hyph;312, 108 Stat. 1691. Section 13 directs the Commission, within six months of the bill's enactment, to transmit to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on Federal-State Cooperation. The report is ``to identify those matters within [The Commission's] jurisdiction where Federal enforcement is particularly necessary or desirable and those areas that might more effectively be enforced at the State or local level.'' In conducting this review, the Commission is directed to ``consider the resources available to the Commission and the States, as well as particular rules that have been promulgated by the Commission.'' In addition, the Commission must ``consider such other issues as will result in more efficient implementation of the statutory responsibilities of the Commission.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13 directs the Commission to ``consult with the attorneys general of the States, representatives of consumers and industry, and other interested parties.'' The Commission is issuing this Notice to solicit written comments from interested members of the public on the issues described above. Because the report must be transmitted to Congress by February 27, 1995, the comment period is limited to 30 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission staff expects to hold informal meetings with persons and groups interested in the topics to be addressed in the report. All interested parties are nonetheless urged to file written comments, because the staff may not be able to accommodate all of the interested groups that wish to meet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments should focus on areas of the Commission's enforcement authority that might be implemented more effectively and efficiently by altering the present manner in which enforcement activity is shared between the Commission and State or local agencies. Specific areas of interest include enforcement allocations respecting trade regulation rules, deceptive marketing practices, deceptive advertising, consumer credit and debt collection practices, and anticompetitive conduct that primarily affects consumers within a particular State or local area versus conduct that has primarily regional or national impact. In any assessment of enforcement allocations in these areas, the impact on resources available to the Commission and the States to carry out their other law enforcement responsibilities should be considered. Comments should discuss the basis for any recommendations, and describe any statutory changes or changes in the Commission's rules that might be necessary to implement the recommendations. Comments directed to telemarketing practices should recognize that the statutory authority of both the Commission and the States has recently been affected by the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, Public Law 103&hyph;297, 108 Stat. 1545 (Aug. 16, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission anticipates that both the range and the analysis of enforcement reallocation opportunities may differ with respect to the Commission's consumer protection and competition missions. Therefore, comments dealing specifically with the Commission's consumer protection responsibilities should be segregated from comments dealing with the Commission's maintaining competition responsibilities. Documents containing the former should be titled ``Consumer Protection Comment;'' those containing the latter should be titled ``Maintaining Competition Comment.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By Direction of the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald S.

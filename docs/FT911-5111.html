			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed action fails to lift dollar THE DOLLAR fell yesterday despite an indication from the US Federal Reserve that it has not eased its monetary stance. The Fed drained reserves from the New York banking system via matched sale and repurchase agreements, when Federal funds were trading at 5 1/2 per cent, well below the assumed target level of 6 per cent. This also came about an hour earlier than usual, which was taken as a signal that the Fed is underlining the present interest rate structure and has not been encouraged to ease policy by the news on Friday that US year-on-year inflation had fallen below 5 per cent in March. A further fall in US interest rates is not ruled out however,and this encouraged the market to test the dollar's downside yesterday. Opinion suggests that traders are looking to pick up dollars below the present value if there is another cut in US rates, believing that any further easing by the Fed is likely to be the last in this economic cycle. At the close of trading in London the dollar had fallen to DM1.6755 from DM1.6845; to Y134.45 from Y136.25; to SFr1.4230 from SFr1.4275; and to FFr5.6550 from FFr5.6900. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index declined to 64.3 from 64.8. The D-Mark improved against the dollar, but lost ground to the Japanese yen as speculation faded that the Bank of Japan is about to cut its discount rate. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi in London, notes that inflation in Japan has not yet established a convincing peak and that deceleration in the economy will not be sharp enough to warrant a relaxation of monetary policy until the middle of the year. Economists at Nomura Research Institute agreed that present monetary policy is likely to be maintained, with the Bank of Japan still worried about the underlying rate of inflation and the high ratio of money supply growth to gross national product. With the D-Mark under a cloud created by the unification of Germany and growing unrest in the Soviet Union, the German currency fell to Y80.25 from Y80.90. Dealers expect the D-Mark to test support at Y80.00 in the very near future, amid fear that a fall though that level would prompt a reassessment of European currency risks by Japanese investors. Sterling bounced off a high of DM3.00, but finished higher against the D-Mark, despite Friday's cut in UK bank base rates. The pound remained the second strongest member of the European exchange rate mechanism, rising to DM2.9975 from DM2.9950 and closing unchanged at FFr10.1150. It gained 1.15 cents to Dollars 1.7890 and also rose to SFr2.5450 from SFr2.5375, but fell to Y240.50 from Y242.25. Sterling's index climbed 0.3 to 93.3.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Books: A political under-achiever - Malcolm Rutherford on the career of Sir John Simon SIMON: A POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY OF SIR JOHN SIMON by David Dutton Aurum Press, Pounds 25, 364 pages WHO, apart from Churchill, was a member of the British cabinet at the beginning of the first world war in 1914 and at the start of the second in 1939? The answer is Sir John Simon and if you had to think for a moment, do not fret. David Dutton's book is the first full-scale biography of the man to have been written; it may also be the last. Simon was Attorney-General when the first war broke out and Chancellor of the Exchequer at the outbreak of the second. In between he had been Home Secretary (twice) and Foreign Secretary. He spent the second world war as Lord Chancellor. Although he was out of office for the entire period 1916-1931, for much of his political life he was thought of, and certainly thought of himself, as a potential Prime Minister. Simon was one of the very few Liberals to survive the effective demise of his own party. Dutton's book is not so much a labour of love as a serious attempt to gather together the pieces of Simon's career. He makes no attempt to say that the man, who in the 1930s and after was execrated as an arch-appeaser, has been under-rated. Instead he tells the story as it was, and it is not particularly pleasant. Simon was an ambitious politician, a lawyer and a Liberal, probably in that order. The fact that the law came second was illustrated by his turning down the offer of the Woolsack in 1914 when, at the age of 42, he would have become the youngest Lord Chancellor in history, the reason being that elevation to the Lords would have cut off his political ambitions. The refusal, said Lord Justice Darling at the time, showed him to be the 'maddest lawyer in London'. Yet the lawyer's mark tended to dog Simon throughout his political career. Professor Gilbert Murray said that he had the 'most irritating set of gestures' he had ever seen in a public speaker: they were picked up from the bar. Simon was aware of the problem. He once advised a young barrister MP that the House of Commons is the only legislative assembly in the world where lawyers are unpopular. 'Try and make your speeches on some political topic and not on a legal one. Get them to regard you as one of themselves and dispose of the idea that you could make just as effective a speech for the other side of the argument.' It was sound advice but, as Dutton comments, Simon never fully took it himself. In a moment of insight Simon commented on his own abilities and shortcomings: 'While I have no great admiration for my own judgment, I do believe in my powers of deductive reasoning.' Lloyd George put it more sharply. What Simon liked, he said, was that someone else should present him with a decision and then he could put up a brilliant case for it. It was Lloyd George again who made the famous remark about Simon having sat on the fence so long that 'the iron had entered into his soul'. The trouble was that Simon was extremely bad at developing and then defending a policy of his own. His name is perhaps best remembered for the Simon Report on the constitutional future of India in 1930. Although it was widely acclaimed as a brilliant piece of analysis and became briefly a best-seller, it was less forthright on what ought to be done. With hindsight, its chief claim to fame is that one of the members of the commission was a relatively unknown Labour MP, CR Attlee, who subsequently became prime minister. Attlee's experience of work on the committee helped shape his views about Indian independence. It is wrong to blame Simon for failing to stand up to the Japanese in Manchuria, when foreign secretary from 1931-35. There were limits to British power and influence and, as Dutton points out, the thesis that if Japan had been checked then, there might have been no second world war stretches the imagination almost to breaking point. Dutton's comment on Manchuria is that 'with an almost hopeless hand, Simon played his cards with some skill'. Nevertheless, Simon was an appeaser. He disliked the idea of giving a guarantee to Czechoslovakia so much that he spelled the country's name with a hyphen as if to suggest it was not a legitimate state worth defending. He insisted in believing that Hitler was just another German leader who could be dealt with and accommodated by patient diplomacy. In the climate of the time, Simon was not alone, but it is not surprising that Michael Foot and his left wing colleagues picked him off as second only to Chamberlain in the appeasement stakes in their 1940 pamphlet Guilty Men. The charge has stuck and Dutton recognises its validity. Simon had begun his political career as a Liberal. One of his most liberal acts was to resign from the government in 1915 in protest at the introduction of conscription. By the end of the war, however, the Liberal Party which had been so strong in 1910 was beginning to collapse as it was overtaken by the rise of the Labour Party. Simon probably saw what was happening more clearly than most of his contemporaries. He wanted to maintain a liberal identity which he defined as 'an attitude of mind about public affairs which always preserves a just balance between the heart and the head'. In other words, 'toughness and tenderness'. Yet as subsequent Liberal leaders have discovered, that is not sufficient for a third party to make a breakthrough in British politics. Simon in any case was one of those Liberals who are much more anti-socialist than anti-Tory. That is why he was invited to join all Conservative-dominated cabinets from 1931-45. He died at the age of 80 in 1954, a Tory in all but name. In a remarkable act of censorship Kingsley Martin, the editor of the New Statesman, once deleted from a profile of Simon the line 'Many of those who have shivered as he took their arm. . .' Possibly Simon mellowed with age: it was said he had more friends on his 80th birthday than on his 70th. Yet, taken all in all, Dutton does little to relieve the impression that Simon was cold and calculating. This painstaking book is not nearly as dry as its subject. If it has a fault, it is that it does not prove beyond reasonable doubt that Simon was the most brilliant barrister of his generation. For that, we have only the word of the lawyers.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTORTION BY 3 AT TABLOID ALLEGED  </P> <P> The three staff members of a tabloid that published a sensational series of  articles on business improprieties in Koreatown and then allegedly demanded  money to discontinue the reports have been arrested on suspicion of extortion,  authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> The staffers of Ka Ju News -- which during 2 1/2 years of publication has  featured headlines such as, "A Scene Out of a Brawling Western: Customers in  Korean-Owned Restaurant Are Threatened With Sushi Knife, Then Handcuffed and  Beaten" -- were arrested Thursday and each booked for investigation of two  counts of extortion and two counts of attempted extortion.  </P> <P> Publisher Tae Kyun Kim, 45; chief reporter Sang Suk Kim, 31, and editor Kook  Kyun Chung, 32, denied involvement in the alleged extortion.  </P> <P> They said the allegations are attempts at retaliation by disgruntled businesses  whose practices were challenged by investigative pieces published in the paper.  The three men were released Thursday after posting $5,000 bail each.  Arraignment was set for Feb. 8.  </P> <P> Police have been investigating allegations of extortion committed by several  Korean-language newspapers since the spring of last year, said Detective Ray  Futami.  </P> <P> In a similar but unrelated case, Korean business owners told police in  September that the publisher and two staff members of the California Peace News  -- an infrequent, makeshift newsletter -- had pressured advertisers into paying  exorbitant rates for unwanted ad space.  </P> <P> When victims refused to pay ad fees, damage to their property or physical  threats followed. The three suspects pleaded either guilty or no-contest to  charges of extortion and arson and are currently serving sentences of a minimum  of one year in jail, Futami said.  </P> <P> Detectives said they have been frustrated by the reluctance of victims to  report extortion. In some cases, police said, Korean business owners were  resigned to paying the extortion demands, considering them part of the cost of  doing business.  </P> <P> Detectives said they are continuing to investigate 15 to 20 non-subscription or  "throwaway" publications for possible extortion activities.  </P> <P> Extortion demands ranged from $300 for advertisement space to $36,000 for a  seat on Ka Ju News' Board of Directors, said Detective John Byun.  </P> <P> Five Los Angeles businesses filed extortion charges against Ka Ju News --  including the Koreatown restaurant where the sushi-knife-wielding chef  allegedly threatened customers, a used-car dealership that reportedly reneged  on several warranty contracts and a Korean supermarket whose long-outdated  snacks reportedly caused a customer stomach problems.  </P> <P> Reporter Kim, who five years ago uncovered a widespread bribery scandal that  led to Los Angeles County district attorney indictments of a state acupuncture  licensing official and 47 fraudulently licensed acupuncturists, said Monday  during an interview at the newspaper's office in the 3000 block of West 6th  Street that the subjects of Ka Ju's investigations repeatedly have accused the  newspaper of running an extortion racket.  </P> <P> "We are not the criminals here," Kim said in Korean. "The businesses that we  have written about -- that have been caught taking advantage of people -- are  behind the accusations. We just write the truth about what happens in  Koreatown."  </P></p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Ukraine's Kravchuk poses dilemma for west: He wants money for reform and stability, but he might not be there to deliver Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk arrives in Washington today to tell the west: give us money if you want a buffer against Russian 'imperialism' and stability in eastern Europe. The trouble is that Mr Kravchuk, if he is to be believed, will not be president in four months' time. So the west has begun to wonder whether it is entertaining a lame duck who will not be able to guarantee the promised scrapping of Ukraine's nuclear weapons nor the economic reforms he wants the money for. Ukrainian journalists and diplomats in Kiev are sceptical that Mr Kravchuk, however unpopular he is at home with the country's disastrous economy, will stick to his decision not to stand for re-election in an early presidential election he called in the turmoil of a miners' strike last year. Indeed Mr Kravchuk indicated on Tuesday that the election, scheduled for June, could be cancelled if constitutional issues were not resolved first. Though he repeated his pledge not to run, Mr Kravchuk seems to be keeping the option open to serve his full term until 1996. Others suggest his announcement is a purposely timed test of public opinion. Ukrainians in recent months have been giving low marks to their president in opinion polls and condemning him around kitchen tables as they have seen their standards of living decline with hyperinflation, paltry paychecks (when they come) and an energy crisis. If Mr Kravchuk's popularity rises, perhaps through the securing of a huge aid package from the west to rebuild Ukraine's devastated economy, he could choose to stand after all - a practice reminiscent of an old Slavic tradition dating back to Ivan the Terrible, when the dictator came back to power after his people begged him to come out of seclusion. Thus Mr Kravchuk might also be testing the west to come up with the money to keep him, their guarantor of a nuclear-free Ukraine, in power. Aware that US President Bill Clinton wants to encourage completion of the nuclear deal between Ukraine, Russia and the US, and that Washington is reassessing its policies toward a more assertive Russia, Mr Kravchuk is trying to get the best deal he can now. The new political tactic to gain economic assistance also takes pressure off Ukraine's miserable economic reform record. Ukraine has yet to take effective steps in fighting hyper-inflation, privatising its mammoth state sector and cutting subsidies to ailing, inefficient industries. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are poised to loan Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 738m) but Ukraine is still far from meeting the anti-inflation conditions necessary to release this money. Last week Kiev abandoned a brief three-month experiment to clamp down on the money supply and issued another huge wave of credits, totalling some 10 per cent of last year's gross national product. If Mr Kravchuk holds to his word and the presidential elections are held, eyes are focusing on two well-known figures from the Ukrainian establishment: Mr Leonid Kuchma, an industrialist and former prime minister, and Mr Ivan Plyushch, the parliamentary speaker. Though neither man has announced his candidacy, opinion polls are giving Mr Kuchma and Mr Plyushch increasingly higher ratings despite their mutual lack of a coherent economic reform programme for Ukraine. Mr Kuchma, who enjoys much support from Ukraine's ailing state enterprises, has expressed a pro-nuclear stance in the past. Last spring, when he was prime minister, he delivered a speech before a closed session of parliament, urging lawmakers to hold on to the country's 176 strategic weapons. During the parliamentary debate on the trilateral deal signed in Moscow with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and President Clinton during the latter's European tour, Mr Kuchma cautioned his deputies 'to know all the protocols and agreements being signed' before ridding Ukraine of its entire nuclear arsenal. Mr Plyushch, who came to power from the state farm system, is famous for his skill as a deal maker and for building consensus behind the scenes. He helped Mr Kravchuk get parliamentary approval for the nuclear deal last month. If Mr Plyushch retains his powerful seat after parliamentary elections this month, he may be reluctant to relinquish it to stand for the presidency, which has a weak and unclear mandate under the current Ukrainian constitution.</p>

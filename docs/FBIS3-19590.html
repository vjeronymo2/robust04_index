That emerged from calculations by the  research department of the Kredietbank. In 1994 wages will  increase in Belgium 0.6 percent quicker than in its five most  important trading partners, expressed in a single currency. In  1995 there will be a slight improvement, according to the report.    Toward the end of the month the CRB [Central Council for  Industry] will again issue an opinion on how the competitiveness  of Belgian companies is developing. The CRB will base itself on  the figures of the OECD. The Kredietbank has already calculated  the conclusions which the CRB will reach.    From the calculations it appears that company  competitiveness  is further deteriorating in 1994, despite wage restraint and  other measures in the Dehaene government's crisis plan. The  explanation is simple: Belgium's trading partners are also  making an effort to keep down wages. In addition, the Belgian  franc -- after weakening in the fourth quarter of 1993 -- has  once again increased in value.    The result is that Belgium's competitive disadvantage in  wage  costs compared to its five major trading partners (Germany,  France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Italy) will increase  in 1994 from 4.1 percent to 4.9 percent. Compared with  Belgium's seven biggest trading partners (the five plus the  United States and Japan). The competitive disadvantage will  increase from 4.7 percent to 5.3 percent.    Assuming that the franc's exchange rate remains stable in  1994 and 1995, then the competitive disadvantage should decline  in 1995 to around the 1993 level.    The end of the tunnel as regards the restoration of  Belgium's  competitive position was not yet in sight, the Kredietbank's  research department concluded.    However, it is possible that the CRB figures will differ  from  the Kredietbank's. The discussion between trade unions and  employers within the CRB concerns the very question of the  impact of the crisis plan on wage developments in Belgium.</p>

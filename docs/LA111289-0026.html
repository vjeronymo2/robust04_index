			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> HEAD ON THE TOWN: Tone-Loc's touring Australia now -- but last month the rotund  rap idol was cruising Santa Monica Boulevard in his Mercedes when he spotted a  white '63 Impala convertible at a red light. Eyeing the slick Impala, Loc said:  "Hey, how much?" Its driver replied: "The car's not for sale." Loc followed the  Impala to the next red light, where he made another sales pitch, only to be  turned down again. Finally, Loc's passenger recognized the driver (and his  red-headed companion). It was . . . Bruce Springsteen (and Patti Scialfa). The  two stars hit it off so much that they ended up hanging out in the middle of  the street, yakking about their favorite music. . . . And yes, that was Joni  Mitchell at the China Club the other night, long after midnight, dancing to the  raucous rock sounds of the Dynatones. Mitchell even took the microphone and  helped out on a noisy rendition of "Land of a Thousand Dances."  </P></p>

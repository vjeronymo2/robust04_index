			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: A poetical piano performance Sir, I object to Richard Fairman's patronising remarks about Kathryn Stott's performance of the Rakhmaninov Third Piano Concerto (Arts, July 28). I listened to it on Radio 3 and found her performance poetical, rich and heroic. Julia Hollingworth, Abbey Villa, Princes Road, Rhuddlan, Clwyd LL18 5RA</p>

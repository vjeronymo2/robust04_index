			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (7): Supplier to the supermarkets - Profile: Jamont the pan-European consumer paper products group RONALD SINGER says he would rather Jamont were not described as a paper company - which sounds strange from the chief executive of Europe's second largest manufacturer of tissue. But Mr Singer was the man entrusted, three years ago, with forging Jamont out of a diverse collection of 14 paper-product manufacturers scattered across Europe. People listen to what he has to say about Jamont's corporate identity. 'I consider us a consumer-products company,' he explains. 'We make the kind of products that are sold in a supermarket.' That means tissue, of all sorts, which represents 75 per cent of the group's business, but also cotton products, feminine hygiene products and paper plates. In the European market, only Scott of the US is bigger, with an 18 per cent share, against Jamont's 14 per cent. More important for Mr Singer, an American, Jamont is a genuinely pan-European group. It is a Dutch holding company, with its headquarters in Brussels (to take advantage of Belgium's generous tax-breaks for multinational headquarters), and subsidiaries manufacturing in 11 countries, both inside and outside the EC. Almost inevitably, the group does all its accounting in the European currency unit, the ecu. Mr Singer believes that annual turnover of Ecu 1.2bn (Pounds 970m) to Ecu 1.3bn is impressive in any currency, and although he declines to reveal any more figures, he says the group is 'substantially profitable'. If market conditions are right, then a stock market flotation may be considered as early as 1994. All this has happened in less than three years. Descendant of a joint venture between James River Corporation, the US paper group, and Ferruzzi of Italy, Jamont was formed when the two original shareholders and Nokia of Finland decided to pour their paper businesses into one company. In January 1990, says Mr Singer, 'we had no legal existence, we had no employees, we had no bank account, we had nothing. We borrowed offices from shareholders and subsidiaries, and we began from zero to create a European entity.' From a manufacturing point of view, the Jamont companies were not an obvious candidate for 'Europeanisation'. There is little benefit in transporting low-density, low-value products like tissues or paper plates across long distances, so there was no need to amalgamate plants. Existing facilities, from Finland to Turkey, stayed put, manufacturing for distinct national markets. Instead, Mr Singer and his multinational staff concentrated on developing a central administration, which could handle strategy, improve productivity and secure financing for the 'new' company. In this last area, Jamont has moved fast. Last year, the group raised a Ecu 400m syndicated loan as security for an aggressive investment programme. Some Ecu 500m will be spent by the end of 1993. The biggest benefit for the subsidiary manufacturers, Mr Singer believes, has been the access to developing technology. "None of the companies had been able to support a substantial technology effort on their own,' he says. James River - which, together with Cragnotti &amp; Partners, the Italian investment group, still owns 86 per cent of Jamont - operates an open-door policy with the group on technology licensing. In its turn, Jamont is ploughing funds into developing technology for 'de-inking' fibres, improving the quality of paper produced, and enhancing the ability of machines to convert large paper rolls into more manageable small rolls. Mr Singer claims that Jamont technicians are already bettering the work done in James River laboratories. For the future, Jamont has three important target areas. Mr Singer wants to fill in the gaps in the group's coverage of western Europe - in particular, Germany, which is dominated by the tissue company PWA, and where another rival, Kimberly-Clark of the US, is trying to expand. Looking further ahead, the group sees possibilities in eastern Europe and - beyond 1994 - it may even start to expand into related areas of business outside the core tissue operations. Much depends on economic developments. As head of a company that has built itself on firm European foundations, Mr Singer has been profoundly disappointed by the unexpected turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism. Now, he says, his staff have to spend valuable time worrying about European currency fluctuations, which he believed were a thing of the past. In general, however, he says Jamont will continue to benefit from the stability of its underlying business: 'Bad times for us means when markets are growing at 1 or 2 per cent, instead of 4 or 5 per cent.' That apart, Mr Singer has one principal goal if he is to seek further funding or a stock market flotation: to convince backers that this Italo-American-Finnish-owned Dutch holding company with a Belgian headquarters is not a European corporate aberration, but the shape of things to come.</p>

Five people, including Congressman Bill  Richardson (Democrat-New Mexico) and the United Nations  Development Program resident representative in Rangoon, were  allowed to see Aung San Suu Kyi, a reliable source said. She  had previously had contact only with immediate family members or  security officials at her heavily-guarded lakeside home on the  outskirts of Rangoon.    The meeting was apparently filmed, as a crew from Burmese  state television was seen entering the premises at around 9 a.m.    Richardson, who arrived in Rangoon Sunday at the invitation  of the ruling military junta, the State Law and Order  Coordination Council (SLORC), is a member of the Congressional  committee monitoring human rights under the Helsinki agreement.</p>

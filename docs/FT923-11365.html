			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / EC/Asean talks hit by row on E Timor NEGOTIATIONS between the European Community and the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) over a new co-operation agreement have been halted by Portuguese objections to Indonesia's human rights record in East Timor. The dispute is embarrassing for the EC, whose 12 members cannot agree on how to proceed, and frustrating for Asean, which was hoping to continue the talks on upgrading relations at a meeting of foreign ministers yesterday in Manila. 'It's a very unfortunate development,' said Mr Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian foreign minister. 'We will not want to abandon EC-Asean co-operation simply because of Portugal.' Asean groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. One senior EC diplomat said he feared the disagreement would have an insidious effect on relations between the two blocs. 'Effectively we can't start (negotiations) until we've cleared the roadblock,' he said. Whereas the existing accord is a bland statement of good intentions, the proposed new agreement would include provisions on resolving trade disputes and on European Investment Bank lending to Asean states. EC-Asean trade has risen to Pounds 27bn in 1990 from Pounds 8bn in 1980, and has been rising by 25 per cent annually for the last three years. Even before the Portuguese blocked further talks, EC and Asean officials were unable to agree on the inclusion of clauses on human rights and the environment in the new agreement. Asean ministers explicitly rejected any linkage between economic co-operation and environmental or human rights concerns at the end of an Asean meeting in Manila on Wednesday. Portugal maintains that it is contrary to EC policy to upgrade relations with countries which have poor human rights records. Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1975, and Indonesian troops shot dead at least 50 civilian protestors there in one incident in November last year. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said yesterday the human rights issue 'will not go away', but he sought to mollify his Asean counterparts by emphasising universal rather than western principles of human rights. 'We are not talking of the imposition of the values of one section of the world on another section with different values,' he said. 'We are talking about an understanding of shared values and agreement on how they can be applied.'</p>

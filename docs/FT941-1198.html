			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Paris deal cuts Ivory Coast debt by Dollars 2.5bn The Paris Club of official creditor nations has agreed to a big debt reduction and rescheduling package that will reduce Ivory Coast's Dollars 15.4bn (Pounds 10.5bn) external debt by at least Dollars 2.5bn. The agreement is seen as a significant step in long-running efforts to resolve Africa's crippling external debt crisis. Sub-Saharan African debt has almost doubled over the past decade and now stands at nearly Dollars 180bn. Debt service payments are well beyond the capacity of the region and development agencies and African governments have been calling for a radical approach to the problem. A potential beneficiary of the breakthrough in Paris is Nigeria, whose Dollars 34bn external debt could be reduced by several billion dollars if the same terms were applied. However, the Nigerian government has failed to renew a lapsed policy agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The first stage of the agreement for the Ivory Coast applies only to the non-concessional official debt totalling Dollars 5bn, and the eventual benefit will be about half this amount. But it also provides for further bi-lateral agreements which, when concluded, will lead to further substantial debt reduction. Ivory Coast is one of the world's most indebted countries in per capita terms. The move, one of the most substantial debt deals offered by the Paris Club, follows an agreement on economic policy between the West African nation and the IMF. The agreement, based on the so-called Trinidad terms of debt relief, is better than Ivory Coast might have expected. It is ranked as a middle-income country, while Trinidad terms are usually offered only to the poorest countries. France, however, had promised at the time of the 50 per cent devaluation of the West African CFA franc in January to press for the best possible terms of debt relief for CFA zone countries, particularly middle-income countries. Less than half the external debt is owed to official creditors represented by the Paris Club, according to the latest World Bank figures. The French Economy Ministry said the Paris Club met on March 23 to discuss Ivory Coast's debt. The French Treasury acts as secretary to the club. '(Paris Club members) welcomed the implementation, with the support of the International Monetary Fund, of an economic adjustment programme and took note of the very weak per capita income in Ivory Coast and the very big cost of its debt, justifying, in this case, exceptional treatment in terms of debt restructuring,' the ministry said. The terms offer two options: a write-off of 50 per cent of the debt service obligations due on non-concessional loans and credits and consolidation of the rest of the debt at market rates over a 23-year period, with six years' grace. Alternatively the creditors can consolidate the total debt owed at concessional interest rates over 23 years so as to reduce by 50 per cent the net present value of the payments due on non-concessional loans and credits. The Trinidad terms were first proposed in September 1990 by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, but implementation has been slow, with the Japanese government having reservations about the terms offered.</p>

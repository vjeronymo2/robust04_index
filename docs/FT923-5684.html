			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Volvo reports loss of SKr103m for the opening six months VOLVO of Sweden reported yesterday a SKr103m (Dollars 19.3m) loss after financial items for the first half of the year. This compares with a SKr1.16bn profit for the same period of 1991. The company said that viewed as a whole it did not anticipate any improvement in performance in 'the immediate future'. Volvo's sales rose by 9 per cent in the first half to SKr41.38bn from SKr37.94bn. Its operating loss was SKr835m compared with an operating deficit of SKr559m for the same period of last year. In spite of this, the cash flow was positive due a reduction in working capital. The loss came after rationalisation measures and lower product development costs. The deficit continued in the second quarter because of weak margins and non-recurring costs involved in taking over the British import company's marketing operations. It added the loss was less than for the same period of 1991. Car sales rose to SKr22.93bn for the first six months and Volvo sold 160,100 vehicles compared with 166,000 for the corresponding period last year. However, Volvo lost sales and market shares in Britain and Germany while it improved its sales in Spain by 20 per cent. The company said its North American sales had stabilised after a 12 per cent drop last year. The truck division made a financial loss in the first half and it suffered a 10 per cent decline in sales over the same period to SKr7.52bn with a 15 per cent decline in European sales of its heavy trucks over the six months. By contrast, it improved its heavy truck sales in the US where the company's market share improved to 13 per cent from 11 per cent. Volvo said its bus operations developed well and achieved a profit. Volvo said the truck group reported a loss for the first half of 1992 compared with a profit in the same period last year. The company added that its cost-cutting programme was continuing and it had brought a saving of SKr600m during the second quarter of the year. So far, the measures have cut Volvo's costs by SKr4.1bn since 1990 and by the end of the year it estimated the annual cost level would have been reduced by about SKr5.2bn.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Pay rises at 15-year low THERE ARE no signs of an upturn in the rate of wage increases and productivity is continuing to improve, according to the Confederation of British Industry's pay databank series for the third quarter of the year, published yesterday. Increases in pay for the January-September period were on average 2.3 per cent, the lowest level recorded by the CBI since it started collecting pay data in 1977. Pay deals in manufacturing averaged 2.3 per cent, down from 3.9 per cent for the same period last year. There was a rise of 2.6 per cent in the private services sector, compared with 4.3 per cent. Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said yesterday: 'These figures are generally encouraging, showing that the need for tighter control of pay remains well understood by employers and their workforces.' The CBI added that the databank findings meant 'continued good news for British competitiveness' with reported provisional productivity gains in manufacturing running at 3.9 per cent, well ahead of wage settlements. The overall third quarter CBI pay figures compare with a 3.9 per cent provisional figure for the same period last year and 2.3 per cent for the second quarter of this year. The CBI said that one in five pay deals in the manufacturing and services sectors involved wage freezes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhou Zhengqing (0719 2973 1987), vice president </F> of People's Bank of China: "PBOC Must Lead AntiCorruption  Campaign"]    [Text] A nationwide campaign is currently under way to  combat corruption and promote honesty in the party and  government in accordance with the policy of the CPC Central  Committee. The People's Bank of China [PBOC] should be a leader  in this campaign.    Let us assess the current contingent of PBOC cadres and  workers honestly. It should be affirmed that most are good. A  majority of party members and cadres are incorrupt and  law-abiding. Two years after we started "educating,  housecleaning, and rectifying" the ranks of PBOC employees and  other activities aimed at preventing swindling and theft and  ensuring the security of bank funds, in particular, the majority  of PBOC cadres have received training and their caliber has  definitely improved. The number of economic cases in the PBOC  system has also shown a downward trend. The anti-corruption  drive and the campaign to improve the party style have been  intensified. However, we must also be clear-headed enough to see  that some forms of corruption have their own specific social and  historical origins that are longstanding and hidden. As society  and the economy develop and evolve, moreover, many new problems  arise. Thus we cannot expect too much from the earlier round of  education, housecleaning, and rectification at the PBOC. Instead  we must realize that the task of combating corruption in the  PBOC system remains an arduous one. Corruption in all its  manifestations exists to various degrees throughout the system,  from the headquarters to the branches, with some problems  remaining very serious. For one thing, although the number of  economic cases overall has dropped, the trend is up for major  and serious cases. Second, to further their own special  interests, small collectives and individuals do not follow the  rules or observe discipline. Using the power in their hands and  the convenience afforded them by their jobs, a minority of  cadres and workers speculate in real estate, stocks, foreign  exchange, and scarce materials with state credit funds. A tiny  handful of workers in PBOC-operated economic entities pervert  justice for a bribe as a means of lining their pockets. Third,  unhealthy trends are still gaining momentum in the industry.  Using the power in their hands, some units and individuals  continue to wine and dine lavishly, demand payments, impose fees  indiscriminately, and raise interest rates covertly. Fourth,  ostentation, conspicuous consumption, and pleasure-seeking are  all the range. Weak, disorganized, and riddled with  bureaucratism, the leading groups of some units treat corruption  and other unhealthy trends within their jurisdictions with  indifference. Mismanagement and lax discipline give bad elements  many loopholes to exploit.    It should be seen that corruption in the PBOC has a major  impact on and constitutes a danger to the banking system. For  starters, it undermines the leadership of the central bank and  weakens its macroeconomic regulatory and control function.  Corruption is bound to interfere with the exercise by the  central bank of its macroeconomic regulatory and control  function and its execution of the nation's monetary policy from  an overall perspective. Second, it has encouraged the rise of  unhealthy trends in the banking system. The PBOC is the core of  the banking system; every word it utters, every move it makes,  sets an example in the system. If the upper beam is not  straight, the lower ones will go aslant. If there is corruption  in the PBOC, how can it patrol the banking system and prevent  the spreading of unhealthy trends? Furthermore, corruption in  the PBOC system directly hinders banking reform and the  deepening of the open policy. Finally, and most serious,  corruption in the PBOC has highly adverse social effects,  severely damaging the bank's reputation and trustworthiness and  affecting the healthy development of the bank's normal business  activities. For these reasons, leaders at all levels in the PBOC  must fully appreciate the serious consequences of corruption and  become even more conscientious about combating corruption. They  must develop a greater sense of urgency and be resolved to fight  corruption in all its forms unwaveringly.    The anti-corruption campaign is a major event in the drive  to  intensify party construction and consolidate the regime.  Implicit in the four cardinal principles, it is a basic  guarantee of the successful execution of reform and the open  policy as well as economic development, an objective requirement  of the development of a socialist market economy, and an  essential condition for implementing the party's basic line  across the board and furthering the current favorable situation.  Allowing corruption of all forms to spread unchecked is a sure  way to ruin our party, our people's regime, and our great  socialist modernization enterprise. Banking is a pivotal link of  the national economy. Banks are a special industry which deals  in the commodity of money. The central bank both discharges the  essential responsibility of regulating and controlling the  macroeconomy and is the leader and manager of the banking  system. Thus the PBOC must be a role model in the  anti-corruption campaign in at least three ways. First, it must  take a firm stand against corruption. There is absolutely no  room for a wait-and-see attitude. Second, it must swiftly take  measures to combat corruption. The emphasis should be on  practical results and there must be no foot-dragging. Third,  corruption cases must be handled seriously and strictly. We must  never tolerate and accommodate ourselves to it.    1. Concentrate Our Energies and Focus On the Priorities. Go  All Out To Produce Notable Successes in the Near Future.    For the moment the PBOC must concentrate its energies on  doing a good job in bringing corrupt elements to justice and  steadfastly overcoming all sorts of corrupt phenomena, including  the reversal of unhealthy trends. It should strive to achieve  the following in the near future. First, leading cadres above  the departmental level in the PBOC system must demonstrate  marked progress in honesty and self-discipline. Second, major  cases must be investigated without delay and swindling  activities prevented and reduced effectively. Third, a few  simple rules must be made to be observed by everybody. The idea  is to largely check the unhealthy tendencies of making loans in  violation of the rules, raising interest rates without  authorization, breaking banking rules and regulations, and  failing to enforce the orders. Ideological and political  education for the rank-and-file party members and cadres must be  intensified to create a corruption-resistant climate without  delay.    First of all, step up the supervision and inspection of the  efforts by leading cadres at all levels to resist corruption and  patrol themselves. People's Bank cadres above the departmental  level must carry out in earnest the CPC Central Committee's  "five regulations" on how cadres in party and government organs  above the departmental level must achieve honesty and practice  self-discipline. They should patrol themselves and discipline  themselves in accordance with the "five regulations" in light of  the reality of work in the banking industry.    Second, it must concentrate its resources on tackling major  cases and firmly punish the corrupt. The PBOC must make the  investigation of major cases the cornerstone of its  anti-corruption campaign and strictly punish corrupt elements.  It must double its attention to information provided by the  masses in personal visits or letters, encouraging and cherishing  their enthusiasm. It must closely analyze and study all  complaints brought forward by the public and follow up on all  the clues and leads, investigating and verifying them  thoroughly. Letters and telephone calls that inform on leading  cadres must be reported to the authorities above accurately.  Nobody shall conceal or suppress letters and other materials  from the masses containing accusations against leading cadres.  In checking out the accusations, we must take a  seek-truth-from-facts attitude. Right must be distinguished from  wrong through investigations. Where the law has clearly been  broken and discipline breached, the offender must be handled in  strict accordance with the appropriate regulations. Not for a  moment can we be soft-hearted, relent, and tolerate corruption.  Things that are out of step with reality must be promptly  clarified.    Third, the rules must be enforced resolutely and unhealthy  trends must be corrected in earnest. The management of lending  must be tightened and every effort made to prevent new lending  in violation of the law. Where loans have been made illegally,  more must be done to sort out the mess. The loans must be repaid  and handled on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the 10  regulations laid down by the bank's headquarters. Interest rate  management regulations must be enforced strictly. Unauthorized  and covert increases in interest rates must be investigated and  stopped. All regulations pertaining to the collection of fees  and charges must be implemented strictly. Nobody shall increase  without authorization the rates at which fees are collected or  collect fees other than those which have been authorized. Links  with institute-operated economic entities must be severed  without delay and funds previously given to such entities should  be recalled. A determined effort must be made to correct all  kinds of unhealthy trends in the industry in light of the  reality in the branches. People who demand payments must be  severely criticized and handled. Appropriate rules and  regulations as well as organizational discipline should also be  drawn up. Democratic practices for party members and leading  cadres must be steadfastly adhered to, as must the "two opens  and one supervision" system so that the bank develop good habits  and establish sound discipline.    Fourth, ideological and political education must be  intensified. For the majority of party members and cadres in the  PBOC system, the anti-corruption campaign is essentially a  question of learning, of education. Ideological and political  education takes care of the root causes of the problem as well  as its symptoms and is as such a big part of comprehensive  treatment. In the anti-corruption campaign, party organs at all  levels must always intensify ideological and political education  for the vast number of party members and cadres, treating this  as the core of the campaign. The anti-corruption campaign must  go hand in hand with the drive to improve the quality of the  contingent of workers. A serious in-depth studying campaign  should be organized for all party members and cadres so that  they will resist money worship, hedonism, and  ultra-individualism on their own initiative and develop the  right philosophy of life.    2. Master the Principles of the Anti-Corruption Campaign and  Know Its Policy Limits. Ensure Its Healthy Development.    The anti-corruption campaign covers a wide area and is  closely related to policies. Party organs at all levels must  adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, correctly  distinguish between and handle the two kinds of contradictions,  and enforce the policies strictly. Their attitude must be firm,  their work solid, solving problems in earnest to meet the  requirements of the CPC Central Committee and ensuring a healthy  and orderly course for this campaign. They must take pains to  abide by the following principles in the anti-corruption  campaign:    A. Revolving closely around the core of banking work today,  integrate the anti-corruption campaign organically with the  rectification of financial order and the strengthening of  financial discipline in accordance with the spirit of the  instructions of the CPC Central Committee and State Council  regarding financial work. Correctly handle the relations between  the campaign against corruption and the deepening of reform.  Never waver from the central task of economic construction. The  anti-corruption campaign must firmly adhere to the party's basic  line, revolve around the core task of economic construction  closely, and contribute to the deepening of reform.    B. Concentrate on anti-corruption work targeting leading  organs and leading cadres. The headquarters and provincial  branches must position themselves at the forefront of the  anti-corruption drive. Headquarters organs should concentrate on  leading groups at the two levels of bank and department while  provincial branches should focus on leading groups at the bank  and office. Only by zeroing in on leading groups can we get the  anti-corruption campaign fully off the ground and truly create a  good party style, good banking practices, and an atmosphere  where people are encouraged to be honest and law-abiding.  Leading cadres must do more than just tackling their own units;  they must clean up the entire PBOC system. They must strive to  meet the demand of the CPC Central Committee that leading cadres  be honest and law-abiding. Only when they become honest  themselves will they gain a voice and be able to seize the  initiative in the anti-corruption campaign. Leading cadres must  think of the big picture and stop being Mr. Nice Guy. They must  summon up the courage to take responsibility and lead the  rank-and-file cadres as well as the masses in combating  corruption.    C. Do not turn the anti-corruption campaign into a mass  movement or give everybody a passing grade.    Leading cadres must examine and correct themselves based on  the CPC Central Committee's "five regulations" on honesty and  self-discipline. Supervision by the masses must be beefed up  significantly. The public reporting system must be further  improved. Discipline inspection organs should investigate issues  raised in complaints from the public in accordance with the law.    D. Handle cases in strict accordance with the law.  Discipline  inspection organs must get to the bottom of cases where the law  has been broken, basing themselves on facts and using the law as  their criterion. Cases in which the criminal code has been  violated should be turned over to judicial organs for  investigation. People who obstruct the investigation of a case  seriously should be firmly dealt with. Corruption and other  negative phenomena have so far been dealt with in an excessively  lenient and half-hearted manner. That must now come to an end.  People who should be dismissed or criticized should be handled  accordingly. In cases where the conduct of an individual should  be reported or circulated, that should also be done. Problems  resulting from omissions and errors in day-to-day work and  management must not be categorically regarded as corruption. Be  careful to cherish the enthusiasm for reform and the creative  spirit. Protect comrades who make mistakes as they experiment  with reform. Help them review the experience and draw lessons  therefrom and encourage them to continue to push ahead. In the  course of financial reform, new issues will crop up of which we  do not have a clear understanding right away. Deal with them  cautiously. Don't make rash decisions.    E. Even as we combat corruption unwaveringly, we must give  wide publicity to the positive. Even as we crack down hard on  all manner of corruption and punish corrupt elements, we must  publicize and commend loud and clear and in a variety of ways  advanced models who are honest and law-abiding and have the  courage to take on corruption. Spotlight the new spirit of  arduous struggle and of giving. Launch activities to study Jao  Yulu [3542 5940 4389], Lei Feng [7191 6912], and the "two Lans"  in depth. Further raise the ideological tone of the vast number  of cadres and workers and enhance their ability to withstand  corruption and change on their own initiative.    3. Strengthen the Leadership of the Anti-Corruption Campaign    The struggle against corruption is a complex and arduous  mission. Party organs of the PBOC at all levels must move  vigorously to step up leadership effectively, with people from  top to bottom working together to produce practical results and  ensure that the CPC Central Committee's plans are carried  through.    A. Comrades in charge of party organs at all levels in the  PBOC must assume full responsibility for leading the  anti-corruption campaign. Get involved personally. Play a  personal role in planning. Stick to the policy of "grappling  with two hands, both aggressively." Tackle the anti-corruption  campaign and the promotion of honesty in the party as the top  priority for the moment and make an earnest effort to pull it  off. Leading groups at all levels should make plans for and  organize the implementation of the anti-corruption campaign  within their own jurisdiction. Major problems that appear in the  campaign must be reported promptly and handled properly.    B. Establish a responsibility system at each level, with one  level supervising the next. The masses must be fully mobilized  to combat corruption under the leadership of party organs at all  levels. Each level should be held accountable to the one above  and help the one below. The headquarters should step up guidance  and inspection of the branches. When a branch, unit, department,  or office experiences serious problems, the departments at the  higher level should send people there to help sort out the mess.  In short, the anti-corruption campaign calls for real work. In  some places of the bank system, work is half-hearted, unhealthy  tendencies are well entrenched, corruption is rampant, and  serious cases occur frequently with little effort being made to  investigate them. As far as these places are concerned, apart  from dealing with the personnel who have broken the law, the  leaders concerned should also be held accountable.    C. Establish sound and coherent rules and regulations and  perfect the mechanism for supervision and restraint. To  eliminate corruption, we must create effective preventive and  restraint mechanisms and a work system that are well suited to  the socialist market economy. The anti-corruption campaign must  be written into law. Identify those areas and linkages that are  particularly vulnerable to corruption, taking into account the  reality in banking work and the fact that thus far policies,  laws, and regulations have failed to keep pace, and diligently  formulate a host of rules and regulations in order to eliminate  the soil on which corruption depends for its survival.    D. Strengthen and support the work of discipline inspection  and supervision departments and party organs. Make the most of  full-time organs. Party organs at all levels must hear reports  from discipline inspection and supervision departments and party  committees. Firmly support them in discharging their  responsibilities in accordance with the party constitution and  the law. Assign them tasks, give them ideas, and help them solve  practical problems encountered in their work. Equip them with  adequate resources to handle the cases based on the needs of  their actual work and speed up the investigations.    Even as we combat corruption, we must commit ourselves to  developing a contingent of workers for the banking industry and  strengthening the organization of leading groups at all levels  as well as developing their ideology and practices. Make a  mighty effort to do a good job here by taking a range of  measures of proven effectiveness.    The anti-corruption campaign is a long-term arduous task to  be tackled as a piece of systems engineering. By combating  corruption, we should raise the political caliber of the  contingent of PBOC workers to e new level and advance banking  work further.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Kingston (NICA)--The Customs Department and the  Narcotics Police Division have their hands full these days  detecting cocaine being smuggled to Jamaica from Panama, Curacao  and Colombia by paid "mules" (female couriers).    The smugglers target especially, the COPA flight from  Panama,  ALM from Curacao, and SAM from Colombia.    The female cocaine smugglers, who hide the drug in body  cavities, are reported to be paid US$200 each when they deliver  the drug intact. On the average, each packet recovered from  vaginal searches weigh 14 ounces. The search is always done by a  doctor.    A Customs Department spokesman explains: "Once we target  them  and take them down to the search room, the doctor does all the  searching. And we have all the equipment, forceps and boxes and  boxes of sterilized gloves." The spokesman pointed out that  although the law states that a female customs officer could  search a female patient, the internal searches are done by  female doctors only.    On being recruited here as couriers, most of the women,  first-time travellers, claim they are higglers going to buy  goods abroad. Their airfares are paid and they are provided with  accommodation, food and ground transport in the country where  they go to pick up the cocaine. Usually, they go and return on  SAM, COPA or ALM. Usually, the recruiter travels to Jamaica on  the return flight with them, having supplied them with the drug  in the source country. Once they arrive here safely with the  drug--that is they clear Customs and the Narcotics Police  without the cocaine being discovered--they are paid.    Men are recruited as couriers too, their method of choice  being swallowing balls of cocaine in condoms. Men and women  couriers smuggle the cocaine in autoparts, and other  merchandise, in bath soaps, in hollowed-out custom-built clothes  hangers, in wig and sneakers or submerging it in cooking oil.    Of nine women targeted by Customs in September as "mules,"  six were held. But three escaped. In September, four men  suspected of having swallowed cocaine balls in condoms escaped  from the Cornwall Regional Hospital, Montego Bay, by jumping  through a window. A man who arrived at Sangster International  Airport, Montego Bay, on the SAM flight from Colombia, the same  month, was found to have swallowed 63 pieces of crack cocaine.    Estimated street value of cocaine in Jamaica now is $200,000  to $230,000 a kilo. In 1992 when cocaine was more plentiful, the  price was $180,000 a kilo.    Wily cocaine smugglers change their techniques frequently,  but the Customs Department and the Narcotics Police catch on  just as fast.    Women smugglers started another trend recently--smuggling  cocaine in lotion bottles having liquefied it. The result is  that Customs is now giving these lotion bottles a more-than  cursory check.    Then there is the "internal conspiracy" at the island's two  international airports, the Norman Manley in Kingston, and the  Sangster, Montego Bay, whereby the courier, by prior  arrangement, deposits the cocaine in the female toilet or in  flower pots, and employees there pick it up.    And ganja trafficking continues to be a problem, showing up  more frequently these days in mailbags bound for the U.S.A.,  especially from the Norman Manley International Airport. Random  probes with sharp instruments of "normally wrapped parcels" in  mailbags have been turning up ganja.    Drug smuggling continues on other fronts too, targeting in  particular legitimate exports such as ground provisions.    "The ganja is smuggled in every section of an empty  container  that you can think of--the ceiling, the floor, the walls," the  Customs spokesman said.    "Then they are put in drums, labelled something else and  shipped. But the smuggler's choice these days for getting out  the ganja, is in scrap metal, because it is so difficult to  handle."</p>

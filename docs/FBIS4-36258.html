			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabbi Shlomo Goren [former chief army chaplain] has  once again published a halakhic edict pertaining to political  affairs; this time with regard to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat.  In his halakhic edict, Rabbi Goren contends that Yasir 'Arafat  deserves to die according to both Israeli and international law,  because he has declared a jihad. Our correspondent Gil Litman  reports that the halakhic ruling is included in a communique  published by the Committee of Jewish rabbis in Judaea, Samaria,  and the Gaza Strip.</p>

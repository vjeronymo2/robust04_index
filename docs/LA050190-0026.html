			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY URGED TO SETTLE DANCER'S $250,000 SUIT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Claims Board voted Monday to recommend paying $250,000  to settle the lawsuit of a dance student who was disabled in a car crash on her  way home from the Renaissance Pleasure Faire 14 years ago.  </P> <P> Debra Thompson was injured when her husband swerved off a two-lane road to  avoid a head-on collision with another car while trying to pass other vehicles  on a blind curve in April, 1976, said Lloyd Halstead, vice-chair of the claims  board.  </P> <P> Thompson, who was 19 at the time of the accident, sued the county, alleging  that cars leaving the fair were routed onto a road that should have been marked  with signs warning motorists of the curve, and that the street should have been  designated as a no-passing zone, Halstead said.  </P> <P> The accident left Thompson unable to dance because one leg is now an inch  shorter than the other, Halstead said. He said she incurred $108,000 in medical  bills, and lost another $100,000 in wages as a result of the accident.  </P></p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Caracas acts to curb rise in prices The Venezuelan government has extended the freeze on the retail price of medicines in place since the start of January for 90 days, and set maximum limits on price rises for some food items. The minister of economic development, Mr Luis Carlos Palacios, said that from yesterday prices for a list of mass-consumption food items frozen since January could be raised by a maximum of 2.5 per cent a month, just below the government's 1994 inflation target of 35 per cent. These items include bread, sugar, vegetable oil, rice, powdered milk, flour, spaghetti and tinned sardines. There are no controls on the prices of most other goods and services, although items such as electric power rates, public transport fares and domestic fuel prices are still regulated or set by the government. The government announcement came as a price control decree issued by the last administration was due to expire. Mr Palacios said business had agreed to exercise voluntary restraint on price increases as part of efforts to tame inflation, which reached 46 per cent last year. If prices rose too quickly, he said the government could use the special economic powers it assumed last weekend to order strict price controls. In a second stage of the administration's inflation control plan, officials will try to convince businesses from producer to retail level to restrain price increases voluntarily for other goods and services not included in the mass consumption list.</p>

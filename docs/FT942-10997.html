			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Asia's big spenders put luxury back into shopping - Things are starting to look up in the world of exclusive labels and goods Asprey, the exclusive London gift shop, recently sold a gold and lapis lazuli nickelodeon for Pounds 300,000 (Dollars 447,000) to an Asian businessman. Now Pounds 300,000 objets are not sold by Asprey every day - but it has been selling them more often since the start of this year. 'The market is still very erratic,' says Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, 'but business is getting better. There's definitely something in the air.' Asprey is not the only member of the luxury goods industry to have detected signs of recovery. LVMH and Hermes, two of the most famous names in French luxury goods, last week both reported sales growth of around 30 per cent for the first quarter of this year. This flurry of good news comes as a sorely-needed relief to the industry after three gruelling years of economic recession and a spate of distress-induced takeovers. Last year alone, Yves Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, was acquired by oil group Elf Aquitaine, and the Gucci family lost control of its Italian leather business to Investcorp, the Arab consortium. However, thanks to improving demand, the industry now seems more stable. Although some established markets, notably continental Europe and Japan, remain depressed, there is evidence of recovery in others. 'There's definitely a positive trend in North America,' said Mr Alain-Dominique Perrin, chairman of Cartier, the French jewellery group, 'although some European countries, such as Italy and Switzerland, are still weak.' One compensation for the squeeze on the industry's established European markets is the expansion of its business in eastern Europe. LVMH has already opened a Christian Dior boutique in Moscow and plans soon to open another for Louis Vuitton luxury luggage. Asprey this summer will open an outlet in Prague for Mappin &amp; Webb, the silversmith. The industry is also benefiting from the emergence of new markets in Asia. One of its biggest problems in the early 1990s was the collapse of Japanese demand, one of the chief catalysts of industry growth during the 1980s. Japan is still fragile, but other Asian countries are expanding rapidly. 'The Japanese market has stabilised, but we'll have to wait until 1995 for recovery to take off,' said LVMH chairman Mr Bernard Arnault. 'In the meantime, we're already experiencing significant growth in other Asian markets such as Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.' These new Asian markets have now replaced the Middle East as the main source of 'high rollers,' the super-rich customers who are likely to treat themselves to the extremely expensive one-off items - such as Asprey's nickelodeon - that are often highly profitable for the luxury goods houses. 'Almost all our big punters come from Asia these days,' said Asprey's Mr Attallah. 'In the old days, it was the Middle East, but that has slowed down since the Gulf war. Even the wealthiest Europeans and Americans are inhibited about spending money. But the Asians are the biggest gamblers and the biggest spenders. If they like something they'll buy it, no matter how much it costs.' However, the market with the greatest potential is China. Until recently, most companies operated there on an experimental basis in liaison with local partners. They are now investing directly, as Cartier did last autumn when it opened a shop in Shanghai. Mr Perrin sees China as 'unquestionably one of our most promising markets for the future'. The brighter outlook has already encouraged some luxury goods companies to adopt a more expansionist stance. L'Oreal, the French cosmetics company which owns Giorgio Armani perfume and Lancome skin products, last month acquired full control of Cosmair, its US distribution business. LVMH last week paid FFr1.96bn (Dollars 344m) for a majority stake in Guerlain, the French fragrance house. Guerlain is expected to be the first in a series of deals for LVMH, which has dramatically reduced its debt after unravelling cross-shareholdings with Guinness, the UK drinks group. Mr Arnault has already indicated interest in diversifying into jewellery. Tiffany of the US and France's Van Clef &amp; Arpels are being talked about in the trade as possible targets. 'We'll consider acquisitions, as we have in the past, if the right opportunities arise at the right price,' said Mr Arnault. 'In principle, jewellery is an area into which we might expand, but there are no specific commitments at this point.' LVMH is now free to commit itself, having last week finalised the Guinness deal. The luxury industry is now waiting to see where Mr Arnault will strike next - judging by his past form, it will not have long to wait.</p>

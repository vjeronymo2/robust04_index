			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Protection urged for currenciesin EMS THE Belgian presidency of the EC yesterday called for new measures to better defend the European monetary system against speculative attacks in the currency markets. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, told the European Parliament that firm proposals would be put to the EC summit in Brussels in December. This would allow a period of reflection on the August 2 monetary crisis which led to the de facto suspension of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Some EC member states, including Belgium and France, have made noises about curbing the power of 'financial speculators' but the majority are nervous about any move which could be interpreted as the reimposition of capital controls. In his testimony to MEPs yesterday, Mr Maystadt - accompanied by Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner - declined to outline specific measures to protect the EMS but both suggested a Community approach would be preferable. This involved protecting the EMS as a 'common good' and putting more emphasis on the system bearing the risks of intervention to support threatened currencies, rather than the targeted countries themselves. Mr Maystadt said sticking to present parities within the new 15 per cent fluctuation bands was dangerous: so too, was a return to the old, narrow bands of 2.25 and 6 per cent respectively.</p>

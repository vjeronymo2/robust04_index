			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Banks launch root and branch reform: UK banks are trimming their high street presence and redesigning their remaining outlets Mrs Geraldine Connolly has worked at the National Westminster Bank 'since we sat on high stools under gas lamps and used quill pens'. But as each day seems to bring news of branch closures, job losses and strikes in high street banks, she wonders how much longer her employment will last. Fortunately for Mrs Connolly, she happens to be sitting in one of the safest seats in NatWest's 2,700 branches. She is a cashier at NatWest's branch near Victoria Station in London. It is an unusual bank. Posters of financial products are on display in the large front windows; the manager has no office, but wanders around the large open-plan service area; no screen protects Mrs Connolly. It looks more like a shop than a traditional bank, where customers queue for services in a narrow strip of space, peering through cashiers' screens at bank staff sitting at desks processing paper. This is NatWest's vision of the future. The bank is working towards two goals - to cut the number of branches and change those that are left. In five years, there will be 55 such open-plan branches in the West End of London - compared with 90 today, most of them traditional. All processing will be carried out in two centres. Other banks are making similar moves. Royal Bank of Scotland plans to cut 3,500 staff in five years through branch restructuring, and TSB is cutting 840 jobs in order to merge its banking and insurance operations. It has upset staff so much that they staged a one-day strike this month, and another is due this week. By the end of the decade, many high streets will lack a stone-fronted bank with a manager sitting imposingly behind a wooden desk. Instead, banks will look like the shops around them. There will be fewer in suburbia. 'The high street is still important, but some suburban outlets that used to be valuable to us are less so now,' says Mr Bill Gordon, managing director of Barclays' banking division. The clearing banks acquired what Mr Gordon Pell, Lloyds Bank's Thames region director, calls their 'bland, heavy' networks in three stages. First was the formation of national clearing banks in the last century; then came the big 1960s mergers, such as the one between the Westminster and National Provincial banks; finally came upgrading of sub-branches in the 1980s as financial services proliferated. The result was an array of branches in which money was stored, cheques cashed, loans granted and paper shuffled. Staff were rotated around jobs to teach them each task. The banks made money by taking deposits, and gaining interest by lending it either on the financial markets or to businesses. Their presence on every high street made them the natural place for families to put funds. But things have changed. The past decade has brought a number of financial, social and technological developments which have been increasingly disruptive: Banks have faced growing competition for cash deposits from institutions such as building societies. Many societies now offer a banking service. Furthermore, societies have built market share with smaller, cheaper branch networks. The Halifax, the largest, has just 750 branches and 20,000 staff. Its ratio of costs to income is 43.5 per cent, compared with an average of 66.7 per cent for large British banks. Technology is reducing the traditional British reliance on the cheque, and shifting business towards electronic payment systems that do not require branches. The number of cheques cleared fell last year after growing over the past 25 years. The banks' Association for Payment Clearing Services projects a big expansion in the use of teller machines to obtain cash, while cheque encashment gradually falls. As interest rates have declined since the UK's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, retail banking has become less profitable. The banks calculate that base rates need to be at least 8 per cent to make traditional branch banking worthwhile, but they fear a decade of lower margins. Unless branches can be used to attract extra business, they are at risk. The banks are making lower profits because of badly judged corporate lending in the 1980s. Combined with a fall in the number of financial transactions, this has forced them to concentrate on lowering costs. Staff and premises, which accounted for Pounds 12.6bn of the Pounds 16.6bn total operating costs of large British banks last year, are obvious targets in the search for quick cost-cutting measures. Yet for all these difficulties, the banks have not so far chosen to abandon branch networks. This is partly for negative reasons. It is hard to sell old-fashioned branches, and the pace of staff cuts has to be slow enough not to provoke the industrial action seen in TSB. There is also a fear among banks that they risk their share of more profitable customers' accounts if they leave suburban streets too rapidly. Branch proximity is still the most popular reason for opening an account. 'It would be fine if you could get rid of a branch and keep customers, but it's not that easy,' says Mr Rod Barrett, a bank analyst at Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, knowledge of local customers helps managers to assess risk. An analysis by Robert Fleming Securities found that the farther a business was from a branch, the more likely it was to default on loans. 'Closing down branches may be self-defeating, because the quality of business in your remaining branches could worsen as a result,' says Mr Hugh Pye, a banking analyst at Robert Fleming. There are also positive reasons for keeping branches. Most banks believe they can raise profits by operating their networks differently. By taking the processing work out of branches, they can use the extra space to sell products such as insurance policies. This the reasoning behind TSB's insurance and banking merger, and NatWest's investment of Pounds 105m in a new insurance subsidiary this month. A lot of space can be freed by removing back-office work. The branches traditionally allocated 80 per cent of space to staff, and 20 per cent to customers. Data processing machines can now sort cheques more cheaply in processing centres. Midland has gone furthest in adopting this strategy; all processing is now done at eight district centres. Most banks want to end up with 'clusters' of branches of different sizes offering different services. Processing and business lending will be done in a central branch, while the smaller branches offer retail services. In Watford, nine Lloyds branches have been turned into one central branch surrounded by five smaller ones. Businesses are served by managers by car from Hemel Hempstead, six miles away. But altering branches is expensive. Converting a branch which has a traditional back office may cost about Pounds 250,000, and can run into millions. Banks are faced with big bills at a time when capital is scarce. To make such spending worthwhile, the new branches will have to produce higher returns. Whether they do so depends on the reaction of customers. There is already evidence that they may not respond well. In 1988, Midland was a pioneer in dividing branches into different types to serve different categories of customers. It is now reconsidering. 'The problem was that the customers lost a focal point for Midland, and they got confused,' says Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive. Midland is now breaking some of the barriers it erected. It wants to ensure that small business owners who visit a branch can also deal with personal accounts. This sounds suspiciously like a traditional branch, as Mr Pearse admits. But no bank thinks it will be enough just to do better what it has always done. To justify the cost of retraining and refitting, more customers have to use the branches. Mr Peter Burt, Bank of Scotland's chief general manager, says this is a stiff task because customers who travel a long way to visit a supermarket will 'hardly cross the street' to enter a bank. 'To date, branches have been profitable, but will they be an asset or a liability in 10 or 20 years' time?' he muses. The bank branch may have been a staple of the British high street for many years, but there is no guarantee it will last there forever.</p>

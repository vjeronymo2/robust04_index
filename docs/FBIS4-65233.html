			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--In order to continue as legal political  entity, the members of the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP)  have founded the People's Democracy Party (HADEP) as a decision  to close the DEP is pending in the Constitutional Court.    The petition regarding the HADEP's foundation will  reportedly  be presented to the Interior Ministry today. After pro-longed  discussions on whether the new party should be called the  Democratic People's Party or the Peace and Democracy Party, the  DEP members have finally decided to give it the former name.  Former DEP Secretary-General Murat Bozlak has been appointed  chairman of the new party, the emblem of which will be a  butterfly with black spots on its wings.    As the new party was being founded, the DEP rank and file  took part in heated discussions, laying the foundations for  division. The supporters of the Kurdistan Socialist Party (PSK)  led by Kemal Burkay, the pro-Kurdistan Democrat Party-Unity  (PDK-Hevgirtin) and the pro-Rizgari have not been included in  the new party.    Hasan Celalettin Ezman, a former Republican People's Party  (CHP) deputy from Bingol between 1973-1980, will be given a post  in the party.    Arguments that the new party should tend towards the left  and  defend the rights of the Turkish and the Kurdish people, as the  DYP [as published] has serious faults and inadequacies, have  influenced the shape taken by the new party.    However due to the fact that the majority of the founders of  the new party are Kurdish gives a hint that it will not easily  lose its Kurdish image. According to party sources the fact  that the program mentions elements such as peace, brotherhood  and humanism and that it is determined to use the political  platform until the end will help it to gain a leftist image.  With the foundation of HADEP, the Kurds in the political arena  will have realized their ambition to establish a new party.    If the DEP is closed, the HADEP will continue its  activities.  However it is known that some groups, who are not happy with  HADEP, are trying to found a separate party. The PSK supporters  have cut off their ties with the DEP and have not taken part in  HADEP. PSK members are reportedly trying to found a legal  Kurdish party. Halil Aksoy, a DEP member and active in the PSK,  has resigned from the DEP. Refik Karakoc, Kmela Yuksel, Latif  Epozdemir and Fethi Demir have also resigned from the DEP.  Serafettin Elci is proposing to found another Kurdish party.  It is known that Elci is continuing his activities in this  respect but there have been no concrete developments as yet.  Furthermore it is reported that Elci plans to exclude all  radical Kurdish groups and found a party which has the support  of pro state people and village guards. However it is said that  this party will not have wide spread Kurdish support. However,  the following view which is voiced in Kurdish circles is worth  mentioning:    "Let all the Kurdish groups found their respective political  parties and led the legal channels in this regard be opened.  This is very important to the solution of the Kurdish question.  Let the Kurds have the possibility to represent themselves  legally." The political spectrum will become more colorful with  the foundation of new Kurdish parties but under existing laws no  Kurdish words are permitted in their programs. We shall soon  wee what formulas are found to circumvent this ban.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. Kozin: "Petr Symonenko: 'Privatization Will </F> Be Halted'"]    [Text] A meeting of journalists was held in Donetsk  Saturday with V. Chuprun, a candidate for the post of head of  the oblast soviet and the present chairman of the oblast soviet  of people's deputies. Seats next to him in the presidium were  occupied by P. Symonenko, first secretary of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine [CPU]; A. Kiyashko,  acting chairman of the political council of the Socialist Party  [SPU]; and A. Gurbych, chief of the Donetsk Oblast press  administration.    "The soviet must have executive authority."    "The reason for soviet authority is to reflect the interests  of the people."    "The main figure is the working person, and not the  speculator."    "We have had enough destruction."    "If a professor becomes a janitor or departs, this is a  failure of the state."    "Land must not be turned into a commodity. Land must be  state property."    "Physicians now receive a wage at a level that is lower than  required for biological survival..."    That which we had occasion to hear at the meeting was rather  predictable. The press of the whole world knows that staunch  communists are enemies of healthy (and unhealthy, in their  understanding) sensations; therefore, the measures that they  organize always proceed smoothly and sensibly. There was no  personal criticism of the contenders in the preelection  campaign. There was a criticism of ideas that were alien to  communists, there was criticism of the policy of the top  leadership, and there was talk that someone, somewhere, was  "passing" something to someone and interfering with normal  living.    A substantial part of the questions was addressed to Petr  Symonenko, CPU leader. Speaking about the results of the  elections to the Supreme Council, he noted that there were  numerically enough left-wing forces in parliament to block any  antipopular law or decision. It is impossible now to disregard  a party for whose representatives more than 10 million persons  voted. However, it is impossible to claim that a victory was  won and that authority was gained. As an example, P. Symonenko  cited these figures: "Thirteen out of the 23 permanent  commissions of the Supreme Council are headed by representatives  of right-wing forces." The first secretary of the CPU Central  Committee shared the anxiety of a number of journalists about  the increase in the threat coming from extremists of  ultranationalist organizations, he talked about this with the  current president, and he reported to those assembled that this  question will be raised sharply in the future. The journalists  received information that the coal industry is now at the level  of 1954, and that 56 percent of the GNP is the production of the  agro- industrial complex...    P. Symonenko was asked: In the event that the CPU is  successful in the elections to the local councils, do you plan  to undertake efforts to change the pace and character of  privatization? This was the answer: Privatization has an  antipopular character. An analysis of it will be made.  Privatization will be halted.    The journalists also heard from the conference participants  that it was difficult for the Communists and their left-wing  comrades to get through with a word of truth on the republic's  television screens. The parliamentary newspaper GOLOS UKRAINY  deals with the life of the regions in a way that is unbalanced  and not objective. But the situation will be corrected, inasmuch  as the Supreme Council commission on the legislative guarantee  of freedom of speech and the mass media is now headed by V.  Ponedylko, a decent person and a member of the CPU from  Zaporozhye.    The two-hour meeting ended in a didactic way. The presidium  called on "comrade journalists" to summon the citizens of the  oblast to come to the ballot boxes on 28 June, for the local  elections have far more than just local significance.    Besides the great and selfless love of the people, perhaps  it  is only this summons that is common in the positions of all  participants in the election skirmish, from both the right and  the left. However, this division in Ukraine is very conditional  and is different from the main civilized world. In fact, none  of those who are "from the right" are above us. There are  right-leftists, left-leftists, and extreme leftists, and those  for whom statehood is above all things. However, it seems that  this has no bearing on the subject of the meeting that was held,  and since this is the case, let us all vote!</p>

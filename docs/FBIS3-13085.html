In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, Bal'awi added that the  savage massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque reaffirmed that the  settlements and peace are two parallel lines that do not  converge. Settlements are the antithesis of the peace process  because they represent an occupation force; a settlement is a  military barracks and an offshoot of the army. Hence,  withdrawal of the [Israeli] army, as a military occupation  force, must be accompanied by the removal of settlements, he  noted.    Bal'awi added that a settler is only an army reservist and  that the perpetrator of the massacre was a clear example of a  military settler. The massacre once again confirmed Israeli  institutions have so far been raised on grudges and racism. The  question posed is: Would this make it possible to achieve a  just peace, and can work be done to prevent such a mentality?    The Palestinian official said credible efforts for genuine  peace require immediate discussion of these settlements as an  urgent issue, and that international protection should be  provided for the sons of our Palestinian people. Bal'awi added  that the Israeli establishment, which was raised on rancorous  instructions and education, should not imagine that the  Palestinian resistance cannot continue its defiance,  confrontation, and all forms of struggle, until Israeli  occupation of the Palestinian territories is terminated.</p>

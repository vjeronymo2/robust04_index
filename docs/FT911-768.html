			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / South Koreans turn their backs on ageing party politicians: Street protests and the fall in government popularity SOUTH KOREA'S ruling Democratic Liberal Party yesterday marked the first anniversary of its official formation. But there was a distinct lack of celebration in the corridors of power, still less on the streets of Seoul. Instead, 250,000 demonstrators - mostly students and workers - spilled into the streets, demanding that the government resign, and clashing with riot police in downtown Seoul and several other South Korean cities. The protests, some of the worst in recent years, have been fuelled by the death of a university student last month at the hands of riot police. While dramatic, this spring's demonstrations are unlikely to pose a threat to the government. But they will further add to the problems of President Roh Tae Woo's administration which has seen its popularity fall steadily as a result of a string of scandals, intra-factional fighting and economic concerns. In the latest poll conducted by Korea Gallup, the DLP received only 18 per cent support. This is lower than that enjoyed by the Democratic Justice Party, the former ruling party, just before it joined together with two opposition groups to form the DLP early last year: the new party has proven to be less than the sum of even one of its parts. Demonstrations by students, traditionally regarded as the conscience of the nation, should never be taken lightly by Korean governments. But dramatic as it seems, the current round of unrest lacks the broader social support needed to achieve the students' demands. There is also much ritual about the protests. It would be a strange spring in Seoul if tear gas did not fill the air and if riot police buses were not lined up in front of the city hall awaiting the inevitable demonstrations. 'May is always the cruellest month,' notes Mr Nam Jae Hee, one of the DLP's most influential national assembly members. This year's protests should also be put in perspective. They have generally been less violent than those of last year, when radical students gained control of parts of the downtown area, setting fire to the US cultural centre. Moreover, the spate of self immolations by students which have so far brought three deaths reflect an extremism borne of falling support among the population as a whole. The demonstrations can be expected to continue at least until May 18, the eleventh anniversary of the Kwangju massacre in which more than 200 protesters were killed by troops in the south-western city. 'But we expect them to die down quite quickly after that' said one western diplomat. Of greater concern, perhaps, are the problems which will remain once the wave of protests passes. The unpopularity of the government, which has resulted from a series of scandals, intra-party factional feuding, inflation and rising housing costs, has caused a disillusionment with politics and politicians in Korea's four year democracy. The response from the government has often served to exacerbate the problem. Since the end of last month, two cabinet ministers have been dismissed - one to take responsibility for a pollution scandal in the south-eastern city of Taegu, and one to take responsibility for the death of the student. But the rapid turnover of ministers only adds to the sense of instability and the feeling that the government lacks direction in its policies. 'There is a crisis of confidence' says Professor Han Seung Joo of Korea University. 'But it is not the same as the crisis in 1986 and 1987 in the sense that it doesn't really translate into opposition to the system itself.' The reason, argues Dr Kim Hak Joon, chief assistant to the president for policy research, is the creation of a solid middle-class. 'They may complain, but they are strongly committed to the system and law and order.' 'Our political parties are strongly related to the past,' argues Dr Kim. 'That is why political parties and leaders have disappointed the masses and that is why nowadays there is much talk about the need for generational change.' Professor Han agrees. 'The only change is that the two Kims have got older' he says, referring to Mr Kim Young Sam, the number two in the ruling party and Mr Kim Dae Jung, leader of the largest opposition party and the other Kim's perennial rival. The opposition has failed to capitalise on the government's weakness and Mr Kim Dae Jung has been unable to extend his support beyond inhabitants of and migrants from the south-western province of Cholla. A poll last month by one of Korea's leading daily newspapers found that a full 60 per cent of those asked did not support any party. So for South Koreans, who turned out in their millions to force the introduction of democracy in 1987, there is disillusion. 'In the medium and long term this means an increasing alienation of people from politics' says Professor Han. 'This is perhaps the most serious problem.'</p>

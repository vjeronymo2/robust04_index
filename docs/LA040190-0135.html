			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY -- CRUEL PUNISHMENT OR JUSTICE?  </P> <P> Ted Rohrlich's article "Does Death Penalty Deter Killers? No Clear Answer"  (front page, March 23) gives the clear answer that death penalty advocates and  opponents are engaged in a futile and never-ending debate. The question remains  as to whether such arguing is necessary.  </P> <P> Is deterring murder the only reason for the death penalty? Apparently the  opponents choose to favor that as one of the (if not the major) reasons for  their opposition. They completely ignore the fact that no penalty for any crime  deters people from committing that crime. Is the world free from burglary,  robbery, rape, speeding or parking violations? They all have penalties, do they  not?  </P> <P> What then is the purpose of a penalty? The dictionary defines "penalty":  punishment for crime or offense. The overwhelming majority of people believe  that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment for murder. So be it.  </P> <P> HASKELL COLLIER  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

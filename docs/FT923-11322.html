			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: New look Arlen tumbles Pounds 884,000 into the red ARLEN, the electronics group, showed a turnaround from profits of Pounds 120,000 to pre-tax losses of Pounds 884,000 in the year to March 31. Mr Paul Cohen, chief executive, said that emphasis would now be on stability after a period of change. In the last two years there was the merger with Highland Electronics, the acquisition of Norbain Electronics, the Pounds 780,000 cash and Pounds 400,000 preference share sale to a management buy-out of Centrepiece Engineering, the closure of Haywood Engineering and the departure of Mr Maurice Dwek as chairman. Indeed the Pounds 350,000 costs of terminating the service contract of Mr Dwek - who has retained 750,000 shares in the company - were taken as an exceptional charge, thereby impacting the pre-tax line. There was also a sharply increased interest charge of Pounds 659,000 (Pounds 255,000) derived largely from the Highland and Norbain deals. Operating profits fell to Pounds 125,000 (Pounds 719,000) on turnover of Pounds 34.1m (Pounds 30.2m). Mr Cohen said the fall in margins was because the company had previously carried heavy stocks which had to be 'dissipated'. However, Sir Campbell Fraser, non-executive chairman, pointed out that of the post-interest loss of Pounds 534,000 only Pounds 7,000 related to the second half, as a result of the disposals, management reorganisation and overhead savings. Losses per share emerged at 3.8p (0.6p). Like the interim, the final dividend is being passed - last time a total of 0.5p was paid. Over the year borrowings were reduced from Pounds 6m to Pounds 4m.</p>

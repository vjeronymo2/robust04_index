			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEA GARDEN TO GET OFF GROUND IN BALBOA PARK  </P> <P> Gold Gulch Canyon in Balboa Park is not much to look at now -- just a sparse  eucalyptus grove nestled in a steep ravine beside the Organ Pavilion.  </P> <P> But that will change next week when planners break ground for an $11.4-million  Japanese garden that they say will rival the world's finest and bring thousands  of tourists to the secluded site.  </P> <P> San Diego's variation on the ancient Japanese art form will showcase miniature  mountains, waterfalls, paths and a pond. A tea house, cultural center, exhibit  hall and arbor also will be constructed, said Michael Yamamoto, an architect  coordinating the project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raised $1 Million  </P> <P> That, at least, is the hope of the Japanese Friendship Garden Society, a  nonprofit organization developing the garden. The society has raised $1 million  so far, enough to pay for the first of five construction stages, said Larry  Marshall, the group's president.  </P> <P> In the fall, skilled craftsmen and a master designer will arrive from Japan to  personally supervise construction, according to Yamamoto. Tokyo architect  Takeshi Nakajima, who built a similar retreat in Moscow, will direct the  effort, Marshall said.  </P> <P> The exhibition hall and a part of the garden along the canyon's rim will be  finished by spring, according to Yamamoto. The rest of the timetable depends on  how quickly the group can raise money from private companies, individuals and  grants, Marshall said. Because of the need to raise funds, the project would  take at least a decade to complete, he said.  </P> <P> "We are in there for the long haul, but it's important for us to start now and  generate some excitement," Marshall said.  </P> <P> But, even if the garden's construction lasts a decade, that will not match the  time it took to reach the ground-breaking ceremony. The master plan for the  garden was approved by the City Council in 1979, after the San Diego-Yokohama  Sister City Society first proposed the project in the 1960s.  </P> <P> After its third stage is completed, the 11.5-acre garden will attract 200,000  visitors each year, Marshall predicted, adding that it could eventually rival  the San Diego Zoo as a tourist attraction.  </P> <P> A Japanese garden was built in San Diego in 1915 for the Panama-California  Exposition, but it was dismantled four decades later to make way for the  Children's Zoo, Marshall said.  </P> <P> Designers of Japanese gardens stress a more natural look than the clipped and  manicured European gardens, according to Ernest Chew, an expert in the field.  </P> <P> Used in ancient Japan for Zen Buddhist meditation, Japanese gardens are popular  worldwide, Marshall said. "There is one in every significant city in the  world," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Volatile Dow finishes firmly on late buying Wall Street US SHARE prices ended higher on late buying yesterday after the rise in German discount rate, the withdrawal of Mr Ross Perot from the presidential race and a bigger than expected fall in weekly jobless claims had earlier caused stock markets to fluctuate, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, having moved back and forth all day, was up a net 16.21 at 3,361.63. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained just 0.44 at 417.54, the American SE composite was up 1.47 at 388.34 and the Nasdaq composite put on 0.72 to 576.19. Turnover on the New York SE was fairly heavy at 207m shares. Prices fell in early trading following the rise in German discount rate, which prompted a sell-off in the dollar and raised concern about how tighter German monetary policy would affect global economic growth. Investors were also worried that a weak dollar, while helping US exporters, could add to domestic inflation. There was some good news, however, in the form of a 15,000 decline in early July weekly jobless claims and Mr Perot's departure from the presidential election campaign. The latter provoked a brief rush of buying on the belief that President Bush's chances of staying in the White House had been boosted by Mr Perot's withdrawal. Although the Perot-inspired gains were quickly lost, a late round of buying pushed prices firmly into positive territory. Second quarter earnings figures again dominated trading, although investors seemed in a mood to take profits after companies announced their results. One of the most actively traded stocks was Blockbuster, off Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 12 1/2 in volume of 3m shares after the video chain store group said it expected to report second quarter profits of around 16 to 17 cents a share early next week. Telefonos de Mexico moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 49 5/8 in turnover of 7.1m shares on the withdrawal of Mr Perot from the election race. Mexican stocks had fallen dramatically last month, partly on fears that if Mr Perot won the presidency he would scupper the US-Mexican free trade agreement. Bank shares lost ground as investors sold in the wake of the sector's good recent gains. Citicorp slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 19 3/4 and Chemical Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 5/8 . The market was aided by substantial rises in Digital Equipment, up Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 40 3/4 , IBM, Dollars 1 ahead at Dollars 100 1/4 , and Minnesota Mining, Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 99 1/2 . Canada TORONTO stocks closed with a slightly firmer tendency following moderately active trading. The TSE 300 index put on 3.5 to 3,475.6, while advances led declines by 287 to 233 after volume of 30.6m shares. Canadian steel industry executives told a news conference that they have initiated anti-dumping actions against US steel makers, in retaliation for similar charges filed last month by US steel makers against Canada and other countries. Among Canadian steel concerns, Dofasco was unchanged at CDollars 13 7/8 , Stelco 'A' was up 30 cents at CDollars 3.90 and Ipsco gained CDollars  1/8 at CDollars 18 5/8 .</p>

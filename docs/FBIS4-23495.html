			<p>BFN     [Text] In the past few months, the Chadian Government has  initiated peace talks with political and military movements  based in the Lake Chad and southern Chad region. One such  movement is the Movement for Democracy and Development [MDD],  and Moussa Medella, one of its officials, talked to our  correspondent Malam Yaro in Niamey about the progress made in  the negotiations with the government.    [Begin recording] [Medella] Yes, we have been contacted  several times by Ndjamena through the official channels but  Ndjamena wants to hold separate negotiations whereas the MDD  wants general negotiations involving all the sons of this  country. Since Chad experienced a civil war some time ago, we  really want a general solution for all Chadians.    [Yaro] Another question, Sir: Does the MDD plan to  participate in the upcoming elections in Chad?    [Medella] Well, we are far from resolving the election  problem because none of the conditions have been met. The  negotiations have not been completed, there is no national Army  in the country, and about 60 to 70 percent of Chadians live  outside because of the insecurity in the country. The  conditions have therefore not been met. [end recording]</p>

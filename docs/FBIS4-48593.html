			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In addition to its cruel, successive  bombardments of densely populated areas, the Jose Eduardo dos  Santos regime is once again using international relief aid as a  weapon against the people, particularly those living in areas  controlled by the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA].    Sources with the UNITA relief services today reacted to  statements made to the Portuguese television [as heard] TSF  [wireless] channel by the MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party] minister for social  reintegration. According to the minister, UNITA troops raided  World Food Program [WFP] warehouses in the cities of Huambo,  Uige, and Jamba. Minister Albino Malungo's remarks were  unfortunate and have been dismissed by [name indistinct], WFP  spokesman in Luanda. Unlike in the regime's areas, there is  neither wholesale theft nor social evils in UNITA-administered  territory. [passage omitted]    Other sources told our correspondent that Albino Malungo's  unfounded remarks are hypocritical because he should remember  that Norberto dos Santos, his predecessor in the same ministry,  was dismissed for diverting relief aid donated by international  relief agencies. The source added that such a situation is not  applicable to UNITA-controlled areas.    The sources urged the international community and relief  agencies operating in Angola not to allow themselves to be  deceived by Jose Eduardo dos Santos' regime. The regime intends  to use the shortages faced by Angolans to effectively implement  its militarist plan. The sources added that the United Nations  should as a matter of urgency review its operations in Angola so  that these cover the whole country, without discrimination.</p>

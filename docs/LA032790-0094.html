			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> BRYN-JULSON, OPPENS IN RECITAL AT SCHOENBERG INSTITUTE  </P> <P> Schoenberg's late-Romantic and Expressionist songs finally seem to be winning  an ever-wider circle of performances. Phyllis Bryn-Julson surveyed the  repertory Sunday afternoon at the Schoenberg Institute in a stunning joint  recital with pianist Ursula Oppens, which they also recorded last week.  </P> <P> Bryn-Julson -- who was last here less than a year ago in a series of concerts  with Pierre Boulez -- need fear nothing in the way of angular Angst and  abstraction, and she made the freely dissonant songs of "Das Buch der hangenden  Garten" sound like spontaneous storytelling. Her voice sounded slightly hoarse  and brittle at first, in an understated delivery close to heightened speech,  but warmed into a fluid performance that married expressive naturalness to  carefully calculated musical and textual point.  </P> <P> In the Four Songs of Opus 2, Bryn-Julson opened up in almost Wagnerian  expansiveness, an approach more effective in the raptures of "Erhebung" than in  the deceptively simple balladry of "Schenk mir deinen goldenen Kamm." She has a  big, gleaming voice, which she worked to uncomfortably overwhelming effect in  the small hall.  </P> <P> For a finale, the soprano turned to seven of the cabaret songs. There she  proved an insinuating chanteuse, supporting all -- from the rippling effusions  of "Galathea," to the barely veiled ribaldry of "Der genugsame Liebhaber" and  the glowing sentiment of "Mahnung" -- with warm sound, crystalline articulation  and generous spirit. In encore, she led the audience in a sing-along account of  the boom-boom-boom chorus of "Seit ich so viele Weiber sah."  </P> <P> Oppens accompanied with restrained brilliance, taking infinite pains with  pedaling and color, exploding where needed with orchestral depth and bravura.  Her effort was beautifully balanced with Bryn-Julson's, in pristine ensemble.  </P> <P> For an opener, Oppens played Hanns Eisler's succinct Opus 1 Piano Sonata,  emphasizing its motivic clarity and expressive variety in a crisp, eloquent  performance.

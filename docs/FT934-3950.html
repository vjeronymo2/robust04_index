			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Names likely to reject Lloyd's offer on losses Lloyd's of London will today publish details of an offer to settle legal actions at the insurance market, amid increasing signs that the offer will prove unacceptable to leaders of loss-making Names. Lloyd's is poised to offer Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - about Pounds 900m as settlement of claims of about Pounds 3.5bn. Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, which represents 17,000 Names organised in 37 action groups, said: 'There is little chance of Names accepting this. There is always a possibility that they will pull a rabbit out of the hat. But we expect to be giving strong advice to Names to refuse the deal.' The deal will offer 21,000 Names compensation reflecting a range of factors including the likelihood of success in the courts, the proximity of hearings and the number of loss-making syndicates to which loss-makers belong. Names on the Feltrim and Gooda Walker syndicates, who are claiming more than Pounds 1bn in damages, are expected to be offered about Pounds 500m of the compensation. But Names who were members of syndicates specialising in liability business, which have been hit hard by claims from US asbestosis and pollution, are expected to receive much less compensation. A number of the Names' leaders are worried that the settlement makes little or no provision for claims which have still to emerge on many affected syndicates and that no provisions have been made to cap losses for individual Names. Observers have been quick to criticise the apparent failure to offer Names on the liability syndicates better compensation. Mr Robert Saunders, a Lloyd's specialist with Smith &amp; Williamson, the private bank, said: 'Their losses are just as bad. Its just death by a thousand cuts rather than a bullet in the head. It is easy to buy off the high profile people and cut the rest off.' Lloyd's aims to finance the deal from three main sources: contributions of Pounds 400m from errors and omissions insurers, which provide insurance for agents covering legal awards for negligence; a contribution of up to Pounds 400m from its own central fund; and donations of about Pounds 50m from members' agents. Lloyd's is also expected to set up a new company, called Lloyd's Recoveries, which would take legal action for alleged negligence against accountants, from whom some Names are also seeking damages.</p>

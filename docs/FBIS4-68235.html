			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed news item: "The Kiev Cadets--Overboard?"] </F>   [Text] Close to 70 cadets from the fourth-year class of the  Kiev Higher Naval School [KVVMU] have arrived in Sevastopol to  serve a tour of duty in the Ukrainian Navy and in the Black Sea  Fleet. Thirty-eight of the cadets have already begun their tours  in the initial positions of deputy commanders of ships 3rd rank  with VSPR and officers in the battalions and companies of the  Ministry of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, while their colleagues  (more than 30 of them) who had concluded contracts with the  Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation have not gone to  the Black Sea Fleet.    The Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard Baltin,  rejected the cadets for tours of duty owing to the fact that the  fleet has no money. This is even though advance agreement was  reached between the command of the KVVMU and the command of the  Black Sea Fleet on the tours for the cadets, which was confirmed  by telegram of the Commander of the Russian Navy, Admiral Feliks  Gromov. The next telegram from the same Gromov prohibited doing  this. Why? This is not known.    The cadets from the KVVMU thus still do not have anything to  do. While the commanding officer of their tours, Captain 2nd  Rank Oleksandr Aksonov, tries to find a contact from the command  of the Black Sea Fleet, the Chief of Staff of the Ukrainian  Navy, Rear-Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko, has decided to accommodate  the Kievans on the grounds of the Sevastopol Naval Institute.</p>

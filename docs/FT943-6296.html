			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: MAN upbeat in spite of 30% drop in earnings MAN, the engineering and commercial vehicles group, claimed yesterday to have ridden out the recession, in spite of a 30 per cent drop, to DM160m (Dollars 98.7m), in net earnings in the year to the end of June. The recovery which took hold in the second half was continuing, and profits were expected to rise in the current year, it said. In keeping with the group policy of paying dividends in line with operating results, the 1993-94 payout is to be cut to DM7 from DM8.50, the company said. A powerful recovery had set in after a weak first half in which restructuring costs had compounded the effects of recession. Group sales ended the year down 4 per cent at DM18bn, after being almost 8 per cent lower at the halfway stage. New orders rose 11 per cent in the review period. MAN attributed this to a 20 per cent surge in foreign demand, which more than offset a 3 per cent fall in domestic bookings. The group reported a 30 per cent increase in demand for printing machinery during the year, while orders for machinery and plant rose 17 per cent. Even commercial vehicles showed a 10 per cent improvement. MAN started the new financial year with 5 per cent more orders on hand than a year earlier, while the workforce was reduced 6 per cent to 57,000 in the same period. Job cuts affected all sectors except diesel engines. Commercial vehicles shed 10 per cent of its workforce and the MAN Roland printing plant plant subsidiary 9 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AMERICA'S RICH GETTING POORER IN 1990  </P> <P> Forbes magazine released its annual list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people  today, spelling out what some have suspected with glee for months: Donald Trump  has hit very hard times, and he's not the only high-flier who crashed with the  1980s.  </P> <P> While the flashy developer was dropped right off the Forbes 400 list,  Metromedia founder John Kluge grew even richer.  </P> <P> The rags-to-riches German expanded his fortune by $400 million, to a staggering  $5.6 billion, enough to retain his crown as the richest of the rich.  </P> <P> But most of the top 400 saw their net worth dwindle.  </P> <P> "With the end of the great 1980s credit binge, capital values almost everywhere  are being marked down. Just as homeowners feel less wealthy than a year ago, so  do most of the nations' rich," the magazine said. "In 1990 the rich have been  getting poorer.  </P> <P> "Trump is the most noteworthy loser," it said. "Once a billionaire, Trump's net  worth may actually have dropped to zero."  </P> <P> Another loser is Merv Griffin, whose Resorts International, which owns the  struggling casino next door to Trump's struggling Taj Mahal, went bankrupt.  </P></p>

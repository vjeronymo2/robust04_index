			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customers originally had 97 days to submit comments and request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information; 56 of those days were after the public information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forum. The largest and most detailed request for data was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received by Western on July 1, 1994, which was 19 days before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the original close of the comment period. The final response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this request was faxed to the consulting firm, on July 19, 1994,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 day before the original end of the comment period. Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then extended the date it would accept comments to July 27,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, to provide commentors extra time to prepare a reply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western believes that ample time has been allowed for public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment and that information was furnished to requestors in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely manner. However, Western also recognizes that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be confusion and misunderstanding regarding the information needed by the commentators and that some of the information received may not be what was needed. Western will continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work with customers and interested parties to find a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient and acceptable process to respond to data requests and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the commentors' needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A customer organization said:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the backdrop of structural changes in the industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and increasing environmental concerns over hydro power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation, it would seem that Western should develop a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing policy based upon a firm understanding of price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity. The lack of any such analysis is a major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> omission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of Western's primary concerns is the impact the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices for its products have on possible sales. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowledge of the electrical power market, Western's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined rates for firm power are below other sources of firm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrical power available to Integrated Projects customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this reason, Western has not undertaken a specific study to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyze price effects on the electrical power purchased by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western's Integrated Projects customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There may be reductions of Integrated Projects energy usage in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the short-term by Western's customers as a result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed increase in the energy rate. Some of Western's Integrated Projects customers with their own electrical power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generating resources may be faced with variable costs that allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them to produce energy more cheaply than purchasing from Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the proposed new rate. Information on the cost of generation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is considered sensitive and is not available to Western.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, published sources of information which relate to coal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices and other components of the variable costs of power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation indicate that the proposed energy rate is less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western's estimate of their cost of generating thermal energy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western has received no comments to indicate otherwise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To help customers respond more completely to Western's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals, a customer organization suggests that, in the future,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when Western entertains the thought of extending the time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenting as done here, tie the extension to a period of time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following completion of responses to requests for information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western believes that the existing customer review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process and the public rate process sufficiently provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both flexibility for input and measurability of the progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toward the completion of a rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several customers concur with changing the expression  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the firm power rate from a `combined rate' to a `composite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate'.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western agrees with the customer comment and believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the composite rate will make the price of Integrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects power more easily comparable with that from other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e. Issue:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A customer states that they believe it is very unfair to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to increase the burden on the ratepayers to fund (environmental) studies which will result in further increases in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs and/or reductions in the amount of power available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted earlier, Western is working with Reclamation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to more closely monitor these costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 11. Issue Papers Resolution:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several issues which Western believes would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have caused considerable protracted comment were discussed in detail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the pre-rate-adjustment process of informal meetings between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various stakeholders and the exchange of issue papers. The stakeholders liked the process. The issues which were resolved in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process are summarized below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

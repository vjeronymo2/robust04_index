			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: A little introspection in order Sir, I was surprised and dismayed that a journal with the reputation and status of the FT should give space to the silly and bigoted views expressed by Michael Thompson-Noel (Hawks and Handsaws, July 23/24) about 'people from the regions' (is not the south-east a region?). I suggest a little quiet introspective research would be appropriate before he applies the expression 'micro-brained' to others. A H Hampson, 4 Grisedale Close, Formby, Liverpool L37 2YE</p>

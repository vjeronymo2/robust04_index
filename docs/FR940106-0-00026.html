The United States may reserve a non-exclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United Sates any such intellectual property, but shall not, in the exercise of such license, publicly disclose proprietary information related to the license. Title to any such intellectual property shall not be transferred or passed, except to a company incorporated in the United States, until the expiration of the first patent obtained in connection with such intellectual property. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the licensing to any company of intellectual property rights arising from assistance provided under this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Patent procedures:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each award by the Program will contain procedures regarding reporting of inventions by the funding recipient to the Program; determinations by the Program as to whether it will retain a governmental use license; march-in rights, and other matters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Copyrights:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as otherwise specifically provided for in an Award, funding recipients under the Program may establish claim to copyright subsisting in any data first produced in the performance of the award. When claim is made to copyright, the funding recipient shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship to the data when and if the data are delivered to the Government, are published, or are deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The funding recipient shall grant to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and for data other than computer software to distribute to the public by or on behalf of the Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Publication of research results:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The decision on whether or not to publish research results will be made by the funding recipient(s). Unpublished intellectual property owned and developed by any business or joint research and development venture receiving funding or by any member of such a joint venture may not be disclosed by any officer or employee of the Federal Government except in accordance with a written agreement between the owner or developer and the Program. The licenses granted to the Government under &sect;295.8(b) shall not be considered a waiver of this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Section 295.14 is added to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;295.14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Special financial reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each award by the Program shall contain procedures regarding financial reporting to ensure that awards are being used in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A&hyph;122_``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations'', Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 31_``Contract Cost Principles and Procedures'', or other sound accounting practices to be specified in the Cooperative Agreement. The audit principles to be applied to ATP awards are the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) according to the General Accounting Office's ``Government Auditing Standards'' subtitled ``Standards for Auditing Government Organization, Program, Activities and Functions''. Each award will be subject to an Attestation Engagement (i.e., providing assurance on representations of compliance with statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements) or an audit in conjunction with the recipient's annual audit at least every two years. In the interest of efficiency, the recipients are encouraged to retain their own independent CPA firm to perform these services. The Department of Commerce's Office of Inspector General (OIG) reserves the right to determine the time frame and/or level of service of financial audit reports that are to be delivered and to determine how the close-out audit is to be conducted. The use of an independent CPA firm does not preclude the OIG's right to conduct its own audit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14.

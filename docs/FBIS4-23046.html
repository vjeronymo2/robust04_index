			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ye. S. Lukin, N. A. Popova, and N. I. </F> Zdvizhkova, RKhTU imeni D. I. Mendeleyev; UDC666.762:539.4]    [Abstract] The achievements of recent research convincingly  demonstrate that the possibilities for developing new ceramic  materials having elevated service properties from oxides and  their mixtures are far from being exhausted. Development of the  theory of fritting, successes in powder technology, new  technological solutions to the selection of modifying additives  enhanced the development of theoretical foundations for directed  synthesis of new ceramic materials having specific properties,  improvements in existing technology and qualities of materials  thereby significantly expanding the range of applications of  ceramics. However, the problem of obtaining new high quality  ceramic materials in domestic industry has not yet been fully  solved, notwithstanding the need for developing a new generation  of components. This situation results from the fact that oxide  powders used for production of ceramics fail to meet modern  requirements, since they are not uniform in particle size or  shape and are aggregated and not evenly dispersed. Even with  prolonged milling it is not possible to obtain powders with less  than 1-2 microns particle size. Without special additives, it is  not possible to make ceramics having controlled structures and  optimal properties. Especially pressing is research on methods  of preparing powders having a given degree of dispersion and the  subsequent development of new types of ceramics from oxides  having high service qualities, possible only through utilization  of chemical methods of controlled preparation of powders and the  use of special modifying additives. There is practically not a  single type of high temperature oxide ceramic produced in our  country that is directly suitable for fabricating high quality  components. Research on the effect of powder structure on  fritting, micro-structure, and ceramic properties made it  possible to formulate a so-called ``ideal'' powder for making  ceramics having optimal properties: aggregate size must not  exceed one tenth of a micron, and they must have a spherical  shape, not stick together and increase in size with time, and  the distribution of components must be uniform throughout the  bulk and surface of the particles. Some small enterprises have  emerged in recent years which have initiated production of  dispersed powders of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/],  ZrO[.sub]2[/], and mixtures of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  with ZrO[.sub]2[/]. As a rule, these powders require  additional milling, calcining, additives, and compacting. The  technology of ceramics made from these powders is still at the  research stage, costly, and not widely used. However, they are  undoubtedly promising. A stable technology has been developed  for making ceramics from partially stabilized zirconium dioxide  from very pure powders using chemical precipitation, hydrostatic  compression, and fritting in air at 1450-1550 C. Durability  of these ceramics is 750-900 MPa. They are monolithic in  structure, less than one micron crystal size, and  near-theoretical density. These ceramics consist of grains of a  tetragonal solid solution, with the surfaces containing  continuous thin-layered coatings of cubic solid solution. This  inhibits crystal growth during fritting and enhances stability  at high temperatures. The use of these unique ceramics could  significantly improve the quality of components made from them.

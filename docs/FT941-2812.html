			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: German bank gets bonus from Luxembourg arm Deutsche Bank Luxembourg, the largest bank in the Grand Duchy, is paying its German parent bank a special dividend of DM174m (Dollars 103m) on top of a normal dividend of DM124m after making record profits last year. Pre-tax profits at the Luxembourg arm of Germany's biggest bank rose by 44.4 per cent from DM440m to DM636m. The increase reflected what Mr Ulrich Weiss, chairman of the bank's advisory board, called an extraordinary constellation of favourable factors. Profits from private customer business more than quadrupled, Mr Weiss explained at a press conference earlier this week, while the bank benefited from buoyant trading conditions in the world securities markets last year. In addition, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg profited from the sale of Third World debt at higher prices than its written-down value. This gave rise to a profit of DM209m, which Mr Weiss said would have been treated as an extraordinary gain in the previous year. Profits from mainstream lending business rose 12 per cent. The profits contribution from private customer business was not quantified, but Mr Weiss said that the number of customers increased by 28 per cent last year, with a 56 per cent increase in special depository accounts for securities. The volume of funds under management in these accounts doubled to DM5.8bn. The spectacular increase in profits highlights a massive transfer of funds from Germany to Luxembourg in recent years, triggered largely by the perceived tax benefits of investing in the Grand Duchy. The first catalyst to the flow of funds to Luxembourg came at the end of 1991 when the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe ruled that interest income should be subject to a withholding tax. A 30 per cent withholding tax was introduced at the beginning of last year, prompting further transfers of capital, but the capital flows have partially reversed more recently in anticipation of a modification to the tax regime. This flow of funds back into Germany - DM25bn in the last quarter of 1993 - is one of the main reasons for the 20 per cent-plus increase in German M3 money supply in January. Although investing in Luxembourg is not illegal for German citizens, the German tax authorities last month launched a raid on Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-biggest bank, claiming that the bank was actively helping its customers evade tax.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'GARY COOPER' DETAILS LIFE, LEGENDS OF ACTOR  </P> <P> Gary Cooper, the blue-eyed cowboy from Helena, Mont., was without question the  most beautiful of all the great American actors, the most genuinely modest and  one of the most unselfconsciously graceful. Like Henry Fonda, he became the  perfect image on whom we could project our feelings of what a right-thinking  American should be: a man of few but telling words, of unquestioned integrity  and deep-rooted values.  </P> <P> If you doubt that, take a look at "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend"  (Sunday at 7 p.m. on TNT cable), a powerful and nostalgic summing-up of the  Cooper life and emerging myth.  </P> <P> Unlike recent film biographies (John Huston, George Stephens or William Wyler),  this one has no interviews with cronies or co-stars to give it supporting  ballast or insider insights. Instead, author and critic Richard Schickel has  created a narrative, entrusted it to Clint Eastwood -- not a bad choice to  comment on another laconic American legend -- and picked the film clips that  most closely support Schickel's own theories.  </P> <P> The results may be a bit skewed, because they slight most of Cooper's urbane or  sophisticated characters and much of his deft light comedy in favor of his  Capra-Everymen and his Westerners, Virginians or Plainsmen. Nevertheless, it's  a literate, compulsively watchable hour.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, an hourlong program with breaks for commercials isn't long  enough to explore how Cooper, the consummate screen actor, learned how to use  the camera so potently, or from whom.  </P> <P> Yet for a biography whose consultant was the star's only child, Maria Cooper  Janis, this film is relatively frank about the affair that created the greatest  upheaval in the actor's life: his romantic involvement at the age of 47 with  his co-star in "The Fountainhead," 22-year old Patricia Neal. Their 2-year  affair, during which he left his family, is introduced as the moral conflict of  Cooper's life, although to understand anything about emotions on either side,  you'd have to turn to other biographies or autobiographies. Clips from "The  Fountainhead" aren't quite enough.  </P> <P> Schickel finds in Cooper's last, restorative films -- "High Noon," "Friendly  Persuasion," "They Came to Cordura," et al. -- a man returned to his best self,  as well as to his family at the end of the Neal affair.  </P> <P> Presumably "High Noon" and "Cooper's public defense of the writer when he was  attacked by witch hunters" washes away the image of Cooper's disingenuous  performance as a friendly witness before the House Un-American Activities  Committee. Certainly, it is more healing to close, as the biography does, with  the Cooper of Frank Capra and with a final legacy of images of the shiningly  handsome, quintessentially American young man, at a time in which everything  seemed to lie before him, and us, "so various, so beautiful, so new."SHEILA  BENSON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "A Just State..."] </F>   [Text] It is at the very least contradictory for Tirana to  seek improvement of its relations with Greece and the  international community while its stance toward the Greek  minority hardens. The latest incident was the persecution of  the Greek minority leadership under serious charges, which may  even involve the death penalty.    A basic prerequisite for the improvement of Greek-Albanian  relations is the protection of the Greek minority's rights in  Albania. The rights of the minority, basic human rights, are  not being protected as, in many cases, the current [Albanian  President Sali] Berisha regime behaves as that of the former  president Enver Hoxha did.    It has been announced that the six Omonoia members, who were  recently arrested, will stand trial and face the most serious  charges under Hoxha's regime penal code, which provides for the  death sentence.    The goal is most obvious: The persecution of Omonoia's  leadership is aimed at terrorizing Greek Albanians and making  them continue their return to Greece.    The method of terrorization by persecuting leading members  of  the minority is well known, but Albania is supposedly moving  toward a democratic system.    Mere talk about democracy is not enough when a just state is  not being established in Albania, a state that will fully  respect human rights. With its actions, Tirana must show that  it is developing into a just state that abandons arbitrariness.    Yesterday, the Government spokesman said that the Greek  side,  in its efforts to improve Greek-Albanian relations, has as a top  priority "respect for the rights of the Greek Albanians."    Berisha's regime must evaluate Greece's friendly intentions,  but also realize that no Greek concessions can be made on this  issue. The Greek side must also make this clearer.    Bilateral relations cannot be improved or promoted by  provoking, persecuting, and terrorizing the Greek minority.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUNNY AND WARMER WEATHER DUE FOR SAN DIEGO OVER THE WEEKEND  </P> <P> With summer nearly a week away, mostly sunny skies and gradual warming are in  store for San Diego this weekend, the National Weather Service said.  </P> <P> Forecaster Dan Atkins said typical June morning low clouds will probably  blanket San Diego and may linger a little longer in the inland valleys,  bringing a chance of morning drizzle today, but the cloud cover should burn off  in all areas by afternoon.  </P> <P> Atkins said he expects a combination of weakening low pressure and dissipating  marine layer moving northeast to notch the temperatures upward throughout the  weekend.  </P> <P> "It's going to be a nice, pleasant weekend with near-normal conditions," Atkins  said.  </P> <P> "The weather is pretty much on track for this month, with maybe a little more  sunshine than typical for this time of year."  </P> <P> Beaches and the coastal strip may be a bit cool; with temperatures in the high  60s to low 70s, but should be mostly sunny by afternoon.  </P> <P> Highs for the coastal strip will run 68 to 73 degrees and drop to 58 to 63  degrees overnight.  </P> <P> Inland the temperatures should range 69 to 76 degrees, with lows of 52 to 60.  </P> <P> Mountains and deserts should be fair throughout the weekend, with mountain  highs of 63 to 71 degrees, 42 to 50 nightly.  </P> <P> Desert regions may reach 98 degrees and are expected to fall to 63 to 71  overnight.  </P> <P> The surf is 2 to 4 feet at 12-second intervals, and the water temperature is 67  degrees.  </P></p>

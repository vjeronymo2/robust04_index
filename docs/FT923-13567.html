			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Economics: Unease over Germany's next move TENSION will mount this week as financial markets contemplate Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting, which may decide to tighten German monetary policy in a further bid to damp demand pressures. The strains in the European exchange rate mechanism likely to be caused by such a move could force other European nations to increase their own interest rates, at just the time when many would like to cut rates to stimulate growth. In the UK, the weak demand due to the recession is likely to be underlined by tomorrow's release of the latest data on the prices of manufactured goods at the wholesale level. Producer prices are expected to have risen by 3.5 per cent in the year to June, from 3.6 per cent in May, illustrating the strong disinflationary pressures. On Thursday, news is expected that the underlying increase in average earnings across the UK economy reached 6.75 per cent in the year to May, compared with 7 per cent in April, another indication of declining inflation.

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs prepare coal inquiry THERE IS good news and bad news for the government in the composition of the cross-party trade and industry committee of MPs which met yesterday to decide the terms of their inquiry into the coal industry. The good news is that the six Tories who make up the majority of the 11-strong committee include Sir Cranley Onslow, a former chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, who is likely to be a loyalist; and also Mr Keith Hampson, MP for Leeds north-west, who is still seen as a henchman of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. Other committee members expect Mr Hampson to keep ministers in touch with the committee's work. The bad news for the government is that the Tories also include Mr Michael Clark, the MP for Rochford in Essex who was one of the six Conservative MPs to vote against the government on Wednesday night. The Labour representation on the committee is in flux at present, with Mr Doug Hoyle and Mr Jim Cousins both about to leave for other parliamentary appointments. Mr Michael Clapham, MP for Barnsley West and Penistone, is set to join the committee. He is sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers and several mines in his constituency have already closed. The other vacancy is likely to be filled by Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman. Mr Richard Caborn, a former Labour frontbench spokesman, is the first opposition MP to chair this committee, and so is keen to demonstrate fairness. Other Labour MPs are Mr Adam Ingram, and Mr Stan Orme, former chairman of Labour MPs and opposition energy spokesman from 1983 to 1987. The committee set itself an ambitious inquiry deadline of mid December, so the report can be prepared over the Christmas recess. The first session will take place next Tuesday, when MPs will question Mr Heseltine.</p>

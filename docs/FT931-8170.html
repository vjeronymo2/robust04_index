			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Nobody's a Nice Guy now: Russia's political battles and ruined economy The mood in Russia and its sister states of the former union is hardening. It is now each state, each region, each individual for himself: the forced, and in part real, equalisation of both scarcity and provision under the old communist system gives way to a Darwinian struggle which grows more feral. This is the atmosphere against which the battle for power in Russia is played out (similar battles go on all about its periphery): it means that the 'constitutional debate' has less of the legislative chamber and the study about it, more of the whiff of rifle oil and the rumble of tank tracks. Everyone - Mr Boris Yeltsin, the president, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, their supporters and ideologues, proclaim that the price of failure to agree is chaos, dictatorship, the end of another Russian experiment with democracy, of which the longest was the period 1905 to 1917. They then continue to ensure that no agreement can be reached. The battle is over the constitution, but the field is the ruined post-Soviet economies. With no end to the crises in any of the former Soviet states, the richer are doing what the rich usually do with the poor - spurning them. This is most seriously the case with Russia, the richest in energy. The Russian cabinet met on Thursday, and made a series of decisions which, if followed through, would be momentous. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the new prime minister - who often shows himself, at least in rhetoric, to be a much harsher economic realist than his predecessor Mr Yegor Gaidar - told his colleagues that he wanted to switch over (more or less) to world prices in all dealings with former Soviet neighbours. He would no longer tolerate a situation where Ukraine bought Russian oil for a rouble-denominated song and sold 8m tonnes of it (as the Russians believe it did last year) for good US dollars. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of foreign economic affairs, said last week that Ukraine and other states would have to make military and other concessions if it wanted to continue receiving cheap energy: and Mr Vladimir Mashyts, head of the committee for co-operation with the CIS member states, pointed out that where Russia delivered 60-70 per cent of promised supplies, the CIS countries averaged about 16 per cent. A following through of this hard line means impoverishing already miserable states: countries like Georgia, where more than half the industry has closed and the black economy traders export the agriculture surplus to hard currency countries, and which owes 70 per cent of its current government expenditure to Russia. Other states are less dramatically dependent, but the tendency will be the same. No more Mr Ivan the Nice Guy is the message they are all receiving: now, even the most liberal minister must be a Russia-firster. None can ignore the imperatives of a people demanding an end to economic misery: nor can they fail to see the galloping disintegration within Russia, as regions within the federation, too, play the zero sum game of grasping after 'independence' (from taxes, state obligations, and the need to confirm to minimum national social and other standards). The politicians turn harder as it becomes clear to them all that 'the west' is not a rich and generous idiot. The International Monetary Fund, which earlier this month anxiously conferred in Washington with Mr Boris Fyodorov, the new economic chief in the cabinet, over the government's programme, believes it can do nothing until at least the basic rules of monetary discipline are in place - a system for controlling the budget deficit, real Central Bank interest rates, a rein on credits. Yet these are as far away as ever. Foreign investors and corporations, their hope for stability fading as the cases of mismanaged and stalled joint ventures multiply, cut back their representative offices and whine. The west, too, is no longer Mr Nice Guy. As with states, so with individuals. The post-Soviet rich are spectacularly rich, the men wearing Guccis and Rolexes, the women dripping with mink, the Mercedes 500 waiting at the Casino door with an ex-paratrooper behind the wheel. Most are criminal in one way or another, even if 'only' tax dodging: the darker side is a violent crime rate now going up almost vertically to the point where Mr Victor Yerin, the saturnine interior minister, spoke on Thursday of his being a 'ministry at war', and said that the population must be 'taught to respect the militia', of whom they had murdered nearly 400 last year. Again, if Mr Yerin's words become deeds, we will see a harsh regime - and can expect to see it welcomed. This tightening of the purses, of security, the emphasis on everyone for himself, underpins the political space within which Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov slug it out for constitutional primacy. Neither are much respected, though Mr Yeltsin retains recognition for his courage. The history of their most recent conflict is that of contemporary Russian politics - improvised, hectic and treacherous. It stems immediately from a deal made at the Congress of Peoples Deputies in December, under which Mr Yeltsin was permitted to call a referendum on a new constitution on April 11: since then, Mr Khasbulatov has attempted to sink the deal, and Mr Valery Zorkin, chairman of the Constitutional Court who guaranteed it, has descended into the political arena by saying he now thinks it a bad idea. This defection from his proper role, hardly noticed in the turbulence of the day-by-day posturing, removed the last planks of the legal framework which might have surrounded the manoeuvrings of those on top of the political heap. We exist in the now-familiar countdown mode: another deadline has been set within which, in this case, a preliminary agreement on the division of power must be drawn up by presidential and parliamentary aides over the next week, then put to a special one-day session of the Congress in early March. Mr Yeltsin appeared on television this week in a cardigan to say that he didn't trust these tricksters in parliament, that he would give negotiation a shot but that he really thought a referendum on a constitution was the best bet. Meanwhile, parliament should agree to hand over most of its economic powers to the government so it could have a free hand in sorting out the crisis: he too would refrain from interfering with the government he appointed. Mr Yeltsin's offer has no hope of acceptance. It may simply be a high opening bid, but it may also be the tabling of a set of conditions, without which Mr Yeltsin does not think the country can be governed and the economy pulled out of its dive. As he attempts to tighten control in face of the tearing apart of his economy and his country, he cannot afford to compromise further with a parliament which, under Mr Khasbulatov, wishes to govern the country too. Mr Khasbulatov, a former economics professor who comes from the Caucasian autonomous republic of Chechnya, has brilliantly used what was in Soviet times a purely ceremonial post to put himself at the head of a parliament whose members are inexperienced, divided and often ignorant: he has played a weak hand to the point where it cannot be ignored and must be either placated or beaten. His self-importance is large, as is his political intelligence. Often down, he has never been out. As the battle rages between the two men, the economic room for manoeuvre has disappeared, as has the 'democratic surplus' - the space within which choices can be made for compromise and consensus between layers of political authority. The politicians, too, are out for themselves: Russia and its neighbours are sucked into the vortex of their struggle, a largely supine citizenry condemned, yet again, to fear and wait.</p>

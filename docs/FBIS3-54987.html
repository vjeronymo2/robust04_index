			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Azerbaijani Military Procuracy has revealed that  the members of the Azerbaijani National Army are heroically  fighting on the battlefront to liberate our homeland from the  enemy. But it also said the following:    Many have been martyred and many others have become national  heroes, the pride of our people. But some have also displayed  cowardice and fled the ranks of the military forces at this  difficult time for our homeland. Several have taken their arms  and other material with them. Such people cannot be forgiven.  So the deserters will be punished severely. They may even be  sentenced to death.    Acting in a humanitarian way, the Republic's leaders have  decided to give them the opportunity to rectify their criminal  behavior by voluntarily returning to fight on the battlefront.  So, a department has been established within the Azerbaijani  Military Procuracy's framework. No criminal charges will be  brought against deserters who voluntarily apply for military  service before 3 January 1994. The applications must be made to  the following address: Azerbaijan [word indistinct], no. 30,  Baku City.    That applies to all deserters, regardless of when they fled  their units. If they don't, criminal charges will be brought  against them and they will be severely punished. We have the  strength and the means to do so.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale agreed  Thursday [12 May] that the two nations will try to resume the  bilateral trade talks prior to the July summit of industrialized  countries, a ministry official said. The accord on the stalled  trade "framework" talks was reached when Mondale paid a courtesy  call on Kakizawa at the Foreign Ministry for the first time  since the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed in  late April.    Kakizawa was quoted as saying there will be opportunities  for  the two nations to have trade talks prior to the summit meeting  of Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations to be held in  early July in Naples.    Mondale said he has similar views on holding the trade  talks,  according to the official.    Kakizawa expressed his hope to visit the United States soon.  He did not mention the timing of the visit, noting he has a  series of debates in the Diet to attend, the official said.    Mondale met Minister of International Trade and Industry  Eijiro Hata earlier in the day and they exchanged similar views  on the need to resume the trade talks.</p>

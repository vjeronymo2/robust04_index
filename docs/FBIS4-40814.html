			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Yuriy Solton from the </F> "Focus on Asia" program, entitled: "Signs for Easing Tensions  Have Begun To Appear"]    [Text] In connection with the possibility of resolving the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, station commentator Yuriy  Solton writes:    A series of new signs for bringing an end to tensions on the  Korean peninsula have begun to appear. Former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter's recent visit to Pyongyang was successful in this  respect.    During meetings with him, DPRK President Kim Il-song made a  series of important assurances. This is represented by  Pyongyang's intention to let the International Atomic Energy  Agency inspectors continue their work in this country's nuclear  facilities. The DPRK also proposed that its nuclear program be  frozen during the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and that  North-South top-level talks be held. The response by Washington  and Seoul to this overture was affirmative. However, some  politicians of Washington and Tokyo expressed a variety of other  views. Time will prove which view is correct.    However, what is clear today is a need not to hasten the  implementation of sanctions. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, who has well-informed sources, viewed that Pyongyang  had no nuclear weapon. He also said that it would take three to  seven years for it to do so.    Moscow worries that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  [NPT]  may be broken down. It worries so because in case one signatory  withdraws from this treaty, there may be a chain reaction. The  Russian foreign minister said that many other countries had been  waiting for their turns.    Russia expressed its dissatisfaction at the United States,  which had unilaterally and hastily distributed a draft  resolution on sanctions in the UN Security Council. Such a  resolution must include convening an international conference  during which how to ensure a nuclear-free status on the Korean  peninsula and ways to effectively ensure security in the North  and South of Korea must be discussed.    The writer says: Today, when new signs for easing tensions  on the peninsula have appeared, is convening such a meeting more  practical than imposing sanctions?</p>

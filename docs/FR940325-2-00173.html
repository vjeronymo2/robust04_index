The Licenses authorize the Licensee to use radioactive material under a broad scope license, possess an irradiator for calibrations of instruments, and possess an irradiator for irradiation of blood products and biological samples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> License No. 37&hyph;01317&hyph;01 was issued on October 25, 1956, and was due to expire on January 31, 1989, but is currently under timely renewal pending staff action based on a licensee request to renew the license, dated December 15, 1988. License No. 37&hyph;01317&hyph;02 was issued on July 19, 1957, was renewed on March 23, 1992, and is due to expire on March 31, 1997. License No. 37&hyph;0117&hyph;03 was issued on May 31, 1988, was recently renewed on October 4, 1993, and is due to expire on October 31, 1988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 13&hyph;20, 1993, the NRC performed an inspection of licensed activities at the Licensee's facility. During the inspection, numerous violations of NRC requirements were identified. The violations are described in detail in a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties issued concurrently on this date. The violations, which demonstrate a significant lack of management attention to, and control of, licensed activities at the facility, included: (1) 48 examples of failure to prepare written directives prior to the administration of radioactive materials to patients at the facility and a failure to instruct a nuclear medicine technologist in the Licensee's Quality Management Program, as required by NRC requirements; and (2) many other violations (related to such areas as failure to maintain security over licensed material, and violations of radiation safety requirements for irradiators, performing required surveys, providing training to nursing staff, maintaining appropriate procedures, ensuring control of material, and maintaining appropriate records) which collectively are indicative of a significant lack of management attention to, and control of, licensed activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The violations are of significant regulatory concern since the Licensee possesses a large broad scope license which places a significant responsibility on the Radiation Safety Committee (RSC), as well as the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), to ensure that licensed activities are conducted safely and in accordance with NRC requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Licensee's failure to maintain sufficient control of radioactive materials raises significant questions regarding the adequacy of the Licensee's oversight of activities at its facility, as well as its ability to assure that activities at those facilities are conducted safely and in accordance with NRC requirements. Accordingly, without independent assessments of the Licensee's radiation safety program and a performance improvement plan, there is a substantial question as to whether licensed activities will be adequately controlled at the Licensee's facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During an enforcement conference on February 2, 1994, as well as in telephone conversations on February 4 and 9, 1994, and March 16, 1994, between Mr. Lou Shapiro of the Licensee's staff and Dr. Ronald Bellamy of the NRC Region I staff, the Licensee committed to retain the services of an independent consultant to perform an assessment of its radiation safety program and to develop a performance improvement plan based upon the assessment findings. The Licensee has consented to the terms of this Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I find that Licensee's commitments are acceptable and necessary and conclude that, with these commitments and the implementation of an appropriate performance improvement plan, the public health and safety are reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health and safety require that the Licensee's commitments be confirmed by this Order. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I have also determined, based on the Licensee's consent and on the significant of the violations described above, that the public health and safety require that this Order be immediately effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and 33,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> it is hereby ordered <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , effective immediately, that licenses nos. 37&hyph;01317&hyph;01, 37&hyph;01317&hyph;02, and 37&hyph;01317&hyph;03 are modified as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The Licensee shall retain the services of a consultant, with extensive experience in the management and implementation of a broad scope radiation safety program, including activities similar to those authorized under the Licensee's program, to perform an assessment of the Licensee's radiation safety program. Within 30 days from the effective date of this Order, the Licensee shall submit the name and qualifications of the consultant to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, for approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Within 90 days of NRC approval of the consultant selection as described under Section IV.A of this Order, the assessment shall be completed, and a copy of the assessment report shall be submitted to the NRC within the following 15 days. The assessment of the Licensee's radiation safety program shall include, but not be limited to, a review of:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Keith Harper, Julie Wolf, and Seumas Milne: </F> "Euro-court Extends UK Workers' Rights"]    [Text] A far-reaching European Court decision affecting  the rights of millions of British workers threw the Government  on the defensive last night over its failure to give employees a  voice in their futures.    In a ruling variously interpreted as a devastating blow to  the Government and a matter of little practical consequence, the  European Court of Justice said that workers, representatives had  a right to be informed and consulted about large-scale  redundancies or when a business was transferred from one owner  to another, including when it was privatised.    The European Commission said that Britain would have to  change its legislation on workers rights. Padraig Flynn, the  social affairs commissioner, said: "There is no question that  change will have to be put in place to satisfy the Court ruling."    Mr Flynn would not say whether he thought the ruling would  open the way to compensation claims by workers whose jobs were  switched from the public to the private sector in the 1980's.    However, last night, Jack Dromey, the Transport and General  Workers Union [TGWU] official in charge of public services,  called on the Government to negotiate compensation for all those  who had suffered as a result of compulsory competitive tendering  -- or fight the unions through the courts.    He said the TGWU would take legal action against any local  authority which tried to derecognise unions. "We believe this  decision will put an end to derecognition in public services."    The Employment Minister, Michael Forsyth, said that the  Government would have to consider the judgment, but its effects  were extremely limited. Employers would not have to recognise  unions as a result of redundancy and transfers, but workers  would have to be consulted.    John Hendy, QC, chairman of the Institute of Employment  Rights, said: "The significance of the decision is not the  question of possible compensation, but a step towards democracy  at the workplace."    The ruling led to a clash between John Major and Labour's  environment spokesman, Jack Straw, during the European election  press conferences yesterday. Mr Major said it was based on a  European directive approved by the Labour government in 1975.    But Mr Straw insisted that the ruling was based on a law  signed by the Government 13 years ago. "It is now going to be  enforced to give British workers the same rights as those  enjoyed by workers across Europe."    John Monks, the TUC [Trade Union Council] general secretary,  described the decision as a "devastating blow" for the  Government. "Once again British workers have been shown to be  denied rights that are accepted in law in all other European  Union countries."    The rulings came in two cases brought by the European  Commission against the Government for incorrectly implementing  EU (European Union) legislation. The first concerned the  acquired rights directive -- known as Tupe in Britain -- which  protects workers' wages and conditions in a sale or transfer of  their enterprise. The second involved legislation protecting  their rights in collective redundancies.    British unions have used Tupe to challenge the practice of  worsening pay and conditions when public services are  transferred to the private sector. A series of court cases,  including a ruling involving binmen in Eastbourne, culminated  last year in Government acceptance that Tupe covered  privatisations.    The Commission brought its case on Tupe after a series of  complaints from workers and unions. The Court upheld the  Commission's arguments on almost every count.    The key part of its ruling was that the Government had  failed  to meet the requirement that employers consult and inform  workers whose jobs were transferred. One aspect of this was the  Government's failure to set up a mechanism for consulting  workers when employers refused to recognise unions. The Court  also ruled that the Government had failed to "provide for  effective sanctions" against employers.    The ruling on collective redundancies also said that the  Government had failed to legislate for consultation and  information. In addition, Britain's definition of collective  redundancy was too narrow.</p>

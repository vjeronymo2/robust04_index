			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In a letter dated December 20, 1993, William H. Honnaker III (Honnaker), vice-president of Goldman Sachs Money Markets, L.P. (GSMM) states that after a review of the CNA Transactions, it is the opinion of GSMM that the Trust sold and purchased the commercial paper at rates which are representative of those at which such paper would have traded on the open market for the time periods in question between unrelated buyers and sellers, and that the Trust purchased the commercial paper at rates which are representative of those at which such paper would have traded on the open market for the time periods in question between unrelated buyers. With respect to the Trust purchases, in a letter dated January 14, 1994, Honnaker states that GSMM could have found a willing buyer other than the Trust to purchase the Nestles and Unilever commercial paper if it had held or acquired such paper at the time of those transactions, and that the commercial paper traded by Nestles and Unilever was readily tradable in the market at the time of those transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In a letter dated December 2, 1993, Andrea L. Dullberg (Dullberg), a senior vice-president of Merrill Lynch Money Markets, L.P. (MLMM) states that the prices at which the CNA Transactions were consummated were within the bid-offer ranges for such securities on the dates involved. With respect to the Trust purchases of GTE and Unilever commercial paper, involving MLMM as broker-dealer, Dullberg states the purchase prices were the fair market prices of the commercial paper at the time of the transactions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In a letter dated January 5, 1994, another vice president of MLMM, John B. Sprung, states that it could have found a willing buyer other than the Trust to purchase the GTE and Unilever commercial paper involved in the Trust purchases in which MLMM participated as broker-dealer, and that the commercial paper issued by GTE and Unilever was readily tradable on the open market at the times of the Trust purchases of that commercial paper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Dullberg's letter does not refer to the fair market value of any other commercial paper involved in the CNA Transactions, and Dullberg states that as a matter of policy, MLMM does not opine on fair market value with respect to trades in which MLMM did not participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Michael B. Connolly, vice president of Citicorp Securities, Inc., states in a letter dated January 7, 1994, that the purchase prices in the CNA Transactions were within the bid-offer range for similar commercial paper on the dates involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) William D. Folland, vice president of CS First Boston Corporation, in a letter dated January 6, 1994, represents that the prices at which the Trust purchased and sold commercial paper in the CNA Transactions were equal to or better than the rates which such paper would have been quoted on the open market by a dealer willing to make a market in such paper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. In addition to the foregoing representations of the Independent Dealers, the applicants have also obtained the opinions of an independent professional analyst of commercial paper markets, Dr. Marcia L. Stigum (Dr. Stigum). Dr. Stigum (Ph. D. in economics, 1961, Massachusetts Institute of Technology), who is president of her money market consulting firm in Quechee, Vermont, represents that she is independent of and unrelated to the CNA Companies, and that she has substantial experience as an expert on commercial paper market issues. Dr. Stigum has submitted a report containing analyses of each of the CNA Transactions and the market environments in which each one occurred. Dr. Stigum represents that her report was prepared with the objective of addressing two questions: (1) Was the paper sold to and bought by the Trust in each CNA Transaction readily marketable at the time of the transaction? (2) Were the CNA Transactions consummated at fair market value? Dr. Stigum's findings detailed in her report in response to these two questions are summarized as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) All twelve issues of commercial paper sold to and bought by the Trust in the CNA Transactions were unequivocally readily marketable. Dr. Stigum states that in this context, the term ``readily marketable'' means ``highly liquid.'' She states that at any time, the original owner or subsequent owner of each issue of the commercial paper could have sold that paper at a fair market value to the issuing dealer or, in the case of direct paper, could have obtained a prepayment from the issuer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Dr. Stigum notes that all issues of paper sold by the Trust to CNA Companies, except for the Chevron paper, was ``dealer paper'' which the Trust had purchased from dealers rather than directly from the issuers. Dr. Stigum states that every dealer in commercial paper stands ready to bid for paper issued by one of the names which that dealer sells (i.e., ``dealer paper''), in order to make the paper sold by that dealer as liquid as possible. Dr. Stigum has determined that the Trust could have sold to an unrelated third party, including any dealer through whom the paper of a particular name is issued, each piece of dealer paper it sold to the CNA Companies, on the same date it sold that paper to the CNA Companies. Accordingly, Dr. Stigum concludes that all dealer paper in the CNA Transactions was 100 percent liquid. With respect to the Chevron paper, Dr. Stigum states that it was ``direct paper'' which the Trust purchased directly from the issuer, featuring the ability to have the issuer prepay at any time before maturity, and that this issue of Chevron paper was and is 100 percent liquid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Dr. Stigum states that two of the three issues of commercial paper bought by the Trust from the CNA Companies were dealer paper which carried the top credit ratings given by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poors, and that the third issue of such paper carried a split rating which even conservative investors consider to be quite acceptable. Dr. Stigum states that at no time during the period over which the commercial paper involved in the CNA Transactions matured, or subsequently, have any one of the issuers of such paper experienced financial difficulties that either caused the issuer's paper to be downgraded or caused the issuer to exit the commercial paper market. Dr. Stigum concludes that the commercial paper sold by the Trust was 100 percent liquid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

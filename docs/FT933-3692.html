			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Middle East Peace Deal: Pact bars Palestinian rule in Arab east Jerusalem THE historic Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement to be signed at the White House today provides for an interim five-year period of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In addition Israeli troops will completely withdraw from Gaza and an enclave, expected to be about 100 sq km, around the West Bank town of Jericho, giving Palestinian authority in these two areas a fuller meaning. Once the document, known as the 'Declaration of Principles' (DOP), is signed in Washington, several more agreements and protocols will have to be negotiated in the next three months to flesh out the agreement in such areas as elections, policing and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The DOP will come into force a month after signing. The text of the DOP, however, makes blatantly clear that a 'Palestinian interim self-government authority' will have no jurisdiction over occupied Arab east Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Israeli nationals in the occupied territories, and external security arrangements, foreign relations and co-operation with neighbouring states during the interim period. Negotiations on a permanent Israeli-Palestinian settlement based on United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 will begin 'as soon as possible but not later than the beginning of the third year of the interim period'. Permanent status negotiations will resolve all the outstanding issues including Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, security arrangements and borders. The first important protocol which will be negotiated after today's signing, as stated in Annex Two of the DOP, will provide for the withdrawal of Israeli Forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. The protocol should be concluded and signed within three months. Upon the immediate signing of the protocol 'Israel will implement an accelerated and scheduled withdrawal of Israeli military forces. . .to be completed within a period not exceeding four months.' The protocol on withdrawal will include arrangement for: A smooth transition; The assumption of internal security and public order by the Palestinian police force, consisting of police offices from within the territories and those holding Jordanian or Egyptian passports; A temporary international or foreign presence; The establishment of a joint Palestinian-Israeli Co-ordination and Co-operation Committee for mutual security purposes; An economic development and stabilisation programme, including establishment of an emergency fund to encourage foreign investment and financial and economic support; Safe passage of persons and transportation between the Gaza Strip and Jericho; Co-ordination for border passage between Gaza and Egypt, and Jericho and Jordan. Israeli forces will withdraw outside populated areas in the rest of the territories by the eve of Palestinian elections. Article III of the DOP on elections says direct, free and general elections will be held for a Palestinian Council not later than nine months after the DOP comes into force. Until the elections and the inauguration of the council, Israel will transfer powers to 'authorised' Palestinians. The powers transferred to Palestinians will be in education, culture, health, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, and the Palestinian authority will immediately start to build a Palestinian police force. Article VII says an 'interim agreement' will specify the structure of the council, the number of its members, the transfer of powers, and the extent of the executive and legislative authority of the council and a Palestinian judiciary. To promote economic growth the council, upon inauguration, will immediately establish a Palestinian electricity authority, a Gaza Sea port authority, a Palestinian development bank, a Palestinian export promotion board, a Palestinian environmental authority, a Palestinian land authority and a Palestinian water administration authority. After the inauguration of the council, the civil administration will be dissolved and the Israeli military government will be withdrawn. A second protocol, provided for in Annex I of the DOP, will have to signed on the 'mode and conditions of elections'. The annex says Palestinians of Jerusalem who live there will have the right to participate in the elections process. It does not say whether they will be able to stand in elections - a key PLO demand. The elections protocol will specify the system of elections; agreed supervision and international observation. Article X provides for a joint Israeli-Palestinian liaison committee to ensure smooth implementation of the DOP and the resolution of disputes between the two sides. Disputes which cannot be settled through the liaison committee will be submitted to an agreed process of conciliation and arbitration. Article XI provides for the immediate establishment of Israeli-Palestinian economic co-operation committee. Article XII says Jordan and Egypt will be invited to join joint Israeli-Palestinian liaison and co-operation committees, including one to 'decide the modalities of admission of persons displaced from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967'.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / People: Matthews - possible reunion with Beazer John Matthews, 49, has resigned as chief executive of Indosuez Capital, the London merchant banking arm of France's Banque Indosuez. His departure increases speculation that he is preparing to help his old boss, Brian Beazer, make a stock market comeback. Matthews joined Indosuez in October 1991 a few months after quitting Beazer, the fast expanding construction group. Banque Indosuez said that it was 'very much an amicable parting'. Matthews is reluctant to elaborate on his reasons for leaving save to say that Indosuez's ambitions for London differed from his own both in terms of size and capital. Matthews, who worked for County NatWest for 17 years, made his name as the merchant banker who helped Brian Beazer transform his small West Country building firm into one of Britain's biggest construction companies in less than a decade. When Matthews brought Beazer his first deal, the company was capitalised at Pounds 4m. At its peak, Beazer was capitalised at over Pounds 800m and at the end of 1988 Matthews moved across from County to be Beazer's deputy chief executive. However, Beazer expanded too rapidly, fell out of favour with the stock market and Matthews stepped down from a heavily-indebted Beazer a few months before it fell into the hands of Hanson in September 1991. Matthews is taking the summer off to ponder his next move. He does not rule out teaming up once again with his old boss, Brian Beazer, 58, who has been spending most of his time in the US where he is a partner in Louis Nicoud, a New York stock broker, and chairman of Beazer Homes USA, a Georgia-based housebuilder, which was floated off by Hanson earlier this year. 'Brian and I see ourselves as investors, getting involved when needs be, rather than full-time partners,' says Matthews. At the moment they are talking about backing the stock market ambitions of another ex-Beazer executive, Chris Pople, but are open to ideas, says Matthews. Indeed, he's prepared to offer a magnum of champagne for the best idea.</p>

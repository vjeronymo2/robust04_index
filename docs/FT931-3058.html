			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Effectiveness of 'green' measures questioned - Environment ENVIRONMENTAL groups and economists welcomed the 'green' measures in the Budget but were highly sceptical that on their own they would play much part in helping the UK reach its environmental targets. The imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and the increased taxes on petrol and car use were presented in the Budget as green instruments which would help the UK reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. The UK agreed at the Rio Earth Summit last July to stabilise carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000 to help combat global warming. Mr David Pearce, an economist at the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, described the Budget as 'encouraging and surprising. This is the first time that he - or any other chancellor - has mentioned the environment in any significant way and that partly reflects the advice he got from his 'seven wise men''. However economists were cautious in predicting that the tough stand on car use - justified by Mr Lamont because transport 'is the fastest growing sector' of carbon dioxide emissions - would have much impact. Energy experts rushed to point out that demand for transport is notoriously unresponsive to price rises. Economists are also concerned that the VAT imposition will give less environmental benefit than expected because demand for domestic fuel is also unresponsive to price rises. Mr Patrick Lane, from Oxford Economic Research Associates, said: 'It might well take a much higher tax than this to have a real impact.' He added: 'VAT is a very blunt instrument - different fuels contain different amounts of carbon.' Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation on Energy, said: 'On our sums, the most that the VAT imposition could do would be to reduce carbon emissions by 2m tonnes of carbon by the time it is fully effective - probably 1986-87.' The government estimates that the UK needs to reduce carbon emissions in the year 2000 by 10m tonnes from the projected 170m tonnes, and that all the Budget measures will save 3m tonnes. However, Mr Warren attacked as 'singularly optimistic' the chancellor's claim that the Budget measures together with existing energy efficiency policy would take the UK 'two-thirds of the way' towards those targets. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, said: 'The chancellor's claim that his Budget is good for the environment is bogus. He is doing nothing to encourage energy efficiency.' Mr Lamont's insistence that EC-wide carbon or energy taxes would not be imposed on the UK by the European Commission came as no surprise, as it repeats the tough stance taken by the UK in Monday's Ecofin council meeting in Brussels. EC officials have interpreted the stance as leaving room for a co-ordinated set of taxes by the EC members. Despite the scepticism expressed yesterday, the Budget's measures may be welcomed in Brussels as the UK's contribution.</p>

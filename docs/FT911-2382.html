			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Observer: Poacher's links It sounds as if Rodney Galpin, the ex-Bank of England gamekeeper now running Standard Chartered, has been doing a bit of poaching from his old establishment. Tony Nicolle, Hong Kong's 55-year old commissioner for banking since 1987, is being tipped to take a senior job in the colony at the Standard Chartered Bank later this year. He gives up his commissioner's job in five weeks and will presumably need a sanitising period before he can join Galpin's team. After all, his head will be full of the colony's banking secrets - including the hidden reserves of the august Hongkong Bank and smaller fry. Nicolle went to Hong Kong on a three-year secondment from the Bank of England where he had worked for nearly 30 years, ending his time drafting the 1987 Banking Act. At the Old Lady he was close to Galpin, then executive director of banking supervision, who was sanitised for a mere three months when he left to became Standard Chartered's chairman in 1988. So there's the link - and the precedent. Maybe Nicolle will spend some time in London and elsewhere studying Standard Chartered's problems, which would surely blur anyone's memory of old forbidden secrets.</p>

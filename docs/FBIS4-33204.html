			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  said this morning that the fact that some governors can be  reelected while others, such as Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo  Duhalde, cannot is "a totally repugnant inequality."    Menem said it is "a tremendous injustice" to prevent the  reelection of some governors when most provinces already have a  clause allowing the governor's reelection, and the  constitutional reform will grant the president that opportunity  as well.    Menem said that Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde "will  not create any problems" at the Constituent Assembly, because  "what he wants is the reform of the national Constitution, and  then through the proper channels, the reform of the provincial  Constitution."    Menem said the convention "is not deadlocked," as delegates  "are looking for consensus." Menem did not rule out the  possibility of proposing a clause permitting the reelection of  governors at the Constituent Assembly.    Menem said, however, that it was not clear how convention  delegates would include that clause in the agenda. Menem said  the reform of provincial constitutions must be carried out in  each district.    The decision to include the issue "will be determined by  convention delegates. I think there are various alternatives.  I am not siding with any one of them. I think provincial  constitutions must be reformed according to proceedings  established in each one of the provincial constitutions," the  president said.    Menem made these remarks at government house after  inspecting  the work under way to remodel the building. Menem said he will  meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Boston between 22 and  24 June within the framework of his unofficial visit to that  country and following his tour of Canada.    After the announcement, NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS learned that the  head of state will take advantage of the opportunity to watch  the soccer match between the Argentine and Nigerian national  teams on 25 June.    The president talked extensively on the radio program La  9.90. He reiterated that "professional agitators who have  already been acting in other places have arrived" in Tierra del  Fuego. He added that "hooded individuals are frustrating  people's right to work."    He said those groups are responsible for "impairing and  frustrating the freedom to work," stressing that these methods  "will not lead us anywhere," and urging striking workers "to  return to work."    The president denied that the government is being pressured  by entrepreneurs, and recommended all parties involved in the  conflict to sit down and talk "to reach an agreement and  resolve" the situation.    On another subject, the president said that he supports the  initiative of some legislators to invest $1.5 billion in the  construction of houses in northern provinces within 90 days.    "A total of $1.5 billion will be invested in housing  construction within 90 days," the president said.    Menem also said that the government will urge the provinces  to speed up the reform of their administrations to reduce the  deficit.    "Provincial governments have not fulfilled the agreements  with the national government. The reform of provincial  administrations has not yet been implemented," the president  said.    [Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish at 1224 GMT on  2  April adds: "President Carlos Menem said that the Justicialist  Party `will fully respect' the Olivos Pact at the Constituent  Assembly, and therefore the clause establishing the presidential  election `is assured.'    ["Menem confirmed that he will meet with his U.S.  counterpart  Bill Clinton during a stopover in Boston upon his return from  Canada in the second half of the month."    [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS also adds, at 1319 GMT on 2 April:  "President Carlos Menem said today that there is an attempt to  create `a class struggle' in Tierra del Fuego, adding that the  situation `is typical of Marxists.'    ["During the La 9.90 program Menem criticized Marcelo Sosa,  UOM [Metalworkers Union] Ushuaia branch secretary general,  because through his calls he `is trying to return to the past  and provoke a situation we have long overcome.'"]</p>

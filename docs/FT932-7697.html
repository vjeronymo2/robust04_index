			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI climbs Ahead of its demerger, ICI rose 11 to 1260p as the group announced that the sale of its European polypropylene arm to BASF, of Germany, would not be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm remained with the chemicals side. The initial gulf between ICI 'new' and the bioscience arm Zeneca, which have been traded in the officially sanctioned 'grey' market, was closed up yesterday. ICI 'new' rose 121 to 630p, while Zeneca ex-rights closed at the same level and Zeneca nil-paid lost a penny to 39p. Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries recovered some of its recent fall, ending 12 up at 834 1/2 p. Results from Storehouse came in at the top end of expectations, although recent reports from the retail trade had indicated the rising strength in high street sales and the shares reacted mildly. They closed 2 adrift at 199p. The retirement of Sir Bernard Ashley from the board of Laura Ashley coincided with the sale of a large chunk of his stake in the clothing group. Close on 30m shares were placed by Kleinwort Benson and Robert Fleming at 108p with institutions, according to dealers. The stock closed a penny off at 112p. Bearish comment and marketmakers' short positions combined to send Kingfisher down 15 to 592p. James Capel was said to be negative over the French retailer Darty. Brent Chemicals fell 30 to 99p after announcing sales and margins for the first four months of the year that were well below expectations. The group added that its first half profits would be significantly below last year's figure. The details highlighted the dire performance of the chemicals industry in mainland Europe and companies with exposure to the area also saw their share price totter. Burmah closed 3 lower at 706p after being up in early trading. Regional electricity shares made strong progress as investors focused on the prospect of 10 per cent-plus rises in dividends during the preliminary reporting season. Double-figure rises were common throughout the sector, with Northern Electricity the best performer and finally 13 higher at 501p, closely followed by Southern, the only FT-SE 100 stock in the sector, which closed 10 1/2 up at 459 1/2 p. Eastern was a similar amount better at 462 1/2 p and South West gained 10 at 482p. Scottish Power moved forward 5 to 315p on good turnover of 4.1m after the company delivered a 10 per cent increase in the dividend along with satisfactory preliminary figures. British Gas closed 1 1/2 higher at 294p after first-quarter figures towards the top end of the range of forecasts. Bears continued to point to the outcome of the MMC inquiry, while bulls said the market had possibly overlooked the profit potential of an aggressive cost exercise at the company. Media stocks performed well yesterday, with suggestions that US domestic funds had been buying selectively. That interest, often in tight markets, was helped by some specific factors. Watmoughs, the design to packaging group, rose 5 to 665p after saying it was renewing a magazine production contract. Ferguson International, which supplies products and services to the retail and communications industries, added 18 at 323p on encouraging results. Dorling Kindersley, the publisher, recovered from recent profit-taking, bouncing 7 to 267p, and Haynes Publishing was lifted 15 to 323p. Among the larger groups, United Newspapers rose 7 to 595p and Reuters 12 to 1276p. Celestion, the clothing and hi-fi group which was transmuted into Magellan at its agm on Monday, put on 13 at 166p. The company was featured at a smaller companies exhibition hosted yesterday by its joint broker Hoare Govett. Cookson Group moved 3 1/2 ahead to 199 1/2 p after NatWest Securities urged investors to switch out of ECC following a forecast cut on Wednesday. Mr Geoff Allum at the house said: 'Earnings at Cookson are likely to continue growing over the next two years, whereas earnings at China Clays remain under pressure.' Bargain hunters helped ECC claw back some of Wednesday's losses and the shares ended 5 up at 438p. Hopes of disposals at Cannon Street Investments boosted the shares and they finished 2 better at 26p. A favourable annual meeting and reports of a recommendation from Kleinwort Benson boosted BTR by 5 to 590p. Some 4.4m shares had been dealt by the close of trading. The placing of Pounds 39m of convertible prefence shares in John Laing by BZW went without a hitch, according to dealers. Laing 'A' closed marginally higher at 266p. Redland shares eased 2 to 492p in spite of plenty of good news on increases in UK housebuilding and a 7 per cent jump in housing permits in Germany, announced at the company's annual meeting. A stock overhang depressed Siebe. The shares eased 6 to 461p, with Kleinwort Benson and SG Warburg said to have been among the day's main sellers. James Wilkes hardened a penny to 82p on the news that Suter, unchanged at 144p, had raised its stake in the engineering group to 15.3 per cent. Further profit-taking in Rolls-Royce saw the shares slip 2 1/2 to 145p on turnover of 3.1m.</p>

Statistics show that by the end of last year, Hainan  Province  had approved 902 Taiwan-invested projects worth $961 million in  total contractual amount, $769 million of which was financed by  Taiwan capital. Of the 902 Taiwan-invested projects, 397 were  registered last year, accounting for $482 million in total  contractual investment, respectively up 21 percent and 32  percent from a year earlier. Taiwan capital currently accounts  for 10.2 of Hainan's total foreign investment, second only to  Hong Kong.    According to concerned departments, Taiwan investment in  Hainan displays the following characteristics:    --Gradual increases in investment every year and an  increasingly faster rate of development. Statistics at the end  of 1988 show that province-wide there were only 11 approved  Taiwan-capital enterprises, with $5.94 million in total  contractual investment. The number was increased annually and by  1992, the growth rate was such that there were 267 and 418  percent increases respectively in Taiwan-capital enterprises and  total contractual investment from the previous year.    --A rising proportion for firms exclusively funded by Taiwan  capital. There are 706 such firms in Hainan's 902  Taiwan-invested firms, 3.6 times the number of joint-venture and  cooperation enterprises.    --Taiwan businessmen invest more in industrial projects and  maintain a rational industrial structure. Of these, tourist and  property investment ranks first, accounting for about half of  Taiwan investment, while industrial and agricultural projects  account for 32 and 10 percent respectively. Together they  account for over 90 percent.    Officials at the Hainan Provincial Taiwan Affairs Office  said  the province will increase its efforts to attract Taiwan capital  and investment, work vigorously to get Taiwan businesses to  launch a few large-scale projects in the agricultural, tourist,  high-tech, and mining sectors, encourage one or two  Taiwan-capital banks or non-financial [fei jin rong 7236 6855  5816] institutions to set up their base in Hainan, and call a  "Seminar on Hainan-Taiwan Economic and Financial Development"  this March.</p>

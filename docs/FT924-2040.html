			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Fisons sells UK consumer healthcare unit for Pounds 90m FISONS, the pharmaceuticals and scientific group, yesterday continued its restructuring with the sale of its UK consumer healthcare business to Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland for Pounds 90m. Fisons shares rose 2p to 212p. Fisons' consumer healthcare business, which included over the counter (OTC) products such as Sanatogen vitamins and Radian analgesic, had a turnover of Pounds 26.6m last year and generated operating profits of Pounds 5m before the allocation of central costs. Roche acquires the brands and existing stock. Fisons retains Pounds 6m owed to the business by debtors. The UK group will also continue to manufacture Sanatogen for nine months and Paracodol, an analgesic, for 18 months until Roche can start production. About 160 employees at Fisons' Loughborough Sanatogen site will then be made redundant. The proceeds from the disposal will be used to cut Fisons' borrowings. Roche's acquisition will almost double its UK OTC turnover which last year was Pounds 30m. The purchase is part of the Swiss group's strategy to expand its presence in OTC medicines. Last year Roche acquired Nicholas, the European OTC business of the US group Sara Lee, for Dollars 790m (Pounds 505m). Roche's worldwide OTC business should generate sales of SFr1bn (Pounds 454m) this year. Fisons's move follows the sale last month of its US and Canadian consumer health businesses for Dollars 140m to Ciba-Geigy Corporation, the US subsidiary of the Swiss chemicals group. The UK group still has to sell its Australian, South African and French consumer health operations. However, Mr Roy Thomas, finance director, said the group was considering a number of bids. Fisons is also looking to sell its horticultural business which has a turnover of about Pounds 85m. Mr Thomas said Fisons was talking to other groups about collaborating in fields such as manufacturing, marketing and drug development. The group is talking to one US company which might manufacture Imferon, Fisons' blood product. Imferon was withdrawn from the US in 1990 following quality control concerns. Fisons is still waiting to hear from the US Food and Drug Administration if its inspectors want to revisit the manufacturing facilities for Opticrom, an allergic eye treatment that has also been withdrawn in the US.

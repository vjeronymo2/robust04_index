			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Graham sets float price at 183p Graham Group, the builders' merchant, yesterday ann-ounced a price of 183p per share for its March flotation - earning Pounds 209.8m before expenses for BTR, the industrial conglomerate which has been seeking to reduce debt by disposals. About 65 per cent of the 114.6m shares are to be placed with institutions. The prospectus, issued yesterday, shows a notional annual net dividend of 4.6p, for a yield of 3.1 per cent at the offer price. Earnings, adjusted for management charges incurred under BTR, amounted to 9.1p in 1993. The prospectus also showed a cash outflow of Pounds 17.9m for the year to end-December 1993, against an inflow of Pounds 15.5m, from operating activities before capital expenditure of Pounds 34.3m (Pounds 3m). Mr Bob Elsmore, finance director, said the turnround was due to increased stocks to meet greater demand, non-recurring items arising from the demerger and early repayment of creditors. Mr Ian Mills, managing director, stressed the opportunities for Graham in a recovering market, with its 148 national branches and exposure to both the heavier side of merchanting, such as timber and bricks, as well as the lighter plumbing, kitchens and bathrooms businesses. Graham's independent status would also allow it to focus on improving margins through a better mix of product and investing in refurbishment. About Pounds 36m was budgeted for investment until 1996, which Mr Mills said should be funded by 'our own resour-ces'. Graham is the UK's fourth largest builders' merchant. The group, which compares itself to Travis Perkins and Wolseley as both have heavy and light businesses, is coming to the market on a historic multiple of 17.4. After adjusting for BTR's charges, the p/e rises to 20.1. Analysts are forecasting operating profits for 1994 of about Pounds 19m, against Pounds 15.3m last year, and earnings of about 9.9p, leaving a prospective p/e of about 18.5. COMMENT Graham is likely to be popular with investors, mostly because of its exposure to the recovering housing market. While it may not be offering an overly generous yield, investors are likely to focus on the recovery potential to 1996. It would appear that much can be done quickly to improve performance, which has been hindered by a lack of investment under its former parent. The shares are expected to trade on a premium to the offer price while the new approach is being rolled out.</p>

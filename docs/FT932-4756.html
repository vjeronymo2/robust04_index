			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine denies wrongdoing over Nadir MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday insisted that he had done nothing wrong in raising the handling of the case of Mr Asil Nadir, the bankrupt former chairman of Polly Peck, with Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general. His statement explaining how he had come to approach Sir Nicholas failed, however, to prevent Labour stepping up its attack on the involvement of ministers with the case of Mr Nadir, who jumped bail last month and fled to northern Cyprus. Opposition backbenchers demanded a Commons statement on the the actions of Mr Michael Mates, a middle-ranking minister, who separately raised the matter with Sir Nicholas, and gave Mr Nadir a 'light-hearted' gift of a watch. Downing Street said that in raising the matter as a constituency MP, Mr Mates had acted 'in line with the guidance issued to ministers'. His resignation had been neither offered nor sought. Mr Heseltine said that after a lunch early this year with a personal friend, Mr Christopher Morgan, one of Mr Nadir's public relations advisers, he had mentioned his conversation to Sir Nicholas. Sir Nicholas had advised him that any concerns should be put in writing so that they could be properly considered. Mr Heseltine had passed this message back to Mr Morgan, and had heard nothing more.

Mr Morgan said he had had an 'informal and confidential' meeting with Mr Heseltine to express Mr Nadir's concerns at how his case was being pursued by the Serious Fraud Office and the belief that he was being denied the opportunity to prepare his defence properly. Some Tory backbenchers remained uneasy about Mr Mates' judgment, and the issue could be brought up at this Thursday's meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs. But, unless further embarrasing revelations emerge, he is expected to survive. Labour intends to use the case to build up pressure on Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, who is due to appear next week at a cross-party committee investigation into the funding of political parties. Mr Mark Rogerson, Mr Morgan's partner and the constituent of Mr Mates, who alerted him to Mr Nadir's position, said his public relations firm had not yet been paid by Mr Nadir. He said he was aware that Mr Nadir was bankrupt. 'We worked for him on the basis that, when he had the ability to pay, he would.'</p>

Kuts: "Will There Be a New Nuclear Power </F> Plant?"]    [Text] The agreement between Belarus and Russia on an  integrated ruble zone may be signed as soon as this month. This  is what Belarusian Prime Minister V. Kebich stated in  Baranovichi at his meeting with representatives of local  authorities from Brest and Minsk Oblasts.    According to the prime minister, Belarus and Russia have  also  reached an agreement on gas prices. Fuel delivered to Belarus  as of 1 January 1994 has become almost 40 percent cheaper. This  has enabled Belarus to repay a large part of its gas debt to  Russia.    At the same time, V. Kebich admitted that Belarus would have  to remember nuclear energy, because it had no other alternative  in the visible future. Currently, work on the selection of a  site for a future nuclear power plant is under way, in line with  international norms.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Goran Ek: "South Coast To Become Important Trade </F> Area"]    [Text] The coastal belt along the eastern Gulf of Finland  will, according to a just-released development program, be  developed into a strong economic center, which at the same time  will be a hub for traffic especially with the St. Petersburg  area.    The development plan covers some 10 subprojects concerning  traffic, environment, and trade with areas to the east.  Sponsoring the program and the coastal project regarding the  Gulf of Finland are such private groups as the regional  associations of the Kymi River Valley, eastern Uusimaa, and  Uusimaa, as well as the individual municipalities along the  coast.    Among other things, it is proposed that Europe Highway Route  18 [E18] be improved, and that the train between Helsinki and  St. Petersburg be able to transit the stretch in two and a half  hours. The sponsoring groups also want to improve know-how on  trade with Russia and Russian business culture, as well as to  increase teaching of the Russian language at all levels of  education.    "The coastal project has been under way for two years, and  the purpose has been to introduce cooperation in order to  develop business, improve the environment, and promote regional  culture in the area." This was said by Tapio Valinoro, director  of a landscape company and chairman of the Kymi River Valley  Development Association.    A basket with 60 concrete development projects are included  in the development project for the Gulf of Finland. From these  60, the involved parties -- the state, municipalities,  businesses, and private associations -- can select which  individual projects concern them, and can in conjunction with  others move them forward. Those elements considered of overall  strategic importance are: improvement of land communications --  E18 and the rail route; developing environmental technology;  improvement of knowledge regarding Russia; betterment of safety;  and establishing planning cooperation over the border.  <H5>  Transit Traffic for 6-7 Billion Markkas </H5>   The better the communications to St. Petersburg, the more  attractive will be the coastal region to those businesses  wanting to establish themselves in the Russian market, reason  the drafters.    The coastal zone in southeast Finland is the most rapid and  secure transportation route from the United States (via  Rotterdam and Amsterdam) and West Europe to Russia and the other  countries of the former Soviet Union.    "This now involves a market of perhaps 2 billion markkas per  year, but if the entire transportation chain is taken into  account, this is estimated to be at least from 6-7 billion  markkas," says Valinoro.    E18 should be [re]built as a four-lane highway or  expressway.  The most difficult bottlenecks are found on the Russian side of  the border and in Vyborg. The railroads are going to be even  more a key factor in the Russian transportation system, and rail  will therefore be the only realistic alternative when large  volumes of cargo are to be transported for long distances.  <H5>  Time Works in Favor of Helibannan [new Helsinki-St. </H5> Petersburg Rail Route]    "Considering all this, it is clear that time is working in  favor of a future Helibannan," Valinoro claims.    The present rail route to Russia should be improved so that  the Pendolino train can transit the Helsinki-St. Petersburg  stretch in four and a half hours.    With this is would be possible to make one-day round trips  between the two cities, either for purposes of business or  shopping. In the long term a new, more direct rail line to the  east is going to prove necessary, and then the travel time can  be reduced -- in the best case -- to two and a half hours.    Development of environmental technology relates to the key  industrial areas along the Gulf of Finland's coastal belt.    The adjacent areas within the CIS and the Baltic countries  are to constitute the most important markets for Finnish  environment companies. An action program must now be drafted  which will make it possible for Finnish companies to participate  in environment projects requiring international financing  arrangements in the former Soviet area. Such a program should  cover needs in Russia and, at the same time, involve  international financing and Finnish know-how.    In comparison with many other areas, especially Tallinn and  Riga, which are in competition for the role of entry ports to  Russia and the East, the Finnish areas along the Gulf of Finland  have an important weak point: our knowledge of the Russian  language, and our familiarity with Russian mores and practices  and the Russian culture are poor.  <H5>  Head Start of Five to 10 Years </H5>   At the same time, we have a time jump of perhaps 10-15 years  in comparison to Finland.    This should be exploited as soon as possible, according to  Valinoro.    "The opportunities for studying Russian should be expanded  at  all educational levels. To awaken a greater interest in Russian  new teaching materials should be developed which reflect the  new, dynamic economy and culture now going on, instead of the  bygone Soviet era and its linguistic usages.    ``It is also important to activate cooperation in education  and research, and to create new programs for practicum  exchanges, as well as exchange programs in culture and sports.''    The border between Finland and Russia is perhaps the world's  deepest living-standards gap. This creates tension and strong  undercurrents. To master them is a difficult job which will  likewise yield profit if handled well. The situation in Russia  is instable and its future prospects partly concealed in  darkness. This creates insecurity and risks, but also  opportunities for progress for capable business people. A  careful but, at the same time, flexible border regime is under  these circumstances a necessary precondition for crossborder  economic cooperation, as well as cooperation in general, to run  safely and smoothly.</p>

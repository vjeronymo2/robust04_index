			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Securities regulators close to capital rules BANKING and securities regulators meet in Switzerland this week to agree the first international capital adequacy rules for the securities business. Protracted discussions over the past three years have brought regulators close to an agreement designed to protect financial markets from the collapse of securities companies. However, investment banks in London continue to warn that the rules could undermine the City's competitive position. The framework is due to be agreed at a meeting in Geneva on Wednesday between representatives of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) and the Bank for International Settlements, which act as the international co-ordinating bodies for securities and bank regulators. It will apply both to banks and non-bank securities companies. The difference in nature between the risks in the banking and securities businesses has led to disagreements between the two groups over the best approach to the problem. They are now close to agreement in principle. The most important, to be agreed this week, are: How much capital should securities businesses have to back their exposures to financial markets? Regulators are close to agreeing an 8 per cent capital requirement for the net exposure of a securities company (that is, after taking account of off-setting positions and other 'hedges'). In addition, securities firms will have to have capital equal to either 2 or 4 per cent of their gross positions. The exact ratio is expected to be agreed this week. How much subordinated debt should companies be able to count as capital for regulatory purposes? Such debt is generally cheaper than equity capital. Securities firms in London are allowed a ratio of subordinated debt to equity of 4:1. Regulators this week are expected to agree an international standard of 2:1 or 2.5:1 - though some banking regulators are pressing for 1:1. In addition, there remain differences of opinion over what constitutes effective 'hedging' and whether companies should have an additional 'cushion' of capital over and above other requirements to provide an extra safeguard. If a tough stance is taken on these issues, London securities firms stand to suffer more than those elsewhere. Other centres claim London's current capital rules allow firms in the City an unfair advantage and expose the London markets to greater risk. However, London regulators have always argued that their system is more sophisticated than those elsewhere and allows capital to be used more efficiently while providing adequate protection. If agreement is reached in Geneva this week, the need to refine the rule and allow a lengthy transition period means that they are unlikely to come into force for several years. They are likely to be preceded by a parallel set of rules for the European Community being developed in Brussels.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Driving off car thieves Car theft has become a European epidemic, writes Andrew Fisher. In Germany, one is stolen every four minutes. The theft of items from vehicles - particularly telephones and CD players - is also a curse of modern driving. Now, VDO Kienzle has produced a device to ward off both types of thief. Its VDO Combi Alarm 2000 security system incorporates contact-controlled monitoring of all doors and also monitors the interior with switchable ultrasonic sensors. The system, which immobilises the car's fuel pump and ignition, is switched on and off by radio remote control. Its alarm can also be integrated with a central locking system. The Frankfurt company says the device activates itself automatically 10 minutes after the ignition is switched off or, via a door contact, 30 seconds after the driver leaves the vehicle. It costs DM920 (Pounds 380). VDO Kienzle: Germany, 6196 872922. Fax 6196 873444</p>

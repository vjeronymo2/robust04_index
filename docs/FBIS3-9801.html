			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 29 (CTK) -- The sad situation in  Slovak schools has been partly caused by the lack of change in  the method of financing and administrating schools, Egyutteles  [Coexistence] Deputy Miklos Feher said at a press conference  today. The state was not interested in schools being  administrated by the community, especially those in areas with a  large Hungarian minority, he said.    Executive Secretary of Egyutteles Alzbeta Dolnikova added  that minorities were not sufficiently represented in school  management.    Egyutteles Deputy Edita Bauerova pointed to the words of an  unnamed Education Ministry representative who said, in the last  electoral term, that "the decentralization of basic education in  Slovakia had not yet been carried out because a large Hungarian  minority lives there."    One solution, Bauerova said, was a proposal which the  government had already looked at -- that the revenues which the  Education Ministry created itself would not then have to be put  into the state budget. Another possibility was to amend the tax  law to allow physical persons to claim tax exemption for the  cost of educating their children.    Bauerova also expressed dissatisfaction at parliament not  having granted the CTV company a license for television  broadcasting. She said she supported CTV because the company  intended to develop regional broadcasting. The competition  would help ensure that Slovaks were better informed, especially  given that public corporation television was having financial  problems.    Egyutteles representatives said they were waiting for the  law  on the media to be put forward, and intended to initiate a  change in the positions of the Slovak Council for Radio and  Television Broadcasting, the Slovak Television Council, and the  Slovak Radio Council.    At its 27th session, parliament failed to approve the  granting of a license to the CTV company for television  broadcasting in the second circuit of Slovak Television.  However, parliament charged the Radio and Television  Broadcasting Council with putting forward a proposal for a new  candidate for the license by the end of April.</p>

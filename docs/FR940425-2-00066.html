These schools represent the primary educational system that trains personnel to operate the Nation's public health agencies, and to administer disease prevention and health promotion programs.

ASPH has provided the critical framework for the schools of public health and the practitioners of public health in Federal, State and local governments to cooperate and share their experience and expertise, and to enable the theoretical and practical perspectives of public health to be blended into comprehensive curricula for teaching health administration, health promotion, health protection, preventive health service delivery, and health research methods to future public health workers. These interchanges have assured consistent approaches to the preparation of public health workers and their performance in controlling today's major health problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

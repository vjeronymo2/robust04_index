			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is  currently meeting with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. This meeting  cut off the meeting between Prime Minister Rabin and 'Arafat.  The forum of the Rabin-'Arafat meeting was expanded to include  Ministers Peres and Sarid and Major General Amnon Shahaq, head  of the Israeli peace delegation, on the Israeli side, and Nabil  Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation, on the PLO side.  Uri Savir, director general of the Foreign Ministry, and Yo'el  Singer, the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, later joined the  talks as well.    While the meeting between Christopher and 'Arafat is going  on, the meeting Ministers Peres, Sarid, and the Israeli  delegation members are holding with the Palestinian  representatives, headed by Nabil Sha'th, is continuing. Our  correspondent Arye Gus notes that the inclusion of Savir and  Singer indicates that the sides have reached the formulation  stage.</p>

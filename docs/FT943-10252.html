			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Freedom for Mavrodi sought Angry shareholders yesterday demanded that the government release Mr Sergei Mavrodi, president of MMM, the investment fund embroiled in post-communist Russia's biggest financial scandal. Mr Mavrodi was arrested late on Thursday and his home was searched in a dramatic raid by armed tax police. But yesterday morning some 3,000 investors rallied to the businessman's defence bearing banners reading 'Hands off Mavrodi' in a demonstration outside MMM's headquarters in central Moscow. The value of shares in the pyramid scheme has tumbled from Rbs115,000 to Rbs2,500 over the past two weeks. MMM officials said the fund would remain closed until the release of Mr Mavrodi, who could face up to five years in jail for tax evasion. Tax officials said he and his entourage succeeded in destroying documents while police mounted their elaborate break-in.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 11 (AFP)--Chinese Premier Li  Peng's slip of the tongue that China, rather than Britain, was  to blame for the breakdown in Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's  political future hit the local newspapers here Friday.    "Is it an innermost thought?" the independent  Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao asked in a headline over a  story reporting the gaffe made by the Chinese premier as he read  his lengthy government work report.    Li corrected himself immediately, saying it was the British  side that was to blame for the breakdown of the 17th round of  Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's democratization process. The  British colony reverts to China's rule in 1997.    Another Chinese-language newspaper, the Hong Kong Daily  News,  described Li's slip as "extremely intriguing," while the  Taiwan-run United Daily News noted that Li did not apologize for  his slip up.    However, his mistake elicited the briefest of smiles from  the  British ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, who attended the  opening of the National People's Congress in Beijing Thursday.    McLaren, who headed the British team in the now broken-off  negotiations with Beijing over Governor Chris Patten's electoral  reforms, said later it was "a Freudian slip." Meanwhile, a Hong  Kong government spokesman declined to comment, saying "it is  inappropriate." The major Beijing-run newspapers Wen Wei Po and  Ta Kung failed to report on Li's gaffe.    The talks collapsed in acrimony in November, and the Patten-  backed reform package was introduced on Wednesday in the  colony's Legislative Council. China threatened to sack the  legislature, apparently resigned to the fact that there would be  no cooperation with Britain on the transition to 1997.</p>

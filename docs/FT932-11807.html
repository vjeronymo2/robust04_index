			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (9): Shake-up in 'perk' sector - Company Cars / The UK NOT since the 'perk' car first appeared in numbers as a way of getting round pay restrictions in the early 1970s has the company car sector faced such a shake-up as that which will arrive on April 6 next year. On that day, out will go the long-standing system of personal taxation of the company car benefit based on three engine-size bands and two price 'thresholds'. In its place will come a much simpler system, in which tax will be payable on a fixed percentage of the manufacturer's listed retail price of the car - its 'list' price - plus any extras. The percentage is fixed at 35 for drivers covering fewer than 2,500 business miles a year (the classic 'perk' car), with a 'discount' of one third, to 23.3 per cent, for drivers covering 2,500-18,000 business miles and of two-thirds, or 11.7 per cent, for drivers covering more than 18,000 business miles. These mileage bands, at which more favourable tax treatment is given, are about the only 'leftovers' from the current system. Employees entitled to two company cars will find that both will be assessed for tax on exactly the same basis, so that the second car - where no business mileage is likely - will be taxed at the highest rate. As with the current system, there will be no reduction in the scale charge payable on a car until it is more than four years old, when the charge drops by one third. In the broadest terms the new system will mean a higher tax bill for about 700,000 of the Inland Revenue's estimated 2m company car drivers, but unchanged or reduced bills for the majority. In some cases, particularly that of executives with cars priced at just under the Pounds 19,250 or Pounds 29,000 thresholds of the current banded scale charge system, individuals face tax rises of up to 60 per cent. Because there is no 'cap' on the system, drivers of very expensive cars face tax bills of potentially daunting proportions. Anyone who is running one of Jaguar's Pounds 415,000 XJ220 sports coupes on the company, for example, and covering fewer than 2,500 business miles with it, will next year face a tax scale charge of Pounds 145,000 or an actual cash payment of Pounds 58,100 at the higher marginal rate of personal income tax. Under this year's scale charge structure, that same XJ220 driver has a scale charge of Pounds 15,060 and an actual payment of Pounds 6,024. At a slightly less exalted level, the new taxation structure has sent a tremor of dismay through companies such as Rolls-Royce Motors and Aston Martin, each with cars in the Pounds 100,000-plus sector. Rolls-Royce Motors, still struggling to emerge from heavy losses, has already asked the government to relent and set a ceiling on car prices above which the tax charge will not rise any further. So far, the appeal seems to have fallen on deaf ears. But it is not only new luxury cars which will fall foul of the fresh system. Many executives have chosen to run classic cars, from James Bond-style Aston Martins to exotic 1960s Ferraris, as low-mileage company cars providing something 'different'. They could do so because they were taxed on the basis of original market value, rendered insignificant by inflation. The new system will base tax levels on current market value, the precise fixing of which has yet to be spelt out. Even though the bottom has already fallen out of the classic car market because of recession, the new system inevitably will damage the sector's hopes of recovery next year. Despite this, the new system is not intended by the Treasury to produce any increase in real terms in the total tax take - now approaching Pounds 1.5bn  -from the company car benefit. That has already been taken care of by further stiff increases in tax scale charges applicable during the current tax year, and announced in last month's budget by Mr Norman Lamont, Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr Lamont now regards the company car overall to be fairly taxed relative to private motorists as a result of this year's 8 per cent increase in the tax scale charge on the car benefit itself, 20 per cent on the tax charge on free fuel for private use and the ending of the 50 per cent reduction in the fuel scale charge for high business mileage drivers. If there are big losers under the new system, there will be a substantially larger number of 'winners', particularly among the drivers of lower value cars which are in genuinely essential business or working use. Tax bills for these could fall by as much as one third. The driver of a 2-litre Rover 800 with a price just under Pounds 19,000 currently pays tax on a scale charge of Pounds 4,485 if he or she covers less than Pounds 5,000 business miles, as the car is assessed solely by it being in the 1.4litre-2litre engine capacity band. Under the new system, however, it will attract a scale charge of about Pounds 6,700, based on 35 per cent of 'list' price. In order to avoid paying extra tax, and all other things being equal, the driver would have to switch to a car with a list price of about Pounds 12,800. Not only should the new system mark the end of production of the 'tax break specials' and other market distortions already much criticised by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission - it has the benefit, from the manufacturers' point of view in particular, of being self-adjusting. Instead of the new car market holding its breath each year waiting to see by how much the Budget would increase scale charges, no action should be needed. The amount of tax payable will be determined by the rate of increase in new car prices. So the new system will contain inbuilt incentives for both companies and employees to choose smaller and more fuel-efficient cars - seen as desirable on environmental grounds - and act as a brake on manufacturer price increases. Once certain effect of the latest scale charge increases and the new system is to make many more companies and their drivers examine whether the time has come for the car keys to be handed over in favour of a cash alternative. There are no straightforward rules to follow in determining whether the company or employee will benefit from such a switch to cash. Whether it will be worthwhile depends on each individual's circumstances and will need precise calculation. Nevertheless analysts such as Mr Stewart Whyte, a director of consultancy Fleet Audits, and Mr Brian Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit Consulting, predict that it will become much more widespread, particularly for 'perk' users who would then be able to take advantage of current high depreciation rates by buying 'nearly new'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- One of the main achievements of  the first six months of 1994 was "demilitarization" of the  Russian economy, First Deputy Economics Minister Yakov Urinson  said today in his speech at the sitting of the conciliation  commission in charge of implementation of the national accord  treaty.    According to Urinson, military orders have declined by 70  percent and this explains the 25 percent decline in production  in the past six months.    At the same time the minister noted the tendency toward  lower  inflation, from 10 percent in February to an estimated 7 percent  in June. In the same period the number of people living below  the poverty line decreased by 10 million and the population's  income in real terms increased by 12 percent.    The number of registered unemployed increased by 900,000 to  the present total of 1.2 million. The actual number of  unemployed is around 4 million or 6 percent of the working  population.    One of the government's priorities will be to channel the  funds saved by closing down unprofitable enterprises into areas  of potential growth, so as to meet its commitments stated in the  national accord treaty, The second priority is "social support  for those in need."</p>

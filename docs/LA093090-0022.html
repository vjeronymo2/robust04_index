			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEYOND 9-TO-5 IN L.A.;  </P> <P> HEY, FORGET THE MYTH THAT THIS CITY IS LAID BACK. WHEN IT COMES TO HARD WORK,  THERE ARE PLENTY OF STORIES TO BE TOLD. . .  </P> <P> Working hard? Putting in longer hours at the grindstone? Feeling stressed and  out of sync in the city where people are said not to exert themselves except  when they're playing Frisbee?  </P> <P> Well, you're not alone. That 50- to 60-hour work week is something many  Angelenos call normal -- because of economic necessity or career choice.  Indeed, in the real L.A., most people do work hard, although some Angelenos  speculate that they may work at a different -- more relaxed -- pace than their  fellow citizens across the country, especially those on the East Coast.  </P> <P> Two transplanted Easterners, public relations executive Tom Reed and urban  planner Bessie Kong, find some truth to the "laid-back Los Angeles" myth. Reed  observes that "New York is busier," the pace more frenetic. He believes that  hyper state means people are working harder, but is willing to concede that  some of the hustle may be more style than substance, and adds: "Maybe there are  just not as many Type A people out here." Kong thinks more people here work for  themselves and can set their own pace.  </P> <P> Statistics tend to support part of Kong's observation: It seems that more  people are self-employed here than in other parts of the country. The U.S.  Census Bureau reported in 1988 that the number of businesses in California  increased by more than one-third from 1982 to 1987, compared with a 28% rise  nationally. And the state's Employment Development Department reported that the  largest percentage growth in business during the 1980s was a 51% rise in small  new businesses with three or fewer employees.  </P> <P> According to Thomas Cummings, a professor of management and organization at USC  who came here from Cleveland in 1976, "The sheer cost of living out here has  got people working hard." That, he said, and the global competition that hit  the West Coast earlier and harder than some other areas of the country.  </P> <P> "You go back to some dinky place back East, and you won't find that," Cummings  said of L.A.'s economic reality. "In terms of the work ethic, probably people  are no different. But it's an entirely different world here."  </P> <P> People on the East Coast may not agree with Cummings. After all, they have been  saying bad things about Los Angeles ever since the city was invented, and it  does not take a congressionally funded investigation to know that the source of  the Lotusland myth is not on the West Coast. But many people here seem to have  bought into the myth and believe there must be something wrong with them  because they are working so hard.  </P> <P> Rather than myth, Angelenos might try reality: In 1988 pollster Louis Harris  released the results of his company's survey of the national work week, and  found it had increased from 40.6 hours in 1973 to 46.8 in 1987, and was headed  nowhere but up in the future. But that is not all the researchers found. Broken  down regionally, the hours were 45.6 a week for the East, 47.2 for the Midwest,  47.1 for the South and 47.3 for the West. We won, in other words, although it  is not clear what the prizes in this contest are.  </P> <P> What follows is a look at some Angelenos who are hard at work, who are driven  by any number of needs, who are in the contest regardless of the prizes.  </P> <P> "Public relations is a business that attracts and fully satisfies terrible  workaholics, which I am, but I don't do it quite as much as I used to," Tom  Reed said. "It's a trap. There's just no end to what you can do."  </P> <P> In public relations for the last 20 years, Reed is a senior vice president at  Braun Ketchum in the Mid-Wilshire area. He is responsible for "investor  relations," which he described as a sub-category of public relations, in which  a client is represented to the investment community.  </P> <P> Over the past few years, he said, he has cut back to about 10 hours a day from  12, "including the reading I do at home, the telephone calls at home,  everything. Before I could stay up, write a speech all night and kill myself,  get away with two hours' sleep, and be ready to go the next day. I can't do it  now. It makes me feel too beat up."  </P> <P> Although he usually rises at 5:30 a.m. to monitor the stock market, he does not  count that as "work time"; it is, rather, a "kind of hobby." He gets to the  office "not terribly early, around 8:30 or 9," he said, "and tends to stay  later. And I take work home."  </P> <P> Reed is not in public relations for the money, and he laughed at the question:  "There was a time in the beginning when money was very important. Public  relations is not a business you get rich in. There are good salaries, but it's  not like corporate law where your earnings are in direct proportion to how many  hours you work."  </P> <P> He came to Los Angeles from New York 10 years ago, expecting that his industry  would be more laid back here. But people were every bit as busy -- as they were  in many other professions.  </P> <P> Reed retained his New York work habits -- staying at work until 10 or 11 p.m.  -- until about five years ago. Now he rarely works that late. On the day he was  interviewed, for example, his 59th birthday, he said he would not be working  late at all.  </P> <P> "I kind of wish it wasn't my birthday," he said, "I've got a lot to do."  </P> <P> Hearing the pace of his own voice, and what he was saying, Tom Mosley halted  for a moment and said, "This is awful. I sound like a runaway train. But I'm  not."  </P> <P> Maybe not runaway, but a high-speed locomotive nonetheless. Mosley has been  program manager for the Hollywood-based AIDS Project Los Angeles hot line for  five years and as of this week will be heading the APLA department that  develops materials -- videos, brochures -- for minority communities.  </P> <P> He has been supervising the 135 volunteers who staff the hot line, keeping up  with the literature on AIDS, doing most of his own clerical work, giving  training and refresher courses. Being one of the few blacks on the staff adds  to his workload, he said. "They wave me around like a black flag. But it's  good, because there are so few minorities."  </P> <P> Mosley, who lives in West Hollywood, hates reading all the medical journals, he  said, but the hot line's "greatest pressure" is the need to know everything.  "Most of those calls are motivated by fear. They have to have the answer right  now. You can't relax."  </P> <P> He gets Tuesdays and Sundays off, "never two days in a row," is compulsive  about the gym, putting in two hours, six mornings a week. He works from about  11 a.m. to 8 or 9 p.m.  </P> <P> "We're all compulsive here," Mosley said of the 110 APLA staff members. "Being  around all this death and dying is not the healthiest thing you can do. In  order to survive this, you have to be compulsive."  </P> <P> He sounds just as compulsive about shutting it off: "Anything I can do to get  my mind off stuff. I live under headphones. At the gym, at home. I put them on  and shut myself in my room at home and my roommate knows not to come near me. I  play as hard as I work, and I would not go to Palm Springs and lay in the sun.  My idea of relaxation is not to lay back. I've got to be committed to something  -- a project, a part, a nightclub where I can go dance all night." As an "AIDS  guru," he said, what he cannot shut off, even at the parties, is "someone  getting in my face and asking about AIDS."  </P> <P> Mosley has learned to cry, and calls it a good release from all the stress.  However, he said he is unable to grieve or mourn. He blocks the emotion he  feels when he hears a friend has died of AIDS, and then finds himself weeping  over an AT&amp;T "Reach Out and Touch Someone" commercial.  </P> <P> He was a professional dancer in Las Vegas -- working similar hours and at the  same pace -- when a skiing accident put an end to that career. That, and the  loss of a friend to "gay cancer" in the early days of AIDS, brought him to his  present work six years ago. "There was a new urgency, a need for values . . . "  </P> <P> Having been tested three times for the HIV virus and coming up negative drives  him even more. He calls it survivors' guilt.  </P> <P> He would be turning 40 in a few days, he said, and planned "to party till I  drop."  </P> <P> For now he is where he wants to be, as a black, as a gay man, and as Tom  Mosley. "It feeds my ego. It's all about applause, not money."  </P> <P> He was just as driven as a dancer, he admits, and wonders how much of his  compulsion is related to the stress of working in a world of death and dying.  Dancing and work at APLA demand the same high energy, and are equally as  dynamic he said. "I don't know where I'd go if not this. I can't go through  life being slowed up. Air traffic control? Broadcast news? I don't know."  </P> <P> As an independent painter, Richard Urquidez is not working as hard as he used  to, when his jobs came through the Painters and Drywallers Union. He worked  about a 40-hour week with the union, "plus an extra 16 hours a week on side  jobs."  </P> <P> His hours are about the same now. He has not had a weekend off since he went on  his own six months ago. The money is about the same, but he says he is not  working as hard.  </P> <P> "It's slower paced. I can pick my jobs. I won't take a job that's going to kill  me." Often, with factory and construction work, he said, "you spray toxic  stuff. You're supposed to wear a respirator, but even if you never take it off,  it takes an hour to come down from the high. You're higher than a kite. Some  guys hallucinate. You get red eyes. If you wore the goggles you'd be taking  them off every two minutes to wipe the overspray off. You come home, and two or  three hours later, you're still spitting out these paint balls. This is not as  hard."  </P> <P> By working smaller jobs, rather than at large industrial projects, Urquidez  said, he can avoid the worst aspects of painting.  </P> <P> Urquidez talked about his work while taking a break from a house painting job  in Bel Air. He estimated he puts in a 60-hour week, "20% of it running around  giving estimates, getting supplies, matching colors." Several months out of the  year, he averages closer to 75 hours a week.  </P> <P> "I don't mind working these hours. Once you're used to it, it's nothing." He  often has to cancel weekend plans, like going to the L.A. County Fair recently,  to do a job. That's OK.  </P> <P> And when he's not working? "If I'm not sleeping, I'm doing yard work at my  mom's or watching the games."  </P> <P> Urquidez, 32, is a fifth-generation Angeleno who lives in Montebello and has  been working as a painter ever since his uncles gave him summer jobs with their  paint business during junior high. He's been at it full time since age 19 when  he left junior college.  </P> <P> Despite the care and pride he obviously puts into his work, if he had it to do  over again, he said, "Oh no way I'd be in this business. I wish I would have  been a carpenter. I wouldn't advise anyone to be a painter. But if it's your  training, it's your livelihood."  </P> <P> Compared to other parts of the country, he said of Los Angeles: "You have to  work harder out here. There's so many people. Competition is bringing the price  down. These guys who come in, put up one thick coat, sometimes they buy cheap  paint for $4 a gallon and put it in brand-name cans. To do the job the way I  want, I'd cost a little more but it takes a lot of time to prep up the house.  You don't just pay for what I do, but what I know."  </P> <P> He attributes much of the competition to immigrant businesses with newcomers  underbidding people like himself.  </P> <P> He sounds resigned to being a painter, unconcerned about the hours, but  restless with the overall scheme of things: "Compared to other jobs, people in  office jobs, executives, I can't see how the pay scale figures -- why this guy  is worth $150,000-to-$200,000 a year, when the best possible year I could have  is $50,000? I'm working just as hard."  </P> <P> Bessie Kong is an urban planner. Earlier this year she left the consulting  firm, in civil and land use planning, where she had worked for seven years and  went on her own. The future was beginning to look stagnant to her, and besides,  she and her husband wanted a family.  </P> <P> "I wanted more free time. I wanted to be in control of my hours."  </P> <P> Born in Hong Kong, she came to New York with her family when she was 4, was  educated on the East Coast and had most of her work experience in East Coast  cities. She arrived in Los Angeles with her husband in 1982 well aware of the  laid-back myth. Now she sees the myth as a matter of pace rather than hours or  amount of work.  </P> <P> "There's a great deal of difference having to work 9 to 5 or running your own  company. The stresses are less even though you work longer hours."  </P> <P> Her hours are longer than when she worked for a firm: "The day does tend to  stretch out, but you can choose your own free time. It makes it seem like more  free time."  </P> <P> Typically, Kong said, she gets to her office, on Olympic Boulevard in Los  Angeles, around 9:30 a.m. and stays until "8, 9 or 10. Sometimes I can leave at  5:30 or 6," which she terms a light day.  </P> <P> It's a 10- to 12-hour day Kong describes, but she does not wish she was working  fewer hours. She attributes her long days to L.A.'s size and traffic, which  make it more difficult to schedule appointments in the field, and to the fact  her husband puts in similar hours.  </P> <P> Being independent has its own pressures, she said, and worrying where the next  contract is coming from is one of them. Nor is it as easy to take a vacation,  she said, adding that she found herself making a lot of long-distance phone  calls when she and her husband did get away for a week this summer.  </P> <P> She has chosen not to set up an office at her home in Silver Lake, does not  take work home and tries to avoid coming in weekends by working later during  the week.  </P> <P> Now in her late 30s, she is happy with her current situation, Kong said, but  knows that if, for example, she got more involved in the community, something  would have to give. She would have to cut back. And while she knows a baby  would be an enormous change and "another large structure of time constraints,"  she is not concerned. "Being on my own still gives me flexibility. I can bring  the baby here."  </P> <P> Peggy Moore probably puts 10 or 11 hours into the average work day, but who's  counting?  </P> <P> Vice president and manager of the Los Angeles branch (the downtown or corporate  branch) of Home Savings for the last five years, she likes what she does, and  said, "The job and what I enjoy doing are a perfect match. I hope it brings out  the best in me. . . . I would imagine if one didn't like it, one would spend a  lot of time knowing what the hours were. But, I can't turn on a clock and say  this is how many hours I spend."  </P> <P> Twelve years ago, Moore started out as a part-time teller at Home Savings. Her  children were graduating from high school. She had totally immersed herself in  the world of volunteer services and was looking for something to fill in the  middle of the day. She found it.  </P> <P> The mother of three grown children and grandmother of one, all in the Southern  California area, Moore, now divorced, talked about her job at her office,  seated before a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce poster of oranges, palm trees  and the downtown skyline. She could have been an extension of the poster,  talking as she did about being part of the community.  </P> <P> She moved downtown to the Bunker Hill area three years ago from Arcadia,  explaining, "I wanted to become involved in the community in which I worked. In  doing so I became a part of L.A. My job and being in downtown Los Angeles are  one and the same."  </P> <P> There is a public relations aspect to her job, building contacts with the  business community, and Moore belongs to the downtown Rotary Club of Los  Angeles and serves on several of its committees, is on the advisory board of  the Sheriff Department's drug abuse program, SANE, and has just finished a term  as chairwoman of a corporate support group for the Girl Scouts.  </P> <P> Her days often start with a breakfast meeting. If not, she is in the office by  7:30 or 8 a.m., having avoided a commuting tantrum by walking to work. She  tends to go out for lunch, "usually business related," and averages two  business-related dinners per week, hibernating on the other nights at home and  not eating.  </P> <P> Usually Moore leaves the office around 6 p.m., but if there are memos or  speeches to write or budgets to work out, she has no problem staying until 10  p.m. or bringing work home.  </P> <P> Recently, she completed a six-month weekend-and-evening "mini-MBA" course at  USC, getting a certificate in management effectiveness, paid for by Home  Savings. Now she is taking a 14-credit class on Tuesday nights, part of Beverly  Hills High School's adult education program, in "other financial vehicles."  </P> <P> She does not consider herself a workaholic, she said, defining those people as  ones who cannot stop. She can. She plays golf one day a week, will take time  off to travel, and said, "I do not feel restricted. Maybe it's because of where  I am in my life at this point in time," a point she "would just as soon" not  specify in numbers.  </P> <P> "I'm responsible for me. I love my family, visit them, but the decisions I make  regarding time only affect me."  </P> <P> Colleen Miller is involved in a classic hard-work situation. She is director of  catering for a new restaurant, Lunaria, just down the road from Century City on  Santa Monica Boulevard.  </P> <P> Lunaria, a French bistro started by Bernard Jacoby, formerly of the Biltmore's  Bernard's, opened its doors in July. Miller came on board in February, and got  on the phone, targeting businesses, setting up appointments with meeting  planners, soliciting private parties -- "small business meetings, fund-raisers,  birthdays, special events, anywhere from 10 to 130 people."  </P> <P> She is still on the phone and knocking on doors she said, and it makes for a  busy day. She works, she said, "on an average of 10 to 16 hours a day,  depending on whether or not there's a function. I run the event, doing  everything it takes to make it run smoothly, from the initial contact to the  bill and thank-you letter. If it's an evening event, I'm still here all day."  And, she added later, she is still there afterwards, "through the cleanup  operation."  </P> <P> Those are her average hours for a six-day week, she said. The restaurant is  closed Mondays, but she works then, taking Sundays off instead.  </P> <P> Even for someone as young as 24, that's an exhausting schedule, but she is not  complaining and not surprised.  </P> <P> She has been in the business for five years, first at the Biltmore, then the  Meridian Hotel in Long Beach, both times working with Jacoby. And while those  more established situations allowed for a more normal work schedule, they also  prepared her for what was ahead.  </P> <P> "I love it. I've chosen this as a career. In the hospitality industry if you  accept a position like this and take on the responsibility, you know you're  going to do more than your hours (technically a 40-hour week), and you don't  mind."  </P> <P> Besides, she said, most of her friends in her age group are working just as  hard. Many of them are in the hotel and restaurant industry, and in general,  she said, "the 9-to-5 people that I know are getting rarer and rarer." She has  a boyfriend, an understanding one, she said, who is in sales and works similar  hours. She does not feel she is missing out.  </P> <P> That does not mean her schedule does not take its toll. Take her social life  for example.  </P> <P> "Forget over a week in advance. Everything's contingent. It's always, 'Fine, if  I don't have a banquet, I'll do it.' And, while she lives a few doors from the  beach in Venice, she sighed, she does not take an early morning run or swim.  </P> <P> "I keep saying I will, but I just value sleep so much I can never do it."  </P> <P> It is not economics that has propelled her to take on such a demanding job, she  said, but ambition, love of the type of work, and an ingrained-from-birth  belief in the work ethic.  </P> <P> "This is not an extremely high paying industry, but I was raised with the  belief that in the long run, work is worth it, the sense of self-esteem, the  personal reward is worth it, if you love your job, which I do. Here, sending  somebody off who's given a party -- they've put their trust in you -- the  reward you get when they leave happy, it's great."  </P> <P> It is not the only reward she wants.  </P> <P> "I want to get married, do the whole baby thing, have a family and not work for  while. But only people who are very fortunate get to do that. Especially in  L.A."  </P> <P> She did not even mention owning a house someday.  </P> <P> "That would probably be pushing it," she smiled. "Maybe if I work hard enough,  I'll be able to get it."  </P></p>

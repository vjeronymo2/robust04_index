Haji  Badru Wegulo, chairman of the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) of  exiled former President Milton Obote, and another official,  Patrick Rubaihayo, were freed conditionally after appearing in  court Monday, they said. They have been charged in connection  with a document released by the party setting out its  controversial manifesto for forthcoming elections to the  constituent assembly.    The polls, scheduled for March 28 have been opposed for a  number of issues. The UPC has in particular alleged that  President Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA) was  dominated by foreigners, mainly of Rwandan origin. Museveni has  strongly denied the allegations, saying they were intended to  insult him and to question his integrity.</p>

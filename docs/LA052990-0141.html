			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THIRD-PLACE CBS UNVEILS FALL LINEUP;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: NETWORK TRIES TO BEEF UP ITS EARLY EVENING PROGRAMMING. AMONG THE  NEW SHOWS ARE FOUR SITCOMS AND FIVE HOURLONG DRAMAS.  </P> <P> CBS' fall schedule features a revamped prime-time lineup with seven hours of  new programming and a first-run movie package, the network's top entertainment  executive said today.  </P> <P> "This is a strong, first step in the process of rebuilding our prime-time  lineup," said Jeff Sagansky, president of CBS Entertainment, introducing his  first full schedule since taking the job last year.  </P> <P> CBS has been in third place for three consecutive seasons but came close to  beating front-runner NBC in the just-completed May sweeps -- although it did so  with a mix of specials and movies that preempted its regular programs.  </P> <P> CBS offers four new half-hour situation comedies -- "family comedies with  breakout star potential" -- and five hourlong dramas aimed at attracting more  family viewing in the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. time period, Sagansky said.  </P> <P> Fox Broadcasting Co. was expected to announce its fall schedule late today.  </P> <P> Sagansky said CBS will have new shows in the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. slots on five  nights. The first-run package of movies that have not run on cable includes  such hits as "Born on the Fourth of July" and "Field of Dreams," he said.  </P> <P> The new sitcoms are the movie spinoff "Uncle Buck," with Kevin Meaney taking  over the role created by John Candy; the blue-collar "Lenny"; Burt Reynolds in  "Evening Shade," as a former pro football star who coaches a high school team,  and "Four Alarm Family," starring Gregory Harrison as a widowed firefighter  raising his four children. CBS also will pick up "The Hogan Family," formerly  of NBC.  </P> <P> The five hourlong series include "The Flash," adventures of the high-speed  super-hero; "WIOU," about the cutthroat world of local television; "The  Hammersmiths," a "comedic and poignant" family saga, and "Over My Dead Body," a  murder mystery with Edward Woodward and Jessica Lundy. There also will be  network television's first prime-time pro-environment series, "The Green  Machine," about a team of experts who right ecological wrongs.  </P> <P> Shows getting the ax included "Tour of Duty," "Falcon Crest," "The Amazing  Teddy Z," "City," "Sydney," and "Sugar &amp; Spice," but Sagansky said  "Paradise" may be renewed. Shows returning include Monday night comedies  "Murphy Brown," "Designing Women" and "Major Dad."  </P> <P> "Wiseguy," a crime series, has been relegated to backup status. Ken Wahl will  return in the first few episodes when the show returns to the air, but a new  actor, Stephen Bauer, will replace Wahl as a new undercover agent.  </P> <P> CBS' news shows "60 Minutes" and "48 Hours" return to the fall schedule, along  with what was "Saturday Night with Connie Chung." Her show was given a new  format and shifted to Monday night as "Face to Face with Connie Chung." The  show in that incarnation got two test-runs during the May sweeps and scored  high ratings.  </P> <P> Sagansky played down suggestions that the CBS schedule is not as unconventional  as that of its two major rivals, each of which have music-drama shows and, in  ABC's case, the return of the quirky "Twin Peaks."  </P></p>

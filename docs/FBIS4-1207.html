			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Minister of Constitutional Development </F> and of Communication R.P. Meyer on the SAPA PR Wire Service on  23 April]    [Text] The accord on Afrikaner selfdetermination which was  signed by the Freedom Front, the ANC and the government, is the  result of months of negotiations. In this process the government  took an active part with great dedication. An [words indistinct]  constitutional settlement has now been reached which offers the  constitutional opportunity to the Freedom Front for continuing  negotiations on the question of selfdetermination, even after  the elections. The government has gone out of its way to make  this settlement possible, also by amending the 1993 Constitution  to ensure a constitutional principle on selfdetermination and a  mechanism for continuing negotiations.    Therefore no logical or sensible ground for parties like the  CP [Conservative Party] to stay outside the constitutional  dispensation and not participating in the elections, still  exists.    The government does not, however, wish to create the  impression that either it or the NP [National Party] is in  favour of the creation of an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] by  their participation in this facilitation process. It remains an  unrealisable idea because Afrikaners do not form a majority of  the population in any region of the country. It is and will  continue to be the viewpoint of the government and NP that  selfdetermination could be exercised in other ways and through  other mecanisms than a volkstaat with demarcated geographical  boundaries. This viewpoint is in accordance with international  trends. Other forms of selfdetermination can be achieved within  a federal dispensation through the devolution of power to  specific communities.    [Issued] Pretoria 23 April 1994</p>

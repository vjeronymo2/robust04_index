Inorganic materials such as ceramics and carbon have far  better properties than metal materials in terms of radiation  resistance, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, abrasion  resistance, reduction of radiation, insulation, etc. However,  the use of single materials, even though their individual  properties are superb, is limited in the nuclear environment,  where many functions such as radiation resistance, strength at  high temperatures, heat resistance, corrosion resistance, etc.,  are required simultaneously. In this context, compound materials  that combine inorganic materials with high levels of heat  resistance and durability have been noted as one kind of  high-performance material.    At JAERI, research and development of high-performance  compound materials has been conducted as a key technological  issue. In this section we report on the current state of  research and development for functionally gradient materials for  the purpose of improving the oxidation resistance of carbon  materials, which feature superb strength at high temperatures  and superior neutron properties, as well as high-performance  fibers for the purpose of improving the tenacity of ceramic  materials with superb strength in high temperature and corrosion  resistance.  <H3>  1. Development of Oxidation-Resistant Carbon Materials by  Gradient Composition </H3> <H5>  (1) Objectives and Issues of Research and Development </H5>   Because of their superb properties in high-temperature and  nuclear environments, carbon materials have been used in a broad  range of fields, including nuclear engineering, for instance,  for the core structure of the HTTR being constructed by JAERI.  At the same time, their lack of acid resistance in a  high-temperature oxidation atmosphere has restricted their use.    In general, a surface coating is viewed as one way to  improve  acid resistance. However, when used for a long period of time,  or in conditions of severe thermal stress, the coated layer may  be removed from the base material by the stress concentrated on  the phase boundary. This stress, in turn, is caused by the  difference in thermal expansion factors of the coating and the  base. Therefore, we have paid attention to gradient compound  materials, which do not receive stress on specific places, and  do not allow the surface layer to be removed easily. This is  because such materials do not have a clear phase boundary  between the coated layer and the base, because the density of  the two materials varies gradually. The development of  high-performance acid-resistant carbon materials is in progress.  Such materials are expected to be applied in fields radically  outside the nuclear field as well.    In the development of high-performance acid-resistant carbon  materials, we selected silicon carbide (SiC) as the material for  the acid-resistant surface layer. This is because SiC has the  highest acid resistance and nuclear stability at  1,500-1,600C among carbides. SiC, a high-performance  acid-resistant carbon material, and a gradient compound material  (SiC/C gradient compound material) using a carbon base were  produced in the following two processes.    [1] Process-1    Based on the porous property of a carbon material, a layer  with a SiC density gradient (SiC/C) is formed from the surface  to the inside of the carbon material using the diffusion  response of gaseous SiO on the carbon material surface and the  pores.    [2] Process-2    On the surface of the material with a SiC/C layer, SiC is  coated with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.    In this report, the production method and evaluation testing  in the current stage of SiC/C gradient compound material are  discussed mainly for graphic materials.  <H5>  (2) Production of SiC/C Gradient Component Materials </H5>   i) Formation of SiC/C Layer    The reaction between SiO and carbon is used to form the  SiC/C  layer. SiO has a fusing point above 1,700C, and is  extremely easy to evaporate at high temperatures. This  characteristic is used to form the SiC/C layer. Powdered SiO  with a purity of 99.9 percent, which is commercially available,  and a cylindrical graphite base material measuring 10mm in  diameter and 20mm in length with rounded ends are used. The  electric furnace used for the SiO and carbon reaction is a  sealed type that uses siliconite as a heating element. The  locations of the two materials in the reaction furnace are  illustrated in Figure VI-1. The powdered SiO is evaporated after  being heated to 1,300C in highly purified helium, the  carrier gas, and forms SiC by the following reaction with  graphite heated to 1,380C on the surface and in the pores:    SiO (gas) + 2C (solid) = SiC (solid) + CO  (gas) [1]       The results show that SiC is distributed from the surface to  the inside of the graphite material with a gradient density. The  gasification temperature of 1,300C for SiO, and the  response temperature of 1,380C in equation [1] were  determined from the standpoint of the response speed. Due to the  formation of SiC, an increase in the dimensions of the graphite  material as a result of an increase in weight and volume was  observed.    Although the temperature condition is different, an example  of an increase in measurements of the graphite material as a  result of an increase in weight and volume is illustrated in  Figure VI-2. It also has been confirmed that the void content of  the graphite material with the SiC/C layer increases along with  the increase in weight compared to the base graphite. When the  SiC density of the base increases as a result of excessive  reaction, in other words, the increase in weight is over about  2-3 percent (differs according to type of base materials),  cracks occur near the surface. Since cracks occur easily at the  ends, the ends are carved to prevent them from forming. The  degree of reaction speed can be discovered by measuring the CO  gas density generated in the equation [1] as needed. The SiC  density of the graphite material is indicated by the increased  weight after the reaction.       The SiC thus formed has been confirmed to be beta-SiC by  X-ray diffraction.    ii) SiC Coating by CVD    A complete SiC/C gradient compound material is produced by  coating SiC by CVD on the surface of the graphite material with  the SiC/C layer. The basic temperature at the time of SiC  coating by CVD must be lower than 1,380C for the SiC/C  layer formation to maintain the correct SiC density gradient.  Coating of SiC targeted at 100 m is done externally.    Figure VI-3 is a conceptual presentation of Si distribution  in the cross-sections of a SiC/C gradient compound material, a  SiC-coated SiC/C material (SiC-SiC/C), and a SiC-coated graphite  material (base graphite simply coated with SiC: SiC-C). Although  there is a clear phase boundary as a border line between SiC and  base graphite in ordinary SiC-coated graphite materials, there  is no clear phase boundary as a border line in the SiC/C  gradient compound material, and the SiC/C layer exists as a  boundary layer between the SiC and the base graphite.     <H5>  (3) Evaluation Test </H5>   Oxidation testing and thermal cycle testing were used to  evaluate the compound material.    i) Oxidation Testing    An oxidation test for SiC-SiC/C was conducted in the  atmosphere at 800C and 1,000C. For the sake of  comparison, graphite materials with only SiC-C or SiC/C layers  (SiC/C) as well as the base graphite material were tested. The  base graphite for the four types of materials was identical.  Figure VI-4 illustrates weight reduction curves for the four  materials. Weight reduction in the SiC coated materials,  SiC-SiC/C, and SiC-C was nil in practice. SiC/C, the graphite  material with the SiC/C layer but without the SiC coated layer,  does not have the perfect oxidation resistance that can be  observed in SiC coated materials, although some improvement can  be made over other graphite materials. Figure VI-5 illustrates  the appearance of the SiC/C and base graphite test pieces before  and after oxidation for about 2.5 hours at 1,000C.          The base graphite test piece is reduced in size (carbon and  oxygen react with each other and produce CO[.sup]2[/] gas),  but there is no change in the external view of SiC/C, even  though there is reduction in weight of 76 percent. Because  SiC/C, unlike SiC coated materials, is not covered with a SiC  layer and is still a porous material, oxygen reacts with  unreacted internal carbon (carbon not yet turned to SiC) through  pores. Porous diffusion of oxygen is easier with SiC/C, which  has a high level of porosity, than with the base graphite.  Although there is no change in the external view due to a lack  of oxidation in the SiC portion of the SiC/C layer, it is  internally oxidized. Even though it is possible to produce SiC/C  with different SiC density by varying the response temperature  and time in equation [1], the reaction of oxygen with unreacted  internal carbon cannot be avoided. Therefore, it is necessary to  coat the SiC/C surface with SiC further, and to turn it to  SiC-SiC/C if more severe oxidation resistance is required.    Based on a detailed examination of SiC behavior, an  extremely  thin and stable SiO[.sup]2[/] layer is formed on SiC by the  following reaction:    SiC (solid) + 20[.sup]2[/] (gas) = SiO[.sub]2[/]  (solid) + CO[.sup]2[/] (gas) [2]    up to 1,000, and the oxidation resistance of SiC is  believed to be maintained.    ii) Thermal Cycle Testing    The evaluation test for thermal cycle resistance properties  was conducted for SiC-SiC/C and SiC-C coated with SiC by CVD.  The method of the thermal cycle test was as follows. First, as a  preliminary heating process, it was heated at 800-1,000C in  the atmosphere for several hours to verify the soundness of the  SiC coated layer. Then, those test pieces with a sound coated  layer were heated to 1,000C or 1,200C at the speed of  20C per second. Next, after maintaining them at that  temperature for 5 minutes, they were dropped into pure water at  20C. In order to evaluate the soundness of the test pieces  after testing, isothermal heating was conducted for one hour in  the atmosphere at 800C after each cycle, and any changes in  weight were measured. When cracks in the SiC coated layer or  exfoliation of the layer is caused by the heat cycle, the test  piece loses weight due to a reaction of oxygen and the base  graphite through the damaged section by isothermal heating.  Thermal cycle and isothermal heating were repeated until the  weight reduction rate, where the coated layer was damaged,  reached about 10 percent.    Figure VI-6 illustrates a typical example of a test piece  where the coated layer is damaged, and the internal graphite  base is oxidized. Figure VI-7 illustrates weight reduction  curves for three kinds of SiC-SiC/C (with different SiC density  in SiC/C) and SiC-C. A list of preliminary thermal process  conditions to verify the soundness of SiC coated layers, and a  suitable retaining temperature for thermal cycle testing  concerning the test pieces a-j in Figure VI-6 are presented in  Table VI-1. Although differences in the behavior of the three  types of SiC-SiC/C cannot be accounted for, they clearly are due  to different SiC densities in individual SiC/C elements, and to  different preliminary thermal process conditions prior to  thermal cycle testing. The figure indicates that the thermal  cycle resistance properties are far more stable than those for  SiC/C.             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table VI-1.

Figure VI-8 indicates the surface  conditions of SiC-C (test piece: g) after the fourth thermal  cycle, and isothermal heating and SiC-SiC/C (test piece: h)  after fifth thermal cycle and isothermal heating as examples.  There are many cracks in SiC-C.       The thermal expansion factors of beta-SiC and the base  graphite (marketed under the trade name of IG-110) are 4.7 x  10[.sup]-6[/]/K (293-2,400 K) and 4.06 x 10[.sup]-6[/]/K  (293-673 K), respectively. As Figure VI-3 indicates, a phase  boundary of heterogeneous materials exists between the  SiC-coated layer and the base graphite in SiC-C, but there is no  clear phase boundary in SiC-SiC/C. In other words, since the  phase boundary between heterogeneous materials exists not as a  line but as a layer in SiC-SiC/C, stress tends not to  concentrate in specific places. Therefore, it can be said that  the SiC coated layer of SiC-SiC/C expresses stable properties  even under thermal cycles.    iii) Miscellaneous    Strength properties are an important evaluation item if the  SiC/C gradient compound material (SiC-SiC/C) is to be put to  practical use as a structural material. Concerning the effects  of the SiC/C layer on the strength properties of the base  graphite at room temperature, a preliminary examination was  conducted. As a result of the examination, it was confirmed that  the strength of the graphite material with the SiC/C layer was  equivalent to or greater than that of the base material without  depending on the weight increase factor, or SiC density, if the  weight increase factor was below 2 percent, or within the range  where cracks were not created at the time of SiC/C layer  formation. Figure VI-9 illustrates the bending strength of  IG-110 graphite with a SiC/C layer in comparison with the base  IG-110.     <H5>  (4) Conclusion and Future Perspectives </H5>   The development of a SiC/C gradient compound material from  which an oxidation-resistant SiC surface layer is hard to  exfoliate has been conducted for the purpose of improving the  oxidation resistance of carbon materials. Using the reaction  between gaseous SiO and carbon, a SiC/C gradient compound layer  was formed in the graphite material. Using the graphite material  as the base, a SiC/C gradient compound graphite material  consisting of a SiC-coated layer produced by CVD, a SiC/C  gradient compound layer, and the graphite base was successfully  produced. According to an evaluation of its oxidation and  thermal cycle resistance properties, it displayed a level of  oxidation resistance equivalent to SiC coated graphite, and a  thermal cycle resistance far more stable than that of SiC coated  graphite.    To date, only three experimental pieces of SiC/C gradient  compound graphite material have been produced and evaluated. We  have good prospects for the development of a high-performance  oxidation-resistant graphite material. We will continue our  research on how the SiC density of the base SiC/C layer affects  the stability of the surface SiC layer, and on the long-term  stability of SiC/C density gradient. Also, we will try to put  the material to practical use. It has been confirmed that the  SiC/C layer formation method based on the reaction in the  equation [1], which is used for the graphite material, also can  be applied to both carbon materials and carbon fiber reinforced  compound materials (so-called C/C compounds). We plan to use the  surface SiC coating by CVD technique to produce a SiC coated  layer-SiC/C gradient compound layer-carbon base, a SiC coated  layer-SiC/C gradient compound layer-C/C compound base, and a  SiC/C gradient compound C/C compound material. We will conduct  evaluation tests on these materials.  <H3>  2. Development of Highly Thermal-Resistant Silicon Carbide  Long Fiber </H3> <H5>  (1) Objectives and Issues of Research and Development </H5>   Although ceramics have superb properties in the areas of  heat  resistance, reduction of radiation, and corrosion resistance,  their lack of fracture toughness presents a problem in terms of  reliability. In order to improve their fracture toughness,  research and development of a fiber-reinforced compound ceramics  material (FRC) is being considered.    There are many ceramics, ranging from porcelain, which has a  long history, to the recently developed fine ceramics. However,  there is only a limited number of reinforcing fibers, such as  alumina fibers, silicon carbide fibers, and zirconia fibers.  Although glass fibers and carbon fibers are used widely as  reinforcement fibers for plastic, glass fibers and carbon fibers  cannot be used directly as reinforcement fibers for ceramics  because of their heat resistance and reactions to ceramics,  respectively. Normally, compounding and molding of ceramics are  done at high temperatures between 10,000 and 20,000C. It is  also necessary to mold fiber-reinforced compound materials at  high temperatures, and thus the development of reinforcing  fibers that can be processed at such high temperatures is  expected.    It is anticipated that silicon carbide (SiC) fibers can be  used as reinforcement fibers for ceramic compounds. The SiC  fiber was invented by Yajima, et al., of the Research Institute  for Iron, Steel, and Other Materials of Tohoku University. In  their method, polycarbosilane (PCS) fiber, an organic silicon  polymer, is used as a precursor. After it is processed to make  it infusible by thermal oxidation in the process illustrated in  Figure VI-10, it is baked to produce fibers. The SiC fiber  obtained by this thermal oxidation method is known as "Nikaron,"  while the SiC fiber obtained by the same method using  polytitanocarbosilane compounded with polycarbosilane and a few  percent of titanium is called "Tilano." These fibers have a high  level of flexibility, strength, and oxidation resistance, and  their maximum heat resistance is 1,200C. Therefore, their  application as reinforcing fibers for compound materials is  limited, and they are used only to reinforce materials with a  relatively low melting temperature, such as glass for FRC, and  to reinforce aluminum for metal compounds.       The heat resistance of SiC fibers must be improved if they  are to be used for the development of heat-resistant compound  materials. "Nikaron" and "Tilano" as marketed at present, begin  to decompose at 1,200C. This most likely is because of the  oxygen included in the SiC. A process to make PCS fiber  infusible is essential to maintain the fiber form in the ceramic  production process. If this is done by thermal oxidation, oxygen  is introduced into SiC fiber after burning, and its density  increases by 10 percent in weight. To reduce the oxygen level, a  method to make the fibers infusible by using radiation was  examined. As a result of developing infusibility technology  based on the study of the effects of radiation on PCS, SiC  fibers with far greater heat resistance than expected were  obtained. The following describes the properties of the SiC  fibers obtained in this research and development effort.  <H3>  (2) Production Technology for Silicon Carbide Fiber Using  Radiation </H3>   i) Radiation Method    We developed a method to process silicon polymer (PCS) fiber  to make it infusible (a process to maintain the fiber form by  heating it to a temperature higher than the fusing point of the  fiber) by irradiating it. When organic polymers are irradiated,  a covalent-bonded molecular chain is either cut off or forms new  bonds with another molecular chain.    The reactions that occurred with PCS were examined by using [.sup]60  [/]  Cogamma ray radiation. The results show that  radiation in a vacuum at room temperature resulted in the  emission of hydrogen (H[.sup]2[/]) and methane  (CH[.sup]4[/]), and cross-linking was promoted. Meanwhile,  radiation in an oxygen atmosphere at room temperature resulted  in the emission of oxidative destruction products, carbon  dioxide, and water. Also, oxygen was absorbed extensively  compared to the amount emitted. Infusibility processing can be  conducted in this case as well, and oxygen density can be  controlled and varied between 3 and 25 percent. The amount of  oxidation induced by PCS radiation is 10 times higher than that  of hydrocarbon polymers, such as polyethylene. This indicates  that PCS, including silicon atoms, is extremely susceptible to  oxidation.    When PCS is subjected to gamma rays in a vacuum, it becomes  infusible by cross-linking, but reaction activity (radicals)  still remains, and exposure to air promotes rapid oxidation as  well as the intake of oxygen. Therefore, we have developed an  infusibility process that does not introduce oxygen by  eliminating the remaining oxygen while implementing  stabilization processing to prevent oxidation in the air. It is  known that there is no difference between gamma rays and  electrons in terms of the radiation effects on organic polymers.  It has been confirmed that electron and gamma ray radiation  produce a cross-linking reaction in PCS fiber.    ii) Development of Production Technology    PCS fiber can be rendered infusible without oxygen by  radiation in a vacuum, but this process requires a dose of 15  MGy. Although gamma radiation can be used for large amounts of  PCS fibers at a time, the radiation speed (dose rate) is about  10 kGy/h at the maximum. This is unrealistic in practical terms  as it would require 1,500 hours of radiation. Therefore,  electron radiation by electronic accelerators was examined for  practical application. Although electronic accelerators are  capable of producing large doses of radiation in a short time,  it is necessary that the items being radiated are thin as its  transmittivity is small. As illustrated in Figure VI-11, we have  developed a method to spool fiber on a bobbin (30 cm in diameter  and 30 cm in width), and to radiate the spinning bobbin in the  radiation container. The electron accelerator used here operates  at a current of 2 MeV, and is capable of radiating electron  beams at a maximum of 30 mA with a scanning width of 120 cm. As  the effective transmittivity of the electronic beams is 0.6  g/cm[.sup]2[/], the maximum thickness of the PCS fiber is 0.6  g/cm[.sup]2[/]. Therefore, the maximum amount of PCS fiber  that can be radiated at a time with the bobbin in Figure VI-11  is about 1.5 kg.       However, a dose of 15 MGy means that 15 MJ of energy is  applied to 1 kg of fiber, and most of this energy is transformed  to thermal energy. Therefore, if the PCS fiber being radiated is  not sufficiently cooled, the fiber will melt with the heat from  the electrons. For efficient cooling, helium gas was used as the  atmosphere during radiation, and the helium gas was cooled with  a heat exchanger. This method made it possible to achieve  infusibility for a maximum of 4.5 kg of PCS fiber by irradiating  it for four hours, which demonstrates the prospect of practical  application.  <H5>  (3) Properties of Silicon Carbide Fiber </H5>   After PCS fiber is made infusible by radiation and thermal  oxidation, it is processed with heat up to 1,200C in an  inactive gas flow. Then, it emits H[.sup]2[/] and  CH[.sup]4[/], and is transformed into ceramic SiC fiber. The  SiC fiber obtained at this temperature has an amorphous  structure with a density between 2.5 and 2.6. The strength of  the fiber does not depend much on the oxygen content, and shows  a value of 2.5-3.0 GPa (100 kg/mm[.sup]2[/]). When this SiC  fiber is processed with heat up to 1,500C in argon gas, the  fiber with a low oxygen content does not change its form or  strength, but the density rises slightly to about 2.7.    Meanwhile, when the oxygen density increases, its strength  drops radically, although the fiber form is maintained.  Examination with a scanning electron microscope shows that the  higher oxygen density generates particles on the surface of the  fiber, and that decomposition is taking place as illustrated in  Figure VI-12. Decomposition is particularly prominent in the SiC  fiber with 10 percent oxygen produced by thermal oxidation  infusibility. The oxygen density indicated in the figure is  expressed in percent by weight based on an element analysis of  SiC fiber. The fiber processed with heat after electron  radiation is the lowest at 0.4 percent. The oxygen density at  1.4 and 2.3 percent indicates insufficient heat processing after  radiation. Since PCS fiber as a material contains about 0.2-0.3  percent oxygen as an impurity, the oxygen density of the SiC  fiber after burning becomes almost 0.4 percent without  additional oxygen in the infusibility process.       Figure VI-13 consists of scanning electron microscope  photographs of low-oxygen SiC fiber being processed by heat up  to 2,000C in argon gas. Although there is no change in the  fiber with 0.4 percent oxygen, the surface of the fiber with 1.4  percent oxygen is coarse, and large crystallized particles can  be observed between fibers. The results of an X-ray diffraction  analysis of the structure of the crystals are illustrated in  Figure VI-14. Those with a higher oxygen density present  diffraction images equivalent to single SiC crystals (_b_-SiC).          In SiC with a lower oxygen density, however, particle growth  is slow, and the fiber form is maintained, although crystals are  formed. Figure VI-15 illustrates the oxygen density and  carbon/silicon ratio by thermal processing, and it indicates the  disjunction of oxygen and carbon beginning around 1,400C.  This is because oxygen that has combined with silicon atoms is  released. It then reacts with excessive carbon, and is emitted  as carbon monoxide (CO) gas. SiC that remains in thermal  decomposition develops into crystallized particles and becomes  deposited between fibers, as illustrated in Figure VI-13.  Although element composition does not change in samples with  small oxygen density up to 2,000C without thermal  decomposition, crystallization takes place gradually.       Figure VI-16 illustrates the relationship between strength  and elastic coefficient of the fiber with the least oxygen  density at 0.4 percent in a tension test at room temperature  after thermal processing in argon gas at various temperatures.  Reduction of strength is extremely small up to about  1,700C, and elastic coefficient begins to decrease beyond  1,900C. When the results are compared with "Nikaron," which  is rendered infusible by thermal oxidation, heat resistance has  been improved by 500C in the range of dynamic properties.  Table VI-2 indicates representative property values of SiC fiber  with a low oxygen density obtained in the infusibility process  by thermal oxidation.          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table VI-2.

An experiment using this technology for  production on a scale of one ton per month is in progress at  Research Development Corporation, and it is expected to be  completed at the end of FY 1994.    For the future, we anticipate the development of  fiber-reinforced compound materials using this newly developed  fiber. Silicon carbide fiber obtained by radiation can endure a  high temperature of 1,700C for a short time. The range of  matrix materials will expand, and it can be compounded with  ceramics. The initial items of examination include  compatibility, reactions, and deference in thermal expansion  between compound materials and this fiber. The next item is the  development of compound technology. Superb inspiration and its  efficient execution will be needed in this unknown field. The  situation will differ depending on whether the matrix is metal  or ceramics, but in each case this will be key basic research  worth our efforts because of its variety.    The application of new materials to the nuclear field  becomes  possible only when technological development of compound  materials expands. A broad range of uses is expected for  enhanced light-water reactors; nuclear fusion reactor materials;  aeronautic and space materials, including rockets; and  heat-resistant materials, including gas turbines.  <H5>  3. Conclusion </H5>   We have reported on concrete developments in key  technological research concerning compound materials, noting  that high-performance oxidation-resistant graphite materials, as  well as a production method for high-performance silicon carbide  fiber, have been developed.    The development of high-performance oxidation-resistant  graphite materials leads to the enhancement of all carbon  materials, and the development of high-performance silicon  carbide fiber will lead to the development of fiber-reinforced  metal and ceramic compound materials.    Our dream expands to the development of gradient composite  silicon carbide fiber compound materials -- the ultimate  compound materials -- by reinforcing the base material with  silicon carbide fiber gradiently compounded with  environment-resistant materials.</p>

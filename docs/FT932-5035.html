			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Books: Araby under fire CRUELTY AND SILENCE: WAR, TYRANNY, UPRISING AND THE ARAB WORLD by Kanan Makiya Jonathan Cape Pounds 18.99, 240 pages KANAN Makiya's principal contention is, as he says, very simple: 'The politics of keeping silent over escalating cruelties inside the Arab world, cruelties inflicted for the most part by one Arab on another, is principally responsible for an Arab moral collapse which has today reached epidemic proportions.' The silence which he so condemns is that of his fellow Arab intellectuals - men, he argues, who were flushed out from under their protective stones by Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and forced to show themselves. 'The whole apparatus of evasion and hiding behind sophisticated veils was laid bare,' he declares. Born in Baghdad but educated in the US, Makiya writes from the moral high ground. His earlier book, produced protectively under the name of Samir al-Khalil, revealed something of the nature of Saddam's regime but was little noticed until the invasion of Kuwait. What the book did reveal was, he says, ignored almost totally by those Arab writers who sought to locate Iraq's aggression in the wider pan-Arab context and in terms of the West's continued manipulation of the Middle East for its own imperial and economic interests. Their attempts to transfer the blame for Saddam's actions onto the West and the Arab-Israel dispute enraged Makiya. 'Their relentless wallowing in illusion filled me with anger.' The reality - first-hand accounts of the brutality of the Ba'athist regime in Baghdad, particularly towards the Kurds in 1988 and subsequently to the southern Shia - takes up the first half of the latest book. Much of the remainder is devoted to denunciations of individual Arab writers, many living in the West, who are accused of moral bankruptcy and failing through their silence to aid the Arabs who are 'trapped inside the oppressive countries of the Middle East.' The author's anger is focused so finely, his primary targets defined so narrowly, that the wider issues raised by the book risk being obscured by personal antagonisms. Governments, almost certainly, bear much greater responsibility. No western foreign ministry was unware of how Saddam Hussein maintained his grip on Iraq. The atrocities commited before the invasion of Kuwait were known, if not their full horror. But in the interests of maintaining a bulwark against the Islamic revolution in Iran and selling into a profitable market, it was convenient politically to overlook them. The same considerations apply today, and not just in the Middle East. Perhaps there has been a glaring, collective failure of the Arab intelligentsia as Makiya asserts. But, if so, it is just one element in a much greater international failure. There is no better example than Burma. The people there actually voted massively for democracy, but the regime which denied them so viciously is being allowed to inch its way back into the international community. It is a sobering lesson for those Arab populations of the Middle East who, in their desperation, are being tempted to see radical Islamic factions as an alternative to politically bankrupt leaderships. Switching the full beam of the Arab intellectual spotlight on those regimes would help - but only if there are more powerful people who wish to see what is revealed.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Fringe benefits forecast to rise as pay is curbed THE DOWNWARD pressure on public-sector pay bills as a result of the government's 1.5 per cent pay rise limit for 1993 will lead to improvements in 'non-pay' benefits, Incomes Data Services, the pay analyst, said yesterday. The IDS view, supported by some public-sector union officials, is that there will be few direct breaches of the 1.5 per cent limit and that costs of improvements in non-pay benefits will, where possible, be postponed into future years. In the private sector, the bulk of pay deals in October and November gave rises slightly above inflation in the 4 per cent to 4.9 per cent range, but IDS also reported a growing number of settlements in the 3 per cent to 3.9 per cent bracket. The pay reviews monitored ranged from a pay freeze at Wang Computers, one of 50 so far this year in the private sector, to salary rises averaging 5.2 per cent at Tate &amp; Lyle. A number of January 1993 pay rises have already been agreed, ranging from a 1.5 per cent rise for manual workers at Carpets of Worth to a rise of 5.9 per cent in the thermal insulation industry in the second stage of a two-year deal. For 1993 as a whole, IDS is predicting private-sector pay rises at or slightly above the rate of inflation. The organisation also detects a narrowing of the normal gap between pay settlements and official earnings statistics. The earnings figures are usually 1 or 2 percentage points above average settlements because they include bonuses and overtime, but also because they include pay rises going back over 12 months. 'Part of the reason for the gap narrowing is that average earnings figures are now measuring a year of low pay settlements reached against a background of low inflation,' IDS says. More than 80 per cent of companies in London and the south-east are still operating executive bonus schemes in spite of the recession, an analysis by PE International shows.

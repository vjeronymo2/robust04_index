			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Europa merger delay not as long as expected The delay to the three-way merger first announced six months ago involving Europa Minerals, a small London-quoted finance house, and two Australian companies with which it is already closely linked - Austmin Gold and Burmine  -will not be as long as recently indicated. Burmine has been ordered by the Australian Securities Commission not to put a resolution about the merger to its shareholders before an appeal hearing. This hearing was originally scheduled for March 14 but, at Burmine's request, has been brought forward to February 7. The appeal is in connection with the rival bid for Burmine.</p>

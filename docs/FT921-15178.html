			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Major sets framework for election manifesto MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday set the framework of a Conservative manifesto for this year's general election centred on lower taxation, privatisation, environmental protection and improving public services. As Labour joined the Tories in promising no let-up in the feverish election atmosphere at Westminster, the prime minister held a second day of talks with cabinet ministers on the broad thrust and details of the party's manifesto. Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, will start work soon on final drafting - although Mr Major has yet to see Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, or Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, to discuss policy within their departments. His detailed consultations with ministers are designed to avoid a repeat of the disaster over the poll tax, included by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the 1987 manifesto. Meanwhile, Treasury ministers yesterday met at the official residence of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, at Chevening in Kent to discuss the Budget. Their meeting will end today. Ministers have been deliberately reticent so far on the manifesto's contents and will try to control the disclosure of individual policy items in the coming months as part of a carefully designed general election strategy. However, it is clear that the main pledges will include the privatisation of British Rail and British Coal, cuts in the basic rate of income tax and a tough stance on inflation. A promise to cut inheritance tax will be targeted at boosting support among Tory voters in south-east England. Public services will be improved under the Citizen's Charter while the social security system is to be enhanced as a 'safety net' for the less well off. Child benefit will continue to be up-rated in line with inflation. Further trade union reforms will be made. The government is already consulting on its plans for an environment agency, and detailed proposals will be included in the manifesto. Mr Tom King, defence secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, will spearhead an attack on Labour's defence and foreign affairs policies next week. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, is to address a rally on Sunday in York, setting out his party's agenda for the election. Liberal Democrats hold their own rally in London today. Further squalls over tax policy - which have dominated the political agenda this week - resurfaced yesterday, when Mr Hurd used a speech in Wolverhampton to accuse Labour of being prepared to destroy incentives and jobs to make themselves 'feel better'. In response, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said Chevening should be used to draw up an immediate package of incentives for investment and training. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said it would be 'politically dishonest' for the government to cut income tax in the Budget and called for increased public investment.

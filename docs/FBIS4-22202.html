			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Press Service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine: </F> "Minister of Defense at Air Force Training"]    [Text] As we reported earlier, Air Force command staff  training is continuing in accordance with the plan for combat  training of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.    Defense Minister General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy  visited the headquarters of the Air Force of Ukraine in  Vinnytsya. As the person ultimately in charge of training, the  minister heard reports from Lt. Gen. Volodymyr Antonets, the  commander of the Air Force, Maj. Gen. Yuriy Petrov, chief of  staff of the Air Force, and the chiefs of directorates and  services and set them the task of working out how the country's  Air Force will be used in strategic defense operations by the  Armed Forces of Ukraine.    Vitaliy Radetskyy stressed the need for more thoroughly  working out the combat missions in such training exercises,  because they offer an opportunity for commanders at all levels  to attain theoretical and practical skills in leading troops.    The chief of Ukraine's War Office visited the helicopter  regiment stationed in Vinnytsya. Here, Vitaliy Radetskyy  acquainted himself with the everyday life of personnel and the  conditions in which the helicopter troops carry out their  military duty. It was evident that the members of this unit and  their families are experiencing considerable social and everyday  hardships. Despite these difficulties, the aviators are  executing the tasks they have been assigned. This was confirmed  by the efficient performance of the pair on duty: On the defense  minister's command, the helicopters rose into the air,  significantly exceeding the accepted standard.    The main subject discussed during the meeting of the defense  minister with the regiment personnel was the need to focus  attention on the problems of the army and to begin solving them  as quickly as possible.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Rabin presses Tokyo on funds for new bank Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday asked Japan to contribute Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m (Pounds 192m-Pounds 256m) of capital for the planned Middle East development bank. Mr Rabin, who is at the end of a three-day tour, the first official visit to Japan by an Israeli leader, requested the contribution in talks with Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister. Mr Takemura was unable to give any indication of further assistance from Japan, which has already pledged Dollars 200m over the next two years for the improvement of Palestinian self-rule areas. Mr Rabin is keen to see wide backing for the bank, which is to fund regional infrastructure projects along the lines of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Last month's Middle East and North Africa economic summit in Casablanca agreed to study the establishment of such a bank, probably with capital of Dollars 10bn, of which Israel has indicated it might provide Dollars 500m. Israel wants the US - a supporter of the scheme - to provide 60 per cent of the capital along with Europe and Japan, with the remainder coming from Middle East countries. In a separate meeting with Mr Yohei Kono, the Japanese foreign minister, Mr Rabin voiced concern over the growing strength of Islamic fundamentalism and alleged official Iranian support for terrorist organisations. His comments come at a sensitive time, as the Japanese government is considering whether to disburse an overdue second tranche of an official soft loan for a dam in Iran. Mr Kono was reported to have made no reply. Reuter adds from Jerusalem: Mr Hikmat al-Masri, a leading organiser against British mandatory rule of Palestine before 1948 and against Israeli occupation later, has died, aged 88, his family said yesterday. Mr Masri, a member of one of the most prominent West Bank families and a co-founder in 1964 of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, died on Tuesday in his native city of Nablus.</p>

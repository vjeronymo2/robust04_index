			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OUT AND ABOUT;  </P> <P> STUDENTS TAKE A COURSE TO NEW DEPTHS  </P> <P> Bill Miller has spent much of his life exploring an environment unfamiliar to  most.  </P> <P> "It's new every time that you go out. Over that next ridge could be the hidden  treasure that you've never found."  </P> <P> He has also spent a good portion of his life teaching others how to survive in  that other place.  </P> <P> "I've been scuba diving since I was in high school, and for 24 years I've been  instructing," said Miller, 56.  </P> <P> For the past 13 years he has headed the scuba diving program at Ventura College  with two other instructors.  </P> <P> Unlike most of the three-week courses at professional dive shops, the Ventura  College beginner program is one semester. Upon completion, students receive an  Open Water I certification through the National Assn. of Underwater  Instructors.  </P> <P> "It's a regular three-unit college course. We go for 18 weeks. That's about 100  hours of instruction.  </P> <P> "I think that's one of the strong points of our program. We have plenty of time  to work on any kind of problem a person might come up with. Whereas some of the  other courses can't spend as much time with individual problems," said Miller.  </P> <P> The most common of which is overcoming the fear of being underwater, said  Miller. Then comes grappling with the equipment.  </P> <P> Ventura College offers one daytime beginner class that meets twice weekly for  two hours, and two night beginner courses, meeting weekly for five hours.  </P> <P> "We don't waste any time getting them wet. They're in the water the first day  so we can test their swimming capability. The first four weeks they'll be  instructed on basic snorkeling techniques. After that, we'll start with scuba  equipment," said Miller.  </P> <P> Students must provide their own mask, snorkel and fins. The school supplies the  scuba tank, regulators and stabilizer jackets.  </P> <P> Students must also pay for three required diving excursions at $40 each and a  $7 wet suit rental. Wet suits are only used during the ocean outings. Other  training occurs in the college's 80-degree pool.  </P> <P> "We spend about half our time during the semester in the classroom studying,  among other things, the physiology and physics of scuba diving. They've got to  understand the implications of breathing compressed air."  </P> <P> To drive the point home Miller has coined a "word of the day." It is also  emblazoned on his license plate.  </P> <P> 'XHALE.'  </P> <P> "You must never forget to exhale when surfacing. It's the main safety thing."  </P> <P> About five weeks into the semester the class will have its first ocean  experience.  </P> <P> "We take them out to Anacapa Island. The first time out consists of just  snorkeling methods," Miller said.  </P> <P> Then comes the scuba experience. So what's it like scuba diving in the ocean  for the first time?  </P> <P> "Frightening!" said Roger Reynhart, who received his diving certification  through Miller's class. "It's all new. You feel strange. It's more of a  survival thing at first.  </P> <P> "By the second dive you start to open your eyes. It's a whole different world  down there. With TV and Jacques Cousteau, people have a sense of what it's like  without moving from their armchair, but to actually go under and experience it.  . . ."  </P> <P> After completing the beginner course, students have the option of continuing  their scuba skills.  </P> <P> "The next step is the intermediate class. They learn to dive deeper and more  aggressively," Miller said.  </P> <P> An advanced course is also offered.  </P> <P> "We're fortunate because diving in this area is excellent," Miller said. "It's  probably one of the prettiest places in the world to dive."  </P> <P> For more information about the course, call 654-6352.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COURSES IN DIVING  </P> <P> * Channel Islands Scuba  </P> <P> 1495 Palma Drive, No. C, Ventura.  </P> <P> Offers a two-week course for $185.

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / A gap at the high table of power play: Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's master diplomatist, leaves a legacy of success THE CRUMPLED figure of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher has haunted the corridors of world diplomacy for so long that his face, like the Cheshire cat's, will take some considerable time to disappear. Under Chancellors Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl, Mr Genscher honed his skills to emerge as the unsurpassed master of coalition wheeler-dealing. His passion for power play was never put to better advantage than during the helter-skelter international negotiations leading to German reunification in 1990. The foreign minister built his penchant for jet-travel diplomacy into a personal trademark. His globe-trotting revealed much about his restlessness, but little about the man himself. Extending the Ostpolitik of Chancellor Willy Brandt, Mr Genscher continued with aplomb this policy of developing links with west Germany's eastern neighbours. Five years ago, he became the first senior western politician publicly to back Mr Mikhail Gorbachev's reform measures in the Soviet Union. Without the bonds of sympathy to Moscow, Mr Kohl and Mr Genscher would never have pulled off German unification quite so quickly. Despite - and because of - his success, he could never throw off altogether a reputation for putting tactics before principles. Mr Brandt, who resigned as chancellor in 1974, as well as Mr Schmidt, whose downfall in 1982 was due to his foreign minister's decision to back Mr Kohl, both had extensive experience of Mr Genscher's talents for manoeuvre. He believed deeply in his mission to help restore the post-war credibility of German foreign policy. Ever thin-skinned, he was deeply hurt to be told that, because of his role in toppling Mr Schmidt, he was not trusted by Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Reunification was his finest hour. Mr Genscher was born in a village outside Halle in eastern Germany and made annual Christmas pilgrimages to his homeland during the years of division. However, like Mr Kohl, he believed he would never live to see the two parts of the fatherland reunited. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Mr Genscher realised, with typical alertness, that the opportunity for unity might be short-lived. His resolve to take it was single-minded. An emotional high-point came in early autumn, 1989. He stood on the balcony of the West German embassy in Prague to announce the liberation of hordes of east German refugees who had been camping in the grounds, hoping to escape to the west. After the catharsis of unity, an exhausted Mr Genscher seemed to lose his touch. He failed to recognise the international mood during the approach to the Gulf war last year. At times, it seemed the foreign minister was trying to elevate Germany's absenteeism from the multinational anti-Iraq task force to a higher form of morality. Mr Genscher also clung for longer than others in the west to the belief that Mr Gorbachev would remain in charge of an intact Soviet Union. In view of the hope and the D-Marks invested by the Germans in the Soviet leader, this was forgivable, but it did not improve the reputation of a man famed for deciphering the shifting runes of international politics. Mr Genscher is a complicated personality, though not quite as complicated as his favoured long strings of high-sounding subordinate clauses can sometimes make him seem. There is a stern touch to him. He adores wise-cracking and carnival festivities, particularly when he is the centre of attention, but instructs his speech-writers never to put jokes into his public addresses. He once expressed indignation when Mr Douglas Hurd, then Britain's home secretary, made a whimsical remark about modernisation of nuclear missiles in a speech at Dusseldorf. He bears grudges, and remembers favours. He recently indicated to Mr Hurd, now foreign secretary, that, since Germany had helped Britain at the Maastricht summit, the UK should be more supportive of Bonn's controversial line over recognising Croatia. By becoming foreign minister of a united Germany, he realised his life's ambition. Since he has made the foreign ministry his personal fiefdom by having placed favoured officials in all the key posts, he can be sure that Genscherism will live on, at least for a few more years. Asked what he would do with more spare time, Mr Genscher once answered that he would re-order the books in his library at home in the hills near Bonn. Perhaps he will write one, too - probably about Genscherism.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SNAPSHOT / A GLIMPSE OF THE SYSTEM;  </P> <P> A JILTED HUSBAND, A BOMBED CHICKEN CAFE, 74 DAYS IN JAIL  </P> <P> No one was inside the chicken restaurant on Sunset Boulevard when the pipe bomb  blew up in August, 1989. A good thing, detectives would say.  </P> <P> Somebody could have been killed.  </P> <P> Investigators learned that the owner of the restaurant, Fernando Gonzales,  recently "ran off to Texas" with the wife and only child of Ohannes  Meguerditchian, a self-employed diamond setter, according to court records.  </P> <P> Meguerditchian eventually was arrested and charged with the bombing, which  buckled a wall and did an estimated $40,000 damage. Prosecutors also filed a  special charge against Meguerditchian stating that he had to go to prison if  found guilty.  </P> <P> But after Meguerditchian agreed to plead no contest, the district attorney's  office dropped the special charge and reduced the primary accusation to illegal  possession of explosives.  </P> <P> In May of this year, Superior Court Judge Lance Ito sentenced him to six months  in jail. A six-month sentence in Los Angeles today amounts to 74 days.  </P></p>

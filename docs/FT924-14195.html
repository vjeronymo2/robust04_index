			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / International Company News: Wagons-Lits back in the black NET profits at Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian tourism group, dropped to BFr284m (Dollars 9.28m) in the six months to June 30 from BFr672m a year earlier. But before exceptional gains the company returned to the black with profits of BFr121m, against losses of BFr227m. The group said the travel agency and restaurant operations had turned in particularly good results, although the mediocre economic climate continued to hold back the hotel, railways and car-hire subsidiaries. The company warned against reading too much into the figures because of the seasonal nature of its business. But it said it was expecting a continued improvement in the second half of the year. Turnover increased to BFr45.8bn from BFr41.2bn, of which the largest part came from the restaurant business - up to BFr15.9bn from BFr14.1bn. Travel agency sales rose to BFr13.2bn from BFr10.1bn, while hotels generated turnover of BFr7.17bn compared with BFr6.91bn. Wagons-Lits is controlled by Accor, the French hotel group, which took over the company a year ago. Minority shareholders in Wagons-Lits are still fighting a legal battle to force Accor to increase its offer price to all shareholders.</p>

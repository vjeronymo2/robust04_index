			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From YONHAP, in Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Hans Blix, International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  director-general, stressed that an additional inspection of the  radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, which North Korea has been  refusing, is urgent and that IAEA inspectors should be present  at the experimental reactor that has an output of 5,000 kw when  its fuel is replaced.    Director-general Blix, now visiting Japan, held a news  conference on 13 April and said that as the inspection of the  radiochemical laboratory, which is believed to be a facility for  extraction of plutonium, was not carried out, it cannot be  determined if this facility has been used since February 1993.  He pointed out that it will become a very serious problem if  this situation continues for a long time.    Director-general Blix revealed that the project for building  a second production line in the radiochemical laboratory is  presently under way, and that this project will be completed  before long.    Director-general Blix stressed that North Korea claimed that  the fuel was loaded in the experimental reactor for the first  time and that plutonium was not extracted from the fuel used in  this reactor. An on-the-spot investigation of the reactor by the  inspectors is necessary to verify this claim.    Director-general Blix pointed out that in the event that  North Korea continues refusing comprehensive inspection of its  nuclear facilities, there is the possibility that the IAEA will  demand that the UN Security Council take stronger steps and  measures.</p>

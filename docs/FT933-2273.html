			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / The Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Williams plea for jobs action MORE RESOLUTE action to counter unemployment was urged yesterday by Baroness Williams of Crosby at the launch of The Reformer, a new quarterly Liberal Democrat journal. The former Labour cabinet minister stressed that it was no longer a problem confined to unskilled and semi-skilled workers in areas where traditional industries had either contracted or disappeared. She said: 'Unemployment will become a real political issue from which politicians can no longer walk away.' Lady Williams suggested that in some cases prolonged unemployment led to racism and other crime and said it was time to address 'the seedbeds from which the flowers of hate grow'. Writing in the first issue of The Reformer, she argues that Britain can no longer afford to send nearly half of school leavers unprepared into the labour market. 'At the very least we should pick up where the 1944 education act left us, with a requirement for two days a week of further education between 16 and 18, with the work component gradually increasing.' Lady Williams notes that while the Liberal Democrats have discussed the idea of national community service, no similar steps have been taken by the government. She urges that consideration be given to the introduction of a community service scheme designed to supplement the 'bare bones student grant' so as to attract prospective university students as well as un-employed inner city youths.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Klaus Kinkel, FDP Chairman and foreign </F> minister, by Martin S. Lambeck in Bonn; date not given:  "Liberals Keep CDU/CSU Waiting"]    [Text] [Lambeck] Mr. Kinkel, after the strategic summit  of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union  [CDU/CSU] in Munich, Helmut Kohl clearly stated that the CDU and  the CSU want to continue the coalition with the Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP]. Do you also want to continue the  alliance with the CDU/CSU?    [Kinkel] I am, of course, pleased that the chancellor and  Mr. Waigel said that they want to continue the alliance with the  FDP. Despite all the forebodings, we have achieved remarkable  things in a difficult time. I have always said that I do not  want to make a statement on a coalition without coordinating it  with the FDP's executive bodies. We will decide before each of  the 18 elections this year whether and when we will make a  statement on a coalition and, if possible, what it will be like;  this will also be done before the Bundestag elections. I am  proceeding on the assumption that it is more likely that a  statement on a coalition will be made.    [Lambeck] The chancellor said in Munich that he expected the  FDP to revise its position on the "great bugging campaign" at  its party congress in Rostock. Have you indicated a change on  this issue to Helmut Kohl?    [Kinkel] I have not. My personal attitude toward this  question is known. I have always said, and said as early as the  time of the party congress in Muenster, that the vote of the  party congress is binding on me. We voted against the bugging  campaign with a two-thirds majority in Muenster. Nevertheless,  there can be different opinions on such a difficult legal and  political question.    [Lambeck] Theo Waigel has demanded that the FDP vote for the  CDU/CSU presidential candidate, Roman Herzog, in the decisive  ballots in the Federal Assembly....    [Kinkel] After every ballot, we, the FDP, will get together  in the Federal Assembly and consider what we will do in the next  ballot. I am against continuous speculations before the  presidential election.    [Lambeck] Do you still see any chance for Mrs.  Hamm-Bruecher?    [Kinkel] Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher was chosen as candidate for  the presidential elections with overwhelming support in the FDP.  I can say only again and again: She is not a mere pawn that  can be exchanged at will.    [Lambeck] The coalition is again trying to find a compromise  on nursing-care insurance with the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD]. Do you also see a chance for the desired  solution if, for the time being, only one holiday is abolished?    [Kinkel] We indeed want to make a new attempt at mediation  on the basis of a solution for the nursing-care insurance that  includes outpatients and inpatients. From the point of view of  the CDU/CSU and the FDP, a solution for outpatients and  inpatients is only possible by compensation that involves the  abolition of two holidays.    [Lambeck] The CDU/CSU is now demanding that the SPD clarify  events concerning the pasts of the Social Democratic  politicians, Wehner and Wienand, which have now become known.  Might the case of Herbert Wehner be the undoing of some people  in the present SPD leadership?    [Kinkel] I am of the opinion that, in the first place, the  SPD has to be committed to clarifying this and taking an  interest in it. On the other hand, I think there should be no  mudslinging in the election campaign. I cannot assess whether  this might result in any problems for SPD politicians who are  still alive. I am interested in the historical question of  whether German politics was influenced in an unacceptable way by  the former GDR or the Soviet Union in the postwar period.    [Lambeck] In view of the imponderabilities in the East, may  Germany continue to cut its defense budget constantly? Should  the Bundeswehr not actually get more money as an insurance  policy for politics?    [Kinkel] The Bundeswehr is a very important factor in our  society. It has to be excluded from the quarrels between the  parties. It has to be excluded from the permanent criticism and  fumbling. It cannot be right that we say we have a certain  amount of money and we can afford a certain amount of Bundeswehr  for it. It has to be the other way around: In the changed world  situation we need a Bundeswehr that can cope with new tasks.  This concept has to be developed and then the money needed for  the concept must be made available.    [Lambeck] In your opinion, does the coalition have a  convincing concept for the Bundeswehr or does this not exist yet?    [Kinkel] The world and thus the tasks of the Bundeswehr have  changed. Only think of the future tasks that hopefully also  will be possible for us after the Basic Law amendment, that is,  to keep and to make peace. In addition, there are preventive  and humanitarian measures. Indeed we need a new concept.  Volker Ruehe must present one. As for the rest, I am convinced  that the Bundeswehr's personnel strength of 370,000 men should  be maintained.    [Lambeck] What do you think of the proposal by your party  friend, Juergen Moellemann, to limit the chancellor's term to  eight years?    [Kinkel] Nothing at all.</p>

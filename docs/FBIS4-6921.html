			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, 24 April -- There are again growing  demands for restrictions on the total volume of Japanese cars,  including those produced in Europe, within the European Union  [EU]. In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter,  Association of European Automobile Manufacturers (ACEA)  Secretary General Lenier [name as published] indicated that ACEA  will ask the European Commission and other organizations  concerned to take restrictive measures, saying: "The share of  Japanese cars in the European market should be frozen." Similar  opinions have also been voiced in the European Parliament. The  1991 Japan-EU agreement does not impose restrictions upon  Japanese cars produced in Europe. However, this issue is likely  to remain a controversial problem in the future, because the  European auto industry has been faced with business difficulties  due to the prolonged economic slump.    The new ACEA chairman and secretary general took office this  year. In his explanation of ACEA policies under the new  leaders, Lenier touched on the Japanese car issue, and said:  "The total volume of Japanese cars, including not only cars  which are directly imported from Japan, but also those produced  in Europe and imported from third countries (such as the United  States) should be frozen." The ACEA has also presented this  demand to the European Commission.    In accordance with the Japan-EU auto agreement, Japan has  restricted its exports at a rate higher than the overall drop in  European car sales. For example, in 1993 Japan set the quota of  direct exports at 980,000 units, which was 18.5 percent lower  than that of the previous year.</p>

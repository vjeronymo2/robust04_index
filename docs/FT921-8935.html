			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Premier aims to shape a new model for Sweden: David Marsh and Robert Taylor interview the Swedish prime minister MR CARL BILDT, Sweden's Conservative prime minister, is a 42-year-old intellectual who combines the looks of a technocratic college boy with the zeal of a revolutionary. The 'Swedish model' forged through 60 years of Social Democrat-dominated social welfare and state corporatism is dead. Mr Bildt, in office since October, is presiding over a free-market programme of economic and social reform designed to restore the country's lost dynamism. He is trying to break the mould in foreign policy, too. On his way to the US for an official visit next week, he observes drily that Americans have grown used to Swedish government leaders 'aligning themselves with revolutionary tendencies in the third world'. But Mr Bildt wants to end Sweden's semi-isolation from the rest of Europe and even talks of his country becoming an 'active player' in collective European security. During an interview this week, Mr Bildt did not hide the size of the challenges. Weathering its second successive year of economic contraction, Sweden is undergoing its worst recession since the 1920s. Traditionally-low Swedish unemployment is set to rise sharply this year from 3 to 5 per cent. He insists there can be no turning back on his ambitious plans for cutting taxes, privatising state industry and restoring incentives for wealth creation. After two decades in the economic doldrums, his objective is to put Sweden on track for a 3 per cent-plus growth rate from the mid-1990s onwards. Mr Bildt likes to quote a phrase made famous in Britain during the rule of Mrs Margaret Thatcher - a politician he admires far less than German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 'There is no alternative,' he expounds. 'Look at the other possible ways. Subsidising industry - no-one thinks it works. We tried devaluation - that was wrong. The Social Democrats now are proposing more taxes and more spending. They don't seriously believe in it themselves.' Heading a four-party government without a parliamentary majority, Mr Bildt has surprised even his friends by his skill in easing coalition strains and giving his administration a sense of purpose. He has so far lived up to his election promises to promote budgetary austerity. And he plans to confront the power of Sweden's huge public service sector with radical plans to curb spending and improve efficiency. Most striking of all, he is on a collision course with Volvo, Sweden's largest company, over its plan to take over Procordia, the diversified conglomerate jointly owned by the state and the Gothenburg-based carmaker. Sweden's industrialists have welcomed Mr Bildt. But by rejecting Volvo's bid for a company which is high on the government's list of privatisation candidates, Mr Bildt has sent a signal to the boardrooms that the old style of doing business is no longer acceptable. Chastising Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman, for trying to push the deal through without full consultation, Mr Bildt remarks: 'We do things somewhat differently under this government.' Mr Bildt's missionary enthusiasm extends to the goal of European integration. He envisages Sweden eventually leading a 'Nordic revival' - both by entering the European Community and strengthening ties to the emerging democracies of the east, particularly the Baltic states and the St Petersburg region of Russia. Sweden's change of heart on Europe was signalled by the previous Social Democrat administration, which applied to join last July. Mr Bildt has kept up the momentum to make Sweden a full member by January 1 1995. This involves a painful period of adjustment - and the tightest of timetables. Constitutional requirements mean that the country needs an agreement on accession by December 1993, nine months before the next general election. Otherwise, the earliest date for EC membership would be delayed until 1998. The government wants early membership of the European Monetary System - perhaps as soon as the end of 1993. Mr Bildt brushes aside the suggestion that Swedish voters will see his pro-Europe policies as the basic cause of rising unemployment - an outcome which could cause rejection of EC membership in the referendum planned for 1994. 'I don't see the risk they will blame Europe. They will blame the government,' he declares. Staying true to his European convictions, he adds: 'And that will be a relief.'</p>

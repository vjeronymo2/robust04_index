			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Blow to telecoms stocks NEWS that the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) had granted the first licence to enable an outsider to compete in the international call traffic market against such companies as BT and Mercury (the telecoms division of Cable &amp; Wireless) hit shares of both the big UK telecoms groups. Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W) shares were particularly unsettled and fell 32, or 5.2 per cent, to 582p, making the stock the third worst performer in the Footsie. Turnover in C &amp; W was a heavy 5.6m shares. The stock was also affected by profit-taking after recent outperformance, dealers said. Analysts said ACC, the US group, had been granted the first 'simple international resale' licence, covering the UK and Australia, Canada and Sweden. Analysts said they did not expect any immediate reductions in earnings forecasts for C &amp; W but that the ACC move would have a greater impact on C &amp; W than BT because of C &amp; W's higher revenue from its international business. 'This is confirmation of the real impact of greater competition in the telecoms business,' said one analyst. BT shares, hit by recent reductions in earnings and dividend forecasts, dipped 6 more to 353 1/2 p on 5.7m traded. The decline was cushioned by optimism generated by the launch of a new marketing initiative - Lifetime - by its Cellnet cellular phone business. Market enthusiasm for Lifetime, which offers a lower tariff to cellular customers, boosted sentiment in Securicor, the minority shareholder in Cellnet. Securicor 'A' stock rose 5 to 559p. Vodafone, Cellnet's arch rival, settled 7 higher at 335p, still boosted by a broker's switch recommendation. Granada wanted Leisure and media group Granada continued its strong run following recent meetings with analysts. Yesterday, it was the turn of SG Warburg and Carr Kitcat and Aitken to recommend the stock; the shares jumped 12 to 258p on hefty volume of 5.7m. Sentiment was also improved by news that two directors had made substantial share purchases this week, prior to Granada going into its closed season. Chief executive Mr Gerry Robinson spent around Pounds 750,000 on 300,000 shares, while the head of Granada Television, Mr Charles Allen, bought a further 85,000 for Pounds 200,000. Mr Jeffrey Harwood at Carr's said that Granada, which has been able to curtail expenditure on Sky TV and elsewhere in the group, is now 'turning into a formidable cash generator.' Enterprise Oil and Lasmo attracted strong support early in the session, much of it said to have emanated from the US. Enterprise closed 6 higher at 412p, but Lasmo failed to hold on to an initial gain and settled a net 1 1/2 off at 164p. Dreadful quarterly figures from Continental Corporation, one of the big US insurance groups, were the trigger for a sharp upturn in the UK composite insurances. A reduced dividend and heavy losses resulting from Hurricane damage prompted insurance analysts to take the view that US insurance rates would have to be increased, thereby signalling a significant increase in international rates. The prospect of higher premiums, plus the strengthening of the composites' balance sheets from the big gains in the equity market in recent sessions, saw share prices race higher. Commercial Union, with its minimal exposure to domestic mortgage indemnity losses, ran up 16 to 535p, closely followed by General Accident, 12 firmer at 521p. Sun Alliance edged up 7 to 310p and Royal Insurance hardend to 185p, the last-named after exceptionally heavy turnover of 5.9m. Insurance brokers shared in the upsurge led by Willis Corroon which put on 20 to 208p and Sedgwick, 12 firmer at 145p. US-led selling in the pharmaceutical sector continued, fuelled on Wall Street by disappointing data on a drug marketed by Merck. Smithkline retreated 13 to 481p, Wellcome 13 to 950p and Glaxo 9 to 770p. Waste management groups suffered as Leigh Interests issued a profits warning due to a downturn in business. The shares collapsed 51 to 175p. Several stocks in the transport sector were in demand. Among them, BAA moved 8 ahead to 715p, and P&amp;O improved 3 to 395p. Tiphook gained 8 to 278p. Shares in tobacco machinery maker Molins jumped 18 to 319p, after the company reported an improvement in interim profits from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 7.2m, and raised the dividend by 50 percent to 4.5p. Investors favoured Vosper Thorneycroft, and the shares jumped 5 to 394p. Uncertainty following the early retirement of the chief executive at wire rope maker Bridon upset the shares and they closed 10 down at 48p. Following a bear raid on Thursday, Allied Lyons came under renewed pressure as some trader's decided the brewery group's recent outperformance was overdone. The shares slumped 27 to 611p. A similar fate befell Whitbread, the 'A' shares falling 15 to 450p, with UBS Phillips and Drew said to be particularly negative. Meanwhile, Kleinwort Benson reinforced its buy stance on Greenalls, the shares climbing 9 to 394p. Food manufacturer Northern Foods continued a successful round of presentations to brokers. The shares put on 4 to 283p. BZW advised clients to take profits in Tate and Lyle, the shares declining 18 to 342p. County NatWest was also targeting Tate's, reportedly advising a switch into United Biscuits, up 6 to 316p. Abbey National moved up to 320p early in the session, still boosted by the BZW buy recommendation, but quickly ran out of steam and fell away to 311p, a net fall of 6. Barclays attracted fresh and sizeable buying interest, reflecting the substantial shift in sentiment in the sector since the UK withdrawal from the ERM and the cut in UK interest rates. Barclays shares settled 8 higher at 374p on 10m traded. NatWest, on the other hand, slipped 8 to 365p. SG Warburg, a strong performer at the start of the week when the shares responded to the big increase in stockmarket activity and also to speculation of a possible merger involving the bank, eased 2 to 534p. Kleinwort Benson hardened 3 to 296p. United Newspapers continued to bask in the glow of its well-recived interim results on Thursday, with several brokers producing positive notes on the publishing group. The shares added 5 to 430p. UBS Phillips and Drew, the UK based securities house, was said to be recommending clients switch into United out of Pearson, off 11 at 387p. Solid results from Central Television sent the shares ahead 70 to 1445p. However, disappointing first half results from HTV knocked the share price by 14 to 27p. The aerospace sector was particularly busy. Turnover in British Aerospace, which reported interim figures below the worst market expectations earlier this week, reached 6m in strong two-way business. The shares held up relatively well easing only a penny to 125p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (92).

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] All sorts of initiatives are flying around to try  and bring peace back to Lesotho. For two weeks opposing  factions of the army, one from the Makoanyane barracks and the  other from defense headquarters, have been fighting each other  around the capital, Maseru. It all began with a pay claim, but  there have been fears of it developing into a coup against Ntsu  Mokhehle's elected government. Yesterday a meeting of southern  African leaders in Gaborone was talking of a task force to be  sent by Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. They could find  the door shut. But today, Commonwealth representatives have  been meeting the two sides in Maseru. The foreign minister was  there too, and it seems some progress was made. On the line to  Maseru Robin White asked Mamelo Maurison of the MORNING STAR  newspaper what the outcome of the meetings had been.    [Begin recording] [Maurison] Well, the outcome of the  meetings is that the foreign informed the Makoanyane side of the  army that they should nominate 10 representatives who will seat  for extensive discussions with the 10 from RLDF [Royal Swazi  Defense Force] tomorrow under the chairmanship of the  Commonwealth team.    [White] And they will try and flush out some kind of deal  tomorrow?    [Maurison] The foreign minister said they should be  prepared,  they should prepare their agenda, including the 100-percent  demand and everything that worries them to be in the agenda for  tomorrow's meeting and that all these complaints will be looked  at with the assistance of the Commonwealth team.    [White] And I gather that some kind of promise was made that  there will be no action taken against those that have been  causing trouble?    [Maurison] Yes, the foreign minister said he was passing the  message from the prime minister, who is also minister of  defense, that no recriminations will be taken against any of the  soldiers for any of their actions in the last few days, and that  they must rest assured that nothing will happen to anyone of  them.    [White] Even to those who killed people?    [Maurison] He said whatever has happened, nothing will  happen.    [White] So, is it your feeling that they might be on the way  now to some kind of deal?    [Maurison] It will depend largely on whether the two sides  will indeed appoint their representatives, and whether the  representatives, when they seat under the auspices of the  Commonwealth, will be willing to talk out their differences, but  by the look of things, it may take some bit of time.

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Pressure on Patten eases as two unions lift boycott Pressure on Mr John Patten, the education secretary, eased yesterday when two teachers' unions told members to lift their boycott of national curriculum tests in England and Wales. The decisions by the ATL and the NASUWT mean that this year's tests are virtually certain to take place. They would also isolate the NUT, the largest teaching union. Last year all three unions boycotted the tests. This forced the government to abandon its planned school league tables based on test results, and to order a review of the curriculum by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority. This year's tests have been halved in length, Sir Ron says. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, predicted that the union would continue its boycott after it had finished consulting its members this month. He said: 'The decisions of the ATL and the NASUWT will break the unity established last year. That is unfortunate. It will create confusion among teachers and parents.' Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'The executive decided to lift the boycott in recognition of the enormous amount of progress that has been made.' Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, said: 'Original concern with the national curriculum tests, later expressed in the ballot of ATL members, was centred upon excessive workload. It is absolutely clear that the tests are now to be shorter and easier to administer.' The ATL and the NASUWT are recommending that the boycott of teachers' assessment of pupils connected to the curriculum should continue where this is 'excessive'. This centres around the 'tick-lists' of statements of attainment which teachers must compile, amounting to about 20,000 reports per school year for a typical teacher. But Sir Ron swiftly indicated that he did not believe that this would be a serious point of contention. He said he urged teachers to 'burn their ticklists' and avoid assessments which were plainly unnecessary, although he made it clear that teachers should still carry out enough assessment to report to parents. The Department for Education welcomed the decisions.</p>

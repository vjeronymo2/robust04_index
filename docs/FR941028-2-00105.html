Soo is wholly owned by Soo Line Corporation (SLC), a noncarrier holding company. SLC is wholly owned by Canadian Pacific (U.S.) Holdings Inc. (Holdings), a noncarrier holding company. Holdings is in turn wholly owned by Canadian Pacific Limited (CP), d/b/a CP Rail System, which owns and operates approximately 17,650 miles of rail in Canada and the United States. CP and Holdings also control the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway Company d/b/a CP Rail System, which operates in the northeastern United States and has no involvement in the proposed transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  BN, also a class I railroad, operates more than 25,000 route miles in 26 states. BN is wholly owned by Burlington Northern, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  BN and Soo jointly own DRI, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a class III switching and terminal railroad which owns and operates approximately 45 route miles between Clinton, IA and East Moline, IL, via Davenport, IA (known as the Quad Cities area).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> BN and Soo each own 14,997 shares of DRI common stock. Three current or former BN employees and three current or former Soo employees each own one share of DRI stock. Thus, BN and Soo each own and control 15,000 shares of DRI stock. BN has agreed to arrange for the sale to DRI of the three shares of DRI common stock owned by current and former BN employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The transactions described in this application will be consummated with internally generated funds and do not involve the issuance of any new securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  BN and Soo expect to benefit from administrative cost savings associated with eliminating DRI as a separate entity. Applicants aver that the allocation of DRI's lines between BN and Soo reflect, in part, their operational patterns in the Quad Cities area. They have concluded that it would be more efficient for each carrier to handle its own traffic on the DRI lines with a contractual allocation of the cost of maintenance of the lines. Transfer of the DRI lines, they say, will permit the efficient consolidation of former DRI switching operations with the existing operations of BN and Soo in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  With the elimination of DRI, Soo and BN plan to establish a direct interchange in the Quad Cities area. Industries currently switched by DRI for BN or Soo will now be served directly by those carriers. Applicants note that no shipper or industry will lose rail service or experience any reduction in rail transportation options as a result of these transactions, and shippers on the East Moline-Albany line currently served by one railroad will be served by two railroads. Applicants anticipate no discontinuances or abandonments in connection with or as a result of the proposed transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Applicants contend that the transactions will not adversely impact BN or Soo employees; however, DRI's current 25-man workforce will be abolished before or upon consummation of the proposed transactions. On July 20, 1994, DRI offered a voluntary severance package to employees with 10 or more years of service. Management employees received a separate severance package. Applicants recognize that, for each transaction for which approval is sought, the appropriate level of labor protection is that set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979), as clarified in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wilmington Term.

Upon consummation BN will own and operate DRI's rail line between Davenport, IA and East Moline, IL, over which BN and Soo already operate and over which Soo will continue to operate pursuant to BN's grant back of trackage rights. BN will own and operate Soo's rail line between East Moline and Albany, IL, over which Soo will also continue to operate pursuant to BN's grant back of trackage rights. Soo will own and operate the joint BN/Soo line at Clinton, IA and the DRI line between Davenport and Clinton. Soo and BN already operate over both lines, and BN will continue to operate over both lines pursuant to Soo's grant back of trackage rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  It does not appear that the transactions contemplated by applicants will have any anticompetitive effects or will result in a major market extension for any applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

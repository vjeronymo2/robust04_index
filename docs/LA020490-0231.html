			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIRM'S SOFTWARE OFFERS ELECTRONIC EFFICIENCY FOR TAXING TIMES;  </P> <P> TAXES: SOFTVIEW INC., AN OXNARD MAKER OF TAX PREPARATION SOFTWARE, HOPES TO  CASH IN ON THE IRS PUSH TOWARD ON-LINE TAX FILING.  </P> <P> Kathleen Lane, president of Softview Inc., an Oxnard computer software company,  is wagering that her company will make a bundle on the Internal Revenue  Service's campaign to encourage taxpayers to file their tax forms  electronically, instead of by mail.  </P> <P> Until now, Softview, with $3.8 million in sales last year, has grown nicely by  becoming the only company that makes a complete tax preparation software kit  that works on the popular Apple Macintosh home computer. Its tax software,  called MacInTax, costs about $100.  </P> <P> Tax preparation software is a promising field, with more than 100 firms in the  business. Instead of taking their taxes to an accountant, people with  Macintoshes can use MacInTax to calculate their debt to Uncle Sam. The software  puts simulated tax forms on the computer screen, calculates an individual's  taxes based on information that is punched in on the keyboard, and prints out  finished tax forms, which the taxpayer then mails to the IRS.  </P> <P> Softview is hoping to double its sales this year by getting into the electronic  tax-filing business. The IRS, in hopes of becoming more efficient, is urging  taxpayers to file their forms electronically. In 1989, about 1.2 million  taxpayers filed their forms electronically, but the IRS hopes to lure about 100  million people by 1994. The IRS says electronic tax filings cut down on errors:  About 16% of tax returns filed through the mail have mistakes, compared to  about 3% of electronic filings. Part of the reason, the IRS says, is the  electronically filed reports are more likely to have their math  computer-checked.  </P> <P> Why would taxpayers bother with electronic tax filings? Simple: It might speed  up their tax refunds. A spokesman for the IRS said electronic filings could  reduce the turnaround time for a refund to four weeks, from the current wait of  up to three months for those who file by mail. The IRS has only begun to  experiment with electronic filing for taxpayers who owe the government money  because of the difficulty of taxpayers making electronic payments.  </P> <P> Softview has teamed up with a San Diego firm called InstaTax, which for a $30  fee, will take the information sent by Softview's customers and have it  electronically dispatched to the IRS. InstaTax has been transmitting tax forms  to the IRS since last year, whether they were calculated using tax preparation  software or just the old calculator method.  </P> <P> Softview's deal with InstaTax calls for it to receive a percentage of that $30  transaction fee. And Lane said, "Electronic filing will be a big impetus to tax  preparation software. You have to key it in somehow."  </P> <P> As an extra service for electronic tax filing, for another $70 or so, InstaTax  will arrange an advance tax refund of up to $3,000. The advance refund is  handled by a banking subsidiary of Sears that lends taxpayers the amount they  expect in a refund from the IRS -- so taxpayers get the refund in about three  days instead of about four weeks. When the IRS refund is sent out, it goes to  the Sears subsidiary, which deducts the "refund anticipation loan" and sends  the rest, if any, to the taxpayer.  </P> <P> InstaTax, which last year transmitted about 9,000 forms to the IRS, expects to  transmit as many as 9,000 forms each day until the April 15 tax deadline.  </P> <P> But Softview isn't alone among software companies looking to capitalize on the  electronic filing of tax forms. Softview's biggest competitor in tax software  for home use is San Diego based ChipSoft Inc., which makes TurboTax, a program  for IBM-compatible personal computers. Two years ago, ChipSoft began to sell  software that allows tax accountants to reformat their tax forms for electronic  filing by a Green Bay, Wis. company called Nelco.  </P> <P> But while ChipSoft and Nelco specialize in tax preparation professionals,  InstaTax President Donald Cook said his company is the only one in the country  offering people who do their own taxes the opportunity to file electronically.  </P> <P> In part, that is because ChipSoft is not as excited about the electronic tax  market as Softview and InstaTax. "It's an immature industry," said Rik Barnes,  ChipSoft's marketing director. "I think it's real hard to predict how fast it's  going to grow." If the market grows fast though, Barnes said, ChipSoft won't  have any problem getting a bigger share of it.  </P> <P> ChipSoft already dominates the tax software market for IBM-compatible  computers, and projected last year that it would do more than $10 million in  sales in 1989.  </P> <P> But Softview has been thriving as well and is the leading seller of tax  software for Macintosh computers. According to MacUser magazine, Softview is  the only maker of software that by itself allows users to do their taxes on a  Macintosh. Other companies make software that can be used to supplement  "spreadsheet" programs, making them work like tax preparation software.  </P> <P> The InstaTax and Softview electronic tax filing works like this: Taxpayers who  have completed their own tax forms will mail or send a facsimile of the return  to InstaTax. Then InstaTax, using Softview software, key-punches the tax  returns into a computer. InstaTax will ship the tax data to another firm, which  electronically relays the information to the IRS.  </P> <P> Softview owes its existence, at least in part, to a $4,000 mistake by Burroughs  Corp. In 1984, Burroughs paid one of its programmers, Susan Morgan, about  $4,000 more than she expected in maternity benefits. Morgan decided to use the  money to buy a Macintosh home computer. (She eventually repaid Burroughs).  </P> <P> Morgan's husband, Michael Morgan, a programmer for Northrop Corp., came up with  the idea of Macintosh software that would display and print out realistic  versions of IRS forms. After he had worked on the idea for a few months, he  quit his job at Northrop and worked on the software full time.  </P> <P> In the next few months, Susan Morgan made the rounds of computer clubs and  persuaded members to invest about $80,000 in the Morgans' idea through limited  partnerships. Meanwhile, the Morgans raised $20,000 to $30,000 from relatives.  That was enough to produce 500 sets of the software to sell in the spring of  1985. After several years as president, Susan Morgan brought Lane on as  president of Softview in 1988 so she and her husband could concentrate on  software development.  </P></p>

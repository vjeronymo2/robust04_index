			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CABARET &amp; JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> DEHAVEN DELIVERS STANDARDS AT CINEGRILL  </P> <P> Talk about support groups! Gloria DeHaven, an actress-singer whose credits  stretch back to the golden days of MGM musicals, had enough encouragement  during the opening of her new act at the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill on  Wednesday night to reassure a whole chorus line of performers.  </P> <P> It started with an introduction by Lucille Ball -- who looked fit and  vivacious, bubbling with the wit and good nature that have made her an  entertainment legend. DeHaven then arrived on stage, buoyed by the enthusiastic  applause of an audience that virtually sparkled with images of a legendary  Hollywood past.  </P> <P> A bit nervous, even in the face of such unquestioning adulation, DeHaven  launched into a set of songs associated, for the most part, with Hollywood  musicals of the '40s and '50s. She sang effectively on a couple of numbers from  her first musical film, "Best Foot Forward" (in which Ball was the star) and  finally began to relax when she dug into a medley of ballad standards.  </P> <P> DeHaven's voice did not have the sound of a particularly serviceable  instrument, and one suspects that she pushed it hard enough to have a problem  with hoarseness after the performance. She is, however, a superb actress, and  more than compensated for her musical deficiencies with a vivid talent for  telling a story.  </P> <P> DeHaven was at her best, in fact, during those moments -- her singing of "Who's  Sorry Now" was a particularly good example -- in which she came through less as  a personality and more as a person, sharply recalling the sights and the sounds  of a fascinating era in show business history.  </P> <P> The final, and perhaps most important element in DeHaven's support group was  provided by the estimable William Roy, a pianist-singer-musical director and  all-around helpmate whose accompaniments were a nightclub singer's dream of  on-stage heaven.  </P> <P> DeHaven continues at Cinegrill through Saturday night and returns Wednesday  through March 4.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Telia pushes earnings up to SKr3.95bn Telia, Sweden's state-owned telecommunications company, yesterday reported profits after financial items more than doubled in 1993 to SKr3.95bn (Dollars 500m) from SKr1.8bn in 1992. Sales were up marginally to SKr35.34bn from SKr35.29bn. The increase in profits was put down chiefly to a fall in investments, which were down by 7 per cent to SKr7.17bn, lower debt costs and a drop in restructuring costs. The company said the number of subscribers fell slightly for the first time, due to the recession in Sweden. However, telephone traffic rose by almost 5 per cent, due chiefly to fast-growing mobile telephone usage. Telia became a commercially-structured, independently-run company in the middle of last year, having previously been a directly state-run concern called Televerket. It faces competition in international telephone traffic, mobile telephone networks and the supply of telecoms equipment. The present centre-right coalition government intends to begin privatisation as early as next year or 1996 if it wins September's general election. However, the opposition Social Democrats, currently leading in the opinion polls, are against any sell-off.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Alojz Englis, the president of the Confederation of  Trade Unions, has sent a letter to Finance Minister Rudolf  Filkus, drawing his attention to the violation of trade union  freedoms as outlined in the accord of the International Labor  Organization on the freedom of association and the protection of  trade unions' right of association. In his letter, Alojz Englis  stressed that the Finance Ministry fundamentally violated trade  union rights by a decision calling on the trade unions that are  members of the confederation to present their account books  outlining their assets to appropriate tax bodies by 31 March.  Englis pointed out that he will inform the international trade  union headquarters about this, and, if the Finance Ministry does  not change its stance, he will forward an official complaint to  the International Labor Organization about the violation of  trade union rights in Slovakia.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Commercial Union cuts losses to Pounds 18m COMMERCIAL Union, one of the largest UK composite insurers, yesterday announced an improved performance in the first six months of 1992 with pre-tax losses falling to Pounds 18.1m compared with Pounds 26.3m at the halfway stage last year. CU posted a Pounds 2.3m profit in the second quarter, in spite of a Pounds 15m loss due to the IRA bombing its London headquarters in April. First-half figures also indicated that CU, the most highly rated of the UK composites, is continuing to increase premium income at a faster rate than its rivals. Overall underwriting losses fell to Pounds 205.2m from Pounds 228.3m, with UK underwriting losses Pounds 95.4m against a loss of Pounds 104.3m. Investment income (net of loan interest) declined to Pounds 129.4m from Pounds 145.1m. Life profits fell to Pounds 50.7m from Pounds 53.7m while associated undertakings' earnings amounted to Pounds 7m, up from Pounds 3.2m. Post-tax operating losses of Pounds 23.7m (up from Pounds 21.5m) were offset by realised investment gains of Pounds 182.4m (against Pounds 36.4m). The interim dividend was unchanged at 9.25p per share. There was a loss per share of 5.4p, against 5p last time. Mr Peter Ward, managing director UK, denied CU was 'pursuing an aggressive policy' but accepted CU was 'writing new business when some of our competitors are shedding business'. Premium income from UK motor insurance rose 52.9 per cent to Pounds 102m, reflecting rate increases and an 12 per cent increase in policyholders. Overall UK premium income rose 19.2 per cent to Pounds 709.9m. Life premiums grew 42 per cent to Pounds 272.2m, reflecting strong sales of a new single premium bond. Mr Ward said CU was prioritising sales of motor policies to drivers aged over 30 and preferred to limit cover to named drivers. Mr Tom Bennett, analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, said: 'The UK account is going ahead at a hell of a rate.' CU has benefited from its relatively low exposure to domestic mortgage indemnity policies, which compensate lenders when they make losses on the sale of repossessed homes. The group has also been helped by its relatively low investment exposure in the UK equity market. At Pounds 1.2bn, shareholders funds were only marginally down on the year-end figure of Pounds 1.21bn although assets were boosted by a Pounds 100m preference share issue in May. CU's solvency (net assets as a percentage of non-life premiums) was 42.5 per cent, compared with 44 per cent on December 31. Lex, Page 14; Market, Page 32</p>

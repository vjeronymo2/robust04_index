			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Japan should allow domestic  telecommunications firms to provide both domestic and overseas  services, a government advisory panel said Tuesday [18 January].    In a report submitted to Posts and Telecommunications  Minister Takenori Kanzaki, the Telecommunications Council also  recommended scrapping restrictions on foreign ownership of  telecommunications concerns.    The ministry is expected to implement the proposals as early  as this summer.    Under the existing rules, domestic telecommunications firms  are prohibited from offering both domestic and overseas services  at the same time regarding satellite communications. They also  limit foreign ownership of telecommunications companies to less  than one-third.    But Japan has been under growing pressure from abroad to  relax rules on foreign telecommunications concerns, as foreign  enterprises step up satellite telecommunications services.</p>

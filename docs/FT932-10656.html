			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Minister rejects Creditanstalt bid THE AUSTRIAN finance minister has rejected a proposal by the Raiffeisen co-operative bank group to acquire a controlling interest in Creditanstalt, the country's second-largest commercial bank. Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the minister, said the bid was badly prepared and that its leaders were unwilling to reveal the sources of their funds. Mr Lacina said he was not willing to play 'children's games' with them. The Austrian government has a 70 per cent voting stake in Creditanstalt. The bid, launched late last week, has been vigorously opposed by the chairman of Creditanstalt's supervisory board, its executive board and employees' representatives. Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, executive chairman, said the terms of the bid - a reverse takeover financed by roughly Sch5bn (Dollars 449m) in debt - would have undermined Creditanstalt's capital base. He also said that many Creditanstalt commercial customers were upset because co-operatives associated with the Raiffeisen were among their main competitors. The bid was seen in Austrian financial circles as a largely political gesture, an attempt to put together a banking group with close links to the conservative Austrian People's Party that would rival Bank Austria in size. Bank Austria, itself the product of a merger of two banks in September 1991, has close ties with the Social Democratic Party. Yesterday's outburst by Mr Lacina followed a meeting with Mr Schmidt-Chiari and Mr Christian Konrad and Mr Klaus Liebscher, chairman and director general respectively of the Raiffeisen Zentralbank. The outcome leaves Mr Rudolf Gruber, deputy chairman of the Creditanstalt supervisory board, in an awkward position. It has emerged that Mr Gruber, who is also chief executive of Energie Versorgung Niederosterreich, an energy utility, was involved in preparing the Raiffeisen bid, but did not inform his colleagues at Creditanstalt. Mr Schmidt-Chiari denied suggestions that Creditanstalt, which has had to make heavy loan loss provisions in the past two years, was looking for a white knight. However, the government has been searching for strategic partners for the bank, and last autumn there were contacts with General Electric of the US. Mr Schmidt-Chiari has said he would prefer to see the government's stake dispersed among institutional investors. 'Certainly, we can stay independent,' he said, pointing to a 47 per cent rise in operating profits in the first quarter.</p>

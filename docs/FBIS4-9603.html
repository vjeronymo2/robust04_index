			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rasim Delic, commander in chief of the Army </F> of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Rasim Cerimagic on 15 April 1994;  place not given: "The People and the State Are Surviving"]    [Text] [Delic] The Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina [the B-H  Army] has not allowed the aggressor to occupy our country, to  destroy the Bosniak people and others who stood up for Bosnia-  Herzegovina as their motherland as well. The B-H Army  militarily defeated the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], and  brought it to the negotiating table. Given the mediation of the  United States, those efforts have resulted in the federation of  Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is what the  Bosnian delegation proposed at the negotiations a year ago. In  addition to these results and the enlargement of the free  territory, the B-H Army has also been cleaning up its own ranks,  has grown stronger in terms of organization, and has finally  reached the stage when those who are familiar with the results  are calling it a real army. That is a great compliment for us.  We know best our weaknesses. There is a plenty of room for us  to strengthen the organization and introduce even more order and  discipline.    We have a vision of how the B-H Army will look in the  federation, and what it will be like in the future. Of course,  all those plans are supposed to be financially, morally, and  politically covered. We are continuing to work on  self-filtration, because there are still those who use their  uniforms to cover up some completely different goals, be it  criminal activities, intelligence gathering for the enemy, or  their ambitions for military careers. We have to understand  that the war is still going on, that the B-H Army is here to  protect the people and the state, so one ought to help it in  every way for the army to become even more than it has been so  far: a guarantee enabling our government to discuss the future  of Bosnia-Herzegovina on equal terms, thereby making it possible  to achieve a just peace and freedom for this country. The B-H  Army is not an alien self-creation, it arose from and is still a  part of our people, to whom I want to express my gratitude for  everything it has done for the army.    [Cerimagic] This is a response of General Rasim Delic to the  question of what strategic goals our army has achieved in the  past two years of the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina by  the Serbo-Montenegrin aggressor and the HVO. Although it was  Army Day, the day of its foundation, that was the only question  related to the achievements reached in the past two years. The  severity with which Gorazde is being attacked, as well as the  attacks on other territories, determined the content of the  interview with the commander in chief of the B-H Army, which  took place on 15 April 1994.    [Cerimagic] The global strategic goal of the Serbian  aggressor is the creation of a 30-km belt on the Bosnian side of  the Drina River, while Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica are three  enclaves that stand in the way of the Serbs' accomplishment of  their ancient dream. What induced the aggressor to take the  risk of NATO intervention at such an unfavorable moment, and  attack Gorazde, even though it was beleaguered and represented  no serious military threat?    [Delic] At this stage the creation of a 30-km belt on the  Bosnian bank of the Drina is certainly not their global  strategic goal. Because, by surrounding those three enclaves,  the aggressor has created conditions to solve a long-term  problem by pressuring citizens to leave the region. This is  from the aggressor's point of view, of course. However, at this  stage, the goal of the Serbs is to ease the pressure that is  being exerted on them. They want to turn the existing  occupation into a factual-legal state at the negotiating table.  By carrying out attacks against the free, that is, safe zones  of Gorazde and Bihac, which the Serbs know are very difficult to  help in any concrete way, because they are surrounded, and that  we will demand intervention by the international community, they  are trying to legitimize their conquests. When we turn to the  United Nations to demand protection and the return to the  initial state on the ground, the Serbs then demand a lasting  cease-fire, and the positioning of UNPROFOR troops between the  warring factions, as they put it. Thereby the situation on the  ground would be frozen, with Bosnia-Herzegovina in the same  situation as Cyprus or Lebanon. The situation on the ground  would turn into a lasting occupation, while in that way the  aggressor would establish its para-state. That is a Serb goal,  and for that reason, despite the strong international political  pressure, and now even military, they have taken the risk of  foreign intervention.    [Cerimagic] There are opinions, to put it metaphorically,  that the Serbs in pounding Gorazde are not destroying the town  alone, but rather the Bosniak-Croatian federation.    [Delic] Certainly, the Washington Agreement and the military  steps that have been taken in the field have caused alarm among  the Serb aggressors, and probably also fear. This is because in  reality the federation means a deployment of large numbers of  troops jointly by the B-H Army and the HVO. As for the HVO,  there are no guarantees that they would be engaged in any  further fighting, but the B-H Army, having saved forces that  were deployed against the HVO until yesterday, has created the  conditions for taking up offensives for the legitimate  liberation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The remarks about the B-H  Army being active on the front are absurd, because the only  legitimate force is the B-H Army, and it is only the deployment  of B-H Army troops that is legitimate in any part of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has a right to take action on any part  of the territory, to liberate it from the Serb-Montenegrin  occupation. Therefore, the aggressor is doing everything to  prevent the implementation of the Bosniak-Croatian federation.    [Cerimagic] How do you comment on the statement by war  criminal Ratko Mladic, that, in his opinion, there will be even  more raids by Phantoms, so that any aircraft attacking Serb  positions will be downed?    [Delic] Well, he is probably frank in saying so, because,  according to our intelligence, the Serbs are not giving up their  goal, that is, to cleanse the right bank of the Drina, and  perhaps even more than that. For that reason he is implying new  raids by Phantoms....    Mladic's threat that they would fire on any object flying in  the airspace over the Serbs' positions is an attempt to divert  NATO from carrying out any further air strikes, and also an  attempt to freeze the current situation on the Gorazde front.  He would be satisfied if the current situation were frozen,  since he is near Gorazde, and that the Serb paramilitaries may  continue to torment Gorazde with their snipers. However, our  attitude is explicit and consistent: We demand that the Serb  aggressor pull back to the positions that it held prior to the  latest offensive....    [Cerimagic] How do you assess the role of General Rose in  the Gorazde case?    [Delic] General Rose is certainly in a position where at the  same time he must carry out his task as a member of the  international forces, and implement the policy of his country.  I can see everything that he, as a commander and a man, wants  to accomplish. His job is certainly very difficult. However,  he should himself explain why he has taken certain actions. I  was sending him information on a daily basis about preparations  for the offensive against Gorazde and its course, together with  concrete data on the number of shells, the directions from which  the enemy troops were coming, and from which their attacks were  carried out. However, the information that was forwarded to the  United Nations by UNPROFOR stated that there were only  skirmishes, and that there were no attacks, right up until the  moment when the situation in Gorazde became worse than critical.  Therefore, his conduct is probably a part of the policy pursued  either by the international community or by certain countries.  Not only the interests of Europe and the United States, but  also some particular interests of certain European countries,  are breaking over Bosnia. After NATO's intervention and the air  strikes, the absurd accusation was issued that the B-H Army was  shelling Serb positions. That is really absurd. The  international community has bound us hand and foot by imposing  the arms embargo against us so that we cannot defend ourselves.  It has done the same thing to Gorazde, while at the same time  doing nothing to protect the town, despite our warnings. The  Gorazde zone is not only the town of Gorazde, but also the free  territory of Gorazde, and at the time when the United Nations  was speaking about peace in Gorazde, before the latest  offensive, and when the town itself was not being so heavily  shelled, our positions toward Ustipraca, Foca, Mesici, and  Rogatica were being shelled. Which means that the focus of  attacks was moved from the town of Gorazde to its surroundings.  UNPROFOR and everybody else ought to know that the safe zone of  Gorazde is much broader than the town itself, and it is supposed  to be defended just as the town is. It is absurd to claim that  the B-H Army, or the forces of the Eastern Bosnian Operative  Group, were disregarding a cease-fire that did not even exist  before the aggression. Obviously, this is an attempt to spread  the blame again, which has produced very negative effects so  far. We demand from the UNHCR and the international community  to implement fully what they proclaimed with their resolutions.  If they are not capable of doing that, they should say so  publicly, and allow us to defend ourselves. I think it is about  time that they did so.    [Cerimagic] Can it happen that a similar situation is  repeated in Bihac, where the B-H Army controls some 30 km of the  railroad from Knin to Banja Luka, which is of vital interest to  the Serbs?    [Delic] That is already happening. Even now forces from the  Knin Krajina, Banija, Lika, and Kordun, the regions pacified by  the agreement between the Krajina Serbs and Croatia, are being  brought in. All the relevant international factors engaged in  the problem of former Yugoslavia have already been informed in  time about these activities by word of mouth, as well as through  letters. For instance, on Tuesday I told General de Lepresle  and Mr. Akashi that uncommitted forces from the UN Protection  Areas in the Knin Krajina were being redeployed in the Bihac  region. Hardware and manpower are being brought in, while  attacks against Bihac are being carried out even from within the  UN Protection Areas.    Therefore, what I said about Gorazde also applies to Bihac.  By using the UN Protection Areas, the aggressor wants to force  the international community to intervene. Since the  international community always looks for balance and culpability  on both sides, it will try to reconcile the warring factions, as  it puts it, thereby making the attacker equal to the victim, and  to pacify the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in such a way.  One thing is for sure, however, that if the aggressor fails to  capture Gorazde, that is, to freeze the situation on the ground,  the same scenario will be played out in the case of Bihac.  Tomorrow the same will be done in Srebrenica and Zepa. In that  way they will force the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina to  accept the state of affairs on the ground, and start talks in  which we would get the short end of the stick, that is, the  conditions that we demand would not be fulfilled, and what we  demand is the relinquishing of territories seized by force.    [Cerimagic] One can say that the aggressor is suffering  military defeats as well. Their propaganda presented their  defeat on the Maglaj front as an agreed withdrawal. Can you  give us a short description of the action by our army?    [Delic] We had a very difficult situation in Maglaj, with  which the international community was familiar. We demanded  from the international community, and in the first place  UNPROFOR, to help Maglaj, to have at least convoys with food  reach the town. However, each time UNPROFOR was halted just  before the town. In the end, we started an campaign to lift the  blockade. We carried out operations inside as well as outside  the ring. As part of the preparations for the final lifting of  the blockade, the 201st Maglaj-Vitez Brigade liberated a  considerable swathe of territory southwards, toward Ljesnica,  and other regions, enabling us to come as close to our forces as  possible. The same thing was done by other units in the  territory controlled by the 7th South Operative Group. We also  prepared a push from the direction of Doboj and Gracanica, while  at the same time we were planning an operation for breaking the  ring around the 7th South Operative Group.    Operations on such a scale cannot be planned, prepared, and  carried out in a short time. By deliberately stretching the  aggressor's forces and conducting raids our units broke through  to the section where the 7th South Operative Group was to be  unblocked. We threw in units of our 2d and 3d Corps. That was a  huge amount of military force. We even planned to overrun HVO  units if they obstructed our action. However, the situation  that was brought about by the Washington Agreement created the  opportunity for the HVO, if nothing else, to be passive and to  let our forces through. The Serbian paramilitary formations  already had intelligence reports on that. We have recordings of  Serbian commanders demanding that their troops urgently pull  out, in order to avoid being totally surrounded. Because if we  had cut them off on the right bank of Bosna River, from  Zavidovici to Maglaj, and on the other side from Novi Seher, two  Serbian brigades would have been fully encircled. Their  commander knew that. He demanded their urgent withdrawal,  because it was a question of hours, rather than days. He sought  a location to escape to, and he succeeded in finding one. That  this is not mere boasting is shown by the results that we  achieved later in the region. By deploying part of the forces  that had liberated Maglaj, we also liberated territory toward  Teslic, Doboj, and additional territories around Maglaj. All  this proves that it was an excellently prepared military action,  and I think it is high time that our people understood that one  cannot instantly respond to attacks, as in the case of Gorazde.  We are a serious army now. We have to plan seriously, work  out, and then carry out operations. Time will produce an answer  to the situation in Gorazde as well. Many serious things are  happening to the Serbian aggressor in and around Gorazde. That  town cannot be physically helped, but there are ways of helping  it indirectly. And we are doing this.  <H5>  [Box, p 17] </H5>   [Cerimagic] The aggressor might not have dared to attack  Gorazde again, if the Rogoj, Trnovo, and Grebak passage,  thorough which the fighters and people of Gorazde were getting  logistic support from the free territories, had not fallen last  year. How could it happen that such a vitally strategic  territory was so poorly defended, and eventually fell into the  hands of the aggressor?    [Delic] One should know that it is a vast and rather  unpopulated area. For that reason it was not possible for us to  amass and deploy enough troops from the local population. The  B-H Army has never had organized logistic support. Our army  does not have any established logistic institutions, as is the  case with the Serbian para-army that inherited from the Yugoslav  People's Army everything that it needs. Throughout the war we  have been organized in such a way that it is mostly local  populations that defend their territory, while on Mount Igman we  could not provide the manpower to defend such a vast territory.  In such cases, when citizens start leaving, then the army also  leaves. Unfortunately, this was the case in Trnovo.    In addition, the aggressor's propaganda had a great  psychological impact. Of course, there were many individual  mistakes up there on Igman. For a long time there was no  fighting, so in such a situation a power struggle developed,  while war profiteering and smuggling bloomed. In addition, at  the time we had paramilitaries among our own army, various units  that were outside the system. On Igman and the Grebak passage  there were 10 or so units whose names were extremely flamboyant,  but actually had rather few people, and were outside the single  command and control network. We have even information that some  of our people were working for the enemy. True, they controlled  only smaller units, but when the investigation started, they  fled over to the enemy side. Among them is Nijaz Zorbic,  commander of the Silver Fox unit, who fled through  chetnik-controlled territories, and is reportedly in Spain now.  The investigation has shown that there are even more of such  people, who arbitrarily withdrew their units from the front  during the offensive.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 17 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Ecuadoran peasants  and Indians took over a provincial cathedral and blocked roads  to protest an agricultural structuring bill presented to the  parliament by President Sixto Duran-Ballen. The Confederation of  Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), which declared a  48-hour strike beginning on 18 May, also reject the governmental  plan, which must be studied by the (unicameral) Congress this  week.    Local authorities confirmed a large number of protesters  peacefully occupied the Ibarra Cathedral this morning in the  capital of Imbabura Province, 75 km from Quito. The peasants and  Indians presented a manifesto asking the church to mediate to  ensure the government withdraws its agrarian restructuring plan.  They reported the government is trying to implement a  "privatization wave" and "to eliminate the right to own land,  the communal properties of the Indian peoples, and the agrarian  reform law."    In this document, the protesters demanded the deputies  reject  the governmental project, because it is "unconstitutional and  antidemocratic and represents the interests of a small group of  large landowners."    Meanwhile, members of the Imbabura Indian and Peasant  Federation and other similar organizations blocked the roads in  the northern part of the country. The police maintained they  controlled the protests without any incidents. The Conaie  followed through on its call to hold a number of protests on 18  and 19 May. The Indian and peasant organizations that oppose the  agrarian project even warned they would promote an "uprising"  that could halt the country. Obstructing the transportation of  products from the countryside to the cities, blocking roads, and  staging nationwide street protests are among the first actions  of the "preventive" event organized by Conaie. The protests  include a gathering in front of the National Congress in Quito.    The main Ecuadoran workers union, the United Workers Front  (FUT), the Teachers National Union, and student and public  employees organizations today announced they will support the  Indian and peasant uprising.    The National Congress, which must issue a ruling at the  latest on 19 May, must analyze the controversial agrarian  project. Meanwhile, the Duran-Ballen administration stated it  will go on with the modernization project and warned it will  take the necessary steps to maintain peace and order in the  country.</p>

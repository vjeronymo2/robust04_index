			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Bundesbank warning on money market funds THE Bundesbank yesterday declared broad support for the Bonn government's proposals to reform Germany's financial markets, but underlined its opposition to the introduction of money market funds in Germany. The Bundesbank's comments, in its monthly report, follow the government's package of measures unveiled in January to strengthen Germany's position as a financial services centre. The proposals include establishing a centralised regulatory body for the securities industry, introducing tough new laws against insider trading, and changing the law to allow money market funds in Germany. The Bundesbank said yesterday that it opposed the introduction of money market funds in Germany on the grounds that they would weaken its control over monetary policy. Money market funds, a highly popular form of investment in the US and many European countries, give investors direct access to short-term money market instruments (such as Treasury Bills in the US) and pay a better rate of interest than short-term bank deposits. The Bonn Finance Ministry believes that such products should be available in a modern financial services centre, but the Bundesbank maintains that they would endanger its minimum reserve policy, a central plank of its fight to constrain money supply growth and keep down inflation. Under minimum reserve policy, banks have to keep a proportion of all their deposits with the Bundesbank. These funds are then used to manage market liquidity. 'The possible shift of funds from bank deposits covered by the reserve requirement to a money market fund not covered by the requirement would lead to a reduction in the minimum reserve base and weaken the efficiency of the instrument of minimum reserves,' the Bundesbank cautioned. There is considerable pent-up demand in Germany for money market funds as short-term interest rates are at historically high levels. This is not reflected in the rates obtainable in deposits. The German banks are ambivalent about the introduction of the product. They agree with Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, that money market funds ought to be available in a modern and sophisticated financial services centre, but fear that their costs would increase sharply if depositors moved their savings from low-interest bearing deposit accounts into higher yielding funds.</p>

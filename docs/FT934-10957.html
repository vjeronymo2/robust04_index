			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Notts colliery set to shut: Closure of 'reprieved' mine ends long wait for British Coal's strategy BRITISH COAL will today begin its long-awaited move to cut the UK coal industry significantly by announcing plans to close the Calverton colliery in Nottinghamshire. The announcement will follow months of speculation that British Coal would close all 12 pits, including Calverton, that were reprieved by the government last March after a public outcry over their proposed closure. In the five months to the end of British Coal's financial year in March, the corporation is likely to close at least a dozen pits. In contrast to last year's announcement of 31 closures, subsequently withdrawn, the corporation will move cautiously. British Coal indicated in meetings with union leaders in Nottinghamshire yesterday that some of the 12 mines reprieved, but under renewed threat, could survive if they performed better than the 19 pits which have never been earmarked for closure. The Calverton closure would be a blow for the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which represents most miners in the region. The union had hoped for preferential treatment after it kept mines open in the 1984-85 pit strike. British Coal executives underlined the extent of the industry's problems by disclosing that the amount of coal burnt in Britain's power stations this year is likely to be 7m tonnes lower than expected, down from an anticipated 64m tonnes. Coal consumption has fallen 20 per cent on last year as nuclear output has risen 12 per cent - equivalent to 3m tonnes of coal. Gas turbine stations have taken away the market for a further 4m tonnes of coal. British Coal signalled its intention to close Calverton as it began consultations on the future of all 30 remaining pits under the industry's revived colliery review procedure. At yesterday's meeting, called to discuss the future of the nine Nottinghamshire pits, British Coal said it was necessary to review further the Calverton colliery which employs 640 men and has made losses of Pounds 6.3m this year. Miners and management at Calverton are to meet this morning. At least one more pit closure is likely next week after British Coal holds a meeting next Tuesday to discuss Yorkshire region collieries. In the following three weeks meetings will discuss Scotland, south Wales, Staffordshire and the north-east. The most vulnerable collieries in these areas are Silverdale, in Staffordshire, and Wearmouth, in the north-east. Mr Neal Greatrex, UDM general secretary, accused British Coal of playing cat and mouse. 'Miners at Calverton will have to wait another 24 hours before they know finally whether their pit will close.' The next meeting for Nottinghamshire pits under the modified colliery review procedure is scheduled for January.</p>

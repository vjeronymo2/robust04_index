			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, May 21 (TANJUG) -- A mosque in the  Moslem settlement Grbavica in the central Bosnian town of Vitez  was levelled with the ground on Friday evening, on the eve of  the Moslem religious holiday of Kurban Bairam, the Croat radio  of Herzeg-Bosnia reported on Saturday [21 May].    The destroyed mosque was in the area controlled by the  Bosnian Croats Army (HVO). There are no details about  perpetrators but an investigation is expected, the announcement  said. `This terrible incident, which happened on the eve of the  major Moslem religious holiday of Kurban Bairam, has  deteriorated the already tense relations between Moslems and  Croats in the area of Vitez,' the Croat Radio said. Only a few  hours before explosive was planted, Moslem troops were  celebrating the coming of Kurban Bairam by shooting on the  positions of a HVO brigade in the area of Vitez, the radio said.    The Bosnian Croats and Moslems were fighting fiercly from  last spring (over territories with mixed population in central  and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina) to early February, when, under  strong U.S. pressure, they signed an accord on their federation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina supposed to grow into a confederation with  neighbouring Croatia.    Relations between Croats and Moslems are, however, still  very  strained, and clashes and incidents do happen increasingly  often. Apart from Vitez, mosques had been destroyed by Bosnian  Croats in Zepca, Kiseljak, western Mostar, and Livno, all in the  Croat republic of Herzeg Bosnia.</p>

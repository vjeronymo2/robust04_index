			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel believes 'no significant debt trading' EUROTUNNEL, the channel tunnel company, does not believe there has been any significant trading in its debt, the company's chief executive, Sir Alastair Morton said yesterday. He was responding to a comment in yesterday's Lex column in the FT which said that a small amount of Eurotunnel's debt had changed hands at a discount to its face value of 30 per cent. Sir Alastair said that under the terms of its borrowing agreement, the company must be notified if security is assigned to any purchaser of debt. In the past six months, Eurotunnel has not been notified of any market transactions in its debt involving the re-assigning of security in this way. However, Sir Alastair said it was possible that debt has been transferred between banks without reassigning security, though he thought it unlikely. If a bank had bought debt without gaining the right to security it would naturally buy the debt at a discount, he said, since the debt would carry an increased risk. In addition, he said that no bank can assign its ongoing commitment to provide Eurotunnel with its undrawn banking facilities without the company's consent - which has not been given in the case of any market transactions in the past six months. Eurotunnel has 220 banks. To date, it has drawn on more than Pounds 4bn of its banking facilities. The company believes that less than 1 per cent of this Pounds 4bn has ever changed hands and is not aware of it ever being sold at a discount. The company also pointed out that it is not planning to seek further finance from its banks or shareholders prior to the opening of the Channel Tunnel towards the end of next year. The need for further funding in the period after opening will be measured during the first year in service in 1994. Sir Alastair also said that negotiations with Transmanche Link, the consortium of contractors working on the tunnel, are going well. There has been a dispute between Eurotunnel and TML over how much the contractors should be paid for fitting out the rail tunnels and building passenger terminals at Folkestone, Kent and Sangatte, northern France . Eurotunnel is now believed to be offering TML between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m less than TML wants, as measured in 1985 prices.</p>

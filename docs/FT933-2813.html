			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading POOR figures on UK inflation, combined with technical trading ahead of tomorrow's expiry, brought a sharp retreat in the September Footsie futures contract leaving it to trade at a discount to cash, writes Joel Kibazo. The initial buying of the September contract faded after the release of worse than expected figures on inflation. Dealers also took this as another sign that a reduction in UK interest rates was unlikely in the near term. Technical trading continued, although nervously, ahead of Friday's expiry in both the futures and index traded options. But with the market continuing to drift lower on a combination of the two factors, traders said that there was little in the way of basket trading. The premium was gently eroded following the inflation figures and at the day's worst September traded at a 10-point discount to the underlying market. It closed at 2,986, a 2-point discount to cash with volume reaching a heavy 18,162 lots. The December contract traded 12,278 lots. Volume in the traded options jumped to 55,490, with volume in the FT-SE 100 option which expires on Friday contributing 22,151 contracts. The Euro FT-SE 100 option added another 3,595 to the total and British Steel was the busiest stock option at 3,580 lots. Amstrad recorded over 3,000 contracts.</p>

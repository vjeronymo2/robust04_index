			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Executive pay The Prudential Corporation has in the past been one of the stoutest defenders of directors' three-year rolling contracts. So its expected abandonment of such contracts may sound their death-knell throughout British industry. Much of the credit must go to the high-profile campaign waged by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, PosTel's chief executive. It is surely no coincidence that Sir Martin Jacomb, currently PosTel's chairman, is due to become the Pru's chairman next year. Even if the Pru does not join Mr Ross Goobey's campaign, directors in other companies will find it harder to cling to their three-year rollers. They will no longer be able to point to a large institution's practice as justification for their own. Rollers allow badly performing executives to receive large pay-offs if they are forced to resign. The actual sums involved are usually small compared with companies' market capitalisations. But rewarding failure in this way damages shareholders' interests not merely through the direct financial impact but also by undermining employee relations. Rollers are a blatant example of one rule for directors and another rule for ordinary staff. That said, the most important impact of PosTel's campaign may be to give a shot in the arm to shareholder activism. Institutional investors have too often been prepared to walk away from poorly performing companies rather than seek to change their boards and/or strategies. It is to be hoped they will now take a tougher line.</p>

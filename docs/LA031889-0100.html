			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  3 CHARGED IN DEATH AT DAY-CARE HOME  </P> <P> A couple who ran an unlicensed Lomita day-care home and their 19-year-old  daughter were charged Friday with felony child endangerment and with violating  the state's Health and Safety Code in connection with the strangulation death  last November of a 16-month-old girl.  </P> <P> Robert and Linda Zieger and their daughter Laura were arrested shortly after  the Nov. 14 death of Michele Heasley, who was one of seven small children being  cared for at the Zieger home.  </P> <P> All three Ziegers have been free on $3,000 bail during an investigation by the  district attorney's office and Sheriff's Department. They are scheduled to be  arraigned Tuesday in South Bay Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Robert Zieger, 48, and Linda Zieger, 47, were reached by phone Friday but  declined to comment.  </P> <P> Investigators reported that the family routinely cared for about half a dozen  children at their home on West 262nd Street, although they were not licensed by  the state Department of Social Services.  </P> <P> Laura Zieger told paramedics that she was at home alone with the seven children  when she found the girl not breathing, about an hour after she had left her  napping in a bedroom. Doctors at Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical Center said  they found abrasions on the girl's neck, indicating that she may have been  strangled.  </P> <P> The county coroner's office ruled the death a homicide, but Deputy Dist. Atty.  Rod Leonard said Friday that there is no evidence to charge the Ziegers, or  anyone else, with murder.  </P></p>

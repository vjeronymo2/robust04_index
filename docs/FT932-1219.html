			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bombardier near to pact on TML contract BOMBARDIER, the aerospace and transit equipment group, hopes to reach an interim agreement soon with Transmanche Link covering part of its CDollars 450m (USDollars 352m) claim for cost overruns on a CDollars 700m tunnel wagon contract for the undersea tunnel between England and France. Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, said Bombardier was near to completing the interim pact with TML, the tunnel's prime contractor, but would not comment on reports that TML might pay an initial CDollars 100m towards final settlement of the claim. Earlier this month, Bombardier won agreement on the approval process and resumed shipments of wagons from its Bruges plant after a three-month halt. The CDollars 450m claim covers extra work being performed because of late design changes. TML is locked in a long-running row with Eurotunnel, the tunnel's operator, over the escalating cost of the project which has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to about Pounds 10bn.( Dollars 15bn) Eurotunnel is expected to tell shareholders at its annual meeting in London today that negotiations with the contractors remain deadlocked. TML has warned that the tunnel is unlikely to open before next summer unless an agreement over costs can be reached. The project originally, had been due to open this month. Mr Beaudoin, speaking after Bombardier's annual meeting, said he wanted to settle his company's claim by the end of this year. Bombardier will shortly send full details of the claim to TML, to be followed by more negotiations. 'If we can't settle towards year end, we'll have to go to court,' said Mr Beaudoin. Bombardier has accounted for about half the claim which led to a CDollars 73m operating loss in its transit equipment division last year. Overall, Bombardier's order backlog totals about CDollars 8bn, evenly divided between transit equipment and aerospace. Mr Beaudoin said 58 business jets would be delivered this year, against 49 in 1992. With Lear Jets' new Series 60 and the Series 45 to come and a new version of the Challenger, Bombardier can compete fully with Raytheon and its recently-acquired BAe business jet division. New orders for the 50-seat Regional Jet are near signing. One prospective customer is British and another German. But Bombardier will move ahead with the long-distance Global Express only if international risk-sharing partners can be found. Besides North America, Bombardier has more than CDollars 2bn of transit equipment orders in Europe, Indonesia, Morocco and Venezuela and its new Mexican subsidiary will help it to enter the growing Latin American markets. Short Brothers of Belfast continues to contribute profits to Bombardier and has become the world's biggest metal bonding producer. Bombardier has dropped plans to raise CDollars 150m with a new preferred stock issue. Institutions objected to conditions under which the preferred could be converted into common shares, with consequent dilution. Analysts expect Bombardier to attempt a straight equity issue late this year provided the market price of the common shares recovers. It is now well below the 52-week high of CDollars 15 1/4 because of uncertainties about the Channel tunnel claim and delays in Regional Jet orders.</p>

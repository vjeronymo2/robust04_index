			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Option of extra Bosnian troops 'not closed off' Signs of a softening of government attitudes towards sending additional British troops to Bosnia emerged at Westminster last night amid reports of a looming clash on the issue between ministers and defence chiefs. As officials sought to play down differences, saying service chiefs and ministers were 'four-square in step', senior ministerial sources said the option of sending extra troops had not been closed off. Last month's request from General Sir Michael Rose, the British UN commander based in Sarajevo, for an immediate addition of 3,000 troops had been seen as premature, the sources said. Britain was unlikely to send more ground troops if no other country did. In public comments to date, ministers have tended to adopt the harder line that if extra troops are needed they should come from countries which do not already have forces on the ground. As recently as yesterday, writing in London's Evening Standard newspaper, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said: 'The plan for opening Tuzla to relief supplies should be carried out. Mostar, Vitez and the Maglaj pocket need relief. This means redeploying the UN force and may need extra men. Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Canada, Malaysia and many other countries are doing their bit. The extra should come from elsewhere.' Mr Hurd emphasised that the 2,500 British troops escorting convoys in the region were 'a bigger contribution than any except the French'. Contacted last night, Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the defence select committee who is due to meet Gen Rose in Split next week, said he thought there was a row between ministers and defence chiefs. The chiefs were saying Britain should 'send what we can', while the government's position was that 'others should do their bit'. Sir Nicholas said it was his understanding that a request had been made to the UN for an additional 7,000 troops. He 'absolutely' backed the government's stance that Britain must not be drawn into the conflict 'inch by inch'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brcko, May 11 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb President  Radovan Karadzic said on Wednesday the combined Croat-Moslem  artillery attack on Serb-controlled Brcko in northeastern Bosnia  on Tuesday had made the Serbs much more reluctant to make  concessions in the future territorial delineation. "This once  again proved us right in insisting that our corridors be  sufficiently deep from the strategic point of view ... to make  our borders easy to defend," Karadzic said early on Wednesday  during a visit to the victims of the attack in Brcko hospital.  "These civilians have paid dearly for their freedom and the  right to hold political meetings in their town," he added.    During the attack, mounted at 7.30 p.m. local time (5.30  p.m.  GMT) on Tuesday, the Bosnian Serb parliament was in session in  Brcko.    A statement issued by the hospital in Brcko said the attack  left three people dead, including one child and one pregnant  woman, and 13 others wounded. Bozo Isailovic, 61, his  daughter-in-law Svetlana, 27, who was in advanced pregnancy, and  her two-year daughter Bozana were killed at their home which  sustained a direct hit from a tank shell. Two of the wounded are  in intensive care, six with severe wounds are undergoing  hospital treatment and five have been discharged after receiving  medical help.    Karadzic told reporters that Bosnian Serbs had always  granted  passage through their territory to Croat and Moslem deputies.  "Otherwise, their joint parliament would be unable to hold any  sessions in Sarajevo." Bosnian parliament Speaker Momcilo  Krajisnik, who visited the wounded together with Karadzic, said  that what had happened last night in Brcko was the crime against  the Serb people and an anticivilizational act.</p>

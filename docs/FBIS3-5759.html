			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles and editorials in Seoul vernacular newspapers published  on 10 March on the North-South contact held on 9 March at  Panmunjom.    The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean on page 3  carries an 800-word editorial entitled "Are We That  `Desperate'?" The editorial refutes Chief ROK delegate Song  Pyong-tae's remark "that the envoy exchange is a pressing issue  that cannot be put aside even for a minute," and calls on Song  to disclose if his remark represents the government's official  view or is his personal opinion. The editorial notes the issue  on exchanging special envoys is "not the supreme task nor a  pressing issue, but what we hope for to occur."    The editorial deplores that "the South side disclosed all  our  cards" and that "we begged the North side for the exchange of  special envoys, which resulted in North Korea's assuming a  haughty attitude toward our demands." Recalling that President  Kim Yong-sam expressed his hope for the North-South summit at a  news conference, the article concludes that our side's  mishandling of the affair is a by-product of  "unification-related government officials' flattery, pursuit for  personal achievements, and excessive loyalty to fulfill the  president's hope."    Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean carries on page 3 a 1,000-word  article by An Hui-chang entitled: "The Prospect for Exchanging  Special Envoys Before 21 March Grows Dim." The article analyzes  North Korea's counterproposal of two additional demands,  including maintenance of national self-reliance, on the agenda  for discussion by the special envoys, as attempts by North Korea  "to break the ROK-U.S. cooperative system by not agreeing to the  envoy exchange" and "to size up our government's determination  to exchange special envoys."    The article interprets "North Korea's attempt to itemize the  special envoys' missions in seven points as an intent to hinder  the ROK side from focusing on the nuclear issue." Commenting on  North Korea's suggestion to add to the envoys' mission  discussions on how to preserve national independence, the  article notes "North Korea added this condition to put pressure  on the ROK side by raising the issue of U.S. troops stationed in  the ROK and to use this as a card during the future North  Korean-U.S. talks." The article concludes "such being the case,  chances are slim that the special envoys will be exchanged  before the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks."    The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries  an  800-word editorial entitled: "How Long Do We Have To Be Dragged  About by the North?" Pointing out North Korea's insincere  attitude to evade the envoy exchange by presenting two  additional demands on the envoys' mission, the editorial calls  on the government "not to vacillate or hasten negotiations. Our  side should make it clear to the North that practical  discussions on the envoy exchange is a precondition for the  third round of U.S.-North Korean talks, which the North longs  for." The editorial condemns the North for always putting  forward "preposterous conditions after reaching an agreement in  principle" and predicts that North Korea will make further  attempts to "gain more concessions," while repeatedly putting  forward additional conditions. The editorial warns the ROK  Government not to get entangled in North Korea's foot-dragging  tactic and calls on the government "to convince the U.S. side  that the North Korean-U.S. talks should be suspended until the  North and the South reach an agreement on the pending issues."    The editorial concludes: "If North Korea continues to put  forth additional conditions for the envoy exchange, our side  should demand that the North disclose its position on its real  intention for the envoy exchange."    The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean carries on  page 2 a 900-word article reviewing the thorny conversations  between the two chief delegates, adding that a tense air  surrounded the contact. The article adds that the chief  delegates held private talks for 20 minutes after the contact,  but ROK delegate Song declined to give more details.    The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean carries on page 2 a  900-word article by Yu Sung-u and the conservative Seoul TONG-A  ILBO in Korean carries on page 3 a 1,000-word article by Pak  Chae-kun. Both articles review the conversations between the  two delegates and describe the atmosphere at the talks as tense.</p>

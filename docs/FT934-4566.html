			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Transport role for utilities forecast The water and electricity companies are expected to emerge as prime movers in the government's drive to involve private finance in public services, according to Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary. Mr Dorrell told journalists yesterday that the government was trying to create a business sector which would build road and rail infrastructure on behalf of the transport department. Construction companies and the banks normally act as promoters for large projects such as the Channel tunnel and estuarial crossings. Mr Dorrell said the benefits of involving the private sector would emerge only if the design, financing and construction of infrastructure were under the control of companies with expertise in managing roads and railways. He said: 'Utility companies recognise this as a business they might move into. There will also be foreign companies with experience of running toll roads abroad. Not all the expertise has to be home-grown.' Mr Dorrell said he would not be keen to see state-owned foreign operators such as SNCF, the nationalised company which runs the French railways, entering the market. The Budget this week included commitments to proceed with three large public-sector projects using private finance: the modernisation of the west coast railway line from London to Glasgow, the extension of the Docklands Light Railway in east London to Lewisham, and the new air traffic control centre for Scotland. Mr Dorrell said he expected all three projects to be out to competitive tender by the next Budget. He acknowledged that there was 'scope for disappointment' over the pace of progress on the private finance initiative. Editorial comment, Page 15</p>

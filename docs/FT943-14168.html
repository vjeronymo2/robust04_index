			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Canadian dollar sector revived by deals aimed at retail buyers After several days dominated by large offerings aimed at institutional investors, the pattern shifted yesterday, as a spate of deals targeted at the retail investor emerged in the Canadian dollar sector. There has been a revival of interest in the sector, due largely to a heavy schedule of nearly CDollars 2bn-worth of redemptions of outstanding bonds - including a CDollars 650m Alberta deal - next month. Many Benelux-based investors are looking for Canadian dollar bonds in which to reinvest following the redemptions, particularly since Canadian dollar yields are now higher than those for Belgian and Luxembourg franc bonds. Until yesterday's rush of CDollars 375m-worth of new issues, there had been little activity for about a month, but the forthcoming redemptions coupled with a strengthening of the Canadian dollar encouraged borrowers to return to the market, dealers said. Canada's Federal Business Development Bank and Germany's L-Bank both launched three-year deals, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Goldman Sachs respectively, while Norddeutsche Landesbank launched a five-year offering via Hambros Bank. At the longer end, Societe Quebecoise D'Assainissement des Eaux, a provincial crown corporation, launched a 10-year deal, which would usually be rather long-dated for retail investors. However, the 10 per cent coupon is attractive to these buyers, who have been looking for this type of coupon for some time. Dealers said that institutional investors are not looking at the market, and anyway would typically prefer larger, more liquid offerings. In the sterling floating-rate note market, a unit of SG Warburg added Pounds 75m to an outstanding Pounds 150m issue. the offering pays a discounted margin of 28 basis points over Libor. Pohang Iron &amp; Steel filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf offering of up to Dollars 700m in debt securities and common stock, Reuter reports. The Korean steel producer said the proceeds from the sale would be used for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures, debt refinancing and overseas investments.</p>

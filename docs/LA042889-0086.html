			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: JUDGE DROPS OUT OF CASE INVOLVING ROSE  </P> <P> A federal judge disqualified himself Thursday from a case involving an Ohio  bookmaker linked to Pete Rose, one day after law professors said he should step  down for remarks defending the Cincinnati Reds manager.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Carl B. Rubin of Cincinnati filed a one-sentence order with  the court clerk, taking himself off the case of Ronald Peters, who said he took  bets from Rose.  </P> <P> Linda D. Kloth, chief administrator of federal court in Cincinnati, said Rubin  removed himself from the case because "he just felt there was an appearance of  impropriety."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, five law school professors criticized Rubin, who last Friday said  baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti was engaging in a vendetta against Rose.  </P></p>

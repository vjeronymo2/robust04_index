			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor de la Hoz from the "RPC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] International media reports coming from Spain have  linked Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero to  several ghost companies being investigated by the Spanish  Government as part of the properties owned by the wealthy  businessman Mariano Rubio. According to this information,  Cordero has ties with several private firms allegedly used to  launder money.    However, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino  pointed  out that those reports are all intended to tarnish the  Panamanian Government's image. Mulino made those statements at  a posthumous ceremony honoring former Foreign Minister Julio  Linares.    [Begin Mulino recording] I am sure the report is politically  motivated and is attempting to damage the government's image  internally. What they are doing with utter irresponsibility,  however, is harming our country. The Spanish magazine [not  further identified] does not highlight anything specific on the  deputy foreign minister. It only mentions his firm  superficially. The problem is a different one in Spain. [end  recording]    Foreign Minister Mulino said Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos  Cordero will clarify this information in due time.</p>

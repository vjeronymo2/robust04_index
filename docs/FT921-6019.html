			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Losing at cards IT PAYS to read the small print in those leaflets which accompany your monthly credit card statement. Holders of Chase Manhattan's Visa card will have received a leaflet in the last few weeks informing them that the card, which is now issued by Girobank, is to be renamed Atlantic, writes David Barchard. But study the leaflet which accompanies the letter carefully. Girobank and Atlantic have introduced charges which could add considerably to the cost of the account. Girobank says charging its customers for special services keeps the price of the card competitive. If customers fail to make a charge by the due date, there is a Pounds 12 fine. If they exceed their credit limit, there is a Pounds 12 fine. If a cheque bounces, there is only a charge of Pounds 8 and the Pounds 12 lateness charge is not made: banks are not supposed to make charges on charges. Extra copies of sales vouchers and statements are charged at Pounds 5. Most of the big card issuers, with the exception of Lloyds, have quietly introduced charges for duplicate vouchers and statements over the last two years. A Girobank spokesman says that the charges are in line with those being introduced by other banks and he does not think it is unreasonable to charge a customer who misses the due date. But the customer is already being charged interest for missing the payment date - and the flat fee may be larger than the amount due. All credit card operations are currently under pressure. Customers are much more careful about paying on time and sales volumes have fallen. The banks have had to find other ways of making card businesses pay. Some banks - Lloyds is one - say they have no miscellaneous charges, but Midland says it has been charging its customers for more than a year for some additional services on their cards, including Pounds 5 for duplicate statements or a copy of a sales voucher and Pounds 10 for a change of statement date. Barclays charges less. Duplicate sales vouchers cost Pounds 3 as do copies of monthly statements. If an account is seriously 'out of order' a charge of Pounds 7.50 can be made. NatWest makes similar charges. The market seems to have accepted them without demur. Apart from Giro and its Atlantic Visa Card offshoot, no banks yet charge credit card customers for failing to make a payment by the due date or exceeding the credit limit. Girobank says: 'We recognise that there are good reasons for late arrival of payments and we will not apply the Pounds 12 charge for at least the first five working days after the due date,' says a spokesman. He adds that the Atlantic Visa card charges only 23.1 per cent a year interest: the lowest rate in the credit card market.</p>

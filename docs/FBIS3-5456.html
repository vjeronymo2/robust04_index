			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Concern Over U.S. Managed Trade"] </F>   [Text] The United States has revived Super 301 at last.  This is a natural outcome of discontent with Japan, which  evades the essence of the question each time by making up for  poor U.S.-Japan relations in an impromptu manner.    In fact, the United States put forward an offensive trade  policy "befitting" the post-Cold War era during the summit with  Japan last month. In other words, it declared that there will be  no more "empty" joint statements to be adopted merely for the  sake of formalities between the allies. Thus, there is an  indication that so-called managed trade [kwalli muyok], which is  intended to reduce red figures in trade with Japan by  establishing a quantitative standard in the U.S. export of  commodities to Japan, will become the U.S. strategy. The  revival of Super 301 can be seen as an extension of the  offensive trade policy suggested during the summit.    We fully understand the discontent with Japan roaring in  across U.S. society. In fact, there is no such a nation like  Korea which has been exhausted by the closed economy of Japan  which dashed only toward the balance in the black.  Nevertheless, we cannot stand on the U.S. side. In other  words, we have no objection to the fundamental principle of  encouraging Japan to realize the inevitability of opening up.  However, we cannot agree with the method of the U.S. practice.    The World Trade Organization [WTO], which 118 nations agreed  to jointly establish during the talks in Geneva last December,  has not yet been officially formed. At this very point, Super  301, which seeks unilateral sanctions and retaliation, has been  revived. Thus, its revival can be said as an unjust, dangerous  act of disturbing settlement and development of the WTO, which  intends to pursue opening and multilateralism.    Moreover, the red figures in U.S. trade are attributable to  its own chronic financial red figures and to the trend of its  excessive consumption. Therefore, once the United States  assumes an offensive posture, retaliation will undoubtedly be  expanded. This is because the ROK and Taiwan will attempt to  fill up the vacuum created due to reduction in Japan's export of  goods to the United States, and the United States will shift the  target of retaliation on others.    On the other hand, Japan's unilateral concession, designed  to  avoid retaliation, cannot be defined as the best method for  problem settlement. If a solution to the pending problems is  sought from the standpoint of managed trade, Japan's concession  will merely heighten the possibility of Japanese business  circles' "autonomous" expansion of imports of U.S. commodities,  and will the reduce shares [chibun] of European and small  countries' in the Japanese market.    At this point, we would like to call on the United States to  abandon managed trade and on Japan to boldly unbar the gate to  its domestic markets. We also urge the ROK Government to seek  solidarity forces in the multilateral trade system, in the  Asian-Pacific conference, and in the Northeast Asian arena,  instead of merely announcing protest statements and watching the  trend of the situation, and to work out diversified strategy for  national survival in a bid to expand the scope of choice. Our  international circumstances may be aggravated to such an extent  that even regionalism, which we do not wish, should be regarded  as a supplementary step.    From the outset, diplomacy is aimed at seeking the best  result while preparing for the worst situation. The ROK should  work to unite strength with other states in Northeast Asia by  developing regional forums and should make efforts to persuade  the United States and defend the multilateral trade system.</p>

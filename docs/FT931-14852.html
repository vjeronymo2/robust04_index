			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Hanson debt offering completed HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday completed a Dollars 1.25bn offering of debt in the US capital markets through its subsidiary, Hanson Overseas. The sale was the first time Hanson, which has extensive US business interests, has tapped the US long-term public debt markets - until now, the company has raised money in the US via commercial paper offerings. First Boston, the Wall Street investment bank that acted as lead-manager for the underwriting, said that demand for the Hanson debt was so strong that the size of the issue was increased at the last minute from Dollars 850m to Dollars 1.25bn. This made it the largest ever issue of Yankee bonds (dollar-denominated bonds sold in the US by foreign issuers). The issue, which was oversubscribed, consisted of Dollars 500m of 5 1/2 per cent notes due in 1996 priced to yield 5.592 per cent at maturity, and Dollars 750m of 7 3/8 per cent notes due in 2003 priced to yield 7.451 per cent at maturity. Hanson said that proceeds from the offering would be used to repay existing short-term debt.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Rexmore stages strong recovery to Pounds 688,000 THE SALE of its lossmaking timber businesses coupled with a reduction in interest costs helped Rexmore, the contract furnishings group, to achieve a strong recovery with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 688,000 for the six months to October 2. The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 143,000 last time and losses of Pounds 1.36m at the previous year end. Turnover for the 26 weeks amounted to Pounds 15.5m against Pounds 20.1m - including Pounds 5.25m from discontinued operations. Comparisons have been adjusted to conform with FRS 3. Interest payments for the interim period were cut from Pounds 322,000 to Pounds 177,000. Further reductions in borrowings and interest costs will materialise from operating profits and as the deferred consideration due from disposals is received, said Mr Michael Rosenblatt, chairman. All operations performed well and indications were that the improvement would be maintained, he said. The interim is raised by 43 per cent from 0.7p to 1p, payable from earnings of 4.44p per share (0.83p losses). The shares closed 11p up at 82p. Mr Rosenblatt, who founded the company almost 50 years ago, is to step down as chairman but will continue to serve as a non-executive director. Mr Michael Rosenblatt will become chairman and Mr Norman Rosen, managing director.</p>

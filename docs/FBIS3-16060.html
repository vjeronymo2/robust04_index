Italian  Ambassador Carlo Siano explained that the foreign minister  primarily represents Italy as the current chairman country of  the CSCE. The discussions will mainly concern the Russian troops  withdrawal and the situation of the ethnic minorities, he added.    The Italian Foreign Minister's meeting with Riigikogu  [parliament] Speaker Ulo Nugis had to be canceled because of the  delayed arrival of the minister. Beniamino Andreatta met  President Lennart Meri, Prime Minister Mart Laar, Dmitriy  Mikhaylov of the Russian Cultural Society and member of the  Russian Assembly Aleksey Semyonov. He is to meet Estonian  Foreign Minister Juri Luik today before leaving for Vilnius.</p>

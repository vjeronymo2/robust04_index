			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Intel Seeks Action in AMD Dispute: Intel said it would seek court action to  prevent an arbitrator from awarding substantial monetary damages to Advanced  Micro Devices in the controversy over the 386 microprocessor. The arbitrator  ruled earlier this month that Intel had breached a licensing contract with AMD  and said a clause in the contract barring most monetary damages was invalid.  AMD is seeking $500 million and the rights to the 386.  </P></p>

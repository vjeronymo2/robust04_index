			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>   State of Emergency To `Clamp' IFP -- Johannesburg THE  CITIZEN  in English on 4 April in its page-6 editorial finds "something  quite cynical" about the imposition of a state of emergency in  kwaZulu/Natal. The government previously refused to impose an  emergency "because it did not want to frighten off foreign  investors. It resorted, instead, to the declaration temporarily  of unrest areas. Another reason was that the African National  Congress was totally opposed to an emergency, which in the past  had been used by the government to suppress its revolutionary  activities." Now the ANC is in favor of a state of emergency in  kwaZulu/Natal because "it wishes to see a clamp placed on the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] as a preliminary to toppling Chief  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the last strong Black opponent of the ANC."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Two Options for Poll in kwaZulu/Natal -- Referring to the  unrest in kwaZulu/Natal and the Independent Electoral Commission  report that an election in that province is impossible under the  prevailing conditions, Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 7  April mentions two options to resolve this problem. The  politicians "can rely on emergency measures to achieve within a  couple of days what is needed." But the editorial warns "there  are limits to what brute force can achieve." Or the politicians  can "begin now looking for a political deal -- starting at  tomorrow's four-leader summit." Nevertheless, "it is much too  late to finalise a deal before the election. What is required  is a preliminary agreement that offers sufficient guarantees to  Buthelezi and the electoral process respectively. If agreement  is not reached the election must nevertheless go ahead as fully  as possible. Only if an agreement is reached can a delay or,  preferably, a commitment to repeat the Natal poll, be  countenanced."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   `Brinkmanship' in Natal/kwaZulu -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 7 April in a page-8 editorial believes "brinkmanship  has been a major feature of pre-election politics." "Perhaps  the most serious place where the game is being played is the  kwaZulu-Natal area. The situation is so grave that it has  already crossed the fine line into becoming a matter of life and  death. The type of destruction -- in one case involving the  grotesque slaying of a family of 10 -- is becoming routine and  highly unacceptable. The question whether the elections must be  held or not is part of this disconcerting problem concentrating  our minds. The dangers for and against the elections especially  in Natal-kwaZulu are extremely high and can be costly."  <H8>  CITY PRESS </H8>   Natal State of Emergency Welcome -- Johannesburg CITY PRESS  in English on 3 April in a page-14 editorial finds it "strange"  that there are political parties "who have found it necessary to  fault State President F. W. de Klerk's decision to declare a  state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal." "Given the frightening  escalation of violence in this region -- particularly in the  last two weeks -- what was the government expected to do?" CITY  PRESS believes that "as long as the security forces act  impartially, drastic measures are the only recourse left for the  government if the violence is to be contained."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   IFP `Blackmail' To Postpone Election -- Johannesburg BEELD  in Afrikaans of 31 March states in a page-12 editorial that the  53 people killed due to the unrest during a Zulu march through  the center of Johannesburg "have apparently not shocked IFP  leader Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi to his political senses.  Instead, he has declared that it will now be a fight to the  finish between the ANC and the Zulu nation." "One can only  remind him that he does not speak for the Zulu nation. He only  represents a political faction -- possibly a minority. But that  is neither here nor there. What is most worrying is that Mr.  Buthelezi says the fight to the finish will take place unless  the election is postoned. Surely this is naked blackmail. He  expects the country to choose between the election and anarchy.  The statements by the IFP that free campaigning will be  permitteed in Natal is only lip service. To many observers it  has long been clear that the IFP is not an honest boycotter of  the election, but an active destroyer." The IFP must realise  that "if it speaks of the final solution, the government and the  rest of South Africa also have final plans ready. And this will  not cost only 53 lives...The election cannot be postoned, so  those who want to drive the country to a final struggle must  know that it will lead to a tremendous counterreaction. Can  anyone reconcile that with a Christian conscience?"    ANC Above Law in Weapons Search -- In his column on page 13  of the same issue of BEELD, columnist Lood writes: "Reports that  the police were unable to search the ANC headquarters in Shell  House on Tuesday on account of political intervention are  disturbing. On Monday the ANC admitted in a written statement  that ANC security personnel had fired on a group of marchers and  killed or injured people. It may not have been necessary, as  reported, to commandeer 400 policemen for the search, but when  people break the law or are responsible for somebody's death,  the least that can be expected is that a thorough search be made  -- even inside the ANC headquarters, if necessary. Nothing and  no one ought to be above the law."</p>

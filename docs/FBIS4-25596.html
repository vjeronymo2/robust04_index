			<p>BFN     [Text] The Renminbi Exchange Rate Will Not Fluctuate  by a Big Margin    In the three months since the unification operation, the  renminbi exchange rate has normally fluctuated around the level  of 8.7 yuan to one dollar and black market operations have been  effectively contained. It is fully possible to accomplish  normal fluctuation to control the renminbi exchange rate at a  rational level in the future. First, China has strengthened  macroeconomic regulation and control and the annual growth rate  of the national economy in the 1990's will stay at 8 to 9  percent, this year it will be 9 percent. The national economy is  growing at an optimum rate and total import demand, that is,  total scale of annual spending of foreign exchange, can be  brought under effective control. Second, there are conditions  for China's exports to develop at a rate slightly higher than  that of the growth of the national economy. The export growth  rate last year was lower than the growth rate of the national  economy but the annual average export growth rate in the 15  years since reform and opening-up is 16 percent, higher than the  average growth rate of the national economy. The rapid growth  of the national economy in the past few years has built a number  of new production capacities, introduced a number of advanced  technologies and equipment, and stepped up China's economic  strength and export material basis. The reform measures  introduced this year have created favorable conditions for the  development of foreign trade exports. Both opportunities and  challenges exist in the international trade environment but,  taken as a whole, there are more opportunities than challenges.  It is possible for China's exports to accomplish growth at a  rate slightly higher than that of the growth of the national  economy. Thus, the total amount of foreign exchange supply can  be guaranteed. Third, China has introduced a number of measures  to control inflation and the index of price increases this year  should be controlled within 10 percent, with gradual reductions  in ensuing years. The total average of export selling prices  can still be increased somewhat. A balance between the two will  not cause any great impact on the fluctuation of the renminbi  exchange rate. Fourth, with the reform of the enterprise  system, various types of enterprises are improving the  operational mechanism of enjoying decisionmaking power over  operations, assuming sole responsibility for their own profits  and losses, self-development, and self-restraint. They are  paying attention to the cost of using foreign exchange and  reducing blindness in its use. Fifth, the state has introduced  measures for stabilizing exchange quotations. Judged by last  year's practices, under effective macroeconomic regulation and  control, China is fully capable of introducing measures to  stabilize exchange quotations. Sixth, we must maintain a  favorable foreign trade management order and effectively guard  against forcing up commodity prices, panic buying at home, and  competing for sales by cutting prices in pursuit of exchange  rates in the international market and thereby increasing export  costs. We are making vigorous efforts to do a good job in this  respect. Therefore, it is groundless to worry about large-scale  fluctuations of the renminbi exchange rate.  <H5>  Foreign Trade Restructuring Is Favorable to Foreign Exchange </H5> Earnings and Income From Exports    To change the quotas of foreign exchange earnings and income  from exports into guiding plans is favorable in itself for  foreign trade enterprises to transform the operational  mechanism, reinvigorate management, and increase foreign  exchange earnings and income from exports. Moreover, a number  of economic measures have been introduced to encourage  enterprises to export more products and accrue more foreign  exchange income. First, an exchange rate system favorable to  exports has been introduced. The standard exchange rate level  enables enterprises to gain rational profits under normal  management conditions. Second, a standardized export tax  reimbursement system, capable of accomplishing full and timely  tax reimbursement and whose formalities are as simple and  convenient as possible, is being implemented and it is still  necessary to guard against illegal tax evasion. Third, set up  an import and export bank is being set up to render funds  support for the export of machinery and electronics products.  Fourth, an export development fund and risk fund is being set  up to support the stable development of some commodities whose  prices fluctuate by a big margin on the international market, to  develop new export commodities, and to provide risk guarantees  for developing new markets and for exports to markets which have  larger risks. Fifth, we must carry out credit policies  favorable to foreign trade exports with the state rendering key  supplies to export credit for various types of enterprises and  the growth scale of loans should match the growth of exports.  Sixth, according to the rights and duties which GATT developing  country signatory parties should enjoy, China is in a position  to enjoy fair competition treatment for exports of some primary  products. Seventh, corresponding export promotion policies  should be pursued and wages and bonuses in foreign trade  enterprises should be linked with foreign exchange income from  exports. Introduction of these policies and measures can  basically overcome the contradiction whereby export sales are  not as good as domestic sales, thus enabling China's commodities  to compete on an equal basis with the same kinds of commodities  made by other countries in the international market.    Exchange Rate Reform Will Not Affect Normal Exports    China is a developing country and to increase foreign  exchange income from exports is mainly with the purpose of  importing more advanced technology, equipment, and goods and  materials required by the modernization program, as well as  importing daily necessities for the people. This is what we  must consider in working out reform policies. After the present  exchange rate reform, there have been increases in exchange  conversion, customs duty, and the circulating tax base and  import costs have gone up correspondingly. However, these will  not affect normal imports and the moderate growth of imports  because, before the unification of the exchange rate, the import  costs of 80 percent of the foreign exchange used for imports  were calculated by exchange quotations on the swap market.  Imports stayed high under the circumstances that foreign  exchange swap prices were so high during the first half of last  year but there is less chance that the exchange rate after  unification will affect normal imports. The financial budget  has been increased correspondingly for that portion of foreign  exchange used for imports with foregin exchange at state-fixed  prices if the imports are still arranged by the state. This  will not affect normal imports. The tax base for customs duty  and circulation tax has been raised but China will this year  again take the initiative by reducing the customs duty rate for  2,898 kinds of commodities. The margin of total customs duty  reduction is 8.8 percent. China has made commitments to foreign  countries that with the progress of substantive negotiations on  the resumption of China's GATT signatory state status, China's  total level of customs duty should be reduced by 50 percent on  the basis of 1992. This can offset import cost increases as a  result of increases in the tax base. Thus, it can be seen that  normal imports will not be affected but we must guard against  importing blindly and this has also been taken into  consideration in the present exchange rate reform.  <H5>  China Still Does Not Have the Conditions To Abolish the </H5> Permit System in Foreign Trade Operations    The permit system in foreign trade operations is an  important  measure taken by some developing countries to strengthen foreign  trade macroeconomic regulation and control and it is also a  transitional measure. It will be abolished in the ordinary  course of events after foreign trade legislation becomes sound  and the market mechanism matures but China still does not have  the conditions to abolish it. It has not been long since China  carried out the policy of opening-up, understanding of the law  of operations in international markets is inadequate, and there  is an eager desire to speed up the development of foreign trade.  Under such circumstances, if we slacken the necessary  management, blindness will easily emerge. In the first half of  1988, we transferred to the lower levels the power to examine  and approve production enterprises to engage in foreign trade by  themselves. Within three months, the number of units engaged in  foreign trade increased by two-thirds and many of them basically  did not have anyn of the conditions so to do. It resulted in  serious chaos in the operational order and affected the normal  development of foreign trade. Finally, we could not but carry  out rectification and control. China has a population of nearly  1.2 billion, the development level of the productive forces  remains very low and the contradiction stands out sharply that  total social supply cannot meet total demand. The things China  exports are squeezed out and the training of China's foreign  trade managerial staff cannot meet the needs. Under such  circumstances, blindly setting up many enterprises engaged in  foreign trade without taking conditions into account will  inevitably lead to a situation whereby "the gruel is meager and  the monks are many" and further to a situation wherein there are  more monks than there is gruel available, affecting the normal  development of foreign trade. Moreover, it is unfavorable to  the realization of scale operation in foreign trade, to  improving economic performance, and also unfavorable to  upholding China's good reputation in the world. Permits to  engage in foreign trade are just to examine the qualification  and ability of operations without restricting quantity. We  should emphasize both having the necessary conditions to acquire  the power to engage in foreign trade and performing export  duties to acquire such power. Some people say that the power to  engage in foreign trade should be given but whether or not the  enterprises export is for themselves to decide. Such a statement  is incorrect. The purpose of granting enterprises with the  conditions the power to engage in foreign trade is to enable  them to make use of the markets and resources, both at home and  overseas, to reinvigorate their operations and also to promote  heightening the technological and management level after  participating in competition in the international market. If  enterprises have the power to engage in foreign trade and yet do  not export, it is not only difficult to ensure the state's  foreign exchange income but this is also unfavorable to the  progress of enterprises. What then is the use of having the  power to engage in foreign trade?! It is not an easy job to  develop the international market. We must build up  relationships of mutual trust with our clients with a continuous  and stable supply of goods, otherwise it will be very difficult  to occupy the market. If we retreat easily from the market and  lose our credit, then we have to pay several times the original  price to redevelop the market again. Considered from the  interests of the state and the interests of enterprises, we must  never be careless about this issue.    Effectively Stop Forcing Prices Up, Panic Buying,  and Competing for Sales By Cutting Prices    Due to the introduction of new pricing reform measures, the  production costs of related products have increased and it is  understandable to raise the prices of goods supplied for export  appropriately but it is absolutely not allowed to exploit the  advantage of reform and raise prices unscrupulously at will.  Such prices of supplying goods are unacceptable and should be  reported to commodity price management departments. Goods can  only be purchased at prices of domestic market supply according  to the principle of fluctuation in line with market conditions.  We should resolutely stand up against prices being forced down  by foreign businessmen. The exchange prices of commodities in  the international market are determined by the social average  labor of mankind and fluctuate rationally according to supply  and demand relations. It is an unreasonable demand for foreign  businessmen to force prices down and share the benefits of  China's unification of exchange rates. The dollar has lost half  its value against the Japanese yen over nearly 10 years. Can we  succeed in demanding that U.S. businessmen lower their export  prices?! Foreign trade enterprises must not be too weak and far  less should they use this as a pretext to compete for sales by  cutting prices.    It is a key to success in foreign trade reform to  effectively  stop forcing up prices, panic buying, and competing for sales by  cutting prices and to maintain good order in foreign trade  operations. Forcing up prices, panic buying, and competing for  sales by cutting prices affect the normal fluctuations of the  exchange rate and weaken the benefits from the unification of  the exchange rates. They affect domestic price raises and  influence popular feelings, stability, and social stability.  They cause benefits to flow out and lower the performance of  foreign trade operations. They also harm the reputation of  China's commodities and cause the confidence of foreign  businessmen to waver in handling Chinese products. They lead to  antidumping measures by foreign countries and cause the  deterioration of the foreign trade operations environment. They  cause blind development of production and affect the rational  readjustment of the industrial structure. We must arouse the  serious attention of the foreign trade management departments,  enterprises, and the parties concerned. We should unite as one,  take practical measures, maintain good order in foreign trade  operations, ensure the successful progress of foreign trade  reform, and promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy development  of China's foreign trade.</p>

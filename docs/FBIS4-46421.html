			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Stasovskiy report under the "Events and </F> Commentaries" rubric: "Fifth Victim: Is the Opposition in  Tajikistan Switching to Terror?"]    [Text] Alarming and tragic reports continue to come in from  Tajikistan. Another two servicemen died on the evening of 1  June. Private Vladislav Maksakov, who was in charge of a border  detail, was blown up by a mine laid by gunmen in the 9th Border  Troop Subunit's section. And in Dushanbe, Lieutenant Colonel  Yuriy Shkipkin, deputy chief of a Tajik Defense Ministry troop  service, was killed not far from his home.    The investigative commissions of the Russian Border Troops  and the Tajik law-enforcement agencies hardly have time to get  to the bottom of one tragedy before another occurs. You cannot  help noticing that attacks on the military have started to occur  most frequently in the rear services and as a result of  terrorist and sabotage acts. According to statements by the  Tajik law-enforcement agencies, the murders of both Lt. Col.  Vladimir Borisenkov of the Russian Border Troops (31 May) and  Lt. Col. Yuriy Shkipkin from the republic's Defense Ministry are  criminal offenses. And yet it may be supposed with a high  degree of probability that gunmen are implicated here. The  opposition has chosen new tactics for waging the struggle.  Since the failure of several operations actually on the border  and substantial losses of mojahedin they have switched to  sabotage and terror. It is perfectly possible that the current  stepping up of terrorist activity has been prompted by the  successful Russian Border Troop operation carried out in the  section covered by the 8th Border Troop Subunit of the Pyandzh  border detachment (31 May-1 June) to "squeeze" gunmen out of the  Naychi peninsula: Several dozen mojahedin were forced to take  to their heels to save themselves after successful joint actions  by border troops and servicemen of the Russian 201st Division.    Five members of the border troops have fallen victim to  terrorism already this year. Aware that they are losing support  even among sympathetic strata of the population, the gunmen are  acting with special savagery, deviousness, and baseness. But by  no means all manage to get away scot-free. According to the  latest ITAR-TASS report, thanks to operational actions carried  out by investigations and law-enforcement agencies, an  inhabitant of Tajikistan was arrested 1 June on suspicion of  murdering Lt. Col. Borisenkov.</p>

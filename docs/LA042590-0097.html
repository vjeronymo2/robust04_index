			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: EL TORO;  </P> <P> WATER DISTRICT BOARD BACKS CITYHOOD ISSUE  </P> <P> Proponents of cityhood for the El Toro area got a major boost this week from  the Irvine Ranch Water District.  </P> <P> The district's board of directors voted unanimously Monday night to sponsor the  Community Coalition for Incorporation.  </P> <P> That sponsorship allows the coalition to apply for incorporation to the Local  Agency Formation Commission without submitting residents' signatures.  </P> <P> But Helen Wilson, chairwoman of the coalition, said her group will also present  petitions to LAFCO today containing 7,500 signatures supporting cityhood. Until  the group found a sponsor, it needed the verified signatures of at least 7,000  people, 25% of the 28,000 registered voters who live in the area proposed for  incorporation.  </P> <P> Wilson said her group will continue to gather signatures "to show we have  community support." She said the group approached the water district to  guarantee placement on the November ballot, rather than risk a late filing of  an application with LAFCO and the possibility of being forced to hold a special  election.  </P> <P> Peer Swan, board president for the water district, said sponsoring the effort  is "just good government. It saves everybody money and allows the people to  vote on the proposal in a general election. A special election is costly, and  only very few voters generally turn out."  </P> <P> The water district serves the Portola Hills area of El Toro. LEN HALL  </P></p>

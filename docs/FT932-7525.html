			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The power of sibling rivalry - The other Antinori is determined to make one of the world's best wines. He may have succeeded / Wine THE STANDARD explanation for the extraordinary increase in wine quality over the past decade or so is improved technology. But that is just part of the story - the arid bit. The real reason often is good, old-fashioned competition between producers. This is keener than ever before, not just because it is a buyer's market but because success is easier to measure. All the world's producers have access to the numerical scoreboards of the American wine press (which publishes points out of 100 for individual wines) as well as to the well-publicised results of comparative tastings and the like. What a thrill to produce a 95-pointer when the product of one's competitor gets only 85. And, just think - if that competitor were one's older brother . . . Sibling rivalry, one of life's more powerful forces, might just be the one which propelled international playboy Marchese Lodovico Antinori to carve his own wine estate, Ornellaia, from the scrub of the once mosquito-ridden Maremma of coastal Tuscany. Antinori is a famous name in the wine lexicon. The family, based at the Palazzo Antinori in the Piazza Antinori, has been making wine in and around Florence since 1385. Today, Lodovico's older brother, Piero, runs Marchesi L&amp; P. Antinori and is probably Italy's most respected wine personage. He made the prototype 'Supertuscan', Tignanello, and a well-received attempt to coax first-growth claret out of Tuscan soil, Solaia. This was itself a riposte to Sassicaia, a similar Cabernet-based wine produced today by Lodovico and Piero's cousin next door to Ornellaia, where Lodovico's wine-producing relatives are referred to as 'the cousin' and the 'brother'. When Lodovico was 23, he was despatched to work for Antinori's US agent in New York while Piero remained at the Palazzo Antinori. But Lodovico's early exposure to a wine market harsh enough to call his family's Chianti 'dago red' did little to kindle his enthusiasm for the business. He spent the next two decades producing films in Los Angeles, being a photo-journalist in Vietnam, skiing in Gstaad, hunting in Austria, and generally fleshing out a CV that would send a shiver down the spine of a careers' master. Although Lodovico still spends more time in Switzerland and Austria than at Ornellaia, there are distinct signs that wine has got to him at last. It was Andre Tchelistcheff, the nonogenarian oenologist in California, who convinced Lodovico in 1980 that he would be better off establishing a wine estate in Italy than California. Lodovico called on a roll-call of top wine names to advise him and regularly flies the jolly lord of Pomerol, Michel Rolland, to Tuscany to supervise the production of his special, all-Merlot wine, Masseto, which has achieved cult status in Germany and southern California. Indeed, it is only because 1989 was a particularly generous vintage, yielding 650 cases of Masseto, that the wine is available in Britain for the first time. The Ornellaia winery may be unusual. A total investment of more than Pounds 5m has resulted in a roof garden surreally sunk into the deserted Tuscan landscape 'this is where we had the famous opening party', as featured in Tatler, empty marble halls 'this is used once a year for a local festa', and an impressively architectural triangle full of Lafite and Lynch-Bages 'the Marchese's private cellar'. But there is no doubting Lodovico's commitment to quality as a wine producer, nor that his approach is as sensitive as it is deep-pocketed. 'I learnt more during Tchelistcheff's annual visits from 1980 to 1988 than I ever will again. It was total immersion in the philosophical concept, like having a tutor in many humanistic subjects, not just technology.' At Tchelistcheff's suggestion, he bought eight brand new oak vats in 1989 (thereby ensuring French coopers Radoux's profitability for the year) simply for short term storage before the wine is racked into the best barrels money could buy, just because Tchelistcheff said that he had good results with them at another millionaire's winery in California. Since his young Hungarian winemaker Tibor G'al visited Chateau Margaux, they are being used for fermentation too. 'Right now I'm having a love affair with Mr Anselmi of Soave', he announces gleefully, having fixed on this talented iconoclast as current white wine-making guru for his Sauvignon, Poggio alle Gazze. Tibor, whose young family has tried and failed to settle at Ornellaia, sighs deeply and often during his employer's outbursts, but he too cares passionately about the wines that are shown at Ornellaia - in special Austrian-made glasses. Presumably in an attempt to staunch the outflow of lire, they have launched a pair of lesser wines, Le Volte red and Pian dei Susini white, made substantially from indigenous grapes grown outside the carefully guarded 56 hectare estate. The next vintage of Le Volte, 1992, looks an exciting step up from the 1991, but will not be exported until the autumn. Lodovico Antinori, touring Britain's wine trade this coming week, if he can be persuaded to stick to his schedule, is determined to make one, preferably two, of the world's best wines. To all intents and purposes he has succeeded. Masseto is a sumptuous Merlot in the style of Le Pin, and the 1989, having been picked early, completely refutes the reputation of this vintage in Tuscany. Ornellaia, a Cabernet-based blend, beguiled a roomful of Masters of Wine when served blind alongside Chateau Latour last year. The 1989 is impressive, the 1988 tantalisingly unobtainable, and the 1990 a knockout. And in issue 82 of the influential US Wine Advocate newsletter, 'the brother' and 'the cousin' scored 90 to Ornellaia's 93. Ornellaia 1990 is Pounds 23.83, 1989 is Pounds 21.49 and Masseto 1989 is Pounds 29.25 from Winecellars, London SW18 tel 081-871-3979, fax 081-874-8380. Le Volte 1992 should be less than Pounds 10.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / National champion on the ropes: Alan Cane and John Ridding report on the plight of the French computer maker Of all the files on the desk of Mr Gerard Longuet, the French minister for industry, the most problematic is that of Groupe Bull, the loss-making state-controlled computer manufacturer. Since taking his post with the new centre-right government in March, Mr Longuet has repeatedly demanded that the computer group draw up a restructuring plan aimed at stemming losses which threaten its survival. 'Bull must be taken in hand,' the industry minister said bluntly in July. Now, after numerous rounds of negotiations between Mr Bernard Pache, Bull's chairman, and the government, a recovery plan is nearing completion. Government officials say it is a matter of days, or weeks at the most. Bull and the government are tight-lipped about the plan. It is understood, however, that at its heart is a request for a capital injection of FFr9.2bn (Pounds 1bn) to fund radical restructuring over the next two years. This is in addition to a contribution of FFr2.5bn approved in February by the previous government. Sources close to Bull insist that a capital injection of this magnitude is necessary if the group is to survive. It is needed to: restore the balance sheet to a healthy state; pay for restructuring measures, including factory closures and the loss of thousands of jobs; fund a substantial programme of retraining to transform Bull from a predominantly hardware manufacturer to a global supplier of software and services, with hardware playing a less important role. But whether the cash injection can bail out the company will depend on the plan's acceptance by the European Commission. The first hurdle for Bull lies in Brussels. Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner is expected this week to announce an inquiry into French state capital injections into the computer group. If all, or even part, of the FFr9.2bn requested under the new plan were to be endorsed by the French government, this would be added to the scope of the EC inquiry. Even if the computer group receives approval for a fresh capital contribution, however, its business strategy and prospects remain highly uncertain. Losses in the first half of the year mounted to FFr1.98bn from FFr1.69bn. Under the management of Mr Pache, chairman since June last year, Bull has already taken several big steps towards restructuring. In July this year, the company announced plans to cut its workforce by 6,500 by the end of 1994. This reduction, from a total of 35,175 at the end of last year, is just the latest step in staff reductions. In 1989, Bull had 47,000 employees. The new plan, however, is thought to prescribe a structural and managerial reorganisation more radical than any Bull has yet undergone. It will mean a profound change in the culture of the company. At present, Bull is organised by geographic region; under the terms of the new plan it is expected to be organised by product or service category, a concept sometimes called 'line of business'. Individual countries will be responsible for implementing, but not for determining, business strategy. Radical changes are expected at Zenith Data Systems, a US personal computer maker which Bull bought in 1989 and which has since proved a heavy drain on the company's resources. It is thought that virtually all the company's operational losses of FFr642m in 1992 were attributable to ZDS. Analysts attribute ZDS's weakness to poor management, including the decision to continue manufacturing personal computers at Villeneuve d'Ascq in France and St Joseph, Michigan, where overheads are high. ZDS today loses money on each PC it sells; sales volume has been improving over the past two years, magnifying the company's problems. It is thought the plan will recommend an end to PC manufacturing at Villeneuve and St Joseph. Instead it suggests further exploitation of the company's link with Packard Bell, a US PC maker which sources its hardware in east Asia and has expertise in low-cost marketing and distribution. In June, Bull announced that it was taking a 19.9 per cent stake in Packard Bell. Under the terms of the agreement, ZDS and Packard Bell will jointly design and manufacture desktop PCs while ZDS will supply its American partner with notebook and sub-notebook computers. The deal will enable Bull to share production and development costs. Analysts argue that even if Bull wins the investment requested, it will still need to build upon existing strategic alliances and to form new partnerships with other international computer groups. Within the next two months, for example, the French company is expected to announce a co-operation agreement with NEC, the Japanese computer company, for the development of powerful mainframe computers. The agreement with NEC, which holds just under 5 per cent of Bull's shares, will be aimed at supplying the top end of the business market, where profit margins are relatively high. NEC already provides Bull with its top-end mainframes and some observers believe it might be prepared to extend its stake in the company to safeguard its European distribution channel. Further investment from International Business Machines, which hold a 5.7 per cent stake, is unlikely. Alliances with Europe's remaining hardware manufacturers, the troubled Olivetti of Italy and Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, are equally unlikely. However, Bull would welcome an alliance with a large systems integrator or a telecommunications company. Without further alliances and success in cutting costs, the outlook appears bleak. Continued support for Bull as an integrated computer manufacturer remains conditional on improved performance. The French budget deficit, forecast at FFr317bn this year, and resistance from Brussels place a limit on assistance. The new plan may, therefore, represent the last throw of the dice for the struggling computer group.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pension prejudice misguided Sir, One begins to feel, on reading the reviews of your columnists and of other journalists, first that the Goode committee recommendations are being evaluated against the presumption that all employer-run pension schemes are being managed by potential fraudsters and, second, that 'time is catching up with the UK's occupational pensions industry'. The implication is usually that final salary schemes are being 'caught up with'. This strikes me as a triumph of prejudice over reason. I think it is not a question of employees deserting final salary schemes, but that misguided popular sentiment, compounded by regulation with which it will prove expensive for the smaller scheme to comply, will increasingly dissuade employers from offering final salary schemes. At a stroke this will solve the contentious matter of the ownership of surpluses (there aren't any in a money purchase scheme) and the employer will be delighted to be rid of the open-ended commitment to make up the fund if the investments are not performing in line with liabilities. And what will fund members get? A group money purchase scheme or a personal pension, the final outcome of either being both unpredictable and not guaranteed. Further, they are subject to the state of the financial markets at the time of maturity. In addition, the input value of the contributions is likely to have been affected by the amount of salesmen's commissions. Most final salary schemes will give the pensioner a better deal than the above alternatives, but if people have been conditioned to preferring money purchase schemes, I can only say let them get on with it and I hope that at the end of the day they are satisfied with the result. My preference is self evident. I understand that likely future patterns of employment may make final salary schemes less relevant than they once were, but that is no reason to threaten the interests of individuals who have maybe 20 years or more of service in such a scheme and are likely to complete full service. They are beginning to worry, not about a Maxwell, but about the value of their fund or contributions being diminished by fiscal discrimination and potentially expensive regulation, and perhaps even wound up because their employer, wearied by the increasing hassle, opts for change to a money purchase scheme.

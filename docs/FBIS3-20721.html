			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Strikes Could Not Achieve Objective"] </F>   [Text] The chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army, General  Momcilo Perisic, stated yesterday that even the use of large  contingents of air power would result in small gains. Thus, from  the military point of view, the desired objective would not be  achieved.    Commenting on the bombing threats yesterday on the Radio  Kragujevac program "The Sign of the Times," Chief of Staff  Perisic said: ``Since the makers of the so-called new world  order have decided to finish everything on these Balkans  territories without direct engagement of their troops, and since  the scenario has somehow been developing slowly, while they are  in a hurry, they now want to resolve the situation as soon as  possible by using major forces from the air.    ``There are different opinions about this in the world, but  I  personally think that this is another threat designed to create  pressure. However, if this were to happen, it would achieve  meager results, and from the military standpoint it would not  achieve the proposed objective.    ``The Western specialists are aware of this, and that is why  there are opposing views in the world. Therefore I think that  air attacks will not happen, but if they did, I believe the  Serbs in the republic of Srpska, and particularly their military  leadership, would be wise enough to avoid being hit. In other  words, they would be wise enough to take up positions that would  offer them maximum protection.''    When he was asked to comment on the special FRY military  units that allegedly are fighting in the republic of Srpska on  the side of its army, the chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army  said:    ``There is no organized transfer of Yugoslav military to the  republic of Srpska, and it will not happen in the foreseeable  future. I assert that not a single unit of the Yugoslav Army has  gone there, nor is any unit fighting in the republic of Srpska  or the republic of Serbian Krajina.''</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. An owner of a Contract may allocate purchase payments to one or more subaccounts of the Account, and the purchase payments will be credited with the investment experience of the chosen subaccount or subaccounts. An owner of a Contract may also allocate purchase payments to the guaranteed interest option, part of the general account of Century Life, and such payments will be credited with interest as provided for in the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The minimum initial purchase payment for Nonqualified Contracts is $5,000 and for Qualified Contracts, other than those sold in connection with tax sheltered annuity arrangements (``TSAs''), the amount is $2,000. Subsequent purchase payments must be at least $1,000 and may be made any time before the annuity date and during the annuitant's lifetime. Initial and subsequent purchase payments for TSAs must be at least $25, and such payments in each Contract year must total $300 and be paid pursuant to a schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Contract provides for a series of annuity payments beginning on the annuity date. The Contract owner may select from four annuity payment options, two of which are available only as a fixed annuity and two of which are available as either a variable or a fixed annuity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. If the owner of a Contract dies prior to the annuity date and the Contract is in force, Century Life will, upon receipt of due proof of death, pay a death benefit. If the annuitant is age 75 or younger, the death benefit is equal to the greatest of: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Aggregate purchase payments made under the Contract less partial withdrawals as of the date that Century Life receives due proof of death; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Contract value as of the date that Century Life receives due proof of death; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The death benefit floor amount as of the date of death plus any net purchase payments and minus any partial withdrawals made since the most recent death benefit floor computation anniversary; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> less premium taxes not previously deducted and any outstanding loan amount on the date the death benefit is paid. The death benefit floor amount is the Contract value on the most recent death benefit floor computation anniversary. Death benefit floor computation anniversaries occur on the seventh Contract anniversary and each seventh Contract anniversary thereafter prior to the annuitant's 76th birthday. After the annuitant's 76th birthday, the death benefit will equal the Contract value less any outstanding loan amount and any applicable premium taxes not previously deducted as of the date that Century Life receives due proof of the annuitant's death. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. On each Contract anniversary prior to the annuity date, Century Life deducts from the variable Contract value an annual fee of $30. Applicants guarantee that this charge will not increase and state that the charge reimburses Century Life for administrative expenses relating to the Contract. The fee will be deducted from each subaccount based on the proportion that the value in each such subaccount bears to the total Contract value. After the annuity date, the annual Contract fee is deducted from variable annuity payments. Applicants represent that this charge will be deducted in reliance upon Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act and that the charge represents reimbursement only for administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. Applicants further represent that Century Life does not anticipate a profit from this charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Century Life deducts a daily administrative charge equal to an annual effective rate of .15% of the assets of the Account. The application states that this charge will compensate Century Life for certain expenses incurred in administering the Contracts. Applicants represent that this charge will be deducted in reliance upon Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act and that the charge represents reimbursement only for administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. Applicants further represent that Century Life does not expect to make a profit from this charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Although no fee is currently charged for transfers, Century Life reserves the right to charge $10 for the 13th and each subsequent transfer during a Contract year. The transfer fee will be deducted from the subaccount or guarantee amount from which the transfer is made. Applicants represent that where the fee is imposed, Applicants will rely upon Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act for the deduction. Applicants state that the transfer fee will represent reimbursement only for administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. Applicants further represent that Century Life does not anticipate a profit from this charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Applicants note that various governmental entities levy a premium tax, currently ranging up to 3.5%, on annuity contracts, such as the Contracts, issued by insurance companies. The timing of the tax levies varies among taxing authorities. The application states that if applicable to a Contract, premium taxes will be deducted either: (a) From purchase payments as received; (b) from Contract value upon withdrawal or surrender; (c) from adjusted Contract value upon application to an annuity payment option; or (d) upon payment of a death benefit. Applicants note that Century Life reserves the right to deduct premium taxes at the time such taxes are incurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

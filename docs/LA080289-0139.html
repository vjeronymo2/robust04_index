			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIET OLYMPIC GYMNAST DROPPED OVER HIS BOOZING  </P> <P> Olympic triple gold medalist Dimitry Bilozerchev has been dropped from the  Soviet team for the World Gymnastics Championships because he went on a two-day  drinking binge, a newspaper reported today.  </P> <P> Bilozerchev, 22, and teammate Vladimir Gogoladze "had a corrupting influence on  other members of the team," top Soviet gymnastics official Leonid Arkayev told  Sovietsky Sport. Gogoladze was also dropped, the report said.  </P> <P> Bilozerchev was known to have an alcohol problem. He was in an auto accident in  1985 while driving drunk and broke his leg but recovered to compete again.  </P> <P> Last year, he made a spectacular comeback, scoring six perfect marks and  winning gold medals in the pommel horse and rings and as part of the Soviet  men's team at the Seoul Olympics. He also took the bronze medal in the men's  all-around.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neighbor's Warning  </P> <P> The World Gymnastics Championships are scheduled for Stuttgart, West Germany,  Oct. 15 to 22.  </P> <P> Sovietsky Sport said a neighbor of Bilozerchev's had warned the newspaper  before the 1985 accident that the gymnast was drinking too much vodka. He was  almost expelled from the Soviet team just before the Seoul Olympics for his  drinking, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> Sovietsky Sport said his latest problems started when Bilozerchev and Gogoladze  failed to show up at a sports training center during a drinking binge.  </P> <P> Bilozerchev had announced at the beginning of the year that he would give up  gymnastics.  </P></p>

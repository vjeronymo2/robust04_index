Jiang made the remarks at a meeting with a visiting U.S.  six-member delegation from the House of Representatives, led by  majority leader Richard Gephardt.    The U.S. Congress has a unique role to play in the making of  U.S. domestic and foreign policies, Jiang said, adding that it  can exert its influence in promoting the development of  Sino-U.S. ties.    Since last year, more than 100 U.S. congressmen have visited  China. Jiang said that the visits would help them to learn  about China's real situation and to make right decisions  regarding Sino-U.S. ties.    The past few years have witnessed fruitful Sino-U.S.  economic  and trade cooperation, he said, and it has been proved that  China and the U.S. are highly complementary to each other in the  economic and trade fields and they have wide spheres of  cooperation.    Gephardt said that the U.S. and China are two great nations.  It is of great significance for leaders of the two countries to  maintain their contacts. He added that active relations looking  to the future should be developed between the two countries.    Gephardt said he learned a lot about China during the  current  trip and saw major positive changes in the country's economic  sphere.    The U.S. is looking forward to developing more successful  and  closer ties with China, he said.    Among those taking part in the meeting were Liu Shuqing,  president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs,  Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu and U.S. Ambassador to  China Stapleton Roy.    This morning, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji also met Gephardt and  the other U.S. congressmen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yi Hyok-chae] </F>   [Text] There are well-known spy organizations in the world,  such as the U.S. CIA, the former Soviet Union's KGB, Israel's  Mossad, and Britain's MI6. However, it is the North Korean spy  organization that can do us direct harm.    President Kim Yong-sam, in a recent meeting with Yi Ki-taek,  representative of the opposition Democratic Party, said that  North Korea has continued to send its spies to the South. The  North Korean spy organization is often called "Office Complex  No. 3." Mr. An Myong-chin, former North Korean spy who defected  to the South crossing the DMZ last September, disclosed the  status of the North Korean spy organization in the April issue  of Japanese monthly THIS IS YOMIURI.    The North Korean spy training institute has changed its name  several times. It was called Kumgang School when its was  established in 1945, Kumsong Political and Military School in  the mid-sixties, Political School Directly Belonging to the  Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee in the eighties,  and Kim Chong-il Political and Military College in January 1992.  The spy training school is located in the Yongsong District in  Pyongyang, a mountainous area in the outskirts of Pyongyang.  The school is under the WPK Operations Department, which  specializes in southward operations. The school site covers an  area of a 10 km radius. Kim Hyon-hui, the terrorist who blasted  the Korean airliner, was also trained in this school. To become  a student of this school, one has to have a clean record and a  good background, good health, and a good brain. There are about  400 trainers.    After graduation, the students are attached to the  Operations  Department (headed by O Kuk-yol), Social and Cultural Department  (head unknown), the Reunification Front Department (headed by  Kang Chu-il), or the External Information Investigation  Department--commonly called the Investigation  Department--(headed by Kwon Hui-kyong). All these departments  are under the WPK. Of these, the Operations, Social and  Cultural, and Reunification Front Departments are charged with  southward operations. Spies attached to the Operations  Department take the role of guiding other spies when they  infiltrate the ROK through the DMZ, or sometimes they themselves  infiltrate the South. The task of the Social and Cultural  Department is to plant long-term permanent spies or intelligence  organizations in the ROK. The role of the Reunification Front  Department is to conduct open activities, such as the  inter-Korean dialogue.    The Investigation Department is charged with overseas  clandestine operations [haewoe kongjak]. Those from the spy  training institute's branch schools are mostly assigned to these  operations. Branch schools are called differently in each  district, such as Kumgangsan District, Myohyangsan District,  Chilbosan District. Kim Hyon-hui received his Investigation  Department training in the Myohyangsan District branch school  for one year beginning in 1981. The spy training institute,  currently called Kim Chong-il Political and Military College,  operates a model town -- also under the Social and Cultural  Department -- where trainees can accustom themselves to the  living environment of the South.    The trainees numbered 100 in 1945 when the training  institute  was first established, 450 in the eighties, and 300 in 1989,  showing a considerable change between periods. The training  period was one year initially. It was increased to three and  four years, and then fixed at five years since 1991 because of  the requirement for more sophisticated spy techniques with the  passage of time.    Spy training, which begins at 0600 and ends at 2200, is  harsh  and varied, covering areas such as blasting, swimming, diving,  parachuting, infiltration, abduction, martial arts,  communications, and driving. In the case of shooting, the  trainee is trained to shoot at a target from the front, the  rear, and while running after it to ensure that the bullet hits  the target under any conditions. Trainees learn to use various  guns, such as Chinese, Russian, Czech, U.S., and Canadian guns.  Trainees sometimes concentrate solely on shooting training for  a month, and have to shoot about 25,000 bullets before  graduation. Trainees are trained to infiltrate into the ROK;  therefore, they have to learn thoroughly about the life in the  ROK. For this, there is an 8-km-long miniature model town  depicting the ROK landscape. There is a street with a  restaurant, coffee shop, supermarket, stationery store, and  movie theater. Traffic signals and pedestrian crossings are the  same as those in Seoul. There is a subway and a bus terminal.  The trainees buy things with South Korean money and see movies  here and learn about life in the South. Mr. An, who defected to  the South, testified that the subway and the bus terminal in  Seoul are exactly the same as those in the model town.    Mr. An saw ROK movies and read newspapers in the model town.  As for newspapers, CHOSON ILBO and TONG-A ILBO are delivered  three days after they are published.    Mr. An was assigned to the "715 liaison office" and went  through infiltration training twice, going as far as 2 km south  of the DMZ and returning to the training base. The training's  objective was to check the ROK Army's guard and develop  infiltration routes. The training was mainly conducted at night.  Mr. An said that he had heard from his trainer that 200 to 300  of the 1,000 North Korean spies have infiltrated South Korea.</p>

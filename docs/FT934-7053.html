			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Court rules BCCI plan unfair to creditors Creditors to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International would have been unfairly discriminated against in proposals between the liquidators to the bank and the government of Abu Dhabi, its majority shareholder, according to the detailed text of a judgment made by the Luxembourg courts late last month. Proposals offered to Abu Dhabi by the three court-appointed liquidators would have breached Luxembourg civil law by ranking it above other unsecured creditors. The document says the proposal allowing Abu Dhabi to offset Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.27bn) in claims against its debts to BCCI companies would break the rule of parity between Abu Dhabi and other unsecured creditors, which should all be treated equally. It also rules that the liquidators' proposals to divide equally with Abu Dhabi the proceeds of any legal actions taken against third parties in connection with the collapse of the bank would be a concession to Abu Dhabi to the detriment of other unsecured creditors. The details shed new light on the surprise decision in the Luxembourg appeals court on October 27, which refused to provide the necessary ratification to allow the liquidators to proceed with their proposals. The fact that the agreement negotiated by the liquidators for a payment of up to Dollars 2bn from the government of Abu Dhabi was in the best interests of unsecured creditors was 'not the sole or even the primary criterion' in the court's decision to reject the liquidators' proposals, the translated verdict says. Equally irrelevant was the lack of a 'serious alternative' to the plan offered by the three BCCI creditors who opposed the liquidators and called for a greater settlement from Abu Dhabi. Judge Raoul Gretsch, a senior judge, announced the verdict in favour of the appeal brought by three creditors to the bank, Mr Adil Elias, Mr Hal Skolnik and Mr Assilaos Artiki, who wanted a greater contribution from Abu Dhabi as part of the settlement. The judgment said found in favour of the appeal, but on the grounds that the proposals included a number of points that which in their current form amounted to a breach of Luxembourg civil law. That suggests the liquidators may have to restructure their proposals to obtain Luxembourg approval even if they obtain agreement for a higher contribution from Abu Dhabi, as desired by the three creditors who made the appeal. The document also argues that Abu Dhabi has broken Luxembourg law by refusing to hand to the liquidators papers and documents to which they are entitled under Luxembourg law. It reveals that the liquidators were planning to receive payment from Abu Dhabi under their proposals into an offshore bank account in Jersey, maintained by Law Debenture. All legal costs incurred in the appeal will be charged against BCCI assets, says the Luxembourg document. It reveals details of a legal action by the liquidators not previously reported. Interfiduciaire, a chartered accountancy and tax advisory firm which audited BCCI in Luxembourg, has been sued.</p>

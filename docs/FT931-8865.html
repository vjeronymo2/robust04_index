			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price turns in heavy loss for year LOSSES at Abitibi-Price, the Canadian forestry group, almost quadrupled last year as a result of the severe slump in the newsprint and other paper markets. The loss from continuing operations was CDollars 200m (USDollars 160m), or CDollars 2.91 a share, up from CDollars 58m, or 86 cents a share, in 1991. The company also reported a loss of CDollars 19m last year from businesses which have been classified as discontinued operations, compared to a CDollars 18.2m loss in 1991. In spite of an increase of almost 10 per cent in sales volumes, revenues were almost unchanged at CDollars 1.7bn. Metall Mining, the Canadian mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft group, is buying out the 49.6 per cent minority holding in Minnova, a Canadian exploration and development company, in a deal worth CDollars 115m (USDollars 90.8m), writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Metall will offer one of its own shares and CDollars 4 cash for each Minnova share it does not own. At Monday's market price for Metall, the offer is worth about CDollars 16.12 per Minnova share, representing a premium of about CDollars 2 over the market price of Minnova shares.</p>

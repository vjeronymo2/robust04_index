			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON SEEKING WAY FOR LINCOLN INVESTORS TO SUE U.S. GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston indicated Friday he will seek to forge a path so that  jilted bond holders of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan can make a claim against U.S.  taxpayers for their losses, which are figured at $200 million or more.  </P> <P> As part of a new campaign to take the political offensive in the scandal of  Lincoln's collapse, the beleaguered Cranston held press conferences in Los  Angeles and San Diego to insist that federal regulators were culpable in the  sale of bonds to more than 22,000 Californians -- bonds that now are believed  to be worthless.  </P> <P> Bond holders have said that they wrongly believed the investments they bought  at Lincoln branch offices were backed by federal insurance.  </P> <P> The four-term, 75-year-old senator is struggling for his political survival as  a result of the Lincoln collapse, in which his intervention with federal  regulators on Lincoln's behalf has drawn heavy criticism.  </P> <P> Cranston said regulators, under Edwin J. Gray, the former head of the Federal  Home Loan Bank Board, "had overall responsibility for examining the sale of  uninsured bonds at Lincoln Savings -- and he had responsibility for stopping  the sale if it was improper."  </P> <P> Therefore, Cranston said, the foundation exists "for claims by the unfortunate  bond holders against the United States government," in the event the bonds  cannot be covered by the assets of the bankrupted Lincoln, its holding company,  American Continental Corp., and its chairman, Charles H. Keating.  </P> <P> But federal law is complicated in this area, and Cranston acknowledged that he  believes bond holders do not have the right to sue the U.S. Treasury, at least  not yet.  </P> <P> "But that's a step that may be dealt with," said Cranston. "I'll have more to  say on that shortly." It was the second time in a week that Cranston told the  bond holders to hang tight, offering them some hope.  </P> <P> Cranston was asked how the bond holders could come to have the opportunity to  sue the government in this case.  </P> <P> "One way could be legislation to grant them that right. I'm considering that.  I'll have an announcement on that shortly," he said.  </P> <P> He scheduled a press conference on the subject for Monday.  </P> <P> Cranston seemed at pains, though, to keep bond holders from hoping for too  much, too fast.  </P> <P> He said he was not at all sure that the restitution of lost savings could be  accomplished by 1992, when he will run for reelection. "It is impossible to get  an instant solution," he said.  </P> <P> Bond holders already have sued the state government, seeking restitution.  </P> <P> Cranston's troubles in the Lincoln debacle stem from the acceptance of $850,000  from Keating by voter registration committees linked to the senator and his  acceptance of $47,000 in campaign contributions. Cranston later intervened on  Lincoln's behalf before federal regulators.  </P> <P> Cranston had previously asked the General Accounting Office to determine  whether U.S. taxpayers were liable for the losses suffered by the people who  invested their savings in Lincoln bonds. Last month, the GAO declined to offer  an opinion while the bond holders still had claims pending against Lincoln. But  the GAO noted that there is no provision in the law requiring taxpayer  restitution for such high-risk bonds.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, on Friday Cranston said he had reviewed the facts in the case and  concluded that U.S. government regulators had failed in their responsibility.  </P> <P> Cranston rejects any blame for Lincoln's collapse. He insists that he sought  only to bring to a conclusion, one way or another, a long-running audit of the  troubled savings and loan. Federal regulators said Cranston and four other  senators who received Keating contributions and joined in the intervention were  applying undue pressure on the regulatory process.  </P> <P> For months the Lincoln mess has drained Cranston's political support, as  measured by polls, and has encouraged any number of fellow Democratic  politicians to plot primary election challenges against him.  </P> <P> This week, Cranston, No. 2 in leadership in the Senate and one familiar with  the bare-knuckles style of campaigning, began an audacious comeback effort. He  began personalizing the dispute as one between himself and the then-chief  regulator, Gray, and said regulators were trying to blame the senators to cover  their own bungling.  </P></p>

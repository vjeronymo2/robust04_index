			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW DIVE OF 46 IS BIGGEST IN 3 MONTHS  </P> <P> The stock market took its steepest plunge in three months Thursday, with  recession anxiety spreading to Wall Street as bonds and the dollar finished  higher.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.47 points to close at 2,458.27, a day  after a key official barometer suggested that a U.S. economic slowdown might be  under way. The stock market plunge followed a 21.63-point drop on Wednesday and  was its sharpest decline since March 17.  </P> <P> "Private investors are thinking that a recession may be more likely than they  perceived earlier in the year," said Harold C. Nathan, a vice president and  portfolio manager with Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The jitters come during a time in which it has been hard to tell the bad  economic news from the good.  </P> <P> In contrast to stocks, bond prices rallied Thursday, as investors looked  forward to lower interest rates in a cooling economy. The dollar also gained  against other national currencies, despite rising interest rates in Europe that  ordinarily would undermine the value of dollar-denominated investments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recession Fears  </P> <P> Until recently, investors have been upbeat about economic prospects in light of  forecasts that a slump could be avoided, especially if inflation remains under  control. But the psychology affecting stocks turned gloomier with Wednesday's  release of the government's index of leading economic indicators. The gauge for  May took its worst dive since November, 1987. It was the third decline in the  last four months.  </P> <P> "People are starting to think that maybe we're not going to have a soft  landing, maybe we're going to have a recession," said Eric McCluskey, a  research associate with the investment firm of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards  Inc. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> As recently as last Friday, news that orders for durable goods such as cars and  equipment fell in May was greeted as a happy sign that interest rates would  fall, but with little economic damage. On that day the Dow Jones average shot  up 49.7 points.  </P> <P> But Wednesday's release of the leading indicators -- documenting a sweeping  fall-off in money supply, consumer confidence, orders for consumer goods and  other measures of economic health -- seemed to take a toll on the confidence of  shareholders.  </P> <P> Fear of recession "definitely carried over from yesterday," McCluskey said of  Thursday's stock nose dive.  </P> <P> On the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, declines led advances 1,319 to 263 on  volume of 167,100,000 shares, up from 158,470,000 shares Wednesday.  </P> <P> In addition to fears of an economic slump, some analysts said the stock market  was affected by a wave of institutional investors seeking to cash in profits at  the end of the quarter, a gambit known as "window-dressing."  </P> <P> "There's a lot of institutional selling going on," McCluskey said.  </P> <P> Thomas Stevens, chief investment officer for Wilshire Asset Management in Santa  Monica, attributed the stock market's wild swings in recent days to doubts  about which way the economy is headed. In such a climate, he maintained,  uncertain investors are more likely to react in a stampede with each new  economic indicator, even though no single statistic can be expected to reveal  what the future holds.  </P> <P> "I think investors would rather have a consensus of recession or a consensus of  growth," Stevens said. "That would tell them what to do."  </P> <P> On Thursday, losers among the blue chips included International Business  Machines, down 2 3/8 at 111 1/2; General Electric, down 1 at 52 3/8; USX, down  7/8 at 34 3/4; Eastman Kodak, down 1 3/8 at 47 5/8, and American Telephone  &amp; Telegraph, down 5/8 at 35 1/2.  </P> <P> Banc One, which won the bidding to acquire the failed banks formerly operated  by MCorp, led the active list, up 4 7/8 at 32 7/8. Amdahl, the most active  American Stock Exchange issue, fell 3 1/2 to 16 5/8. By contrast, L.A. Gear  rose 2 1/2 to 60. The footwear company posted sharply higher quarterly profits  and said its order backlog continued to increase.  </P></p>

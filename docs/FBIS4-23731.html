			<p>BFN     [Text] Zambia has mobilized 800 troops to help the United  Nations in Rwanda, where more than 500,000 civilians have been  slaughtered in a two-month civil war there. Defense Secretary  Brigadier General Jack Mwaanga said in an interview with ZNBC  [Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation] today that the 800  soldiers are ready to leave for Rwanda any time. He said the  contingent is on standby on the Copperbelt but cannot leave  without special equipment which the Zambia Army has requested  from other countries. Gen. Mwaanga said because of the  difficult nature of the operation in Rwanda, the Zambian troops  will need special equipment.</p>

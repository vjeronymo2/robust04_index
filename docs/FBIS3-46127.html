			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 26 (AFP)--Hong Kong asked Beijing  Wednesday for an "urgently needed" meeting on airport funding,  despite China's warning that it would not pay the project's  post-June 1997 debts.    A spokesman said in a statement that a meeting with Beijing  was "urgently needed to enable us reach agreement, so that these  important projects can proceed without delay."    He said the government regretted the statement issued late  Tuesday by China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, adding  that it would not help with the construction of the  20.3-billion-U.S.-dollar airport.    The Chinese statement stressed that without a Sino-Hong Kong  financial agreement on the project, China refused to recognize  any laws or contracts associated with the airport that straddle  the colony's reversion to Chinese rule in 1997.    China has repeatedly warned Hong Kong against pressing ahead  with the airport without an agreement on financing arrangements  as called for under a 1991 pact with Britain.    "We have always taken the view that it is much more  constructive to discuss these issues in formal meetings of the  airport committee, rather than through press statements," the  spokesman said.    China's announcement came four days after Hong Kong's  administration announced that it had offered to put an extra  five billion Hong Kong dollars (646.83 million U.S.) into the  airport in a bid to revive talks with Beijing on the project.    Hong Kong's financial secretary, Sir Hamish Macleod,  revealed  the offer Friday as the colony's legislature approved 1.67  billion dollars in stop-gap financing to keep work going on the  airport.    Talks on the airport have stalled since Governor Chris  Patten  angered Beijing by launching his proposals to extend democracy  in Hong Kong prior to 1997.    Although the Chinese statement expressed hope that talks  would resume, it gave no direct response to a formal request  from Britain Monday for a meeting of the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group, charged with deciding technical aspects of the  1997 transition.</p>

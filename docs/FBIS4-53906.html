			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "To Regain Asia's Glory"] </F>   [Text] The fact that China, despite its big power status,  has never adopted an expansionist or colonial policy for  centuries is a matter of historical record. Western  apprehension of China's possible emergence as a new economic  power in Asia that will use force to expand its territory is  nothing but a delirium arising from jealousy and a lack of  vision in understanding the culture of the world's biggest  nation. On the other hand, history proves that only the  Europeans have used conquest, either violent or peaceful, for  gaining wealth or for self-defense. Yesterday in Beijing, Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed told a summit meeting  entitled "China 1994," sponsored by the INTERNATIONAL HERALD  TRIBUNE, that Asia would regain its place in world civilization  if all Asian nations shared not only the benefit of China's  modernization and economic development but also saw it as a  positive contribution to progress in the region.    Surely, a prosperous and wealthy China will be able to  become  the engine of growth for the world in general and East Asia,  including Southeast Asia, in particular. A diverse market will  be created in China, whose 1.2 billion people enjoy only half of  the U.S. wealth. Nevertheless, China still needs to import from  Southeast Asian neighbors such commodities as cooking oil, gas,  oil products, and manufactured goods. All Asian nations must  grab this opportunity through economic cooperation with China  instead of seeing this country as a giant to whom we should not  be close. The entire region may benefit from China's wealth  through trade and economic relations.    Strangely, nations that believe that China's emergence as an  economic power will threaten their position are not equally  apprehensive of the economic power of Japan, which colonized  them half a century ago. In this regard, we agree with Dr.  Mahathir that if Southeast Asian nations are not apprehensive of  Japan, they should not be apprehensive of China either. If such  a feeling is inevitable, they should be apprehensive of the two  nations. We believe that the apprehension has been influenced  by the Westerners, who do not want to see China as an economic  power. For them, Japan's success in dominating the world  economy and technology is enough to disprove their belief that  the Europeans deserve to lead the world.    Being Asian, the countries in the region should dismiss the  idea as there is no reason for them to help the Europeans thwart  China's efforts and slow down Asia's efforts to gain their equal  rights as world citizens. In addition, they should not be  apprehensive of China's efforts to turn itself into a military  power because any countries with strong economies would do the  same. Moreover, seen from the perspective of international  politics, China's emergence as a world politico-military power  will at least counter the domination of the United States as a  single superpower following the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The Westerners are so apprehensive of such a situation that  they have sought various pretexts, including alleged violations  of human rights and freedom in China to gain international  support for their efforts to isolate China.    We believe that all Asian nations are well aware of the  West's decadent strategy because some of them have also become  the victims of the same tactics. As the prime minister said,  Asian nations have a different view of China because they  understand China. China has introduced the socialist market  economy in an attempt to avoid an economic and political anarchy  plaguing Russia. We also understand how China will implement  the process of revolutionizing its society to enable all its  people to enjoy overall prosperity in the 21st century.    We are confident that progress in Asia will be complete and  the continent will regain its place in world civilization if  China's modernization and economic development succeeds. Those  who have doubts over this possibility should refer to the  Prophet Mohamed's appeal to his followers to go as far as China  to gain knowledge some 1,414 years ago.</p>

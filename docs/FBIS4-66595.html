			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 22--Mongolia considered Kashmir as  an integral part of India and any outstanding issues between  India and Pakistan should be "resolved within the ambit of the  Shimla agreement, bilaterally."    This Mongolian position was conveyed by the visiting  President, Mr Pansalmaagiyn Ochirbat, in unambiguous terms here  on Tuesday to the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, during  their meeting on Tuesday morning.    The Mongolian leader further felt that India's peaceful and  non-violent approach was something to be emulated by the whole  world.    The two leaders felt that bilateral cooperation between the  two countries must be strengthened for mutual benefit and  advantage. Mr Narasimha Rao referred to the joint committee now  being set up at the just concluded round of summit talks would  promote co-operation in the economic, science and technology  areas. He further expressed the hope the joint committee would  not only implement the decisions taken but should also identify  new areas of cooperation.    The two leaders also discussed regional issues and felt that  regional cooperation in Asia should be strengthened.    They also discussed the possibilities of cooperation in  different areas such as, mining including exploration of uranium  reserves in Mongolia, oil deposits, and agriculture and agreed  that details should be worked out by the just set-up joint  committee.    The two countries on Tuesday signed a treaty on friendly  relations and co-operation between the two countries and four  other agreements--(a) for establishing of a joint committee for  economic commercial and science and technological cooperation,  (b) avoidance of double taxation, (c) cultural exchange  programme, 1994-96, and (d) cooperation in health, 1994-96.    Addressing a 40-minute press conference later in the day,  the  Mongolian President asserted that his visit to India "is very  successful." With his meeting with the President, Dr Shankar  Dayal Sharma, on Monday and the Prime Minister, Mr P.V.  Narasimha Rao, on Tuesday, his delegation has completed "main  political agenda." He attached great importance to the  strengthening of Mongolia's bilateral ties with India. He also  attached paramount importance to the just signed treaty of  friendly relations and cooperation as well as the setting up of  the joint committee.    He pointed out that his country has great reserves of  uranium  and petroleum, and Mongolia is prepared to undertake  feasibility studies with any country, including India. In reply  to a specific question about possible Indian participation, the  Mongolian leader's forthright reply was that his country "has no  reservation with regard to any country.</p>

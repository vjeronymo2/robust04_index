			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Huancayo, Peru, 7 Mar (EFE) -- It was reported here  today that last week an Army patrol killed a terrorist and the  police seized a large volume of weapons, ammunition, and  explosives in various areas in Junin Department.    The political-military command issued a communique, which  was  disseminated today in Huancayo, Junin's capital, saying that on  4 March an Army patrol, alerted by local inhabitants, captured a  terrorist group in Ipoki, between the jungle settlements of  Satipo and Chanchamayo.    The communique says that an undetermined number of  subversives escaped, although one of them was wounded by the  military. The wounded subversive died while on his way to a  hospital.    The terrorist had in his possession two grenades and Tupac  Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) propaganda. This group has  been practically disbanded by security forces.    On 3 and 4 March police raided three residences in the area  surrounding Huancayo, 315 km east of Lima, and seized a large  number of weapons, explosives, two grenade boxes, diverse  caliber ammunition, and military clothing.    The residences allegedly served as arsenals and hideouts for  Shining Path activists. The police source did not give details  but added that several people were detained.    According to private and public statistics disseminated  today, terrorist activities are gradually decreasing in the  country. The relative Shining Path and MRTA presence has been  reduced to only three areas in the country in recent years.    Both subversive organizations have been hard hit by security  forces since 1992 and 95 percent of their leaders have been  captured and sentenced to life in prison, including Shining  Path's highest- ranking leader, Abimael Guzman, and MRTA top  leader Victor Polay.</p>

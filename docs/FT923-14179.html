			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Gibbon Lyons falls 22% to Pounds 806,000 A 22 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 806,166, was announced by Gibbon Lyons Group, the USM-quoted printing ink, dyestuffs and paints company, for the year to March 31. Mr Michael Gibbon, chairman, said the group had managed to sustain sales at Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 23.1m) 'in spite of fierce competition and price cutting'. A wages freeze and further staff reductions had been made, but profits had been affected by a need for further provisions for bad and doubtful debts, he said, including more than Pounds 100,000 in France. Earnings per share fell from 10.5p to 4.8p and the proposed final dividend is cut to 3p for a 5p (6p) total on increased capital. An encouraging start to the current year had been made, Mr Gibbon said, partly due to the introduction of new projects and efforts to eliminate lossmaking areas.</p>

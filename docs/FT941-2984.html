			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Malaysia urged to reverse trade bias Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday he hoped Malaysia would reverse its recent discrimination against trade with British companies, in spite of fresh indications that it was hardening its stance. Mr Heseltine said he hoped both countries would restore good trading relations 'at the earliest opportunity'. His comments came as Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, appeared to take a hard line towards trade relations after allegations that a British offer of aid to help Malaysia build the Pergau dam was linked to sales of defence equipment. In a letter to the Financial Times, published yesterday, Dr Mahathir attacked British press reporting on the Pergau dam issue, saying there would be no contracts for British companies as long as 'lies' were written in the British press about the issue. Meanwhile, Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of Earth, told the Commons foreign affairs committee yesterday that Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, could have broken the Overseas Development Administration's rules on aid and trade provision when he gave final approval for funds to be sent to Malaysia in July 1991. Mr Lees said: 'The payment in the Pergau case was not within the published rules and procedures.' Mr Hurd could only have abided by the regulations if he had secured Treasury permission to go ahead.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Arts: Dominican 'Running Dream' In Running Dream Trish Cooke has gone in search of her Carribean roots. Her family came over to England from Dominica, a tiny island with a distinctive Anglo-French culture. Through the characters of grandmother, mother and daughters, Cooke conjures with times past, times present, memory and reality. It is more an evocation of mood rather than drama. When Florentine (Claudette Williams) chases William (Wilbert Johnson), the father of her two girls, to England, she takes one child, Grace (Sherlina Chamberlain) with her, leaving the other, Clementine (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), behind to be looked after by her grandmother. Many years later Grace travels back to Dominica to find her home. Dominica is full of light and sparkle, childish games and casual courtships. England, the place of promise and achievement, offers sickness and materialism. It is no contest, especially when Dominica has all the best tunes. The most uplifting moments are when the excellent cast break into song or into the local patois, an intriguing creole of English, French and African. Andrea Montag's simple wooden verandah set suggests heat and warmth in Dominica; imprisonment in England. The evening would have been livelier if the plot had matched the atmosphere, but events are touched upon rather than investigated. The transience of Carribean men is well illustrated by their fleeting appearances on stage. William gives Grace one more child Bianca (Cathy Tyson) on her arrival in England, and then only pops up again at her death bed to urge a belated return to the island of innocence. The character of Bianca, the successful English woman, is only lightly sketched and one doubts whether she will be really happy back in the ancestral village. More could have been made of local folk lore and music but director Olusola Oyeleye certainly lifts you away from bleak Stratford. The play does not preach, does not judge. It offered to what must have been one of the largest gatherings of Dominicans in London an instant plug into their folk memory. They loved it. Theatre Royal, Stratford East: 081-534 0310</p>

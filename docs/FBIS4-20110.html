			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Christopher Lockwood report: "Germany Drops Threat of Beef </F> Ban in `Mad Cow' Row"]    [Text] Britain appeared to have won a significant victory  yesterday over German attempts to ban British beef because of  fears of "mad cow" disease.    Herr Jochen Borchert, German Agriculture Minister, told  journalists at an EC meeting in Luxembourg that he was now  seeking "a European solution." This appears to be a significant  climb-down, as Herr Horst Seehofer, the German Health Minister,  said last month that Germany would take unilateral action  against British beef imports.    The German position has found no sympathy in Brussels, where  Agriculture and Health Ministers have pronounced themselves  content with measures taken by Britain to ensure that meat from  infected cows does not enter the human food chain. The European  Commission has also warned Germany that unilateral restrictions  would be illegal.    The battle is not yet over. Herr Borchert will be pushing  the Commission to institute more screening procedures for beef,  but it appears that the threat of unilateral action has been  withdrawn.    However, Mrs Gillian Shephard, Britain's Agriculture  Minister, said: "It is clearly a retreat by the Germans. I am  not prepared to tolerate any question of a unilateral ban on a  British product."    She has accused Germany of scare-mongering by voicing fears  about British beef. These, she contended, were having a  devastating effect on an export business worth some 8 million  pounds a year, and were affecting other British products such as  lamb.    To encourage Germany to back down, the Commission has  announced measures that include a study of procedures for the  processing of meat-and-bone meal, considered the primary cause  of infection. Britain has already banned the feeding of cows on  meal from other ruminants, after recognition that meal from  diseased sheep was the most likely cause of cow infection.</p>

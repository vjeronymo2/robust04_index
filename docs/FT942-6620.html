			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Orchestras strung out - Off the wall These are miserable times for members of London's four great orchestras. Audiences still seem to be in modified free fall; the Arts Council is still looking at ways to cut their dwindling subsidies; freelance work is hard to find. The LPO has turned to the Musician's Union for a loan and the Philharmonia towards its rich French patron, Vincent Meyer. The RPO has cut the salary of its chief executive Paul Findlay and the performance fees of its musicians by 10 per cent. Back desk musicians with fifteen years experience now find themselves looking at incomes of just Pounds 17,000 a year. Only the LSO, bolstered by its double subsidy, from the Arts Council and the City of London, can be confident about the future. The RPO, which saw its Arts Council grant cut by 25 per cent for 1994-95, has embarked on a delicate strategy of trying to raise its critical profile while appealing to a wider market. It has signed a deal with Tring Records which guarantees 177 recording sessions over the next 15 months. In addition to the recording fees, royalties from the 125 CDs to be released, priced at Pounds 3.99 and sold everywhere from Little Chef restaurants to garage forecourts, could bring the RPO an extra Pounds 500,000 a year. Sales by the end of May for the first ten releases totalled 100,000, ahead of target. The RPO is also benefitting from a deal with Classic FM, which is worth Pounds 500,000 a year, mainly in kind, such as 250 advertising slots for the orchestra and its sponsors, plus fees for jingles and some sponsorship. A recent Festival Hall concert saw bookings rise from 25 per cent to 60 per cent in 24 hours, thanks to radio promotion. The RPO is now happier with its role as a sometime regional orchestra based in Nottingham, and hopes that extra Arts Council money will enable it to play more concerts there. At Nottingham it can experiment by abandoning the fussy orchestral attire of white tie and tails and by introducing to the concert hall a giant screen, so that listeners at the back can be brought into the heart of the performance. But London is where reputations are made and where the orchestra must premiere its best programmes. It is an expensive process: Pounds 200,000 of the RPO's Arts Council grant of Pounds 300,000 for showcase London promotions goes straight in rental to the Festival Hall. A recent concert there was enjoyed by a packed audience but actually lost the orchestra Pounds 18,000. Mrs Janet Holmes a Court was in London this week checking up on her chain of London theatres. One, the Royalty, will be sold in the next few months, probably to neighbouring LSE. She confirmed that in October the Globe in Shaftesbury Avenue will become the Gielgud, in honour of the 90th birthday of the nation's greatest living actor. The name change will coincide with a new production, by Peter Hall, of Hamlet, a play Sir John knows well. It providentially contains a part that is well within the range of a nonagenerian actor, the Ghost of Hamlet's Father. It would be a wonderful start to 'his' theatre if he could be heard, if not seen, every night during the run. One attraction for Stoll-Moss in re-naming the Globe is that London will soon have another theatre of that name - the Globe at Bankside, Sam Wanamaker's, now posthumous, dream of a re-created Jacobean theatre on virtually the same site as Shakespeare's Globe. Mrs Holmes a Court seems prepared to bless the 'old' Globe with practical help and perhaps some of the cash still needed to complete the project: Pounds 8m has been raised and another Pounds 1m is required. The planned opening date is April, 1995. It could slip two months, but the Globe will certainly open. The competition between Sotheby's and Christie's to secure masterpieces for sale has never been more cut-throat. Both auction houses desperately need million dollar lots to lift their convalescent balance sheets. So when four important collections of Impressionist and modern paintings came into view in New York, the struggle to secure them sorely tested the judgment of both salerooms. Christie's blandishments were the more effective and it scooped three of the four. Sotheby's had to make do with the collection of former CIA deputy director Gates Lloyd, which sold very nicely earlier this month. Christie's disposed of Zurich industrialist Jacques Koerfer's collection equally satisfactorily, but the paintings of financially straitened retail magnate Mershulam Riklis bombed spectacularly. The real setback for Christie's came from four paintings of the late Neil McConnell. Works by Monet, Gauguin and Sisley sold, but poorly, bringing in a disappointing Dollars 6.7m Unfortunately a Cezanne still life attracted bids of only Dollars 2.6m, well below the Dollars 4m-Dollars 5m estimate, and was bought in. This could be shrugged off but for the fact that Christie's had given the McConnell estate a non-refundable advance, probably in the region of Dollars 11m, to secure the pictures. This is a guarantee in all but name. When the art market was boiling over in the 1980s Sotheby's and Christie's tried several lures like loans to prospective buyers and guarantees for sellers. When Alan Bond could not pay back the money he borrowed from Sotheby's to enable him to acquire Van Gogh's 'Irises', loans fell out of favour. The business of guaranteeing sellers a certain sum for their works of art before they reached the podium also acquired a dubious reputation. As well as being potentially disastrous for an auction house if the market suddenly collapsed, it was reckoned to be unfair on bidders, who, perhaps naively, expect auctioneers to be impartial between buyer and seller. A compromise was reached: any lot that carried a guarantee would be marked in the catalogue. To avoid showing their hand in this way both Sotheby's and Christie's have invented the 'non-returnable advance', cash up front for important owners in return for disposing of their collections. It has turned out to be equally risky, given the current nervousness of buyers. Christie's now has in its vaults a Cezanne still life which it must sell, presumably privately, for at least Dollars 4m if it is to break even on the McConnell deal. It is just the kind of extra headache it does not need in the current fragile market. Madonna's career may be waning but she is quickly becoming an object of saleroom nostalgia. One of her conical bodices, designed by Gaultier and discarded after a Barcelona concert in 1990, sold for Pounds 12,100 at Christie's South Kensington on Thursday, a record for any Madonna garment at auction. The last time a similar contraption appeared in the saleroom it made Pounds 9,000.</p>

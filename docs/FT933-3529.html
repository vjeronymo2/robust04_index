			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Madrid on course to hit 4.5% inflation target THE SPANISH government believes it is on target to meet its revised 1993 inflation forecast of 4.5 per cent after figures for August, released yesterday, showed prices rose just 0.6 per cent. The August figure is 1.2 percentage points below that of August 1992, when new value added tax charges came into force. The annualised rate of inflation in July was 4.9 per cent. The slow downward trend, caused largely by recession, will be a relief to the government, which yesterday began formal talks with trade unions and employers over pensions and unemployment benefits designed to secure union co-operation in lowering public deficits and wage inflation. The lower inflation figure will be particularly helpful as a reference during discussions in the next few days over the way the government calculates state pensions. Madrid, alarmed at the growth of pension outlays, has said it wants next year to base pension increases on its forecast for 1994 inflation and not on the 1993 figure. The unions are wary and have begun to insist on a 'realistic' target for next year, as the government's forecasts are usually over-optimistic. The government wants to have the pensions talks completed before the 1994 draft budget gets to parliament on September 20 and yesterday's inflation figure will help centre them on a figure close to 4 per cent. Nevertheless, economists close to the Bank of Spain say the easing in inflation is unlikely to lead to further quick cuts in interest rates, which are at historically low levels already. The central bank is waiting to take the budget's measure and to see whether, as promised, vital talks on wage moderation get under way in October. Madrid originally intended to win agreement on wages before discussing pensions and unemployment benefits with the unions. But the reverse has happened. The unions have won an important political concession. By negotiating pensions and benefits, issues the government has in the past been content to issue decrees on, they are being drawn back into the shaping of national policy from which they have been excluded since Spain joined the EC in 1986. Analysts say the return of political responsibility to the unions should make agreement on labour market reform and a three-year wage moderation package relatively easy after the budget has been presented. The long-term consequences of unions returning to policy-making are still difficult to discern, however, but some analysts worry that the government and the previously hostile unions have managed to begin talking to each other with such ease. They say the resulting agreements may be compromises outside the tough fiscal and wage constraints the markets have been insisting on.</p>

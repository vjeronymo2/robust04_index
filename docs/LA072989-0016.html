			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PHILOSOPHICAL BAGGAGE' OF EVOLUTION  </P> <P> This will by no means be the only response to your editorial. Since evolution  is only a theory, and cannot be proven, why would teaching the creation theory  be confusing science with religion," as you say? If God created everything, as  we "fundamentalists" believe, then true science and the Bible agree totally. If  you were to study with a biblical science scholar you would realize this.  </P> <P> As long as the evolution theory is taught in the schools, the creation theory  should be allowed also. After all, if evolution were a fact, it would also be  God's doing, so you would still be confusing science with religion, would you  not?  </P> <P> LOIS A. MICKEY  </P> <P> Ojai  </P></p>

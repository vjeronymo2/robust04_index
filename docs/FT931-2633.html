			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Keebler setback cuts UB to Pounds 162m - Margin improvement and business consolidation are main priorities UNITED BISCUITS, Britain's largest biscuits and snacks manufacturer, pledged yesterday to make margin improvement and consolidation of its business its top priorities after reporting an 18 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 162.3m for the year ended January 2. The result, which mainly reflected a severe setback at Keebler, the group's US subsidiary, compared with profits for the previous year of Pounds 197.2m, restated to conform with the FRS 3 accounting standard. Before restatement, the 1991 figure was Pounds 211.3m. Sir Robert Clarke, chairman, said that although market conditions in the past 12 months were the toughest for many years, all divisions had begun the current year well and trading was considerably ahead of last year. He expected group turnover to slow in the next two years, but profits and earnings to increase more rapidly. 'The name of the game is profit. The traditional UB values of grinding out higher margins will now be evident in continental Europe, Australia and the US,' he said. Mr Eric Nicoli, chief executive, said: 'We realise a period of consolidation and relative stability would be appropriate.' He foresaw no further large acquisitions, apart from a possible bid for the biscuits business of Royal Brands, the Spanish food manufacturer. Profits were reduced by an exceptional item of Pounds 3.3m, compared with a restated Pounds 12.6m the previous year. Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 3.12bn (Pounds 2.98bn), with continuing businesses advancing 6 per cent to Pounds 2.94bn. Operating margin, before exceptionals, fell to 6.7 per cent (8.2 per cent). Operating profit at Keebler fell 60 per cent to Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 65.6m). UB expected Keebler this year to recover about half last year's fall in profit under a new management which was more concerned with costs and margins than with increasing volume and market share. A 31 per cent increase in profits from continental Europe, where it has recently made several acquisitions, helped McVitie's raise operating profits 5 per cent to Pounds 111.8m. Profit rose 1 per cent to Pounds 92.7m in the UK, where a decline in the UK biscuit market early in the year was reversed in the second half. KP Foods also benefited from operations on the Continent, which increased profits 15 per cent to Pounds 7.6m, helping the division lift operating profit 3 per cent to Pounds 44.8m. In the UK, KP's profits grew 1 per cent to Pounds 37.2m in the face of keen price competition, though it increased its share of a declining savoury snack market. Ross Young's, the frozen foods subsidiary, lifted profits 4 per cent to Pounds 28.5m, though disposals and restructuring reduced turnover by 4 per cent. The business enjoyed a good second half and was said by UB to have been 'transformed and re-vitalised'. Terry's, the chocolate business which is being sold to Philip Morris, the US tobacco and food company, suffered a 6 per cent fall in profit to Pounds 13.4m despite a 15 per cent rise in sales. UB blamed the poorer result on a weak UK market and price competition. Earnings per share fell to 22.4p (28.1p). The final dividend is held at 9.8p, bringing the total for the year to an unchanged 15.3p. See Lex</p>

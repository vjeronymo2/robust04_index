			<p>BFN     [Text] Senate May 27 SAPA -- South Africa had finally put  all political conflict behind it, President Nelson Mandela  assured the chamber Friday. Replying to debate on his opening  address he said the past four days had been the most exciting in  the country's political life. "For the first time we have put  all political conflict behind us," he said. The government of  national unity had created the visible and tangible guarantee  that there could be no chance for oppression or radical policies.    Recalling the process of negotiations started with his first  contact with the senate president and former minister of  justice, Mr Kobie Coetsee, he also extended credit for the  change to dialogue to a previous state president, Mr P W Botha.  He recalled his first meeting with him where he had been  received with dignity and respect. He met him again six months  ago when he was again received with the same welcome, warmth and  respect. "He telephoned me two days ago, not only to  congratulate me on the inauguration, but on the work that has  been done since then."    In his early discussions with Mr Botha in March 1989 on the  issues of violence, majority rule and reconciliation, he had  said that the acid test for a future government and the ANC was  to assure whites that majority rule -- not black majority rule  -- would not lead to black oppression of whites. Furthermore,  there had to be tangible and visible structures that guaranteed  it. "We now have that structured guarantee," Mr Mandela said.    The government of national unity had brought together a  variety of political parties, making it impossible to implement  radical policies. It compelled the government to develop a  culture of consultation, to learn the lesson as fellow South  Africans bound together by a common loyalty that men and women  should see the issues that united them rather than those that  divided. "The last four days have been the most exciting, the  most unforgettable in our political life."    The electorate had clearly made the right choice and he was  proud to work with the men and women who constituted the new  government. "Whoever started the process is of little  relevance," Mr Mandela said. "What has been achieved has been  the product of us all."    In the past few days he had met the leaders of the so-called  radical left and right. "I can assure you the spirit of these  discussions have been most harmonious. I would lean backwards,  go on my knees, for peace in our country."    Nobody should fear peace or democracy. It was the  correctness of the position from which one took decisions,  careful thought and the support of strong and independent men  and women which in all probability warranted the taking of  correct decisions.</p>

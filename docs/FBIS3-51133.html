			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moises Perez Mok] </F>   [Text] Havana, 5 Jan (PL) -- Cuba requires today the  adoption of a new economic model, which existing circumstances  are already causing to emerge, said here Pedro Monreal,  investigator at the nongovernmental Center for Studies on  America (CEA).    The country's conditions of accumulation have changed  radically. This demands the elaboration of a new concept, an  instrument that may make it possible to understand why the  economy can or cannot grow, said the specialist in statements to  PRENSA LATINA.    The economic model, he said, must be basically understood as  an analytical abstraction in which there are several levels: the  economy's macro additions [macroagregados] (investment and  consumption), the sector's structure, the international  situation and insertion (under what conditions it takes place),  and the institutional framework.    He said many economists limit the concept of the model to  this last aspect, in which two basic things prevail:  organization and norms.    According to Monreal, even if the most urgent task of the  Cuban Government were to be the adoption of a package of  measures aimed at correcting the island's financial problems,  the most important job will be in-depth economic restructuring.    According to estimates from the Finance Ministry, the Cuban  budget deficit in 1993 amounted to 4.2 billion pesos (the same  amount in dollars per the official exchange rate) and excess  money in circulation surpassed 10 billion.    Cuba -- he said -- has a very open economy, whose structure  was not designed to compete in the world market but to operate  within another constitutional framework: that of the Council of  Mutual Economic Aid, which it joined in 1972.    He added that within the economy there are competitive  sectors, such as sugar, nickel, citrus, tourism, tobacco, rum,  electronics, construction and engineering services, and some  steel products, among other sectors.    There is a second front, not operating right now, but which  could be if modernized and reduced. It is reflected in the 130  investment opportunities offered by the State Committee of  Economic Collaboration for Foreign Enterprises, as well as a  third area (food production), which he considers nonoperational.    Monreal is one of those who believes that no proposal for a  solution to the economic crisis can accept a squandering of the  labor force, which is doubtlessly the country's most valuable  resource, he stressed.    In this sense he recalled that a possible economic  adjustment  presupposes the elimination of state subsidies for production  and therefore a reduction in jobs.    There are at least three options to the former: aspire to  the  growth of a new state sector that may reabsorb the unemployed,  create new jobs in joint ventures, or expand cooperatives beyond  the agricultural sector.    The two first options -- he said -- have the drawback of  having very big external component, whereas the extension of  cooperatives to other fields, such as services (particularly in  trade) would create a new sector in the economy with a capacity  for absorbing an important amount of labor.    It is convenient -- he stressed -- to exhaust these three  possibilities without undermining the emerging private sector  (some 87,000 citizens with licenses for self-employment) which  technically is not capitalist, as it is a simple mercantile  producer.    The structural changes in the economy will ultimately define  future growth in that sector, as the constitutional framework  has been undergoing modifications and today is much more  flexible than two years ago, he said.    In socialist production -- he concluded -- there is now a  growing presence of market mechanisms, understood to be stimuli  for social cooperation, although often surrounded by the myth of  the intrinsic impossibility for regulating them, which is  totally untrue.</p>

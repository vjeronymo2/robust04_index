			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> The son of singer Bobby Darin has sued McDonald's Corp. for more than $10  million, alleging that the restaurant chain copied his late father's singing  style and gestures in the "Mac Tonight" commercials. The suit, filed last week  in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges that the television ads infringe  on rights to Darin's 1959 hit version of the song "Mack the Knife." The  commercials feature a tuxedoed man with a smiling quarter-moon head, wearing  sunglasses and belting out the hamburger jingle. The suit contends that the  character's voice and gestures resemble those of Darin, who died in 1973 at age  37 of heart problems. The suit seeks an injunction halting the McDonald's  commercials, $100,000 in general damages and $10 million in punitive damages.  Shauna Snow  </P></p>

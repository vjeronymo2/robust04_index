			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 2 (KNS-KCNA) -- A central meeting of  Korean residents in Japan was held in Tokyo Saturday to denounce  the nuclear war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and  the South Korean puppet clique and open the way of peace and  reunification of the country.    In his speech first Vice-chairman of the Central Standing  Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) Yi Chin-kyu condemned the Kim Yong-sam puppet  clique for entreating the United States to restart the "Team  Spirit" joint military exercises, desperately trying to  introduce Patriot missiles into South Korea and openly inciting  war fever, by opening to the public even a new war plan against  the North dubbed "New Operation Plan No. 5027". He branded  these moves of the puppet clique as a treacherous act against  the 5,000-year-long history of the nation and a crime which can  be committed only by the enemy of peace and reunification.    He said:    "The United States, which totally reversed the DPRK-U.S.  agreed conclusions at the New York contact and unilaterally  broke up the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks, is now scheming  to unleash another war, while crying for `sanctions' and  `blockade.' This fully shows that it is still watching for a  chance to provoke a new war in Korea."    He strongly demanded that the Japanese authorities no longer  join the United States and the South Korean puppet clique in  their nuclear war provocation moves but promptly renounce the  hostile policy toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  and Chongnyon.    Solidarity speeches were made by Japanese public figures and  indignation speeches by Chongnyon officials at the meeting.</p>

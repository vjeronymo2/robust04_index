According to the threats, the embassy was  going to be blown up with ground-to-air missiles if the internal  crisis in that country was not resolved.    The threats, which were received on 5 October, were only  revealed today when Alexandre Liapin, the embassy's first  secretary, and Rafhil Eivazof [names as received], head of the  consular section, presented charges to Federal Judge Gustavo  Adolfo Literas, who is now in charge of the investigation.    The investigation was initially in the hands of the Federal  Police, which carried out the pertinent investigation through  its Foreign Affairs and Worship Department in order to identify  the threats' perpetrators.    The two Russian officials confirmed that the threats were  received at the embassy, located at 1971 Rodriguez Pena Street  in this capital.    The threats referred to the internal crisis the Russian  Federation had been experiencing since the takeover of  Parliament by groups that opposed the government of Boris  Yeltsin.    According to courtroom leaks, the case also was presumably  evaluated by the Supreme Court in utmost secrecy before the  courts went into recess for the month of January.    The Supreme Court ratified the qualifications of Judge  Literas, who now will continue the investigation.    The court, through then-President Ricardo Levene, had been  in  charge of the investigation of the bloody attack on the Israeli  Embassy on 17 March 1992, but the court could not identify the  perpetrators of the attack in which more than 20 people died.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TRADE PACT THAT REALLY WORKS  </P> <P> It was only the second meeting the Canada-United States Trade Commission  created by the free trade agreement between the two giant trading partners, but  already there was action to accelerate implementation of the historic  agreement. Clearly, the pact is working.  </P> <P> John C. Crosbie, Canada's minister of international trade, and Carla Hills, U.S  Trade representative, met at the end of November in Ottawa in their capacities  as commission members, and quickly reached agreement on speeding elimination of  tariffs on more than 400 items with a bilateral trade value of $6 million.  Parliamentary and congressional approval are now required, but that does not  seem to pose any problem. The cuts were requested by the industries themselves  and no opposition has been voiced. Without this action, some of the tariffs  could have remained in force for the full 10-year transition period provided  for implementation of the agreement.  </P> <P> Crosbie and Hills also were able to express satisfaction with the way the  free-trade agreement, implemented just 11 months earlier, is working. They  acknowledged that the agreement had not resolved all of the bilateral  disagreements that inevitably occur, but the atmosphere of negotiations held  promise of working out solutions more readily than in some of the trade  confrontations that preceded the global agreement.  </P> <P> The two nations, with about $200 billion in trade between them, represent the  largest bilateral trade in the world.  </P></p>

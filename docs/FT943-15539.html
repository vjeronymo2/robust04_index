			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: British Bloodstock moves out of the red with Pounds 124,000 After three years of losses, British Bloodstock Agency returned to the black in the 12 months to March 31 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 124,000. Shares in the USM-traded company, however, fell 13p to 92p yesterday, as the result fell short of some market estimates of between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 300,000. Mr Christo Philipson, chairman, pointed out that the result, which compared with a Pounds 38,000 loss previously, continued the steady improvement in trading results which began in the second half of 1991. He attributed the recovery to a substantial reduction in fixed costs and the first increase in turnover since 1990 - up 4 per cent at Pounds 5.22m. Despite the return to profits, no dividend is recommended. Mr Philipson explained that he believed reserves should be strengthened following the lossmaking years and that the improvement in fortunes must be sustained before payments could be recommenced. Earnings per share were 2.7p (1.4p losses). The chairman said greater industry confidence reflected the beneficial change in VAT legislation in the spring 1993 Budget and an increase in prize money. He expected the market to benefit from further increases in prize money, funded by the evening opening of betting shops and Sunday racing, and also in breeders' prizes, which are set to top the Pounds 1m mark in 1995. Mr Peter Bickmore, managing director, has decided to step down in order to concentrate on running BBA Insurance Services and expanding the group's insurance interests. He will however, remain an executive director.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 4 June that the United States  asked Japan at the bilateral financial talks to amend the  Securities and Exchange Act [SEA] and the Foreign Exchange and  Foreign Trade Control Act [FEFTCA]. This was revealed by an  international financial source.    The United States reportedly wants to broaden the definition  of "securities" in the SEA, and is asking Japan to ease  regulations on overseas transactions in financial instruments by  institutional investors under the FEFTCA.    Financial services have been designated as an additional  priority sector in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The  United States has also asked for the liberalization of the  market for public pension funds. This sector is now expected to  emerge as a major controversial issue in the framework talks.  Finance Ministry Takes a Negative Attitude [subhead]    The present Japanese SEA adopts the "positive list" method  under which a list is drawn up of financial instruments  considered to be "securities." The United States, however,  wants this changed to the "negative list" method which details  everything not considered "securities."    It seems the United States wants to broaden the definition  of  "securities" to create a better environment for foreign  securities firms -- which have an advantage in designing new  financial instruments -- to freely develop new products freely  in order to increase their business opportunities. In the past,  new products from foreign securities firms have taken an  extremely long time to win permits because they were not  considered "securities" under the SEA.    When institutional investors other than banks and securities  firms buy financial instruments overseas, they are required to  have minimum foreign currency deposits. Under the present  FEFTCA, such foreign currency deposits are governed by a permit  system.    A senior U.S. Government official has pointed out that  "Japanese institutional investors are obstructing full access to  innovative products and services available from foreign  financial institutions."    According to the Securities Bureau, the Finance Ministry  takes a negative view on the issue of amending the SEA, claiming  that "if coverage of securities gets even partially out of  control, it may not be possible to protect the investors."    As far as FEFTCA is concerned, the International Finance  Bureau says that "the existing law fully meets the needs of  investors." Bilateral talks are expected to experience rough  sailing.</p>

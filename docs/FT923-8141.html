			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Queens Moat advances to Pounds 38m QUEENS MOAT Houses' continental European hotels helped the company lift half-year pre-tax profits by 5.4 per cent to Pounds 38.1m despite continuing gloom in the UK. Mr John Bairstow, chairman, said the company would continue its programme of 'vigorous expansion' on the Continent, avoiding large-scale capital investment by seeking leases, management contracts and franchising agreements. Mr Bairstow said the UK had become less important to the group's overall performance. 'With more than half our room capacity, a large proportion of profit and the emphasis on expansion being outside of Britain, it follows that the UK will progressively become one of our major areas of operation, rather than the mainstay of the business.' The company has 86 hotels on the Continent, compared with 103 in the UK. However, because the continental hotels tend to be larger, of its total of 22,291 rooms 11,667 are on the Continent against 10,624 in the UK. Operating profits in the UK were Pounds 38.7m for the period ended July 12. This was an increase of 6.6 per cent over last year, when hotel occupancies were badly affected by the Gulf war. By contrast, operating profits in Germany increased 37 per cent to Pounds 23.1m and in the Benelux countries by 22 per cent to Pounds 12.9m. Profits in France were up 26 per cent to Pounds 2.9m. Mr Bairstow said he saw little sign that business confidence had been dented in any of the continental European countries in which Queens Moat operated. UK hotel bookings increased in the three to five weeks following the Conservative victory in April's general election, but this improvement was not sustained. He said there was little prospect that UK hotel performance would improve in the second half. Profit before rent and interest increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 81m. Rent charges more than doubled, however, to Pounds 9.6m, restricting growth at the pre-tax level. Mr Bairstow said increased rent was the result of the company's policy of seeking leases and management contracts rather than outright purchases. He said that as the company expanded, rent payments would increase further. Interest payments rose to Pounds 33.2m compared with Pounds 28.8m last time. Turnover was Pounds 291.9m, compared with Pounds 213.4m. Fully-diluted earnings per share were 2.92p (3.29p). The interim dividend is 1.395p (1.342p). See Lex</p>

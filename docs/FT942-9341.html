			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): A jobless problem that recasts Euro-debate To judge by the behaviour of other French cities, Roubaix should be in flames by now. With 28 per cent of its workforce jobless, it has an unemployment rate that is more than double that of other French cities and towns which saw violent street protests this spring against a proposed cut in the minimum wage to promote youth employment. But this traditional north-eastern textile town of 90,000 has stayed relatively calm, perhaps because of the attention paid it by the government, whose prime minister and interior and urban affairs ministers have all taken care to visit it in recent months. There is no question that unemployment is the predominant political issue in Roubaix as much in the current campaign for the European Parliament election next month as in any local or national poll. But the broad Euro-debate on unemployment, pitting the right's argument in favour of flexible pay and labour markets against the left's emphasis on increased training and work-sharing through shorter hours, is re-cast in Roubaix in far more basic terms. Before launching into debates about more vocational training, Roubaix first needs to tackle 'the problem of the more than 20 per cent of its kids who leave school at 16 without being able to read or write,' says Mr Jean-Philippe Leclerq, the head of the town's new special employment directorate. Equally, before getting worked up, like the rest of France, about changes in the so-called Smic minimum wage, Roubaix has a more fundamental problem. This, says Mr Leclerq, is that an increasing number of Roubaisiens simply prefer to draw France's basic RMI welfare premium, rather than seek a full-time job (on the Smic or not). At FFr2,400 (Pounds 281) a month, the RMI is less than half the Smic, but by doing some work 'on the black', they can do just as well as Smic-earners with half the effort. (If someone refuses a job offer, under French law they cannot have their welfare payments or family allowances docked, Mr Leclerq complains.) 'With 4,000 on welfare and 11,000 people on unemployment dole, Roubaix, relative to its size, has the worst situation in France,' says Mr Leclerq. Jobs exist in the town - 46,000 in all - but most of them go to people from the surrounding area, because Roubaisiens don't have adequate skills or interest. Mr Leclerq points to Roubaix's textile industry, given a new lease of life by having its products sold by the mail order industry, for which Roubaix is the centre. 'The problem is that the mail order companies want people with computer skills, while the tailoring companies are now largely staffed by people from south-east Asia, like Thailand or Cambodia.' Young Roubaisiens 'just don't want to re-enter a trade - textiles - from which their parents were made redundant', says Mr Leclerq. 'I know, because we have set up two workshops for apprentices and can't fill all the places.' More troubling to Mr Leclerq is that of the 600 new low-skilled jobs created in the town each year, Roubaisiens fill only about 200. 'Even jobs like being a cleaner or a building, parking or garden attendant, require people being able to read instructions and being able to move around the city transport city system if need be.' But in coping with its huge unemployment, Roubaix has something older than France's Fifth Republic or the European Union on which to fall back - a rich, almost medieval tradition of private associations whose members look after each other. The town has some 800 associations, which have spread to embrace many in the large community of Maghreb origin; after the 1958 devaluation of the franc discouraged Belgians from coming, Roubaix almost literally sent out the boats to north Africa for people to work its textile mills. 'These associations start with some leisure activity, often sporting, but frequently then go on to organise post-school education or homework sessions,' says Mr Mohammed Benguessi, deputy director of the Foyer de Jeunes Travailleurs. The Foyer also tries to place young people in their first job, not an easy task, says Mr Benguessi who meets a certain amount of anti-Maghreb prejudice from employers. In general, Roubaisiens ruefully agree with the Delors White Paper's conclusion that 'there is no miracle cure' to unemployment. They appear to expect little possible improvement as a result of the Euro-elections, or indeed any other election, pinning more hope on their own local efforts. But there is also a specifically French reason why Roubaisiens and their co-citizens are apathetic about the Euro-elections. It lies in the 'national list' system France still uses for Euro-elections, whereby the country is considered as just one big constituency represented by 87 Euro-deputies who get elected according to the relative tally that their party amasses nation-wide. It is a pure system; unlike regional or single-member constituency systems, no votes are 'wasted', but nor is there any geographic identification between a French Euro-MP and his or her electorate. So, Roubaix has no Euro-MP it can call its own or complain to. All French parties now recognise this as a weakness that has compounded the sense of remoteness of their Euro-MPs from their voters, and one that needs changing.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Russia may pay compensation to Stalinist victims Millions of victims of Stalinist repression could be compensated for their confiscated property as Russia continues to exorcise the trauma of its Soviet past, writes John Thornhill. According to the Itar-Tass newsagency, the Russian government has passed a resolution promising to reimburse innocent victims of repression either by returning their original property or paying the cash equivalent. Details remain sketchy and the complications of implementing such a plan are vast. It is also likely that approval would first be needed from President Boris Yeltsin. The scheme would certainly open up a Pandora's box of highly-emotional claims. During Stalin's 30-year rule, many millions were persecuted, including whole ethnic groups such as the Russian Germans, Ingushis and Crimean Tartars. Establishing the claims of respective parties would be fraught with difficulties. Itar-Tass reported that all citizens of Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union would be eligible for compensation as well as foreign and stateless victims. The heirs of the repressed could also inherit their relatives' claims.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- "The necessity of solving  the non-payments problem is one of the main points of the  memorandum sent by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the chairmen of the Federation  Council and State Duma", presidential spokesman Vycheslav  Kostikov told a briefing in the Kremlin on Thursday.    According to the spokesman, "the technical solution of the  non-payments problem is the prerogative of the government, but,  since that question has grown into a political one, it has  entered the competency of the president".    Kostikov said Yeltsin's "memorandum should stimulate the  process of economic reform". He explained that, in the same  memorandum, the president "calls the attention of the lawmakers  to the fact that they have been too slow in enacting laws in the  economic sphere".</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Sedat Ergin: "Turkey Must Reprimand </F> Butrus-Ghali" -- punctuation as published]    [Text] A strange situation emerged in the Vienna talks on  Cyprus two weeks ago. The talks were held in accordance with  the initiative that was made by Ambassador Robert Lamb, the U.S.  State Department special coordinator on Cyprus. Fearing the  possibility of an impasse in the talks, the U.S. diplomats  organized a meeting between the Turkish, Turkish Cypriot, and UN  officials in Vienna.    Many of the points in the UN "miniagreement package" on  Maras  [Varosha], dated 21 March, which caused uneasiness in the  Turkish Cypriot side, were resolved through Robert Lamb's  proposals in that city. But then the problem emerged. The UN  and U.S. officials failed to put in writing the formula on which  the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] agreed. They  informed the Turkish Cypriot side as follows: "The  understanding reached in Vienna will be taken into consideration  in the talks if you agree to the UN package dated 21 March."    No one must expect TRNC President Rauf Denktas to adopt a  naive approach and say "yes" to unwritten, nonbinding, and  abstract promises.    Denktas visited Turkey after he returned to north Cyprus  from  Vienna. Regardless of the suggestions made in Ankara, he  refused to agree to the package, dated 21 March, that is, not  until the Vienna accord was regarded as a binding document.  That was why Prime Minister Tansu Ciller sent Ambassador Tugay  Ulucevik, Turkey's number one expert on the Cyprus problem, to  the TRNC.    A compromise formula was agreed on by Ankara and Denktas  through Ulucevik's initiatives in Nicosia two days ago. And  Denktas disclosed that he agreed to the minipackage, provided  that "the Vienna accord is included in the text of the  agreement." He explained his new position in writing to Gustave  Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special  representative, during the dinner he had with him the night  before last.    Undoubtedly, Denktas can be criticized to a certain extent  on  this point. It would have been more appropriate for him to make  that disclosure, on which Turkey insisted, while he was still in  Ankara at the beginning of the week.    Nevertheless, the disclosure was made. What was strange at  this time was the UN General Secretariat's approach. UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali submitted his report to  the UN Security Council in New York nearly two hours after  Feissel put Denktas' letter in his pocket and bid him farewell  in Nicosia. It is common knowledge that Butrus-Ghali's report  accused the Turkish Cypriot side of maintaining an  irreconcilable approach. Butrus-Ghali's behavior indicated that  he ignored Denktas' important step. He hinted in his report  that Denktas does not have the political will to resolve the  problem by saying: "I am doubtful as to whether the Turkish  Cypriot leaders will be willing to reach an agreement even if  the changes that have been asked for by the Turkish Cypriot side  are realized."    Not satisfied with that, Butrus-Ghali proposed "sanctions"  against the Turkish Cypriot side to force it to agree to solve  the problem. In other words, he urged the UN Security Council  to penalize the Turkish Cypriots.    Regardless of how the situation is considered,  Butrus-Ghali's  report has revealed that he maintains an unfair and biased  approach, which has further complicated the solution to the  problem. Considering the concession Denktas made the night  before last, Butrus-Ghali should have withheld or, at least,  changed his report. Obviously, Denktas' disclosure created a new  opportunity in the negotiations process, regardless of the fact  that it was conditional. The proverb that comes to mind in  light of all that is as follows: "Do we wish to acquire grapes  or beat up the vintner?"    Obviously, Butrus-Ghali does not intend to facilitate the  solution of the problem. On the contrary, he wishes to  reprimand the Turkish Cypriot side. The initiatives he has made  on several problems, including the situation in Bosnia, have  failed. Consequently, he has decided to take action against the  TRNC leaders in the Cyprus problem in order to strengthen his  morale.    The Turkish diplomats were expected to obstruct  Butrus-Ghali's report. That has not been done. Therefore, they  should, at least, expose Butrus-Ghali's biased approach in the  UN Security Council. Sanctions should also be taken against the  UN secretary general for the mistakes he makes. The conflicting  UN and U.S. approach on the problem is a good opportunity for  Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots in that regard.    Butrus-Ghali's report indicates that he preferres a scolding  approach instead of heeding the norms of diplomacy. Undoubtedly,  Turkey is influential and capable enough to react in a similar  way. Let us wait and watch developments.</p>

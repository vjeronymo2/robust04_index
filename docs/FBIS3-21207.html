For pilot  fabrication, it will be necessary to provide stable microfine  pattern fabrication technology (equipment, processes, etc.) in a  few months. At the present stage in which photoexposure (i-ray,  KrF, + resolution improvement) technology which is fully usable  below 0.25 m has not been established yet, electron beam  (EB)  direct-drawing technology, which is capable of drawing microfine  patterns and is not restricted by chip size, is considered the  only lithography technology which can provide stable processing  in this domain. Usually, the following are considered the major  issues of the EB direct-drawing technology.    (1) EB equipment technology: Analysis and improvement of  drawing accuracy, improvement of throughput, and stabilization  of operation.    (2) Resist process technology: Selection of resist,  optimization of process conditions, and countermeasures against  charge-up.    (3) Pattern data processing technology: Technology for  conversion of massive data, correction of proximity effect.    These are universal technological issues that have been  tackled for more than a decade; technologies have been developed  and optimized for each generation and applied in prototyping  advanced devices.    Recently, we developed and optimized these technologies and  applied the results to prototype a 256M DRAM.[.sup]1[/] In  this report, we will introduce 0.25 m EB direct-drawing  technology, detailing the analysis and improvement of drawing  accuracy with regard to drawing equipment, optimization of  process conditions with resist processing technology, and  correction of the proximity effect by pattern data processing  technology.  <H3>  EB Equipment Technology -- Analysis and Improvement of  Drawing Accuracy </H3>   To secure the drawing accuracy required for 0.25 m  processes, analysis and evaluation of the accuracy of each part  of the equipment is necessary along with the study of accuracy  improvement based on the results of the analysis.  Variable-shaping EB equipment[.sup]2[/] used for our  prototyping provided the drawing accuracy analysis results shown  in Table 1, where the improvement of mark detection accuracy  with the largest error is essential.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

But the  detection accuracy is largely variable depending on the value of  correlation operation parameter W (correlation operation width).  Therefore, to minimize variations in detection accuracy, we  developed a technique for optimizing operation parameter W.    Figure 1 shows the W optimization technique that we  developed.[.sup]5[/] First, to improve the S/N of input  signal Y(i) (the primary differential signal in mark detection),  autocorrelation processing is performed and output correlation  signal Z'(i) is obtained. Then, from the signal peak width of  Z'(i) with improved S/N, optimum correlation operation parameter  W is obtained from the following formula:    W = W[.sup]0[/] + _D_W    Here, _D_W is the beam width when a mark is detected. The  use  of this technique can improve the mark detection accuracy from  0.046 m (3 _s_) to 0.020 m (3 _s_). In addition,  overall  drawing accuracy was improved by improving the stage-moving  accuracy. These improvements have made it possible to reduce the  calculated overall drawing accuracy below 0.070  (3 _s_),  assuring the drawing accuracy necessary for use of the 0.25  m rule.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-27A>           Figure 1. Optimization Technique of W (Correlation </FIG>       Figure 2 shows the alignment accuracy in the actual  prototyping of a 256M DRAM. It refers to the accuracy of the  word-line layer with respect to the device-separation layer. The  accuracy is good on both the X and Y axes, sufficiently within  the alignment margin required from the device structure. Similar  alignment accuracy results were also obtained with other layers  by previously optimizing the correlation operation parameter for  each EB drawing layer, within 0.075 m (3 _s_) which is  almost the identical level to the calculated accuracy.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-28A>           Figure 2. Alignment Accuracy (Word-Line Layer) </FIG>     <H3>  Resist Process Technology -- Optimization of Process  Conditions </H3>   With EB direct drawing, electrons lose energy when they are  scattered in the resist, and this energy forms a negative or  positive image by causing chemical reactions among the resist  molecules. Therefore, electron scattering in the resist is the  most important factor governing the shape of the resist. Because  the prototype EB equipment used an accelerating voltage of 20  kV, the resist film thickness should be decreased to reduce the  influence of forward scattering. However, thin resists cannot  cover the height differences in the device and are not  sufficient for use as the mask in etching. Actual prototyping  was based on a multi-layer resist process. A single-layer resist  process was also used in some instances for reducing the TAT.    When a multi-layer resist process is used, it is essential  to  optimize the thickness of the organic film in the lower layer.  Previously, the lower-layer organic film had a large thickness  (1 to 2 m) to reduce the influence of backscattering from  the  wafer. However, when drawing patterns at the 0.25 m level of  the 256M DRAM class, the aspect ratio rises during organic film  etching, causing a size shift, pattern tilting, and shape  deterioration. In short, the minimum required thickness of  organic film is determined by the absorption of height  differences, resistance to etching, and influence of  backscattering.    We first studied the thickness of the lower-layer organic  film and the influence of backscattering by simulating energy  accumulation.[.sup]6,7[/] As shown in Figure 3, the thickness  of the lower-layer organic film hardly influences the contrast  of the distribution of the electron accumulation amount (at the  interface with SOG film). This result shows that the thickness  of the lower-layer organic film can be optimized by considering  only the thickness of the etched material and the height  difference on the wafer in every EB drawing.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-28B>           Figure 3. Interface Contrast of Accumulated Energy (at </FIG>       Figure 4 [photo not reproduced] shows the bit-line patterns  of SAL601 negative-resist prototype with a multi-layer resist  process.    The single-layer resist process can be applied in  prototyping  in the case where the height difference on the wafer is small,  the pattern is coarse, and the selectivity ratio between the  etched film and resist is sufficient. As the single-layer resist  process allows the TAT and etching count to be reduced, it makes  it possible to minimize size variations.    In actual prototyping, the single-layer resist process was  applied with bit-line and capacitance contacts. As shown in  Figure 5 [photos not reproduced], contacts were fabricated with  reasonable accuracy in both (a) the cell-array section and (b)  the peripheral-circuit section. This is assumed to be possible  by a small mutual proximity effect attributable to the  relatively coarse drawing pattern and by the wide exposure  margin of the ZEP520 positive resist used.  <H3>  Pattern Data Processing Technology -- Correction of  Proximity Effect </H3>   For the fabrication of microfine patterns of the 0.25 m  class using EB direct-drawing technology, it is essential to  correct the proximity effect which degrades the drawing  accuracy. Therefore, when we converted the design data into data  formatted for the EB equipment, we developed a data conversion  system which can correct the proximity effect at the same time  as the two-level data compression processing.    This correction processing is based on the two-dimensional  self-consistent method using the EID (energy intensity  distribution) function,[.sup]8[/] and also uses contour  processing and rectangle redivision processing. Also, we  specially developed a vector processing system using an SX-2  supercomputer and a simplified one-dimensional drawing intensity  calculation technique to decrease conversion time (CPU time).    Figure 6 shows the basic concept of the one-dimensional  processing technique. In case identical patterns are developed  infinitely (beyond the backscattering domain) in the direction  of an axis (Y axis), the mutual proximity effect (drawing  intensity) in the axial direction can be considered constant.  Therefore, because the intensity drawing on the pattern to be  corrected (required when correcting the proximity effect) can be  determined by a primary line integral calculation considering  only the drawing intensity in the X-axis direction, the drawing  intensity calculation time can be reduced.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-28C>           Figure 6. Simplified Technique for One-Dimensional </FIG>       By optimizing the weight of the drawing intensity, the  processing at the corner sections of the array-developed region  becomes possible in the same way as at the array center section  and a satisfactory pattern can be obtained as shown in Figure 7.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-29A>           Figure 7. Before and After One-Dimensional Proximity </FIG>       Figure 8 shows the conversion time when the above is applied  to the word-line layer. The conversion time when vector  processing and one-directional proximity effect correction are  applied is drastically reduced to about 1/20 of the conversion  time with two-dimensional processing without vector processing.  Also, as a result of applying the one-dimensional proximity  effect correction to other layers of the prototyped 256M DRAM,  we could reduce the conversion time to a practical period of 30  to 50 minutes, and the proximity effect would be corrected  satisfactorily.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-30A>           Figure 8. Result of Performance Evaluation (Application to </FIG>     <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   We applied EB direct-drawing technology using variable-shape  electron-beam drawing equipment (accelerating voltage 20 kV,  current density 10 A/cm[.sup]2[/]) to the prototyping of a  256M DRAM using the 0.25 m rule. Actual prototyping was  hybrid with i-ray technology and EB direct-drawing technology  used for layers with the 0.25 m rule.    Aiming at stable operation of EB equipment and the  improvement of its alignment accuracy, we analyzed the accuracy  factors of the prototype, developed a technique for optimization  of the correlation parameters (EB equipment technology),  optimized the multi-layer resist process (partially single-layer  resist process) (resist process technology) and developed the  two-level data compression technology for large-capacity data  and one-dimensional proximity effect correction technology  (pattern data processing technology).    As a result, we were able to produce the prototype 256M DRAM  shown in Figure 9 [photo not reproduced], with an alignment  accuracy of no more than 0.075 m (3 _s_).  References    1. T.

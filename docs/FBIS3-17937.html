Faction head Alexander Kirsteins, however, questioned the  option as legally and technically impossible. The parliament  may be dissolved exclusively by the president, according to the  country's Constitution, said the faction's deputy head Andrejs  Krastins.    If one of the factions withdrew from the parliament, the  president may be forced to consider the parliament's  dissolution, said Krastins.    LNNK has not discussed the resignation issue with other  factions in the parliament's National Bloc yet but Lembergs  predicted they could approve of the motion.    The National Bloc dislikes the Latvian-Russian agreement for  concession to Russia's demands of the Skrunda radar operation  and the social guarantees to war pensioners in return for Aug.  31 as the withdrawal deadline.    The National Bloc includes parliament factions of LNNK,  Homeland and Freedom, Christian Democrats Union. They have been  pressuring President Guntis Ulmanis and the parliament not to  sign and ratify the agreement since it was initialed on March 15.</p>

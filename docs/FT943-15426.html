			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Insurer reviews 'unfair' reference Standard Life, the insurance company, is reviewing a negative reference it issued for one of its former sales agents after the document led to him losing his new job. The review follows a complaint to the company by Mr Matthew Lacey that the reference was unfair and based on false information. Mr Lacey was sacked from Scottish Widows, another insurance company, last December, after the company received the reference in confidence from Standard Life. Standard Life decided to reconsider the reference ahead of this week's ruling by the House of Lords that employers have a duty to take reasonable care in issuing references. The judgment clears the way for people to sue their former companies on the grounds of negligence if they believe incorrect references have damaged their ability to work. Standard Life, based in Edinburgh, said yesterday: 'We have contacted Mr Lacey and are still examining the case.' It said its normal policy was to give people 'fair and honest' references. It was difficult to say what relevance the ruling had in this case. Mr Lacey said: 'My main aim is to clear my name so that if I want to I could work in the insurance industry again.' He had been distressed to lose his job at Scottish Widows and was studying the legal implications of the affair. Mr Lacey worked for Barton Lyle, a London-based company which sells life products and pensions on behalf of Standard Life, until last autumn. He then moved to Scottish Widows where he worked for just two months until he was sacked after the company received the reference, based on information from one of Mr Lacey's former clients implying he had behaved unethically. The former insurance agent is now working for a funeral company in London. Mr Duncan MacKechnie, assistant general manager at Scottish Widows, said the company had had little option but to sack Mr Lacey after it received the reference. This was because of life-industry regulations which were designed to ensure that sales agents who had behaved unethically in previous jobs would not be allowed to work in the industry. The company said yesterday it could not comment further on the implications for Scottish Widows of the Standard Life review.</p>

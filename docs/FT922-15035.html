			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Underwriting undermines Sun Alliance Pounds 466.2m for 1991 compared with 1990's Pounds 180.9m - Sun Alliance is shrinking parts of its business and cutting jobs in a bid to restore profitability. General insurance premium income rose to Pounds 2.68bn (Pounds 2.51bn) - largely as a result of rate rises - and life insurance income to Pounds 1.1bn (Pounds 861.2m) in 1991. But underwriting losses climbed to Pounds 833.5m (Pounds 550.8m), mainly because of a sharp rise in insurance losses in the UK to Pounds 713m (Pounds 461.3m), where the bulk of recession-, weather- and crime-related losses have been concentrated. Life insurance profits rose to Pounds 54.3m (Pounds 47.7m) and investment income was marginally down at Pounds 313m (Pounds 322.2m), largely as a result of negative cash flow in the UK. Losses per share were 59.2p (13.4p) and the total dividend is lifted to 14.25p (14p) with a proposed unchanged final of 9p. In the UK the company has been more selective about the business it underwrites, reducing its motor exposures from 1.8m at the end of 1990 to about 1.5m at the end of last year. Another 100,000 policyholders could leave the books over the next 12 months. In the UK household sector, where Sun Alliance is market leader with a 25 per cent share, the company has introduced a system of differential rating, whereby householders living in areas more prone to subsidence damage, such as the south-east, will pay up to twice as much as those living in other parts of the country. Mr Scott Nelson, general manager, believes that relatively high levels of subsidence loss will be a 'permanent feature of UK buildings insurance'. Sun Alliance has also refused to accept commission terms offered to it for block business by Abbey National on the grounds that these were 'unacceptable'. On the jobs front, Sun Alliance announced the loss of 800 posts in January and said that further cuts have been identified since then.</p>

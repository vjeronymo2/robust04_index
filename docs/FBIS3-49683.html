			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 13 (BTA) -- Deputy Foreign Minister  Todor Churov acquainted the Foreign Policy Committee of the  National Assembly with the U.S. Partnership for Peace plan today.    According to MP Ivan Genov, deputy chairman of the Foreign  Policy Committee for the Bulgarian Socialist Party, the  Partnership for Peace offer is NATO's and the United States'  compromise with the East because they do not want to isolate  Russia from the processes of European and Euro-Atlantic  security. The Partnership for Peace plan is a function of the  relations among the great powers, he said. Mr. Genov absolutely  disagrees with the statement that the U.S. initiative gives  equal chances to the countries participating in it. The  Partnership for Peace is based on bilateral contracts, which  means a different approach to each country that is not a member  of NATO, therefore the participants are placed on an utterly  unequal footing, Mr. Genov stressed.    The Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) believes that  Bulgaria should join the Partnership for Peace framework the  soonest possible as this is the first important step towards  integration into the structures of NATO, MP Yunal Lyutfi, deputy  chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee for the DPS, said. In  his opinion, the Partnership for Peace plan treats the countries  on an equal footing without placing the Visegrad Four in a  privileged position. Bulgaria's clearly and categorically  stated desire for participation in the initiative is a serious  guarantee for its national security, Mr. Lyutfi said. He said  that a special group with the Council of Ministers was working  on the programme of Bulgaria's participation in the Partnership  for Peace.    The initiative gives a very good chance to each individual  country participating in it to take the necessary steps for  integration with NATO, MP Asparukh Panov, deputy chairman of the  Foreign Policy Committee for the Union of Democratic Forces,  said. He expressed his hope that the committee would actively  participate and assist in the elaboration of a programme for  joining the Partnership for Peace plan. It is the SDS MP's  desire that rapid and resolute action be taken with this purpose  in view. According to Mr. Panov, Bulgaria has always had an  advantage over the Visegrad Four because of its geopolitical  position. We do not have a common border with Russia but with  two NATO member countries and the establishment of a future  triangular of NATO member-states will contribute a lot to the  stabilization of the Balkan region, Mr. Panov believes.</p>

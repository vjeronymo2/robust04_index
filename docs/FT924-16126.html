			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Ukraine's premier forced to resign UKRAINE'S president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, yesterday announced the resignation of the prime minister, Mr Vitold Fokin, in an effort to appease the country's increasingly assertive parliament. A conservative who favoured centralised control over the economy, Mr Fokin had become the focus of attack on the government's poor economic performance and its failure to implement long promised market reforms. In sacrificing his position, Mr Fokin appears to have saved his economic plan, which calls for reassertion of central economic control and only gradual privatisation. Mr Kravchuk left in place the rest of the cabinet. Much will now depend on the figure chosen to succeed Mr Fokin. Speculation has focused on Mr Leonid Kuchma, a missile factory director, Mr Valentin Symonenko, deputy premier, and Mr Ivan Pliushcht, parliament's chairman. The resignation has forestalled efforts by some parliamentarians to call a no confidence vote in the entire cabinet.</p>

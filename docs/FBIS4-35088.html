			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 28 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Costa Rican  police today reported that a Colombian citizen, a top money  laundering suspect sought by U.S. authorities, was arrested in  Costa Rica as he arrived from Colombia.    The Judicial Investigations Agency (OIJ) reported that Juan  Crisostomo Trujillo Martinez was arrested on 24 June after he  arrived in Costa Rica aboard a flight from Santa Fe de Bogota.  Trujillo's arrest took place after U.S. Customs alerted the OIJ  to the pending arrival of the Colombian, whom the United States  has linked to the "laundering" of large amounts of Cali Cartel  money.    According to sources, Trujillo did not have contacts in  Costa  Rica. Rather, he arrived here after U.S. authorities set him up  to travel to this Central American nation. The suspect, who  remains in custody at a jail in San Jose, will be extradited to  the United States within the next few days.</p>

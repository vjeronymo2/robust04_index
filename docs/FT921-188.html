			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Fayeds seek court decision on panel THE FAYED brothers yesterday renewed their attempt to block disciplinary proceedings launched against them by the City Takeover Panel, Raymond Hughes writes. The proceedings followed publication of a government report on their acquisition of the House of Fraser stores group in 1985. They asked the Court of Appeal to allow them to seek a judicial review of the panel's refusal in December to adjourn the proceedings, at which the central issue will be statements made by the brothers about the source of funds used for the acquisition. A similar application was refused by the High Court in January. Mr David Oliver, QC for the Fayeds, said the disciplinary proceedings should be deferred until after a pending High Court action against the brothers by Lonrho, the conglomerate headed by Mr Tiny Rowland, which lost the battle for House of Fraser. Mr Oliver said the panel should first conduct its own investigation into allegations against the Fayeds, and not base its proceedings on the Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report on the matter. The Fayeds would challenge that report in the Lonrho action, he added. The panel executive alleged that the Fayeds had committed fraud by knowingly making untrue statements - exactly the allegation Lonrho made in its court action, Mr Oliver said. It would be an injustice if the full panel came to a conclusion adverse to the Fayeds and publicly censured them when they might succeed in the Lonrho action and be vindicated. The hearing continues today.</p>

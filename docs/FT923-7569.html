			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Turn right for the Astrodome: Preview of this week's Republican party convention in Houston THE Houston Astros, a baseball team of limited talent, are having a miserable season. Adding insult to the injury of being nearly last in their league, they have been evicted from their own stadium, the Astrodome, for nearly a month because the Republican party is staging its quadrennial bash there, just down the road from the hotel room which President George Bush calls home for voter registration purposes. That hotel, the Houstonian, is also a sad story, operating only under the protection of bankruptcy laws. Indeed, Houston generally is a bit of a mess, unrecovered from the recession that so damaged its biggest industry, oil, hit by rising crime and recently in the grip of the sort of heatwave that turns tarmac back into crude by midday. These are not the most auspicious surroundings for a party which needs some auspicious moments this week. By contrast, the Democrats found New York last month at its most benign and, thus encouraged, came out of the city on a unified bus and with a ticket driving away to undreamt-of leads in every known form of polling measurement. It is not easy to adjust to this political role reversal. Democratic conventions used to be fun, because they were disorganised, while the Republicans orchestrated theirs to the last nano-second, easing such dissent as existed under the blue rinses and funny hats of the delegates quietly into oblivion. Now, suddenly, it is the Republican party which portrays itself as 'the big tent', tolerant of an unprecedented diversity of opinion, while depicting the Democrats as the imposers of the sort of discipline that used to be associated with the KGB. The reality is that the Republicans must get their act together this week. The twin tasks are to bash the Clinton-Gore ticket at every turn, but in ways that strike home to the wider electorate and not only to the committed; and to give President George Bush the sort of 'bounce' which so lifted Governor Bill Clinton a month ago. Yet this is going to be done mostly without the ever-present direction of the new bandleader, Mr James Baker, still secretary of state until next Sunday, who may not be much in evidence at Houston. The convention score has, in effect, been composed mostly by those very people found so wanting that Mr Baker's return was deemed necessary by Mr Bush. The party platform, for example, constitutes a very conservative wish list, the unfinished agenda of the Reagan era. This reflects the influence of the activists, almost all of the right and many of them nakedly distrustful of Mr Bush, not to mention Mr Baker. Only with difficulty were explicit criticisms of Mr Bush's sanctioning of the 1990 tax increase excised. As it stands the economic policy recommendations of the draft document emphasising tax reductions contain most, if not all, the right wing's demands. The social policy agenda was best described by a leader of the Christian Coalition, representing fundamentalists: 'The language on Aids, education, abortion, homosexual rights, prayer in schools and taxes is all being strengthened so we can telegraph a message to the core constituency that this is still their party.' It is unlikely that Mr Baker will pay too much heed to the platform when he is in control, though if the battle for the presidency is to be fought on middle ground, as the Democrats expect, it does not help to be stuck with too much baggage from either far left or right. But to go into battle without the right - who are, like liberal Democrats, the enthusiasts, the activists, the letter stuffers of the party - would be a handicap. So Vice President Dan Quayle stays on the ticket and speaking room has been found this week for Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, and Mr Patrick Buchanan, the erstwhile candidate for the nomination, just as Mr Clinton let the Rev Jesse Jackson and Mr Jerry Brown have their say. The worst handicap is to go into battle with an unpopular leader, and in this respect the resurrection of Mr Bush is easily the most important task of the week. This can be done both by tearing Mr Clinton down and by building Mr Bush up. The same can, and will, be done to their respective wives. There has been a sharp negative edge to the assaults on the Clintons in the last two weeks, especially as voiced by Ms Mary Matalin, the campaign's political director, and by Mr Rich Bond, the national party chairman. What they have seen as good rough'n'tough partisan politics seems sometimes to have sat ill with Mr Bush, though he has never explicitly disowned them. More to the point, they have neither rattled Mr Clinton nor improved Mr Bush's standing. Mr Baker undoubtedly will, in time, refine this, creating more of a balance between attacking Mr Clinton for his inexperience and the presumed cost and impracticality of some of his policy proposals, contrasting both with Mr Bush's record, especially in foreign policy. It is certain that this week will be full of the Gulf war and the president's role in presiding over the collapse of that ultimate Republican demon, Soviet communism. Where Mr Baker's influence might first be apparent is in the content of Mr Bush's acceptance speech on Thursday night. While too much can be made of one address - Mr Clinton gave an indifferent one in New York, but was not hurt by it - the president's matters because it gives him the opportunity to lay out what he would do with a second term. This is precisely what the electorate has been waiting to hear and it is why Mr Bush said he was bringing Mr Baker back to the White House. The president enters this week knowing he is behind. The current polling gap is comparable to the 23-24 point margins by which Nixon beat McGovern in 1972 and Johnson beat Goldwater in 1964. There is no way that Mr Bush and Mr Clinton are going to be separated by as much in November, but what the incumbent needs from Houston is more than its miserable baseball team can offer. If he wants local inspiration, he might try Nasa's Johnson space centre, accustomed as it is to proclaiming 'we have lift-off.' He will have to ignore the fact that it is named after a Democrat.</p>

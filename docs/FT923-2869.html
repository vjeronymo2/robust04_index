			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / More than 1,000 killed in floods MORE than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed in one of the worst floods ever seen in Pakistan. Hundreds of peasants outside Multan, the historic city of the Sufi saints, yesterday sought refuge on the roofs of their mud houses, as the heart of Pakistan's cotton belt was hit by the floods. Small patches of cotton and rice crops, and trees with their trunks fully submerged in a sea of water were the only remaining signs of the lush green farms that were flourishing up until last week. Breaches made by army engineers in a canal west of the city helped prevent flood water from entering Multan. But the floods were last night heading towards the southern province of Sindh amid widespread fears of further damage to life and the economy. The floods and torrential rains have progressively spread over Pakistan and parts of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan over the past week. The cost of rehabilitation could intensify pressure on the national economy, already hit by a world recession which has caused a setback to cotton-related exports. Now there are concerns that the cotton crop, the production of which had risen by 35 per cent over the past year, will take a severe beating. Although the extent of the damage remains unclear, cotton production levels may decline by at least 10 per cent, the government estimates. However, some officials believe that the losses could be as great as 20 per cent. Last year, almost 58 per cent of export earnings came directly or indirectly from cotton. Western and Pakistani journalists were flown in an army helicopter outside Multan yesterday. Little land was visible, while motorboats, carrying relief supplies and army troops, were plying between camps and the refuge sites as rescue operations continued. A government minister said Pakistan was considering launching an international appeal for help.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Early market gain lost after Bundesbank confirms money target SPECULATION, later denied, that the Bundesbank was due to hold an emergency meeting, and hopes of a revaluation of the D-Mark sent European government bond markets higher yesterday. However, bond prices slipped back late in the afternoon on comments by Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank board member, in defence of the central bank's use of a target for M3 money supply growth and its efforts to reach that target. Trading was volatile due to uncertainty about the implications of this week's events in Sweden and Italy, and due to continued weakness in the lira in spite of central bank intervention. Activity concentrated in futures, although dealers reported demand for the French 30-year government bond. GERMAN bunds and futures continued on their upward path, as investors sought refuge in D-Mark paper. The December bund contract touched a high of 89.49 in afternoon trading after opening at 89.13 on London's Liffe. ITALIAN government bond prices eased in the morning as dealers took their profits after the previous day's late gains, but recouped their losses as the day progressed. The December future fell 30 basis points to 92.12, in quieter trading, with 16,422 contracts traded, compared with more than 25,000 the previous day. ON the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the September OAT bond futures contract closed at 106.60, up 0.50 in active volume of 141,948 lots, while the December contract closed at 107.04, up 0.52 on volume of 33,445 lots. At the long end of the government bond market, the 8 1/2 per cent 2023 bond rose 0.99 to 97.27 to yield 8.75 per cent. UK GILTS and futures had a more comfortable day, in spite of sterling remaining below DM2.79. The 11 3/4 bond due 2003/07 rose  19/32 to 114 5/8 while in the futures market, the December contract rose  1/2 point to 97.02. SWEDISH government bonds were supported by aggressive buying by domestic institutions and the yield on the two-year 199 bond fell to 13.88 per cent from 14.15 per cent. However, there was a flattening of the yield curve at the longer end. THE Spanish government bond market failed to participate in the generally firmer mood, concentrating instead on its domestic economic problems. The yield on the 10-year 10.30 per cent bond rose to 12.65/69 per cent from 12.51/55 per cent. US Treasury securities recovered from early weakness after the market judged that the economic plan unveiled by President Bush yesterday would not widen the deficit. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/16 at 100 3/32 , yielding 7.237 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 13/16 , yielding 3.801 per cent. Almost Dollars 6bn of new corporate debt has been issued this week, and not only did the large influx of corporate supply lure investors away from Treasuries, but some underwriters sold government securities to hedge their corporate deals. Consequently, prices at the long end of the Treasury market came under early selling pressure yesterday. However, prices recovered in the afternoon on President Bush's speech. Although he called for a one percentage point cut in taxes, analysts judged that his proposals would have no real impact on the deficit, which remains the bond market's greatest worry. CANADA'S sliding dollar has led to a decline in Canadian bond prices in recent days. Prices of long-term government bonds dropped about 1.60 points yesterday, bringing their fall to almost three points since the start of the week. The 30-year bond was yielding 8.1 per cent at the close. Mr Barry Calhoun, chief bond trader at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said that the pressure was confined mainly to foreigners selling into a thin market. The spread between Canadian and US bonds, a key indicator of the attractiveness of the Canadian market, has widened from 72 basis points at the beginning of this month to 91 points. The Bank of Canada raised its bellwether bank rate by 21 basis points to 5.14 per cent, the first increase in 19 weeks. The Bank rate was set last week at 4.93 per cent. TRADING in Japanese government bonds was thin ahead of today's publication of the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey. The yield on the 145 10-year government bond ended at 4.84 per cent, one basis point lower, as dealers covered short positions late in the afternoon. Dealers expected the Tankan to be negative, showing a build-up of inventories, a drop in business confidence and more evidence of a liquidity squeeze. However, they added that the survey was of historical importance and that the bond market was more likely to be influenced by the stock market, which saw the Nikkei break above 19,000 yesterday.</p>

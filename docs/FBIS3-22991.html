Yatom said yesterday.    Ramallah was under curfew for the second day, as reinforced  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units pressed to find more clues.  Sources said it is now almost certain that the attackers knew  who they were ambushing.    Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] published a leaflet  contending the attack was made possible through "a Hamas spy who  infiltrated the GSS." The leaflet identifies the spy as A.A.H.    "A spy is the wrong term, but it is likely that a regular  informant executed the attack, assisted by at least two others,"  one military source said. [passage omitted]</p>

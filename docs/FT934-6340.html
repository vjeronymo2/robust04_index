			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Concentric ahead in spite of 'unusual instability' Concentric, the diversified Midlands-based engineering group, lifted pre-tax profits by 13 per cent in the year to September - a period which included 'unusual instability in every business in which we are involved.' Pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.36m (Pounds 8.25m), achieved on turnover of Pounds 116.4m (Pounds 113m), were at the lower end of market expectations. 'Month by month business and opportunities have been up and down,' said Mr Tony Firth, chairman. 'General market conditions show no sign of improvement,' he added. He said that the automotive market, which accounts for about half of Concentric's sales, 'collapsed' last January. The business in satellite dishes had been sluggish with considerable amounts of stock on the market following technical changes in dish specifications in the middle of the year. By September, export sales accounted for 30 per cent of turnover, against 28 per cent in the first half; Mr Firth said, however, that continental European customers had 'lost interest' as recession deepened. Against the background of market difficulties, the rise in profits came from winning market share, the exploitation of new business and improved margins, Mr Firth said. Following the rights issue in 1992, Concentric maintained a net cash position, although capital expenditure nearly doubled to Pounds 8m. The group has sought higher productivity through a restructuring which reduced the size of the workforce from 2,000 to 1,900 a year ago. Earnings per share rose from 11.63p to 12.03p. The final dividend is 4.09p, making a total of 5.86p (5.59p adjusted for January's scrip issue).</p>

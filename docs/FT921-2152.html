			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: HK hotels group posts 6% fall HONGKONG and Shanghai Hotels, which owns the luxury Peninsula hotel group, reported net profits of HKDollars 313m (USDollars 42.64m) for 1991, a 6 per cent decline from 1990's HKDollars 333m. The results showed a marked improvement over the interim stage, when the hotel group saw profits drop by HKDollars 32m. Operating profits were 5 per cent down for the full year at HKDollars 479m, on turnover up 1 per cent to HKDollars 1.74bn. Profits were hit by the effects of the Gulf war and recession in Europe and the US. But Mr Hanmer Webb-Pebloe, managing director, said: 'The lower-than-expected returns from the hotel and restaurant business were offset to a significant degree by the strong revenue generated by the company's property portfolio and non-hotel operations, which continued to perform well.' Earnings were also affected by the closure of 54 rooms in the flagship Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong while a 32-storey tower extension is built. But Mr Webb-Pebloe indicated the hotel and restaurant operations would experience only a slow recovery in 1992 'as a result of the continuing recession in several major western economies'. Hongkong Hotels recommended a final dividend of 11 cents, making a total of 17 cents in 1991, the same as in 1990.</p>

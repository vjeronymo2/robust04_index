			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAN CALIFORNIA PROVIDE ALL THE BILINGUAL EDUCATION NEEDED?  </P> <P> During the 1980's, the numbers of students in California public schools who  speak and write little English more than doubled.  </P> <P> Three-fourths of these students speak Spanish. The growth of students needing  help because of their English skills may slow over the next 10 years, but the  critical shortage of trained bilingual teachers is likely to persist.  </P> <P> Source: Compiled from Assembly Office of Research and California Department of  Education data.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BALLARD PAIR SWIM WELL IN PRELIMS  </P> <P> As family traditions go, the Ballards of Encino have their act down pretty  well. Some families take pride in, say, sending all their children to the  parents' alma maters, or having all their offspring take piano lessons.  </P> <P> But the Ballards just plain swim fast. In the late '80s, Matt and Jason Ballard  dominated City Section championship meets in the distance freestyles and  butterfly.  </P> <P> Wednesday in the City prelims at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach, the latest in  this lineage of Birmingham High aquatic standouts swam with a fury indicating  that the tradition is alive and well.  </P> <P> Senior Christian Ballard blazed through his heat of the 200-yard freestyle in 1  minute 44.67 seconds. That time improved his season best by four seconds and  came within two seconds of his best time of 1:42.40, set in the senior  nationals last summer. His closest competitor, Tate Hurvitz of Grant, swam a  1:49.92.  </P> <P> In the 500 free, Ballard also flew, swimming 4:39.33, more than 16 seconds  ahead of second-place finisher Hurvitz (4:55.97). Not bad for a guy who came in  not quite prepared.  </P> <P> "I didn't taper or rest for this meet," Ballard said. Next week in the City  finals, Birmingham Coach Nick Rodionoff indicated, Ballard could ride a wave of  inspiration to even better times.  </P> <P> "If he really wants, he can break the City records," Rodionoff said. "It'll be  a psych swim next week."  </P> <P> Just as effective was Christian's sister, Heather, a sophomore distance  freestyler who cruised through her heats with true Ballard ease. Heather, who  also has qualified for the mile, shotput and high jump in the City track meet  finals, won her heat in the 200 free (1:57.54, three seconds shy of the City  record) and took second in the 500 free (5:08.52, two seconds better than her  season best).  </P> <P> The top 12 finishers in each event qualified for the finals, which also will be  held at Belmont Plaza. The top six finishers will swim in the championship  finals and the bottom six will swim in the consolation finals.  </P></p>

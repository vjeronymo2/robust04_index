			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Japan and the United States have begun to move  toward the resumption of bilateral framework trade talks for the  first time in three months. Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice  minister of international trade and industry, and Sadayuki  Hayashi, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs, will visit the  United States on 19 May to begin unofficial talks with the U.S.  Government. Behind this move lies the fact that the Clinton  administration can no longer put pressure on Japan at a time  when a sudden surge in long-term interest rates, caused by the  dollar depreciation, might have a negative effect on the U.S.  economy, and that the Hata government intends to strengthen its  foundation by breaking the stalemate in the trade talks.  Despite the Hata cabinet's intention, the trade talks will  continue to be rough because it is still unclear whether the  minority Hata coalition can implement multiyear tax cuts as a  macroeconomic measure.    After the breakdown of the summit meeting in February,  Japan-U.S. relations were put in "abnormal circumstances." U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor gave strict orders to U.S.  negotiators not to meet Japanese bureaucrats and as a result, no  contacts were made. However, following the inauguration of the  Hata government, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and  International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata met with  U.S. Government officials. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also  held a telephone conference with President Bill Clinton. As  such, there are signs that bilateral relations are improving.    It is believed that Washington has changed its attitude  toward Japan because it can no longer maintain its policy of  putting pressure for the yen to further appreciate at a time  when rapid appreciation of the yen might lead to a triple drop  in U.S. bonds, stock prices, and the value of the dollar, and a  sudden rise in long-term interest rates might have adverse  effect on the U.S. economy. Also, alarmed by a letter  complaining of Washington's Asia policy, which was sent by U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord to Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, the Clinton administration has shown a  tendency of reviewing its economy-oriented diplomacy toward  Japan.    Meanwhile, it is said that the Hata cabinet is eager to  resume talks with Washington because it hopes to strengthen its  foundation through the improvement of relations with the United  States so that it can maintain its centripetal force even after  the passage of the 1994 budget bill, enabling it to promote tax  reform and deregulation. Because "it is not allowed to make a  mistake again," the two sides have agreed to hold unofficial,  subcabinet-level meetings first.    In Japan, some people argue that if Tokyo and Washington  agree to resume trade talks, they should adopt a "two-step  plan." They propose that negotiations on government procurement  and insurance should virtually be concluded by early July,  before the (G-7) Naples summit opens, and then talks on  automobiles and auto parts, a sector in which there is conflict  of opinions between the two countries, should be concluded by  the end of September, which is the deadline for Washington to  invoke the Super 301 provision of the U.S. Trade Act (which  outlines steps for retaliation against trade partners' unfair  practices). However, this plan is possible only when the ruling  and opposition parties reach an agreement on tax cuts and  sources to fund the cuts by the end of June. An official at the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said: "If  this macroecnomic measure is scrapped, it will be impossible for  the government to obtain concessions from Washington in  negotiations on each trade sector." Nevertheless, it is  uncertain whether the ruling and opposition parties will be able  to reach an agreement.    Main topics in the negotiations on government procurement  and  insurance will be what method should be used to gauge the  openness of markets and what measures should be taken to promote  deregulation in each trade sector. A top MITI official said the  Japanese Government hopes hopes to avoid the "theological  argument" over the issue of whether to call it numerical target  or objective criteria and to "start concrete discussions as soon  as possible. However, whether Washington will change its policy  toward Japan and make a compromise over numerical targets "will  not be known until the trade talks resume" (according to a MITI  official).</p>

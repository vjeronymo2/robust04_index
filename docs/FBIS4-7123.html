			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Replacement of Fuel Rod </F> of Experimental Nuclear Power Station" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  answered a question put by KCNA today regarding the planned  replacement of fuel rod of the 5 megawatt experimental nuclear  power station in the DPRK.    He said:    We will soon begin the replacement of the fuel rod according  to the operation plan of the 5 megawatt experimental nuclear  power station for the present as part of the undertakings for  the normalization of our peaceful nuclear activities.    As we pointed out already on April 4, we are not in a  position to freeze the operation of our graphite moderated  reactor system for an indefinite period since the implementation  of the DPRK-USA agreement on the conversion of our graphite  moderated nuclear reactor system into a light water system has  become uncertain as a result of the abortion of the third round  of DPRK-USA talks and, moreover, the prospect of the resumption  of the DPRK-USA talks is dim at present.    In view of technical requirements, too, we can no longer  delay the replacement of fuel rod of the 5 megawatt experimental  nuclear power station.    Consistent is our stand to show the honesty of our nuclear  activities, although the replacement of the fuel rod is being  made while we are still in a unique status following the  temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared  withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.    Hence, we decided to voluntarily notify the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] of our plan for the replacement of  fuel rod and, especially, to allow inspectors of the IAEA to  observe the process of replacement of the fuel rod so that they  may verify that nuclear materials are not diverted to  non-peaceful purposes, and promptly issued entry visas to the  inspectors as requested by the agency.    Observation activities of the agency may involve adequate  contents of inspection for the continuity of safeguards,  including observation of the activities for the replacement of  fuel rod, measurement of all the fuel by the spent fuel rod  counter, containment and surveillance of all the replaced fuel  by the agency, activities related to the agency's seal and  monitoring apparatuses and examination of documents of operating  and accounting records.    This shows that we are actively guaranteeing inspection  activities of the agency with the utmost leniency and good will  despite our unique status.    If inspection activities falling within the scope of routine  and ad hoc inspections are raised in the course of the  replacement of the fuel rod, they may be allowed after the  nuclear issue is settled in a package deal at future DPRK-U.S.  talks.    Truth to tell, we intended to discuss first the resumption  of  routine and ad hoc inspections within the framework of a package  solution to the nuclear issue at the third round of DPRK-U.S.  talks.    But we remain in a unique status with the abortion of the  third round of talks. At this transitional stage observation of  the replacement of the fuel rod cannot but be the inspection for  the continuity of safeguards to verify non- diversion of nuclear  materials.    We will leave the fuel rod to be replaced this time strictly  under the containment and surveillance of the IAEA and fully  provide the continuity of safeguards data.    We are studying the problem of "additional inspection" of  the  radiochemical laboratory raised during the March inspection  activities of the IAEA in close relations with the attitude of  the United States and the IAEA Secretariat.    Hence, we have already notified them that we are willing to  allow an "additional inspection" as an exception after examining  their future behavior in keeping with the change of the current  situation surrounding the exchange of special envoys between the  North and South.    If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat, ignoring our  good will, rudely demand sampling and other inspection  activities in disregard of our unique status at the time of the  replacement of the fuel rod, we will have to regard it as a  sinister political intention to continue more openly the  campaign for stifling the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear  activities.    When an irrevocable complex situation is created by that, we  cannot hold ourselves responsible for it at all.    If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our  unique status and take a fair attitude and position, looking  straight at the current situation, another opportunity of  finding a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue will be  created.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HALEY LUMBERED INTO WRITING  </P> <P> Alex Haley says he may not have become a writer if his parents and grandparents  had not given him a foot-thick slice from a California redwood as a gift 60  years ago.  </P> <P> The tree slice had small white markers illustrating the tree's growth, Haley  says in the Sept. 2 issue of Parade magazine.  </P> <P> "I was told that, if I read all I could, whenever I found something notably  historic, then that could become another marker in my slice of tree," he said.  </P> <P> "From then on, I read every book I could handle, along with my grandpa's  newspapers for black people," he said. "Today, I absolutely believe that the  reading inspired by the tree slice greatly influenced my becoming an author. It  is also why I like most of all to write about historical subjects."  </P></p>

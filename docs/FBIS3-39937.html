			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "D.Gd.": "A White Paper for the Soldiers of the </F> Year 2010"]    [Text] Further, faster, with more professional soldiers  and equipment, and without dropping our nuclear guard. The  authors of the white paper on defense commissioned last May by  Edouard Balladur have ambitious objectives for the French armed  forces by the year 2010.    The document was presented yesterday by the prime minister  and Defense Minister Francois Leotard to the deputies and  senators of the Defense Commissions of the two houses. This is  the first exercise of this kind since Michel Debre's white paper  in 1972. The latter orchestrated the strategy and missions of  the French armed forces following the acquisition of the strike  force in the context of the Cold War. The 1994 version of the  white paper takes a defense posture in an international context  which has become particularly fluid since the disintegration of  the Soviet Union. In addition there are heavy budgetary  constraints set by Edouard Balladur in his five-year law to  control public spending.    This white paper, drawn up by around 100 experts, members of  the military, and senior civil servants, under the chairmanship  of Marceau Long, first vice president of the State Council, will  serve as an "explanation of the themes" of the forthcoming  1995-2000 military programming law which should be debated in  Parliament in June. It has received the implicit approval of  Francois Mitterrand who approved its terms during two defense  council meetings in January and February.  <H5>  Uncertainty and Diversification of Threats </H5>   The uncertainty applies to the stability of the countries of  the former Warsaw Pact and the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction. The new threats lie in the probable multiplication  of regional conflicts, ethnic or religious extremism, terrorism,  and drug trafficking.    In this context, the white paper takes up the two classical  aims of French defense policy. First, to defend the country's  vital interests, "alone if necessary, against any threat  whatever its origin." This is the role of the nuclear  deterrent. Second, to watch over France's "strategic interests"  which "correspond to its international responsibilities and its  rank in the world." Six crisis scenarios of varying scales (see  below) stem from this, ranging from the potentially nuclear  conflict to the defense of the DOM-TOM [French Overseas  Departments and Territories].    Most of these commitments will take place in the framework  of  coalitions, under the auspices of international organizations  (United Nations, NATO, Western European Union, CSCE). The white  paper thus defines the role which France intends to play in  these organizations. It reflects the recent rapprochement with  NATO, while formally rejecting a return to the organization's  integrated military structures which France left in 1966.  <H5>  Nuclear Doctrine Unchanged </H5>   French strategy, it reaffirms, "is a strategy of deterrence,  rejecting any confusion between deterrence and use." The white  paper thus takes up the 1972 definition conferring on the  nuclear deterrent the virtue of "rendering recourse to all-out  war unacceptable as an active political method." Added to this,  and included in French doctrine for years, is the "final  warning," characterized by a limited strike against military  targets.    The text says remarkably little about the question of  nuclear  tests, which Francois Mitterrand decided to halt in 1992 -- a  halt now opposed by the government. No mention is made of the  international moratorium on tests. The authors of the report  view "favorably the drafting of a treaty for a total ban on  tests," provided it does not "hamper the maintenance of our  deterrent's credibility." Similarly, although the white paper  stresses the need to safeguard "the capability for technological  development" of the military use of nuclear power by  strengthening "the test simulation program," it refrains from  choosing the component (naval, airborne, or land-based)  responsible for delivering the "final warning."  <H5>  More Autonomous Conventional Forces </H5>   The same vagueness surrounds the numbers of men in the  conventional forces which, according to the details provided in  the crisis scenarios, should remain stable after the reductions  started in recent years. Indeed, it is their capability for  intervening in overseas crises which will be strengthened. The  recent crises (Iraq, Somalia, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia)  have shown how very difficult it is for the French armed forces  to simultaneously deploy sizeable forces on several theaters of  operations.    "There must gradually be a real conversion in the role of  conventional means. It is henceforth their use outside a  nuclear context which predominates," and hence "their aptitude  for the prevention, limitation, or settlement by force of  regional crises or conflicts which do not present the risk of  escalation to the extremes," the white paper notes.    The philosophy being to "prevent" the eruption and  development of these crises, the white paper thinks it is  necessary for the French armed forces "to simultaneously conduct  several actions: A very intense regional conflict in the  framework of a coalition; one or several interventions to help  an overseas departement or territory or to implement defense  agreements; a limited peacekeeping or international law  enforcement operation." This presupposes the strengthening of  the complementarity of forces within the armed forces. The aim  is to have a "reservoir of rapidly mobile forces of 120,000 to  130,000 men" in the army.  <H5>  No Professional Army </H5>   Although it is in favor of a greater professionalization of  the armed forces, the white paper rejects the move to a  professional army, regarded as "unrealistic" especially because  of "excessive budget costs." National service, "the best  guarantee of the importance which the nation and the citizens  attach to their defense," should be both "condensed" in its  military aspect, whose 10-month duration is not questioned, and  diversified in its civilian forms.  <H5>  Budgetary Constraints </H5>   The armaments sector, which currently represents 300,000  jobs  of which 100,000 are indirect, will have to be "radically  restructured" for mainly financial reasons: "It will no longer  be possible for it to be present in every niche" as was the case  until 1985. Outside the nuclear sphere, France is called upon  to develop European cooperation, but also to resort to buying  armaments abroad. Similarly, it is explicitly stated that the  state "will no longer be able to support its arms industry in  all spheres, as it has in the past." The restructuring of the  arms industries started a few years ago will be continued by  "opening up the capital of some public enterprises" and  "improvements in productivity."    It is by this tightening up and by European cooperation that  the authors think that the cost of arms spending can be reduced  (around Fr100 billion per year excluding export revenues). In  the present context, the document admits, the challenge of  "maintaining the defense effort" presupposes "3 percent annual  growth in volume to fund all the current programs." The white  paper therefore envisages "arbitration concerning all the  current programs" to avoid jeopardizing the new programs deemed  to have "priority." Some of the existing major programs will  either have to be abandoned or scaled down.  <H5>  The Six Crisis Scenarios </H5>   No country is named, but everybody is free to identify them  on the basis of the recent crises or crises which are  foreseeable in the next 15 years. The six crisis scenarios  foreseen by the white paper are designated S1 to S6 and place a  major nuclear conflict last.    S1 -- Regional conflict not endangering our vital interests:    This is the Iraqi case, envisaged in the Middle East, but  also in Europe and the Mediterranean and its "degree of  probability is high in the short and medium term." Bringing  into conflict countries with modern conventional weapons, it  involves "high intensity engagements." In this case, France  would intervene in the framework of an international mandate  with a coalition.    S2 -- Regional conflict which could threaten our vital  interests:    Regarded as "plausible at the turn of the century" in  Europe,  the Mediterranean, the Near or Middle East, it involves a  nuclear power and "by a knock-on effect" is likely to threaten  our vital interests. Action in an international framework could  be of a deterrent nature if necessary.    S3 -- Attack on the integrity of national territory outside  the mainland:    This scenario, the likelihood of which is "low at present"  but could "increase with time," concerns the DOM-TOM. France  "must be able to control and settle this kind of conflict in  complete independence and disregarding possible international  pressures."    S4 -- Implementation of defense agreements:    These are French interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. Very  high probability.    S5 -- Peacekeeping and international law enforcement  operations:    These are foreseeable on all continents and result in very  high probabilities of French participation in a multinational  framework. The white paper advocates fixing the duration and  scale of the resources committed by France from the start.    S6 -- Resurgence of a threat to West Europe:    This is the nuclear threat stemming "from a state or  coalition of states with large nuclear and conventional forces."  "Very difficult to imagine and unlikely in the period  considered," this risk "cannot be ruled out because it is a  lethal danger." The deterrent must play its role. In view of  the fact that the reemergence of this threat should "take long  enough," it should be possible to carry out "a gradual  adaptation and a change of format in the defense tool." This  clearly means reconstituting the forces formerly directed toward  the Warsaw Pact.</p>

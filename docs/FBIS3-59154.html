			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gianluca Luzi report on Italian People's Party Secretary </F> Mino Martinazzoli remarks to journalists in Rome on 25 January  in Rome: "Martinazzoli's `No'"]    [Text] Rome -- "[Pact for Italy leader] Segni is not our  political agent. If Bossi, who is the League's leader, says  that he does not want to talk with us, obviously I acknowledge  the fact." Everyone was waiting for him outside PPI [Italian  People's Party] headquarters and, before meeting with the  nonconfessional socialists of the UDS [Union of Democrats and  Socialists] and the PRI's [Italian Republican Party] Giorgio La  Malfa, he confronted the wall of journalists. Martinazzoli was  sharp and unyielding and gave no glimmer of a hope of an  agreement with the League. He issued a warning to Segni [PPI  Chairwoman] Jervolino went still further, describing an  agreement with the Pact leader as "very, very unlikely,"  attacked Bossi, and leveled charges at Berlusconi.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Martinazzoli, do you not  think that there is some common ground between the PPI and the  League? After all, Bossi too wants the next legislature to be a  constituent one.    [Martinazzoli] I regard it as an afterthought, a last-minute  contrivance. To say that a legislature is constituent means  absolutely nothing unless you specify in what way it will be  constituent.    [Correspondent] Do you still regard your dialogue with Segni  as open?    [Martinazzoli] That depends on Segni.    [Correspondent] But is he still your candidate for the  premiership?    [Martinazzoli] Segni remains our interlocutor. We have  granted him this possibility, but obviously Segni is no demiurge  that can square the circle. Many have tried to do so, but  nobody has succeeded.    [Correspondent] Are you not afraid that your party will  remain isolated?    [Martinazzoli] The only danger would be if the new-born  party  were to decide to die.    [Correspondent] But do you not think that a bipolar  arrangement is now an obligatory option, with this electoral  system?    [Martinazzoli] What must be realized is that electoral rules  are not a substitute for politics: They must be interpreted.  It is Mr. Occhetto who invented this neurosis about a two-pole  system, unfortunately; he is to blame. This restores old  alignments, ancient controversies, obsolete arguments -- in  other words, a complete mess.    [Correspondent] You said that the program signed yesterday  is  not neutral with regard to political accords.    [Martinazzoli] Political programs are not just any pieces of  paper; indeed, they relate to the political forces that support  them.    [Correspondent] Do you mean that [League lower house floor  leader] Maroni's signature is not enough and that Bossi's is  needed, too?    [Martinazzoli] I am not well acquainted with the League's  rules. However, I see that Bossi called me a chicken thief.  Perhaps that is the language of the new modern liberal democracy.    [Correspondent] Will you now seek a political and electoral  agreement only with Segni's Pact?    [Martinazzoli] We said Saturday [22 January], and repeated  yesterday, that we believe that alternation -- or, rather, the  conditions for real alternation -- must be built around a  polarity that is not a division between extremes. So we will  continue our dialogue in the days ahead much more intensely than  last week -- but not with vestiges, relics.    [Correspondent] Did you expect the agreement between Segni  and the League?    [Martinazzoli] Frankly, I did not consider the possibility.    [Correspondent] Did you expect the League to subscribe to  Segni's program?    [Martinazzoli] I do not see what the spectacular novelty  is.... Throughout these past months I have observed that the  League has an extraordinary capacity for change. Be that as it  may, the League will be holding a congress shortly. We shall  see what they have to say.    [Correspondent] Is your rejection of the agreement not a  repudiation for [PPI ideologue] Buttiglione, who is pleased  about the Segni-Maroni meeting?    [Martinazzoli] From his viewpoint, Buttiglione was right to  be pleased. I too -- who am less of a philosopher than  Buttiglione and therefore use a more direct language -- noted  that the League had lost federalism along the way. So this is  the reason for his satisfaction....    [Correspondent] The fact remains that Buttiglione was in  favor of it, and Mattarella and Bindi against it.    [Martinazzoli] Please do not ask me any more what Bindi  thinks and what Formigoni thinks, and whether I will succeed in  reconciling them. This, partly because if you were at the  conference hall Saturday you will have seen who is in charge in  this party -- and I say this without arrogance, though it has to  be said from time to time.    [Correspondent] Will there be another meeting with Segni,  who  has stated his willingness?    [Martinazzoli]I should hope he is willing to meet with me.    [Correspondent] Does it not worry you to see the moderate  front so divided, compared to the compact progressive front?    [Martinazzoli] What worries me is your distorted perception,  because the left-wing front is by no means compact. What  worries me is the fact that you all portray it as compact, and  it rather irritates me.    [Correspondent] Do you not think that this is all just a  game  to involve [Fininvest President] Berlusconi?    [Martinazzoli] I do not know. My opinion is that Berlusconi  entered the arena a while ago. He has encouraged the departure  of some of my supporters, has issued ultimatums such as you  would not give even to a waiter..., he has rewriten Italian  history by arguing that Sturzo is to blame for having helped  fascism. So I think he is fully involved. Perhaps he is  something of a demiurge.</p>

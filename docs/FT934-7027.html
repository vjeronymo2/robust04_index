			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Observer: Tribal warfare The Economist, redoubtable weekly magazine that it is, always adopts a lofty tone in its leader columns, dismissing with great vigour any idea it finds absurd. So it cannot complain too much if it occasionally gets the same sort of treatment itself. Take last Friday's outburst by ex-prime minister Sir Edward Heath at a conference in Luxembourg. Sir Edward dismissed John Major's recent European vision article in The Economist as 'ghastly', and then complained that the magazine had not allowed him to write a serious rejoinder. But presumably that request was only a jest, since he ended by dismissing the mag as 'not read at all in Britain, sparsely read in Europe, and mainly a coffee table paper in America'.</p>

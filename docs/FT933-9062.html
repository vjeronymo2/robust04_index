			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Unions' links with Labour discourage potential members TRADE UNION links with Labour represent the biggest single factor discouraging people from joining unions, according to a survey of health service and local government employees. The strongest attraction is union support in disciplinary proceedings. The survey, by an official of National Union of Public Employees the public-service union, which has now merged into Unison, was conducted before the last general election. It adds a further twist to the struggle by most big unions to resist a reduction in their power within the party, due to reach a climax at this year's Labour conference. The financial and consumer services, such as cheap holidays and insurance, which many unions have developed over the past decade, come last in a list of eight reasons for joining a union. The first three are all associated with legal support for the individual employee - advice on discipline, legal assistance and advice on grievances - with pay negotiations coming fourth. Mr Allen Kerr, who conducted the survey, says the low priority attached to pay is probably due to centralised public-sector negotiations. Just under 300 questionnaires were returned from union members and a similar number from non-union respondents. Some 28.4 per cent of non-union respondents said that union support for Labour was a 'very important' factor in not joining. The second most common explanation (24.9 per cent) was because unions are no use to part-timers and the third most common (22.8 per cent) was that unions do not understand the problems of working women. Research for the TGWU general union by Warwick University says that the union's female membership is growing fast. About 18 per cent of the 1.1m members are women but 26 per cent of all new members are women. Only 6 per cent of lay representatives are women. The survey found that the union was failing to recruit members in growth sectors 'because workers do not see unionism as relevant to them'. New members are coming predominantly from traditional sectors - 21 per cent in road transport, 8.1 per cent in food, drink and tobacco, and 5.6 per cent in other manual occupations. The rest cover a very broad spread of occupations.</p>

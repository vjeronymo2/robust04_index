			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Cautious trading in US dollar THE DOLLAR oscillated in a two pfennig range against the D-Mark yesterday as dealers analysed different messages in Europe and the US about the American currency's future, writes James Blitz. The possibility that the Bundesbank will ease official interest rates at its council meeting tomorrow continued to support the dollar. The German central bank again injected liquidity into the market at the rate of 8.9 per cent, 60 basis points below the Lombard rate ceiling, suggesting that the rate differential between the US and Germany is set to narrow. But, whatever happens in Frankfurt, there will probably be a firm cap on the dollar between now and the US presidential election on November 3. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, believes that the dollar is trapped in a DM1.45-DM1.50 range until then. He is much more positive for the dollar after that, believing that the US-German differentials in economic growth and interest rates will narrow. 'I see a DM1.67 target over the next six months,' he said. Mr Mark Slater, head of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch in London, agrees. He believes that the dollar is already supported by a flood of players who do not want to be left out of the upward rush when it comes. In his view, a victory for Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic challenger, is now being seen more positively by dealers. 'That would mean having a a Democratic President and Congress,' he said. 'Rather than having a lame duck president, you might have one who gets things done.' The dollar closed at DM1.4680 against the D-Mark, down less than  1/2 a pfennig on the day. In New York trading at lunchtime, it was at DM1.4700. Sterling continued to consolidate above DM2.50, helped by the UK chancellor's renewed emphasis on supporting the exchange rate when he appeared before British MPs on Monday. The pound closed at DM2.5200, up nearly a pfennig on the day. In spite of Mr Lamont's comments, there is a feeling that the UK is moving into a position where it could cut interest rates without damaging the pound. Yesterday's UK producer prices figures for September showed the lowest monthly rise in 25 years, indicating that the disinflationary momentum in the UK is very great. Mr MacKinnon believes that retail price inflation could now be easily contained to 3 1/2 per cent next year. He believes that dealers will now invest in countries which show signs of growth. One analyst said yesterday: 'European countries may now compete to cut rates significantly below German levels. Those that end up cutting rates too late will find that an easing has already been priced into the market.'</p>

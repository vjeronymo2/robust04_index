			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / New trade barriers in Sweden Sweden, which has taken steps to liberalise trade over the past four years, will raise trade barriers again when it joins the European Union next month, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A Gatt report published yesterday on Sweden's trade policies and practices said prices of imports from non-EU nations are 'in many cases' expected to rise from January because of 'generally higher' EU tariffs and more complicated trade control systems. With the reintroduction of textiles and clothing quotas under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement and other trade controls, Gatt predicts that the number of import licence applications in Sweden could rise from a few thousand to over 60,000 a year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>   [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- Seoul, Washington and  Vienna were all in limbo Thursday, faced with having to make a  crucial political decision within days on the North Korean  nuclear row.    The decision due on March 21 will determine whether the  international community continues to pursue peaceful dialogue  with North Korea or seeks punitive measures through the UN  Security Council.    While the likelihood of the latter option is higher now, the  inclination in Seoul is still toward dialogue.    The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  wasted no time in briefing its board of governors on the status  of two-week inspections in North Korea that ended Tuesday. IAEA  inspectors hurried back to Vienna and reported directly to  Director-General Hans Blix, who immediately briefed the governor  states.    A statement issued after the briefing said "important  measures " agreed between the agency and North Korea had not  been carried out at the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon,  widely regarded as a reprocessing plant and the core of  Pyongyang's suspected nuclear program.    The IAEA went to North Korea to verify that the stalinist  state had not diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses  since the last visit in August, but after the fortnight of  inspections, the agency ruled it "was not in a position to  verify."    In a wild twist, the North Korean nuclear situation has gone  back beyond the starting point -- March 12 last year when  Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).    Before then, at least, the seals on equipment at the  radiochemical laboratory were intact and the IAEA had full  access to all of North Korea's seven declared sites including  this lab.    It's becoming clearer by the day that Pyongyang is pressing  Washington to hold the promised third round of high-level  dialogue while giving the bare minimum in return.    Seoul officials say this is why North Korea allowed  something  approaching -- but not quite -- full IAEA inspections and why  Pyongyang keeps alive the inter-Korean dialogue while blocking  progress on an envoy exchange, one precondition to the  high-level talks.    The IAEA convenes a special board of governors meeting next  Monday. The likelihood of the agency declaring a break in North  Korean safeguards is low because the political consequences  would be too heavy.    Such a declaration would automatically send the issue to the  UN Security Council and start a process leading up to gradual  economic sanctions.    Officials here say the decision is entirely up to the IAEA,  but the agency won't be able to ignore the views of Seoul and  Washington, which still see room for negotiation.    Seoul is expected to continue working-level dialogue with  Pyongyang on exchanging envoys, helping fulfill this  precondition.    Washington is likely to contact Pyongyang and press for  further IAEA negotiations on checking the restricted  installations so that they can go ahead with the high-level  meeting, even if it is postponed to after March 21.</p>

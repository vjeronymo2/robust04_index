			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Greta Steyn] </F>   [Text] Bankers yesterday sent a strong signal of protest to  the ANC [African National Congress] over its reconstruction and  development programme's proposals to restructure the banking  sector.    At a seminar on banking in Johannesburg yesterday, Standard  Bank group economist Nico Czypionka said the proposals had "made  my hair stand on end" and called on fellow bankers to contact  the ANC to express concern. Cyzpionka was referring to  suggestions that banks be required to lend a rising share of  their assets to small, black-owned enterprises and be forced to  provide reasons for turning down loan applications.    He said the ANC should be told that the NP [National Party]  government had tried the route of controls over banks, with  "messy" results for the economy. "To be blunt, the proposals  are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how the financial  sector works." The programme was "a shopping list that, if added  up, would blow the country's financial resources out of the  water."    To the extent that it was financially and physical feasible,  banks would push hard to address under development problems and  play a part in dealing with apartheid legacies. They had to do  this without deviating from the principles of sound business  practice, he said. At this time of change, when new economic and  other policies were being sought, banks had to make their voices  heard. "I am not sure that we as bankers are doing this  adequately and effectively. I getthe strong feeling that this  country's banks have sold themselves short -- we are doing far  more than we are being given credit for."    Banks had a vested interest in the long-term prosperity of  the country, and had taken active measures to support this with  concrete actions. He cited the growing momentum of community  banking operations within a number of banks, the Community  Banking Project, the negotiations between the Association of  Mortgage Lenders and civic organisations, and involvement in the  National Housing Forum.    Council of Southern African banks CE [chief executive] Piet  Liebenberg said the industry was in the process of formulating a  response to the ANC's policy statement. "The ANC's statement  was issued without consultation. We will not be able to change  much, if anything, in the reconstruction and development  programme. But we intend to lobby, inform and debate the  issues. We are pulling out all the stops," he said. He did  not, however, believe nationalisation was a real threat to the  industry.    Community Banking Project CE Archie Hurst said the most  optimistic projections indicated that by the year 2000, the  bank's total advances would not exceed R[rand]3bn[billion]. He  urged commercial banks to keep exploring ways of being active at  the bottom end of the market, while government involvement was  also important. "It is our hope that through its efforts, the  Community Bank will pave the way for commercial banks to become  involved in this market."</p>

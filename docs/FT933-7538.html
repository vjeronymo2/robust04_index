			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Goldman Sachs to evaluate Sidbec THE Quebec government has retained Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, to help evaluate Sidbec-Dosco, a steelmaker with about 1.5m tonnes annual capacity that it indirectly owns, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The government has been trying to privatise Sidbec for several years, but the company has been losing money because of the recession. Its basic steel plant near Montreal is modern but the rolling and finishing operations need more investment. CAI Capital, an investment firm headed by Mr David Culver, retired chairman of Alcan Aluminium, jointly with a union investment fund has made a tentative bid for Sidbec. The government says the private sector can run Sidbec best, but any buyer must provide for new investment.</p>

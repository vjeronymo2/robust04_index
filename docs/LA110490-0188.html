			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PANAMA;  </P> <P> NORIEGA 'PLANT' IN MILITARY REPORTED  </P> <P> U.S. military intelligence specialists, analyzing dozens of debriefings of  loyalists to deposed Panama leader Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, report that a  renegade former aide to Noriega planted his own men in the new Panamanian  Public Force to prepare for future moves against the U.S.-backed government.  The analysis, obtained by New York Newsday, focuses suspicion on Capt. Asuncion  Eliezer Gaitan, a zealous Noriega aide, for plotting insurgency operations.  Panamanian government sources are concerned that opponents, including Noriega,  are capable of destabilizing the nation.  </P></p>

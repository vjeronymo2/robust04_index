			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: IADB drops borrowing requirement to Dollars 2.8bn The Inter-American Development Bank, the multilateral bank whose purpose is to further the economic and social development of Latin America and the Caribbean, plans to raise some Dollars 2.8bn in the international capital markets this year, significantly less than the Dollars 3.3bn forecast at the beginning of the year. The borrowing requirement has been revised downwards due to a slower pace of loan disbursements, a lack of advantageous redemption opportunities and the fact that the IADB had less maturing debt than in 1993, when it raised Dollars 3.9bn, said Mr Charles Sethness, finance manager. However, the borrowing requirement will return to around Dollars 4bn to Dollars 4.5bn in 1995, he stressed. The IADB has raised some Dollars 500m so far this year in four different currencies. It plans to issue 'one or two significant-size' US dollar deals and a DM500m deal later this year, but there are no immediate issuance plans while the bond markets remain volatile. 'Our cash position is quite comfortable,' Mr Sethness said. After lending Dollars 5.5bn of funds in 1993, lending was not likely to exceed Dollars 6bn in 1994. The IADB's shareholders recently agreed to allow it to lend to the private sector without government guarantee, limiting this exposure to 5 per cent of new loans. Although the bank will be exposed to commercial risk for the first time, Mr Sethness was confident it would not threaten the IADB's triple-A rating since this lending would be 'at a marginal level and on an experimental basis'.</p>

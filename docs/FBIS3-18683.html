G.": "Kinkel Meets Kravchanka"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 3 Mar -- Foreign Minister Kinkel called on  Belarus to continue economic and political reforms even after  the election defeat of President Shushkyevich. At a meeting  with Belarus Foreign Minister Kravchanka in Bonn on Thursday [3  March], Kinkel said that Germany possibilities for providing  Belarus with financial assistance had been exhausted. However,  the faster privatization and reforms proceed, the easier it will  be to successfully attract foreign private investment capital to  Belarus. Kinkel and Kravchanka signed a cultural treaty that  should facilitate the work of private organizations. A  "memorandum of understanding" [preceding words in English] was  signed on promoting cooperation in alleviating the effects of  the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It should  eliminate bureaucratic obstacles in dealings between the two  states and thus assist the work of private German relief  organizations. Kravchanka said that only 1 percent of the  territory of Belarus was unaffected by contamination resulting  from the Chernobyl accident. The effects of the accident have  caused suffering to 2.4 million Belarussians.    Kinkel praised Minsk's compliance with disarmament treaties.  Like Kinkel, Kravchanka said he was in favor of an unlimited  extension of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear  weapons until 1995. Kravchanka asked for technical and  financial support for the destruction of tanks in accordance  with the Vienna CSCE treaty on the scrapping of conventional  weapons. Belarus must use its own financial resources to  destroy foreign -- Soviet -- tanks and needs assistance. All  formerly Soviet tanks that were withdrawn from abroad, including  those that were stationed in the GDR, were brought to Belarus.  Almost 2,000 tanks and 150 aircraft had to be destroyed, more  than in the United States, Great Britain, and France. The  destruction of missiles in line with START I nuclear disarmament  is also costly. Kinkel promised that Germany would send experts  to Russia to check what costs are involved. He could not,  however, make any financial commitments. Kravchanka said that  Belarus essentially took a "positive" view of the NATO offer of  a Partnership for Peace, but had not made any official decision  so far. Belarus would like to strengthen economic and political  relations with Germany.</p>

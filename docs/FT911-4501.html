			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Sweden sets date for EC entry application SWEDEN'S ruling Social Democrats intend to apply this summer for European Community membership without insisting on conditions upholding the country's traditional neutrality, according to government sources, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. Ministers now argue that Sweden should remain free from any existing military alliance but take a full part in the shaping of a common EC foreign and security policy. They are even ready to wait and see whether the country should become involved in any eventual Community defence union.</p>

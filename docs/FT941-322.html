			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Viacom to sell cable TV stake Hearst Corp and Capital Cities/ABC have agreed to purchase Viacom's one-third interest in Lifetime Television for Dollars 317.6m in cash, AP-DJ reports from New York. Hearst and Capital Cities, which currently each own one-third interests in the cable network, will each own half interests upon completion of the deal. Viacom said that it made the sale because 'a minority interest in the network does not fit into our strategic objectives'. Lifetime is available on more than 5,800 cable systems, serving nearly 59m households.</p>

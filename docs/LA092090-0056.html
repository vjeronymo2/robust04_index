			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mustang Ranch Seized: The Mustang Ranch, one of the world's best-known  brothels, has been seized by the Internal Revenue Service and may soon be  operated by a federal bankruptcy court.  </P> <P> After years of negotiations over millions in unpaid taxes owed by owner Joe  Conforte, the IRS obtained an order from the bankruptcy court in Reno to begin  liquidating the 105-room brothel. Jerri Coppa, the bankruptcy trustee assigned  by the court to sell the property, said she planned to supervise the operation  of the business until it could be sold. Coppa said when she arrived at the  ranch, which is located about six miles east of Reno, she found the  establishment closed and the employees scattered.  </P></p>

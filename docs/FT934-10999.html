			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Palestinians suspend talks TALKS between Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiators broke down yesterday over the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip. The Palestinian team, led by Mr Nabil Shaath, said it was suspending talks with Israel until next week and would consult Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, before resuming the talks on the details of implementing the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. The disagreement over the extent of Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza, due to begin in less than six weeks, is the first real snag in the talks which are supposed to conclude a protocol on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank area of Jericho by the middle of next month. On Monday Israel presented maps and plans for the withdrawal and redeployment of its soldiers, which leaves control of several roads used by the 5,000 Jewish settlers in Gaza in Israeli hands. Substantial Israeli forces would also remain in the settlements, on the beaches and on the roads even after a withdrawal was supposed to have been completed by April. There would be full Israeli control over the border crossing from Gaza into Egypt, and plans to ensure the protection of Israeli settlers moving through the Gaza area. Palestinians say the proposals contravene the peace agreement. They are particularly upset at Israel's insistence that it maintain a military presence over roads leading into the settlements which pass through Palestinians population areas. After yesterday's breakdown Palestinians said they would demand complete Israeli troop withdrawal.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Watchdog pledges curbs on excessive electricity profits THE 12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales will not be allowed to make big profits at the expense of customers, the Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer) said yesterday. In a statement timed to coincide with the start of the companies' results season, Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, said consumers were concerned by the average 40 per cent rise in profits expected from the companies. Miss Penny Boys, deputy director of Offer, said the statement aimed to anticipate media criticism of these profits and reassure customers. That did not deter Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, from criticising the 41 per cent rise in profits announced yesterday by East Midlands Electricity. 'Never in the field of public utilities have so many made such enormous profits for doing so little,' he said. City analysts said Offer's statement simply reiterated its belief that the companies must not reward shareholders at the expense of customers. 'There's nothing in it that causes me concern,' said Mr John Harris, chairman and chief executive of East Midlands Electricity. Mr Ken Harvey, chairman of Norweb, the regional company reporting results tomorrow, said: 'Our price increases have been below the rate of inflation for the last four to five years.' Prof Littlechild sought to reassure customers that he would ensure the companies were not making too much money, and were providing a good service. But he also noted that the companies' large profits this year were due to a technical blip. Electricity prices increased by about 11 per cent last year as the companies compensated for undercharging in the previous year. They had underestimated inflation, one of the factors in the formula governing price rises. These big increases will not be repeated next year, since prices rose by about 2 per cent this April, the regulator said. Miss Boys said Offer was likely to tighten the price formulae when it reviews them in 1994 and 1995. It is also likely to include in the formulae a historical inflation adjustment, rather than a forecast. This would help to eliminate the swings in profits that occur when prices are to compensate for inaccurate inflation forecasts. East Midlands results, Page 23</p>

Minister Granic told reporters that the talks focused on the  situation in the former Yugoslavia, particularly in the light of  the latest Washington agreements. He informed the Norwegian  foreign minister of Croatian activities at the United Nations  and the Security Council, as well as of perspectives for future  negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs and the local Serbs in the  occupied areas in Croatia.    The Croatian foreign minister said Norway congratulated  Croatia on the [Croat-Muslim] agreement as the foundation for  future peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He added that Norway  believes the problems of the UN-protected areas in Croatia and  of Bosnia-Herzegovina will have to be solved simultaneously.  Minister Granic said that Norway is interested in developments  in the former Yugoslavia and is ready to provide humanitarian  aid and lend assistance in the reconstruction. Norway will soon  hold a referendum on joining the EU [European Union], and one of  Croatia's main aims is to obtain associate membership in the EU,  Minister Granic said, adding that this will be discussed further.    The two ministers will resume talks over a working lunch  when  they will discuss mutual relations. An agreement on technical  and cultural cooperation, which is soon to be signed, is of  special importance, as well as improved economic relations  between the two countries.</p>

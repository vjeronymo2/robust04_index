			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON;  </P> <P> TREATING GALLSTONES  </P> <P> Question: What are gallstones? What are the symptoms that let you know that you  have them? What can be done to get rid of them?  </P> <P> Answer: Gallstones are composed of cholesterol or calcium. The symptoms include  pain in the upper abdomen after a meal, particularly one that includes fatty  foods. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting and fever.  </P> <P> Gallstones can be removed by surgery, dissolved with drugs, or treated by shock  waves (lithotripsy). As many as 50% of all gallstones that are treated  medically reappear within 10 years. Surgery is a permanent cure.  </P></p>

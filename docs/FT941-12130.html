			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Observer: Leave taking The government's tortuous review of local government in England and Wales had further hiccups yesterday at London's High Court. Cleveland and Avon county councils were seeking leave for a judicial review of the Local Government Commission's proposals for their areas. But as proceedings began, Mr Justice Harrison, due to hear the application, said he felt he should not, as he is a friend of Sir John Banham, the LGC's chairman, and has discussed local government reorganisation with him on numerous occasions. The next judge pencilled in, Mr Justice Pill, also stepped down, because of his role as vice-chairman of the Welsh Boundary Commission. Mr Justice Potts came to the rescue after lunch; and granted the councils' wish.</p>

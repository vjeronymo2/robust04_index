			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Iran-Pakistan Declaration"] </F>   [Text] Pakistan and Iran will increase defense cooperation.  In addition, memoranda about the agreement for a joint gas  pipeline between the two countries have also been signed.  Members of the agreement expressed satisfaction at the  cooperation between the two countries. In the joint communique  released by the two countries, emphasis was placed on stopping  the atrocities being committed on the people of Kashmir and on  respecting human rights. They emphasized that the Kashmir issue  be resolved according to the UN resolution. This communique  strongly demanded that efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue be  accelerated. The joint communique asked that the opposing groups  in Afghanistan stop fighting. It accentuated the importance of  lasting peace in the Middle East, as well as cooperation and  agreement among Muslim religious leaders.    The joint communique from Iran and Pakistan is proof of past  relations between the two countries. If we look at it within the  framework of the present situation in the world it is very  important, because the international situation at present shows  a lot of unrest in the Islamic world because of the conspiracies  of the Hindus and Jews against Muslims. The Indian atrocities in  Kashmir, the massacre of Muslims in Bosnia, and the Jewish  aggression against the Muslims in Palestine are problems which  we can resolve by working together.    Wherever the Muslims live now, there are economic and social  problems. The non-Muslims also have a monopoly over trade and  commerce. From the perspective of resources, Muslims are not  behind in any country; however, the disagreements and minor  scuffles among the Pakistani nations, as well as the unnecessary  confrontation, have stopped Islam from making an important place  for itself in the world. Even today, if Muslim nations cooperate  with each other in economic and social areas, no power in the  world can insult them.    It is our misfortune that we have to depend on non-Muslims  to  obtain modern technology. If we sign mutual agreements for  exchange of technology, then we will not have to look at anyone  else.    Iran, after the 1979 Islamic revolution, started to use its  own resources. Soon after this revolution, the imperialists  forced a war on Iran. Still, after this long war, Iran managed  to keep its economic and social conditions under control. All  this happened because of its strong faith, which was helped by  the grace of Allah. Imam Khomeini once said that neither the  United States nor communism were superpowers; only God is the  superpower. If we trust someone else, then our faith is weak. In  light of Imam Khomeini's statement, Iran confronted a major  superpower, which influenced politics worldwide.    It is a welcome development that the Muslim nations are also  changing slowly, and that an atmosphere of mutual cooperation is  increasing. This will help us to at least escape the control of  foreigners. Relations between Pakistan and Iran for the last  half century have prepared Pakistan to openly trust the Iranian  Government and the people there. The people of Pakistan declare  Iran their second home; similarly, our brothers in Iran consider  Pakistan their second home. We pray the agreements made between  the two countries will last until the end of the world, and that  friendly relations between the governments and the people of  Iran and Pakistan will never end.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Worner warns Germany over 'no-fly' role A DECISION by Nato to impose a no-flight zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina would 'without a doubt' influence the military situation, and bring an end to the war in the former Yugoslav republic, Mr Manfred Worner, secretary- general of the western military alliance, has told a German newspaper. But if the decision is taken, Mr Worner warned that Germany must finally decide if it will allow its crews to staff the alliance's Awacs, the surveillance aircraft needed to impose the ban. In the clearest signal to date from Nato, the secretary-gengeneral, who is German, told the Hamburg daily Die Welt that the 16 member states of the alliance, with the support of the UN security council, must 'by all appropriate means' stop the conflict spreading to Macedonia, and the Serb-controlled southern province of Kosovo. Although he did not go into detail about how the conflict could be contained, German and western military officials recently said Nato was now making contingent plans to impose a no-flight ban over Bosnia from Geilenkirchen, western Germany, close to the Dutch border, where the Awacs are based. The problem is that the 18 Awacs aircraft are commanded by a German general, and a third of the crew are German personnel. Under Germany's constitution, the deployment of the Bundeswehr, or military, from activities outside the Nato area, is banned. Attempts over the past 10 days by the ruling coalition of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, and the Liberal the opposition Social Democratic parties, to agree on constitutional amendments have failed. Mr Worner said any German withdrawal from the Awacs fleet would damage its efficiency. 'My hope is that Germany will keep its pilots, crews and other personnel in that fleet. . . Germany will surely not put at risk its ability to act as a member of the alliance,' he said after a Nato meeting in Brussels on Friday. General Klaus Naumann, the chief of Germany's armed forces, said Germany should withdraw from the command of the Awacs fleet if Bonn refused to participate in imposing a no-flight zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina. Both Bosnian Serb and Croat forces from Croatia repeatedly fly over Bosnian air-space in contravention of a tacit agreement at last August's London peace conference to respect a ban on flights.</p>

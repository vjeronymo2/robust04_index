			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (3): Message from the sponsors - Seiko Challenge is the essence of sport. Each and every Olympic Games comes alive when the world sees young men and women who have the courage to put on display their skill, their passion for excellence and their will to win. For these athletes, the next 16 days in Lillehammer will be the ultimate challenge of their sporting lives. Seiko represents this spirit of challenge and will do justice to it by providing to the athletes and their events the highest level of timing technology ever seen at a winter sports event. Since 1964 when our appointment as Official Timer to the Summer Olympic Games was the catalyst for Seiko to develop Quartz Timing Technology, we have continuously set new standards and accepted the challenge posed by the ever-increasing needs of sport for timing systems accurate to the millisecond and capable of instantaneous transmission to spectators, athletes and TV viewers world-wide. To our technology partners in the Olympic Family; to the Organiser of the Games; and, most of all, to the athletes; we offer our commitment to help Lillehammer 1994 be the best Winter Games in history. Mr Masahiro Sekimoto President, Seiko Corporation</p>

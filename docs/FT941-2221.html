			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Astec (BSR) doubles to Pounds 14.9m Astec (BSR), the Hong Kong-based and London-listed electronics company, 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson Electric of the US, yesterday reported a sharp increase in pre-tax profits reflecting the benefits of its reorganisation in recent years. The group, which claims to be the worlds largest supplier of power conversion products, reported a near-doubling of pre-tax profits to Pounds 14.9m, against Pounds 7.82m struck after Pounds 5.82m of restructuring costs offset by Pounds 5.5m of profits on the sale of operations. Turnover grew by 16 per cent to Pounds 291.4m (Pounds 251m). On a comparable basis, adjusting for exchange rate movements and discontinued businesses, turnover increased by 6.6 per cent. Group operating profits grew by 58 per cent to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 9.61m) as margins widened from 3.8 per cent to 5.2 per cent. The core power conversion business reported operating profits of Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 9.15m) on sales up 29 per cent to Pounds 135.6m (Pounds 182.5m). Adjusting for exchange rate movements, power conversion sales grew by 8.6 per cent compared with world market growth of 6.2 per cent. After returning to profitability in 1992 the electronic components business reported increased operating profits of Pounds 2m (Pounds 465,000) on sales down 18 per cent to Pounds 55.9m (Pounds 68.4m). Adjusting for discontinued operations and exchange rate movements, sales decreased by 1.2 per cent. The group ended the year with Pounds 7.3m of net cash, compared with net debt of Pounds 11.6m at the end of 1992. Earnings per share increased to 4.16p (2.15p). An 0.5p final dividend is recommended making a total of 0.75p (nil). COMMENT Astec's senior management, led by Mr George Tamke, chief executive, has made considerable progress re-focusing the group on its core power supply business, restructuring the balance sheet and positioning it for growth. The world power supply market remains highly fragmented, but Astec already ranks number one and expects to grow bigger, both through organic growth and acquisition. Economies of scale and tweeking the product mix should enable the group to keep margins moving ahead. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 20.5m look possible this year producing earnings of about 5.7p. The shares, which gained 2p yesterday to 91p, have risen steadily over the past two years and are now trading on a prospective p/e of 16. They could go higher.</p>

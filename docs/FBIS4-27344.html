			<p>CSO     [Text] Marubeni has made a business tieup with a major oil  company of Russia, Siberia Far East Petroleum (SIDANCO, Moscow).  Marubeni will cooperate with SIDANCO from delivery of machinery  and facilities for drilling and refining to capital procurement  and overseas expansion. In the future, they also will consider  investment. The Russian Government has the idea of cultivating  major domestic firms into [international] majors (international  oil capital). Marubeni's plan is to ensure an oil supply base  for Japan through this tieup.    SIDANCO was just established on 5 May. Eight oil production,  transport, and refining companies with Tyumen Province of  Western Siberia as a home base and the Russian government have  jointly financed it. The crude oil production capability of the  group is 700,000 barrels a day. Their scale follows Rosnefte and  Look [as transliterated] Oil in Russia. In the future, they also  are scheduling oil field development in the eastern part of  Russia such as Eastern Siberia and the Far East, and expansion  to China and Vietnam as well.    Marubeni has made a tieup with a U.S. oil company,  Anglo-Swiss (Houston, Texas), which has a record of establishing  joint-venture firms with Russia. Besides cooperating in order to  bring financing from Japanese Government-affiliated agencies on  the development of new mining areas at home and abroad by  SIDANCO, they are undertaking the export of pipe. Furthermore,  they are prepared to invest in any case since the Russian  Government has approved acquisition of up to 15 percent of  SIDANCO stock (currently 5 billion yen) by foreign investment.    Marubeni views SIDANCO as being able to become a supply  source of crude oil and petroleum products for Japan which is  close in terms of distance.    Currently, two groups, the Japan-U.S.-Europe five-company  cartel with Mitsui Corp., and a cartel with U.S. Exxon and  Sakhalin Oil Development Cooperation (SODECO), a Japanese  Government and privately financed company, are proceeding with a  development program off Sahalin, but the possibility has emerged  that a new export to Japan project with the participation of  Japanese firms will appear.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Nato, Russia in talks accord Nato yesterday agreed to Russia's request for urgent talks on the relationship between Moscow and the alliance, despite bitter arguments at last week's meeting of foreign ministers in Istanbul. Ambassadors from the 16 Nato members yesterday 'agreed to invite Russia to begin discussions in Brussels immediately', according to an alliance spokesman. Until recently, the alliance had been insisting that Russia must join its Partnership For Peace military co-operation programme under the same procedure as the existing 20 members, by signing up first and discussing practical details later. However yesterday's decision confirmed that Russia is having some success in convincing the alliance that a wide-ranging agreement in principle on the shape of Russia-Nato relations must be sealed before Moscow signs up to PFP. At last week's meeting in Istanbul between foreign ministers of Nato and the former Warsaw Pact, western diplomats described as a 'disgrace' the firmness with which Russia insisted on several key points in the final communique. These included the exclusion of any reference to the possibility that countries such as Poland and Hungary might become full members of Nato.</p>

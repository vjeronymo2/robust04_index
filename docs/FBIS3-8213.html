			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian </F> Serbs, by an unidentified reporter; place and date not given:  "Pushed Under the Russian Wing"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] For the first time NATO has enforced  the no-fly zone over Bosnia by force. Has this blow taught the  Serbs to be afraid?    [Karadzic] NATO's interference in our crisis is a disaster.  NATO is clearly anti-Serbian, and threats directed one-sidedly  against us will not lead to peace. No organization is  legitimated to supplant the United Nations.    [DER SPIEGEL] However, the United Nations has proved to be  incapable of dealing with the crisis and has not been able to  implement any resolutions.    [Karadzic] Then the United Nations must reinforce its  troops. Such a mission must not be left to a block pursuing its  own interests. NATO, which has long become obsolete since the  dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, has made use of the weakness of  the United Nations and is now acting completely on its own.    [DER SPIEGEL] But giving the order for an operation still  rests with the UN commanders on site.    [Karadzic] NATO was determined to shoot also without an  order. The Western alliance had the need to do so. Therefore,  Boris Yeltsin asked me and President Milosevic to give in.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is it not becoming increasingly likely that  there will be a new Yalta in the Balkans, with Serbia falling  into the Russians' sphere of interests?    [Karadzic] The Russian culture, the Russian people and its  religion are very close to us. However, when we are pushed  under the Russian wing in political terms, this is just the  fault of the West. It has proved to be merciless and aggressive  toward our people. We are in a situation where one cannot  choose one's friends. If Russia offers to protect our rights,  we cannot refuse this.    [DER SPIEGEL] You have just been to Moscow. Did President  Yeltsin promise you any specific help if there was a further  escalation between Serbs and NATO?    [Karadzic] Of course, Russia will not permit NATO to  dominate the Balkans. Nor can Moscow have any interest in  letting the conflict spread to Greece, Turkey, or Albania. By  the way -- we can defend ourselves.    [DER SPIEGEL] President Yeltsin has suggested a peace  conference with the big five: the United States, Russia,  France, Britain, and Germany. Would you participate in such a  conference and sign a peace plan worked out there?    [Karadzic] This conference would have to be prepared well.  All three sides would have to make sacrifices. The final  outcome should be an international peace treaty similar to the  one of Versailles in 1919 that sets down the new borders.    [DER SPIEGEL] And what should these borders be like?    [Karadzic] Our idea was the formation of a Muslim state in  Bosnia with 33.3 percent of the territory. This is enough to  survive. There are smaller states. We wanted to exchange  territories with Croatia. As a result, the Serbs would not have  gotten everything and the Croats would not have lost everything.    [DER SPIEGEL] In the meantime, an agreement between Bosnian  Muslims and Croats has been achieved, who want to form a joint  federation and then plan to establish a confederation with  Croatia. Will the Bosnian Serbs join this model?    [Karadzic] Only political illiterates could expect us to do  that. We lived in the so-called Croatian-Muslim state in World  War II. At that time hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed  under German protection under German protection. For us there  can only be an independent Serbian state in Bosnia or the  unification of the Bosnian Serbs with all other Serbs in one  state. Anything else would be unnatural.</p>

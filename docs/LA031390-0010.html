			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAW REQUIRES DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE PARKLAND  </P> <P> The Culver City Council has adopted a law requiring developers of residential  units to provide the city with three acres of parkland for every 1,000  residents their project would house.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 2 last week, with Councilmen Jim Boulgarides and Steven  Gourley dissenting, to approve the ordinance, designed to address an increasing  shortage of park and recreation facilities in the city.  </P> <P> Developers would be allowed to either dedicate the required amount of land for  public recreation use or pay a fee. The law also allows the council to grant up  to a 50% credit toward the requirement for proposed private open space and  recreation facilities within the project.  </P></p>

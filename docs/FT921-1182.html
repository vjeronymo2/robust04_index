			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / Boost for R&amp;D is urged THE Semiconductor Manufacturers Association said yesterday that whoever won the election needed to understand the importance of encouraging industry to invest in training and research and development. Mr Ken Sanders, managing director of Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor manufacturer, said that a Conservative plan requiring employers who poached a worker to compensate the other company for its investment in training did not address the lack of training in the UK. He said the government should also encourage wider adoption of common standards to raise the effectiveness of industry. The association also noted that it had started to see the first signs of recovery in the past three to four months, with some members reporting business levels exceeding those of any period since 1988.</p>

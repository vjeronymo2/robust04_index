			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Government bond prices given boost UK government bond prices were boosted yesterday by the chancellor's announcement that there would be a Pounds 6.8bn reduction in official sales of gilt-edged stock during the next 18 months, because of a policy change announced in the last Budget, Conner Middelmann writes. The long-dated gilt futures contract rose sharply, from 115 25/32 just before the speech to close at 116 5/8 . It rallied further to 116 29/32 in after-hours trading. In the March Budget the then chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, announced that sales of gilts to banks and building societies from 1993-94 onwards would count towards the funding of the borrowing requirement in the same way as sales to other institutions. He also announced a second measure designed to help the government fund its borrowing requirement. He said that any gilt sales to banks and building societies which had already been made in 1992-93 would be used to reduce funding requirements over the following two to three years - though at that stage it was not known how much had been sold to these institutions. Mr Clarke said yesterday that Pounds 6.8bn had been raised by gilt sales to banks and building societies in 1992-93. He added that none of this had yet been used in the government's current funding operations. As a result, gilt sales between now and the end of 1994-95 will be Pounds 6.8bn lower than would otherwise have been the case, he said. 'This was the announcement that kick-started the market yesterday,' said Mr Chris Anthony, gilts analyst at UBS. Lowering next year's gross gilt issuance by Pounds 6.8bn 'reduces the risk that things will go sour', he added, meaning that the government could otherwise have had difficulty making gilt sales. Funding for the current financial year has gone relatively smoothly, with some Pounds 43bn of the total Pounds 50bn PSBR covered so far.</p>

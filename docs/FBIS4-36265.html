			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by tourism affairs correspondent Ilan Shehori] </F>   [Excerpts] Senior Transportation Ministry officials are  examining the possibility of abrogating the present aviation  agreement between Israel and the United States and demanding  that a new aviation agreement be negotiated with the Americans.  The sources claim that the conditions of the present agreement  discriminate against Israel and enable the Americans to carry  out an unlimited number of flights to Israel.    Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar yesterday held an  emergency meeting after U.S. aviation authorities announced  their decision to implement sanctions against Israel by  canceling three weekly El Al flights to the United States  starting two weeks from today. This will reduce the number of  weekly El Al flights to the United States from 20 to 17. U.S.  aviation authorities also plan to ban El Al from flying to  various destinations inside the United States.    The Americans announced their intention to impose sanctions  against Israel after the Israeli Transportation Ministry refused  the request of U.S. airline World Airways to hold three regular  weekly flights on the New York-Tel Aviv line.    Qeysar summoned El Al director general Rafi Harlev and the  heads of the Civil Aviation Administration to the consultation.  The ministry's legal adviser also attended the meeting.    In the meeting, Minister Qeysar sharply criticized the  manner  in which Israel was informed about the sanctions against El Al.  He said that last week a representative of the American airline  came to his Knesset office, and that even before he was able to  brief the airline management about his meeting with Qeysar, the  U.S. Department of Transportation decided to announce sanctions  against El Al.    Following the consultation Qeysar decided to send a letter  to  U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena requesting that, in  accordance with U.S. law, a 30-day extension be granted before  the sanctions against El Al are implemented. The same law  states that another 60-day extension is possible before  sanctions are implemented. [passage omitted]    The transportation minister will travel to the United States  for talks with the U.S. transportation secretary and other  senior administration officials late this month. In these  meetings Qeysar will apparently demand that the current  Israel-American aviation agreement be abrogated. [passage  omitted]    Qeysar said yesterday: "Approximately two weeks ago the U.S.  transportation secretary and myself agreed that no steps be  taken against El Al until our meeting in Washington late this  month, but unfortunately this did not help."    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 6 June  carries a recorded passage of Minister Qeysar answering a  question about the dispute with World Airways, in which he says  that "we are now negotiating to find some compromise. We just  finished a conversation overseas with the representative of  World Airways, and we are going to reach a compromise. We don't  want any war with the Americans, because they are our best  allies. We have no reason to have a conflict with the  Americans."] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia plans to set up a huge military district in  the Northern Caucasus complete with mobile and other forces and  powerful weaponry.    Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in an interview with Interfax  in Rostov-on-Don on Wednesday said that everything had been done  in the past two years to turn the North Caucasian Military  District into an army grouping "capable of conducting combat  operations" to defuse small or big conflicts.    Grachev said the district would also have to solve domestic  tasks in line with Russia's defense doctrine which provides for  the armed forces and Interior Ministry troops to conduct joint  security operations.    In this connection, he said that if regional security forces  were unable to cope with their duties, Russian troops would take  part in cracking down on "terrorist groups" which had mushroomed  in the region.    The minister is at the start of a regional tour to inspect  troops deployed in the Northern Caucasus. He plans to visit  army units and meet leaders of the region where Russian troops  are deployed.    On Thursday Grachev is scheduled to visit Anapa,  Novorossiysk  and Makhachkala. Nor does he rule out visiting Abkhazia "if any  changes occur in the area of the conflict" between Georgia and  Abkhazia.</p>

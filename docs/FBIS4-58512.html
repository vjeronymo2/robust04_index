			<p>BFN     [Text] Two soldiers were injured in stone-throwing  incidents in the territories yesterday. Near Nabulus, a soldier  suffered medium injuries when a military vehicle in which he was  traveling came under a hail of stones. He was taken to  Beilinson Hospital for treatment. The village of Hawwarah,  where the incident took place, is under curfew.    In Jericho, a soldier suffered light injuries when local  residents threw stones and bottles at the police station at the  center of town.    During the night, dozens of right-wing activists and  settlers  continued their efforts to try to reach the ancient Jewish  synagogue in Jericho. Part of the town has been declared a  closed military area. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says soldiers  were busy chasing those trying to infiltrate. Several arrests  were made.</p>

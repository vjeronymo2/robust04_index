			<p>BFN     [Text] In a report citing Amman Radio and attributed to an  Iraqi official, MENA said a short while ago that the Iraqi  authorities have detained a Lebanese diplomat in Baghdad in  retaliation for the Lebanese Government's measures against the  Iraqi diplomats who were accused of assassinating Shaykh Talib  al-Suhayl al-Tamimi. The Iraqi official did not mention the  name of the Lebanese diplomat.    It should be noted that only one diplomat was serving at the  Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad. He is Charge d'Affaires Sa'd  Dakhya, who was summoned to Beirut on the second day of the  crime and before the Council of Ministers made its decision to  break off diplomatic relations with Baghdad. The Foreign  Ministry has stated that there are no Lebanese diplomats in Iraq  at present.    Commenting on the Iraqi report, Foreign Minister Faris  Buwayz  said a short while ago: I have been informed of the report, but  we have no Lebanese diplomats in Iraq.    Minister Buwayz then left his office at the Foreign Ministry  for B'abda Palace for a meeting with President Ilyas al-Hirawi  and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.    It should be noted that there are five locally hired  Lebanese  citizens at the Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad who have no  diplomatic status. They carry special identity cards from the  Iraqi Foreign Ministry.</p>

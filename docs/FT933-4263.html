			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Brazilian steel deal probe BRAZILIAN government officials were yesterday discussing anti-trust implications of the acquisition of Cosipa, the recently-privatised Brazilian steel producer, by Usiminas. If approved by the government, the sale would give Usiminas, itself privatised in 1991, control over 61 per cent of Brazilian output in flat rolled steel and all of its output in heavy steel plates, said Mr Rui Coutinho de Nascimento, president of the Administrative Council for the Defence of the Economy (CADE). Mr Coutinho was yesterday discussing the situation with Brazil's minister of mines and energy, Mr Paulino Cicero. The acquisition of Cosipa by Usiminas could be annulled if CADE, the justice ministry agency responsible for anti-trust investigations, decides that the deal would result in over-concentration in the steel industry, said the offi-cial.</p>

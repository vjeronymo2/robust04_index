It Promises To Pass Without Delay  Laws of Top State Importance"]    [Text] The State Duma will adopt a decree today on where  it stands on the president's message "On Strengthening the  Russian State." The draft of the Duma decree was prepared by a  working group under Valentin Kovalev (Russian Federation  Communist Party), the chamber's deputy chairman. The document  has been signed by representatives of all factions except  Yabloko, as well as separately by Mr. Zhirinovskiy and Mr.  Gaydar. The draft of this decree is a marriage -- one upon  which various Duma factions insisted -- of a declaratory  reaction and of a rather negative reaction.    The decree points out that the most important task facing  the  State Duma, which shares the main points of the president's  message, is legislative support for "the Russian Federation's  evolution toward the creation of an integral and stable  democratic state where human and civil rights are honored, where  an efficient economy functions, where the principles of  federative relations are consistently realized, and the rights  of big and small nations are upheld." The draft decree suggests  that the government evolve a plan of measures to overcome the  socioeconomic crisis. As for Duma activity in the realm of  draft laws, it is supposed to give priority to draft laws  dealing with stabilization of the economy, finances, and  protection for the country's commodity producers.    The State Duma thinks it necessary to set up conciliation  working groups of representatives of the president's staff, the  government, and the Federal Assembly in order to "minimize the  time consumed in the procedure of agreeing on the top state  priority draft laws, and promises to consider them without  delay. The last point of the draft decree proposes that the  president and the government should settle the nonpayment crisis  and eliminate delays in the payment of wages.</p>

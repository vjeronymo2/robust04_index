			<p>BFN     [Text] A regional trial court in Quezon Province, 180  kilometers south of Manila, has ordered the transfer of captured  Leftist leader Wilma Tiamzon from the national police to the  custody of a Joint Peace Committee of the Catholic Bishops'  Conference and the National Council of Churches in the  Philippines. The court order virtually released Tiamzon to the  Joint Peace Committee, which named Bishop Alberto Ramento as  Tiamzon's local guardian and who shall be charged to their  safety and appearance in court. [sentence as heard] The  arrangement was reached after President Ramos earlier announced  Tiamzon's release on the recognizance of a responsible  institution.</p>

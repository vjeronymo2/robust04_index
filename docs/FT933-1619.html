			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Gain in readers held by Times THE TIMES is continuing to hold on to a circulation increase of more than 30 per cent nearly three weeks after the newspaper cut its weekday cover price by 15p to 30p. The official ABC sales figure for the first week of the price reduction shows an average sale of 461,000. The average figure for August was 354,280. Sales in the second week are expected to be about 468,000. Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, which is owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International media group, said yesterday: 'It's a success. People agree that price is a factor, including university lecturers and civil servants - our core readership.' Wholesalers say that the main loser has been The Daily Telegraph, which has a cover price of 48p. According to some it has lost as much as 4 per cent. Other papers have not been seriously affected. Sales of The Independent, which costs 45p, were less than 1 per cent lower, although at this time of the year sales ought to be rising. The broadsheet market as a whole is estimated to have risen by just over 1 per cent. Mr Stothard said yesterday that he was receiving as many as 40 letters a day on the price cut, most of them from former readers of The Daily Telegraph and those who used to buy The Times two or three times a week and now take it more regularly. The ABC figures for The Sun, another News International paper, indicated that its 5p price reduction to 20p increased the sales of the popular tabloid by 234,341 to 3.832m in August, an increase of nearly 7 per cent.</p>

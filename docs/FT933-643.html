			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 75m of HTR Japan with institutions HENDERSON Touche Remnant announced yesterday that it had placed Pounds 75m with institutions for its HTR Japanese Smaller Companies Trust. The trust - the first new launch by the recently-merged fund management group - was offered to the public yesterday. Henderson TR's aim is to raise Pounds 100m, so Pounds 25m is available through the offer for subscription. The offer consists of ordinary shares at 100p, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. The existence of the warrants, which will trade separately, is a device designed to deal with the discount problem, since shares in investment trusts often trade at a discount to net assets. The warrants will have a value which should compensate investors for any discount which occurs. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. The manager of the new trust, William Garnett, already runs Henderson Horizon Japanese smaller companies, an offshore, open-ended fund. Henderson TR believes that low interest rates and increased government spending will help the Japanese economy to grow appreciably in 1994 and 1995. The public offer closes at noon October 14 and dealings open on October 22. The annual management fee will be 1 per cent, and 75 per cent of the management and interest costs will be charged to the capital account.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Nokia in German move to cut costs NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, has shifted production of its small-screen television sets from the Far East to Germany, claiming that the move will cut costs and improve quality, Andrew Adonis writes. Nokia, one of Europe's top three television manufacturers, expects to reduce its production costs by up to 20 per cent by concentrating television production in Germany instead of continuing with an arrangement with Sanyo, the Japanese supplier, in Singapore. The shift involves a DM20m (Pounds 8m) investment in two new production lines, but no net increase in employment. Mr Heikki Koskinen, president of Nokia's consumer electronics division, said he believed the move was the first of its kind in the industry. 'It will enable us to unify our development and production efforts, and offers the prospect of a reasonable margin at a competitive price.' Although it returned to profit in the first four months of this year on the back of fast expanding telecommunications sales, Nokia's consumer electronics division is still making losses, like those of most of its European competitors. The division accounted for a third of Nokia's sales.</p>

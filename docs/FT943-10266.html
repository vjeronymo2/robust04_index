			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Jobs growth braces US markets for rates rise US financial markets are bracing themselves for the Federal Reserve to raise short term interest rates after the government's July employment report showed that job creation was much stronger than expected. The headline unemployment rate rose in July to 6.1 per cent, compared with 6.0 per cent in June, the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported yesterday. But the number of non-farm jobs, which is based on a different survey and is watched more closely by investors and money market dealers, grew by 259,000 to 113.6m. Job creation was slower than in June, when 356,000 new jobs were added to non-farm payrolls, but economists had predicted an even sharper slowdown. Wall Street economists said the employment figures, which indicate a stronger economic outlook and the possibility of future inflationary pressures, increased the likelihood that the Fed, the central bank, would soon raise interest rates. Anticipating an increase, the US bond market dropped sharply yesterday, while share prices and the dollar weakened. Fed officials have in recent days seemed to be preparing the ground for an increase at or shortly after the August 16 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy. Fed governors told the New York Times earlier this week they were not convinced by possible signals that the economy might now be slowing down, such as the large increase in business inventories in the second quarter. Mr Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, said yesterday in a speech in Tacoma that he would not be unhappy if growth slowed in the second half of this year, and warned that the unemployment rate could not be expected to fall further without provoking an acceleration of inflation. However President Bill Clinton and his administration are anxious not to choke off the recovery by an increase in interest rates. Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, said yesterday the July employment figures were 'further proof that job growth is continuing its solid, steady course,' but he insisted that they 'exhibited no sign of inflation'. Private sector economists say the Fed could act very quickly in response to July's strong job creation data. 'We had thought that they would raise rates by 25 basis points at the August 16 meeting. We now think they might move before that,' said Mr Robert Mellman, an economist with New York's J. P. Morgan bank. The Bureau of Labour Statistics said its survey of households, on which the unemployment rate is based, showed a slight increase in the number of unemployed people to 8m. Many of the new non-farm jobs came in temporary employment programmes, restaurants and food stores, while higher wage jobs in the manufacturing sector remained steady at around 18m.

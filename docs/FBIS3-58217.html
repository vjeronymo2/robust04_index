Reports from southeastern Turkey indicate that the operation  against the PKK in sensitive areas has already begun. The State  of Emergency Governor's Office has moved to implement the  security measures planned for Nevruz [spring festival] and the  local elections in March. Teams have been established to work  at the Winter Operations Headquarters to maintain effective  coordination between the military and civilian units around the  clock. State of Emergency Governor Unal Erkan, Deputy State of  Emergency Governor Ahmet Erturk, and other high-ranking  officials closely studied the preparations during the past three  days.  <H5>  Special Teams Based in the Region </H5>   Special security measures are being taken against the PKK's  urban activities in Diyarbakir, Batman, and Sirnak, which have  been declared sensitive towns. It has been reported that the  towns are being patrolled by trained teams of two or four  security personnel armed with automatic Kalashnikov firearms.  The patrol units wear civilian clothes and carry field radios.  Meanwhile, some 500 civilian police have been transferred to  the region to maintain security at public establishments and  installations used by the media and the private sector.    It has been reported that the first special Army teams in  the  region have been based at the installations used by the Turkish  Coal Mining Works Company, which are 10 km from Sirnak. The  teams reportedly are prepared to render ineffective the Botan  branch of the PKK in Sirnak, Idil, and Cizre. It has also been  reported that they clashed with the PKK militants between  Ikiztepe and Toptepe Villages the night before last, and that  special teams will be deployed to predetermined areas in that  region.  <H5>  F-16 Aircraft Based in Diyarbakir </H5>   The preparatory work required to deploy F-16 aircraft at the  2d Tactical Air Base in Diyarbakir has been completed. Two F-16  squadrons reportedly will be based in Diyarbakir in the next few  days. The officials are convinced that the F-16's, which are  equipped with systems that lock on to enemy targets, will be  effective against the PKK.</p>

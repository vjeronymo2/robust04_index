			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German carmakers come into the limelight CARMAKERS came more broadly into the limelight yesterday as the big German groups replaced Volvo as the centre of international investment attention, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT majored on the motor industry as Volkswagen rose DM10 to DM338 and BMW by DM6 to DM523.50, VW and Daimler heading the active stocks list in turnover of DM888m, and DM864m. German stock market turnover rose from DM6.4bn to DM6.6bn as blue chips led equities higher. After a 1.59 fall to 679.34 in the broadly-based FAZ index at midsession, the 30-share DAX closed 8.51 higher at 1,680.91. Mr Bob Barber, who heads the European automotive and capital goods analysis team at James Capel, was not impressed with VW, noting that the company, which underperformed the market last year, faced an estimated drop of 12 per cent in new German car sales this year with 40 per cent of its own sales going into the domestic market. BMW yesterday confirmed that its sales and profits were higher in 1991, and forecast higher production and sales figures for the current year. In electricals, AEG had another of its sporadic surges, rising DM9.80 to DM224.20 and the battery group, Varta, rose DM11.50 to DM302. It said yesterday that final talks on a cooperation accord had begun with Japan's Toshiba Battery, and Duracell of the US on the production of rechargeable nickel hydride batteries. PARIS came back from its highs after an active day's trading. The CAC-40 index slipped 5.70 to 1,873.94 in relatively heavy volume of FFr3.2bn. Synthelabo, the pharmaceutical company controlled by L'Oreal, was unusually active as 92,700 shares or around 1 per cent of the company were put through the market in several large blocks. The stock fell FFr6 to FFr1,095. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs would only say that it had placed less than 5 per cent of the company yesterday. Dealers believed that the shares had come from the owners of companies recently taken over by Synthelabo and had been placed with institutions. Pernod Ricard, the drinks group, rose to an all-time high of FFr1,534 on continued takeover speculation before closing FFr10 down at FFr1,485 with a heavy 149,000 shares traded. Paribas ended FFr7.50 lower at FFr347.50 with 217,866 shares traded. After the close the bank announced that it had made a net attributable loss of FFr200m in 1991, which came in below expectations which had already been downgraded after the recent disclosure of heavy provisions for loans to Maxwell companies. MILAN weakened during the official session following the overnight loss on Wall Street. The Comit index fell 7.26 to 537.81 in turnover estimated at L100bn after Wednesday's L105.8bn. Fiat fell L133 or 2.6 per cent to L5,028 in the wake of its poor 1991 results and slipped to L5,025 after hours. The telecommunications sector came under pressure on rumours that Stet was launching a big bond with warrants into Sip savings shares and there were fears of heavy earnings dilution as a result. Stet slipped L13 to L2,261 while Sip savings shares fell L55 or 4 per cent to L1,320. STOCKHOLM saw another fall in Volvo in the aftermath of the abortive Volvo/Procordia merger. The B shares fell SKr7 to SKr378 on the day and 10 per cent from Monday's intraday peak of SKr420. The Affarsvarlden General index dropped 6.2 to 967.5 as brokers said that the market was also beginning to be troubled by the prospect of the Swedish corporate results seasons which begins next week. Market rumours indicate disappointing results from Electrolux, due to produce preliminary figures on next Tuesday. Yesterday the B shares slipped SKr3 to SKr239. AMSTERDAM slipped back slightly, the CBS Tendency Index shedding 0.1 to 121.00 in turnover of Fl 539.8m. Elsevier, which announced a strong profit forecast, rose Fl 2.40 to Fl 105.40. UK interest was reported to be heavy. Elsewhere in the publishing sector VNU rose Fl 0.5 to Fl 83.00. MADRID's general index fell 0.07 to 253.80. Asland, the cement group, which played down reports of possible US court action, drifted Pta40 to Pta2,065. Volume in Iberdrola, the utility, was high at 2.7m shares: the share price picked up Pta2 to Pta723. Telefonica continued its fall on the back of the pension fund problems, losing Pta5 to Pta1,160. OSLO gained in dull trading, the all-share index moving 1.5 to 445.00 in turnover of NKr217m. Saga B rose NKr4.5 to NKr95.5 on reports that the UK may lift a ban on imports of Norwegian gas.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 30  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1130.52  1130.91  1133.63  1135.73  1135.90  1132.96  1132.11  1131.87  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1136.67    Day's Low  1130.31  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Jan 29    Jan 28    Jan 27    Jan 24    Jan 23     1132.85   1143.22   1142.52   1131.86   1131.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

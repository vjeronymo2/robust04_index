			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Floods 'not economic threat' Economic activity in the US continued to expand slowly to moderately in June and the first half of July and was not threatened by Midwest flooding, according to US Federal Reserve banks, Reuter reports from Washington. In their Beige Book report, the banks said 'flooding inflicted considerable damage in parts of the Chicago, St Louis, Kansas City and Minneapolis districts, but the effects were said to be highly concentrated and were not seen to threaten overall economic expansion in any district'. The report, which is produced about every six weeks, was based on surveys of business executives conducted before July 27 by the 12 component banks of the US central bank. Midwest flooding, which is being called one of the worst natural catastrophes in US history, has killed 45 people and caused an estimated Dollars 10bn in damage.</p>

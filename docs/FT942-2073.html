			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Emap approach rebuffed by Trans World The board of Trans World Communications yesterday rebuffed an approach from Emap, the media and exhibitions group, for a recommended takeover that would have valued the commercial radio group at about Pounds 70m. The statement came after last week's announcement that Emap, which already owns 30 per cent of Trans World, had an agreement giving it until June 22 to buy at 181p a share the 22 per cent stake owned by Mr Owen Oyston. The six members of the 10-strong Trans World board who did not exclude themselves from the decision concluded that the premium on offer was not high enough. The board also expressed concern that the deal could face a legal challenge. A full Emap takeover of Trans World would breach the legal limit on the number and size of commercial radio licences which can be held by one company. The Radio Authority, the industry regulator, has agreed 'an ownership structure' that could be put in place for part of Emap's existing radio interests to enable it to comply with the rules. The directors of Guardian Media, publishers of The Guardian, which owns 20 per cent of Trans World, separately made it clear yesterday that it was considering a legal challenge to the ownership arrangements. The Trans World board said yesterday that the 181p price represented a premium of 5 per cent over the 172.3p average of marked bargains on the day before the Emap announcement. The board also emphasised yesterday that under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, Emap's statement that it would not increase its 181p offer was now binding. Emap declined to comment yesterday, although it is clear that if, as seems likely, it decides to go ahead with its purchase of the Oyston stake before tomorrow's deadline, it will hold a majority of the company. That in turn could lead to considerable uncertainty if there is a legal challenge. For now the Trans World directors urged shareholders to take no action at the moment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday  evaluated relations between Bolivia and the United States. He  said they are "narcotized," adding that Bolivian and U.S.  antidrug efforts have not yielded the expected results.    The minister examined the interdiction, prevention, and  alternative development programs. He admitted that "they have  had no visible effects" in either the United States or Bolivia.    Replying to questions from reporters, he said the subject is  "controversial" and has caused confrontations in the search for  consensus.    He said the reduction of illegal coca plantations in Bolivia  has not been reflected in the volume of drugs entering the U.S.  market. In addition, Bolivian peasant producers "have had no  guarantees on the sale of their products to that country."    The minister said the peasants have found no market for  their  products and, because of the economic nature of this problem,  they do not support the bilateral antidrug effort.    Among the achievements he mentioned were those attained  between 1987 and 1992, when the area of illegal coca plantations  was reduced by 47 percent, that is, by almost half of the limit  established.    He said: "This shows the Bolivian Government has made a very  great effort to reduce the offer of cocaine by reducing the  cultivated areas." He added: "This caused a debate on the  benefits of the policy and on its success or failure."    In Bolivia there is a clear difference between the  traditional use of coca, its cultural value and its historical  significance, and its use for the production of narcotics, which  is regulated by Bolivian-U.S. agreements.    This situation has, to a considerable extent, narcotized  Bolivian-U.S. relations, for which reason agreements and  exchange notes were signed each year, combining the repression  of traffickers with alternative development.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim] </F>   [Text] When historians and political analysts  retrospectively study Brazilian-U.S. relations, they are faced  with a paradox. At the beginning of the 1970's, Brazil was under  an authoritarian regime, human rights were not respected,  protectionism was the economic policy touchstone, and countries  intentionally avoided signing nonproliferation agreements in the  field of international security.    Brazilian-U.S. relations at the time, however, were deemed  excellent. So much so, that some critics even classified the  Brazilian international position as "sub-imperialistic." There  was even a famous sentence uttered by a U.S. president asserting  that the rest of Latin America would follow whatever trend  Brazil adopted. Accidentally or not, the sentence caused several  misunderstandings and was a source of problems for our  diplomacy. However, it eloquently expressed the U.S. concept  about the role performed by Brazil and emphasized the good level  of relations enjoyed by the two countries.    Twenty years have elapsed and now Brazil is an entirely  democratic country, has a free and energetic press, and active  movements are being staged by civilians. Human rights violations  -- which frequently are byproducts of social problems -- are  firmly fought by the government. These issues are dealt with in  absolute openness. Profound structural reforms translated into  liberation of the economy and privatizations have replaced old  protectionist practices. Brazil's firm commitment to disarmament  and nonproliferation has become the central issue of our foreign  policy. This was shown by the government's decision to sign  several international agreements on the peaceful use of nuclear  energy and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.    Despite all these changes, which actually make Brazil  further  approach values supported by the United States, one seems to  strongly perceive that the two countries' bilateral relations  have become worse. There is a widespread feeling in Brazil that  Americans see our country more as a "problem" than as an  important partner that deserves to be trusted. Great emphasis is  placed on trade conflicts and on certain specific aspects of the  human rights and environmental issues, although no similar  measures are adopted by the United States. In the economic  field, we have received a clear message that all the efforts  already made are not enough. Instead of concentrating their  attention on the 90 percent of the results already obtained,  Americans seem to prefer to point out the remaining 10 percent  that still must be done. A typical example of this attitude  refers to the intellectual property issue.    Apparently, our achievements in those areas are neither  understood nor reflected in concrete and positive attitudes. We  have opened our economy, but we were not granted -- except for a  token offer -- better access to the U.S. market for our leading  export products (contrary to one of the key promises made by  President Bush in his Initiative for the Americas). Despite the  strengthening of the democratic system in our country and the  efforts made by the government to come down heavily on those who  violate human rights, we continue to be the target of  unprecedented scrutiny and oversimplified criticism by the U.S.  press and public opinion. Our resolute adherence to  nonproliferation and disarmament has not facilitated our access  to advanced technology.    Some specific and transient aspects of our situation are  brought into focus with great interest, but they seem to miss  the essential aspects. The most significant event in recent  Brazilian history is the struggle for the consolidation of  democracy, a process that, under the leadership of President  Itamar Franco, has been underpinned by a strong moral component.  The series of events that led to the impeachment voted through  by Congress in 1992 and the probes into corruption charges that  Congress currently is conducting are at the very heart of a  veritable revolution that will have major implications for  Brazilian political culture. Brazilians are promoting  all-encompassing structural changes, which at present can only  be compared with the Clean Hands Operation in Italy. Under the  influence of public opinion that is becoming increasingly  involved in our country's affairs, our political system is being  shaken to its very foundations and will no longer be the same.  We are in the process of becoming an even more democratic  society with enhanced social awareness that will be built on  more solid moral values. The strongholds of impunity, even those  of the powerful, are already beginning to crumble.    Brazil is trying to solve its economic problems in a free,  democratic, and pluralistic atmosphere. We are confronting our  problems without resorting to magic or conjuring tricks. We  reject the authoritarian temptation of having recourse to  technocratic formulas, which always impose the greatest  sacrifices on the most vulnerable segments of the population.  President Itamar Franco and Brazilian society have chosen a  different path. It may very well be a more complex and exacting  path, but it can undoubtedly be upheld by a consensual and  democratic framework. Much of the criticism that one reads or  hears reveals that these things are poorly understood.    There are other aspects that have a significant impact on  relations between Brazil and the United States. Brazil is  characterized by a constant trait -- it is a country that has a  natural leaning toward peace. Its actions in the international  arena are predictable and trustworthy. These qualities have  enabled us to maintain harmonious relations with all our  neighbors in South America for a century. Our vocation for  fostering nonhegemonic and cooperative relations also is  projected in other regions, especially Africa. Moreover, our  country is not torn by any conflicts on account of racial,  cultural, or religious matters. This is particularly important  at a time when the resurgence of hatred due to racial  considerations is putting the lives of so many people of the  world in jeopardy. We take great pride in these attributes and,  besides, they obviously represent a contribution to world peace  and security. Even speaking in terms of economic considerations,  this unique combination of a peaceful and stable environment  both domestically and internationally may prove to be a  "comparative advantage" for likely investors.    At a time when the Clinton administration is casting its  eyes  over Latin America, it is important to bear in mind that  cooperation and security in our hemisphere also depend on the  preservation and enhancement of relations between Brazil and the  United States, which should be based on mutual trust. Brazil has  a strategic importance as it is acknowledged to be a pole that  irradiates values and ideas that have a great impact on several  parts of the world and are considered in all international  forums. We deem that democracy is the only system of government  that makes it possible to have dynamic and creative social  relations at the domestic level and that may assure the peaceful  coexistence between peoples at the international level. We deem  that respect for human rights is a universal law that is not  subject to particularities of any kind, be them cultural or  otherwise. Like the United States, Brazil believes in a  multilateral system of free trade. We contributed greatly to the  "Uruguay Round," which was recently brought to a successful  conclusion. Brazil is a global trader [preceding two words in  English]. The regional initiatives that we further in Latin  America, and which we consider so important, like the Common  Market of the South -- Mercosur, the Amazon Initiative, and the  recently proposed Free Trade Zone for South America, as well as  our possible future relations with NAFTA, ought to be seen from  this perspective. Regional integration must strengthen the  international system of trade rather than being a substitute for  it.    Within the broader framework of the international world  order  after the end of the Cold War, Brazil and the United States  share basic principles and objectives, which have given us  promising opportunities for cooperation. Our participation in  the UN Security Council is a good example of this. We are  witnessing radical changes in the international scene that even  though they bring a promise of better days, demand mature  thinking and an exchange of ideas from different perspectives,  though not necessarily conflicting ones. We should not be afraid  of dialogue, which is always synonymous with give and take, with  a mutual learning process rather than blind agreement.    Relations between Brazil and the United States have a strong  economic substratum and a long history. They are marked by great  convergence and also by some instances of disagreement. This  dichotomy proves that the possible discrepancies do not override  our affinity. We must, therefore, harmonize our ideas so as to  try to better understand each other. The talks I held during my  recent visit to Washington with Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and security adviser Anthony Lake, and my contacts  with think tanks [preceding two words in English] that study our  relations, have led me to believe that Brazil and the United  States are ready for a mature partnership. A partnership that,  by bringing the two largest democracies in the hemisphere closer  together, will be instrumental in turning those values that we  share into concrete actions that will accrue to the advantage of  both countries, and indeed the entire hemisphere.</p>

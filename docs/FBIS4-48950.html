			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial party committee held a rural work  conference in Jinan on 29 April.    In his speech, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial  party committee, urged that the people from higher levels  downward across the province should concentrate greater energy  on grasping the 1994 agricultural and rural work; focus on  increasing the supply of farm products and the income of the  peasants; stabilize grain production; ensure cotton production;  increase economic results; and ensure a stable increase in  grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, an overall increase in the  rural economy, and a big increase in the income of the peasants.    Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of the provincial government, chaired the  conference. Present at the conference were some provincial  Leaders, including Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, and Li Zhen; and  responsible comrades of the prefectural, city, and county party  committees and provincial-, city- and prefectural-level  departments concerned.    According to the opinions made by the provincial party  committee and the provincial government, Jiang Chunyun talked  about eight issues as follows.    First, stabilize the production of grain, cotton,  oil-bearing  crops, and vegetables and effectively ensure the supply for  society.    Jiang Chunyun said: The province's main agricultural  production tasks in 1994 are to stabilize the production of  grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops; to restore cotton  production; and to enrich vegetable baskets. Cotton production  is the province's most important agricultural task for this  year. The provincial party committee and the provincial  government urged that the party and government departments at  various levels should regard the planting of good and sufficient  cotton as an arduous economic task as well as a serious  political task. We should continue to carry out the system of  leaders assuming responsibility for cotton production and regard  that whether or not the localities can plant sufficient amounts  of good cotton and capture bumper cotton harvests as an  important content of assessing [words indistinct] cadres.    Second, comprehensively develop the rural economy and  increase, by a big margin, the income of the peasants.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Striving to increase the peasants  of the peasants by a big margin at the time of ensuring a stable  increase in the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing  crops is an urgent, prominent agricultural and rural work task  for this year. To this end, we should positively readjust and  optimize the rural industrial structure and the rural product  mix and increase the economic results of agriculture.    Third, ceaselessly deepen the rural reform and inject new  vitality to the development of agriculture and the rural economy.    Jiang Chunyun said: To further mobilize the peasants'  enthusiasm for production, we must make a new breakthrough in  reforming the property right system. We should strengthen the  setup of the (?land turnover) system and positively carry out  the shareholding system. Barren mountain areas, barren beaches,  wasteland, and undeveloped coastal areas can either be developed  on a contracted or leasing basis or be auctioned for  development. It is necessary to guide the broad masses of the  peasants to enter markets.    Fourth, realistically strengthen the buildup of agricultural  scientific and technological front and vigorously popularize  agricultural sciences and technologies.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: We should regard the improvement  of the peasants' scientific and educational quality as a  fundamentally great matter for rejuvenating agriculture with  science and education and comprehensively upgrade the peasants'  scientific and educational quality.    Fifth, continue to support the poor, to make development,  and  to ensure the realization of the fourth five-year plan for  supporting the poor.    Jiang Chunyun said: Recently, the province worked out the  fourth five-year plan for supporting the poor. That is, the  province should concentrate five years of time to solve the  problems relating to four million people's food and clothes.  This indicates that our province has entered the last stage of  the project for supporting the poor and making development with  the purpose of providing sufficient food and clothes for the  people.    Sixth, strengthen agriculture's role as the foundation of  the  national economy and do our best to serve agriculture.    Jiang Chunyun said: In line with their actual conditions,  all trades and professions and all departments should generally  examine their aid-agriculture work, affirm their achievements,  find out where they lag behind, study and formulate measures for  improvement, and conscientiously attend to the implementation of  the measures.    Seventh, implement overall measures and ensure the stability  of the rural areas.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Nineteen ninety-four is the key  year of reform. So, it is of peculiar importance to  safeguarding the stability of society. According to the  existing [words indistinct] as well as [words indistinct] that  will possibly crop up, the leading comrades at various levels  should persist in the policy of taking a two-hand approach and  being sure that both hands are tough and positively and actively  do their work jobs.    Eighth, strengthen the setup of the rural basic  organizations  to provide a reliable guarantee for agriculture and the rural  work.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: The prefectural and county party  committees should concentrate their main energy on the rural  work. Secretaries, majors, commissioners, and county heads of  the localities that fail to promote the production of major farm  products, such as grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, and  vegetables; and have problems in supply of these products,  should be called to account. It is necessary to persist in the  principle of seeking truth from facts, to resolutely overcome  formalism and bureaucracy, and to strictly ban exaggerations and  false reports. The grass roots should report to higher levels  both good and bad news, and [words indistinct].    Responsible persons of five prefectures and cities and two  provincial-level departments made speeches at the conference.    Before the conclusion of the conference, Zhao Zhihao,  governor of the provincial government, made a speech.    In his speech, he urged that all localities and all  departments should conscientiously implement the guidelines of  this conference and ensure there are ideology, tasks, measures,  and leadership.    In regard to the current production, Zhao Zhihao said: The  most important agricultural production task is to grasp cotton  sowing work. We should try every possible means to fulfill the  cotton sowing plan. He also reminded all localities to grasp  the management of wheat field in the later stage, to make  earlier preparations for planting, harvesting, and field  management, and to ensure a bumper summer grain harvest.</p>

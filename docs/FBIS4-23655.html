			<p>BFN     [Text] Ghana has threatened to pull out of the African  military force in Liberia unless that country's warring factions  prove they want peace immediately. Ghana's foreign minister,  Dr. Obed Asamoah who disclosed this in Tunis today, said the  peacekeeping effort was a drain in the nation's resources. Dr.  Asamoah said the renewed fighting has stopped disarmament of  some 60,000 militiamen in the country and is threatening to  delay elections which are planned for September. He said  Nigeria and Tanzania are ready to pull out their troops within  the month. Apart from Nigeria, Ghana is the second highest  contributor to the peacekeeping mission in Liberia. Liberia  will be the main topic at the OAU summit which opens in the  Tunisian capital on Monday [13 June].</p>

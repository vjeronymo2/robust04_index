			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Arts: Fortepiano pleasures - Concert Robert Levin is a scholar of distinction and a performer whose repertory stretches from the early keyboard collections to Boulez and Carter. As he proved at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Thursday, his powers as a recitalist on the fortepiano are immense. He is not a miniaturist or an antiquarian (although the physical and spiritual qualities of the instrument were captured with alert 'period' sympathy), but a musician engaged to his utmost on the matching and reconciling of instrumental sound and musical sense. A fortepiano recital in this coldly un-intimate hall is a risky business, even when a wooden shield has been supplied to enclose player and instrument, to focus the tone and line amid so much acoustical woolliness. But in his touch of the instrument Mr Levin did nothing egregious or cosmetic to achieve communication; he had no recourse to flashy, audience-wooing tricks. Rather, his accounts of Schubert (the D major Sonata, D850) and Beethoven (the 'Hammerklavier') gloried in the smaller dynamic range, the palette of unhomogenised tone-colours. He did this by paying the most precise and purposeful attention to tempo relationships, varieties of accents, fine distinctions of chord-voicing, accurate applications of legato and marcato phrasing, in ways unavailable to all but the most sensitive modern-piano performances. The exquisitely fresh, springy and above all keen-spirited character of his Schubert was a continual delight; such needle-point wit, such nimble-footed fantasy of the finale recalled Clifford Curzon's performance of the D major - than which no praise can be higher. The 'Hammerklavier' represented a challenge of a far more arduous sort, bravely and in many ways brilliantly faced. I have never heard the Allegro movements go at such a lick, nor the decorative details of the Adagio traced and developed with so lightly lyrical a command of phrase. In this of all works the late-20th-century ear is still habituated to expecting monumentality of sound; Mr Levin's reading achieved genuine rugged monumentality of spirit, which is much rarer.</p>

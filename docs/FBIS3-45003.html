			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial  party committee, delivered a speech at the provincial work  conference on politics and laws on 8 January, at which he  stated: Major tasks for 1994 are to earnestly implement the  spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, the spirit of the national work conference on  politics and laws, and the spirit of the second plenum of the  sixth provincial party committee. In line with the strategic  principle of building the two civilizations simultaneously and  scoring achievements in both of them and according to the  demands of establishing the system of a socialist marked  economy, efforts should be made to enhance the function of the  people's democratic dictatorship and to make all-out efforts to  safeguard the political stability and social peace so as to  ensure smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic  construction and to create a good social environment for  fulfilling the task of improving the province's economy to a new  level and for accelerating the pace of building Jilin into a  developed, border, and maritime province. Under the leadership  of the provincial party committee and the provincial people's  government and by bringing their functional role into full play  since the beginning of 1993, the organs in charge of politics  and laws at all levels across the province have further enhanced  and improved the work of politics and laws; defined the guiding  ideology of giving priority to stability; safeguarded the  political stability of the province as a whole; and maintained  good public security order by upholding the principle of dealing  strict blows at crime. They have upheld the principle of having  personnel who are in charge of the work be responsible for the  work and promoted the implementation of various measures adopted  for the comprehensive management of public security. They have  also concentrated their efforts on investigating and handling  appalling and major criminal cases; played an active role in  scoring periodical results in the struggle against corruption;  rendered effective services for applying legal measures to  establishing the systems of socialist market economy; and made  positive contributions to ensuring the smooth progress in  reform, opening up, and economic construction and to building  Jilin into a developed, border, and maritime province.    Wang Jinshan contended: The province's current situation in  economic development, political stability, nationalities' unity,  and social progress, is good. However, we should note that our  province still has many prominent problems affecting the  political stability and social peace. The hostile forces both  at home and abroad are colluding each other and echoing each  other at a distance. Their infiltrating and damaging activities  have become increasingly intensified. The serious criminal  cases of various categories steadily increase and unstable  factors in the society show a relative increase. Under such a  situation, the task of safeguarding the stability will become  more heavy and urgent. He urged party committees and  governments at all levels and departments in charge of politics  and laws to correctly estimate and judge the situation, to  resolutely keep a sober head, and to fully discern the important  position and role of political and legal work.    These party committees, governments, and departments in  charge of political and legal work should be prepared for danger  in times of peace; take precautions; and conduct the work of  safeguarding the political stability and social peace  satisfactorily, profoundly, carefully, and realistically.    Wang Jinshan pointed out: Safeguarding the political  stability represents the major duty of departments in charge of  political and legal work. They should enhance their struggle  against hidden dangers and resolutely deal blows at the  infiltrating and damaging activities launched by the hostile  forces both at home and abroad. They should also correctly deal  with the contradictions cropping up under the new situation  among the people, enhance the capability of handling unexpected  incidents, realistically and effectively carry out the struggle  against corruption, and apply the actual deeds and achievements  scored in the struggle against corruption to winning the  people's confidence and bringing into play the enthusiasm of the  vast number of people in safeguarding the stability of the whole  situation and in engaging in reform and construction.    In citing the comprehensive management of public security  Wang Jinshan said: We should have every locality, department,  and unit truly implement the responsibility system in conducting  their comprehensive management of public security. As for those  that fail to earnestly enforce the leadership responsibility  system in this regard and have caused a chaotic social order, we  should exercise the right of vetoing all work done by them and  impose the disciplinary sanction of the party and administration  on them. Efforts should be made to further upgrade the work  level of dealing strict blows at crime and to deal strict blows  at serious criminal activities by emphasizing the task of  cracking down on appalling cases, smashing criminal rings, and  pursuing and capturing escaped criminals. We should resolutely  eliminate and mop up evil phenomena in the society and block the  trend of the spread and development of crime. Efforts should  be made to consolidate the public security order in complicated  public places, such as railway and bus stations, ports, cultural  and recreation centers, and trade fairs; to deal with the  prominent public security problems in rural areas; and to  restore rural production and livelihood to a normal order. By  conducting consolidation in a specific field in the struggle of  dealing strict blows at crime, we should further promote the  implementation of other measures for the comprehensive  management of public security to ensure social stability.    In citing the task of vigorously rendering effective  services  for developing the socialist market economy Wang Jinshan pointed  out: It is imperative to enhance the building of socialist legal  systems and to make sure laws are enacted that can be depended  on, every law must be observed and be strictly enforced; and law  violations must be handled. Efforts should be made to gradually  establish complete legal systems suitable to the socialist  market economy and to fully apply the legal weapon to dealing  strict blows at the criminal activities that are damaging the  development of productive forces and the market economy.    According to the practical situation in the personnel's  contingent on the political and legal front, Wang Jinshan  demanded: In building the contingent of political and legal  personnel this year, we should continuously implement the  principle of conducting strict management and enhance the  education and management over the contingent of political and  legal personnel by regarding the reform as a motive force and  the campaign of opposing corruption and encouraging  administrative honesty as an emphasis so as to stabilize and  develop the achievements scored in the concentrated  consolidation, to further upgrade the contingent's quality as a  whole and fighting strength, and to provide reliable guarantees  for fulfilling the annual plan for the political and legal work  this year.    Wang Jinshan stressed in his speech: The more we deepen the  reform, broaden the opening up, develop the market economy, the  more we should enhance and improve the party's leadership over  the economic work. At present, special efforts should be made  to enhance the leadership over politics and ideology and over  principles and policies and to strengthen the organizational  leadership. Party committees at all levels should consciously  put the political and legal work on their important schedule,  fulfill their duties in dealing with the practical difficulties  cropping up in the political and legal work, and make new  contributions to building socialism with Chinese characteristics  and developing the socialist market economy.    Attending the provincial work conference on politics and  laws  held in Changchun on 8 January were Ke Muyun, vice chairman of  the provincial people's congress standing committee and vice  chairman of the provincial [words indistinct] commission; Wang  Guofa, vice governor of the province and deputy secretary of the  provincial commission on politics and laws; and comrades in  charge of political and legal work from various cities,  prefectures, and autonomous prefecture.</p>

In his letter dated March 23, Mr. Christopher notes that he  has sent messages of congratulations to Foreign Minister  Andrejevs and Foreign Minister Kozyrev on the successful  conclusion of troop withdrawal negotiations. "The United States  considers the Latvian-Russian agreement to be an important  milestone toward our mutual goal of seeing all Russian forces  withdrawn from the Baltics, including Estonia, by August 31,  1994."    Mr. Christopher further assures Mr. Luik that the United  States "will continue to urge the Russian Government to live up  to its commitment to withdraw its forces."    Strong international support for the withdrawal of ex-Soviet  forces from the Baltics played an important role in Russia's  decision to continue Estonian-Russian talks April 5-6 in Moscow  and to abide by the agreed-upon date for withdrawal. Yesterday,  in Riga, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, Latvia and  Lithuania called upon "the international community to continue  its vigilance that this date will be observed."</p>

Elias] </F>   [Text] Mmabatho March 10 SAPA -- A REUTERS television crew,  which has covered wars around the world, was severely beaten by  Bophuthatswana police on Thursday [10 March] and said it was  pulling out of the area immediately.    Mark Chisholm, Paul Arubicek and Frank Kgolane were stopped  by Bophuthatswana police near Mafikeng, hauled out of their car  and beaten with batons, sjamboks [whips] and fists. "They  pulled us out of our car, tore off our bullet-proof vests, beat  us up, chucked our equipment about and told us to leave," Mr  Arubicek told SAPA minutes after the incident on Thursday  morning.    The police had blamed them for littering the streets with  stones, and their kevlar vests were no protection against the  savage beating. On their return to the Mmabatho Sun Hotel  television crews filmed the weals on their backs from the  sjamboks and batons.    Mr Arubicek's T-shirt had been ripped to shreds and Mr  Kgolane's T-shirt was full of the blood which sprayed from his  nose during the beating.    The international television news team has covered hot spots  as intense as the Gulf, Sarajevo and Beirut. "When the police  start turning against the press reporting the crisis there is no  point in hanging around. We are pulling out immediately," Mr  Chisholm said.    Another television crew, from the international agency WTN  [World Television News], was also beaten by police in Mafikeng.    Journalists on the streets to report on the almost total  stayaway by workers in Bophuthatswana are leaving hotel grounds  with kevlar protection, many with luminous flashes identifying  them as press or with the name of the agency they are working  for.    The information service of Bophuthatswana claimed it had no  knowledge of either incident.    An SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] staff  member working in Bophuthatswana, Phineas Diphopo, was severely  beaten on Thursday and warned he would be shot if the  Bophuthatswana police saw him on the roads again. He was  stopped by police on the Mmabatho airport road which had been  blocked by youths using stones and burning tyres. The police  had their own roadblock on the Mmabatho side of the barricade.    "The police pulled me out of the car, assaulted me with  their  fists and their feet. They also hit me with a sjambok," he  said. The car was searched during and after the assault. "When  I left, they threatened to shoot me if they saw me on the roads  again."    Mr Diphopo told SAPA that at the scene of the burning of the  house of security policeman David Morobi, police were heard to  say they would "start taking an eye for an eye".    Mr Diphopo was was beaten on Wednesday night on the same  road, but by the youths who had erected the barricade.</p>

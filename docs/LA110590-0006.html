			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL MASS TRANSIT PLANS  </P> <P> It was refreshing to read Fulton's opinion regarding the construction of  commuter rail transit in the Los Angeles region. I have been in enough cities  to have learned that mass transit only works in dense, urban areas.  </P> <P> It is not necessary to be a transit expert to figure that out.  </P> <P> None of the transit lines proposed for Los Angeles will provide service to the  urban Westside. This is an area where there are major, regional destinations --  UCLA, Westwood, Century City, the beaches, Beverly Hills, Mid-Wilshire.  </P> <P> If a line is built west of downtown, it will follow a low-density path from  Santa Monica to USC. It is hard to imagine that route being a highly traveled  one.  </P> <P> It would sure be nice if someone would slow down and do some thinking before we  end up with a multibillion-dollar rail system that serves almost no one.  </P> <P> JOHN THOMPSEN, West Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The 35th anniversary of the promulgation of the  first Agrarian Reform Law in La Plata, Sierra Maestra, which for  the first time in Cuban history gave the land to the people who  worked it, is a time to reminisce and render homage.    Three veterans of the revolutionary struggle with ties to  the  agrarian sector -- Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, Jose Ramirez Cruz,  and Conchita Fernandez -- today will receive the 17 May Order,  the National Association of Small Farmers' [ANAP] top award,  which is bestowed by the Council of State at the request of  ANAP. The fact that to date only Commander in Chief Fidel Castro  had received this order gives the presentation even greater  importance, falling as it does on Peasants Day and the  anniversary of the Agrarian Reform Law, especially since it is  going to be presented during the closing session of the  cooperative-peasant-scientific-technical meeting which began on  16 May at the Olo Pantojas Communist Party of Cuba School in  Havana. On this occasion, 10 cooperative workers and farmers  will receive the Romarico Cordero medal and the Antero Regalado  award.</p>

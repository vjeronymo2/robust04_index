			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Loss of Pounds 586,000 at Sims Food SIMS FOOD GROUP, the meat processor and supplier, fell into the red in the year to March 31 after an exceptional provision of Pounds 6.59m. A warning of the loss had been given a month ago. From pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.84m restated for FRS 3, the group fell to losses of Pounds 586,000. The exceptional charge covered the writing-off of under-utilised equipment for storing meat under pressure, the clearing of the non-core Country Feast and J Redmond, and the restructuring and reduction of the catering and retail divisions to reflect more accurately lower demand. Turnover rose 24 per cent to Pounds 312.7m (Pounds 251.4m). Stripping out the effect of acquisitions, underlying organic growth was 9 per cent. Mr David Brady, finance director, said this was encouraging, given static meat prices over the year. He added however that margins had been badly eroded. Part of the problem was that Sims had incurred EC-driven capital expenditure more quickly than turned out to be necessary because a three-year period of grace had been granted. Further, the devaluation of sterling and the alignment of 'green rates of currency' more directly with market rates led eventually to shortage-driven price rises, only part of which the supermarkets helped absorb. Earnings per share last time of 15.9p were turned into losses of 5p. However, again as forewarned in June, the final dividend is reduced to 4.5p (8.25p), resulting in a total of 7.5p (11.25p) for the year.</p>

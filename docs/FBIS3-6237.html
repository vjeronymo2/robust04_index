"With the question of politicians and money drawing  attention, Mr. Hosokawa has not told the truth of whether he was  given the money or borrowed it, leaving the matter unresolved,"  Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) said Sunday [13 March].    Mori, in a move to throw down the gauntlet to the governing  coalition, warned that his party will refuse to begin a session  of the House of Representatives Budget Committee to discuss the  national budget for fiscal 1994, starting April 1, until the  premier proves his innocence.    Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the 100 million yen from  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a now-defunct parcel delivery company,  in 1982 and repaid the money nine years later. But the LDP,  toppled from power last summer for the first time in nearly four  decades, has retorted it is unclear how the premier used the  money and how he returned it to the creditor.    Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, which has since been absorbed into  Sagawa Kyubin Co., a Kyoto-based parent company, was embroiled  in a massive money-and-mob scandal in 1992 and 1993 that  implicated former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and disgraced  LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru.    One element compounding the matter is Hosokawa's  inconsistent  and less-than persuasive explanations about his receipt and  repayment of the money. This has caused the LDP to suspect that  it was not a loan that the premier obtained, but an illicit  donation.    Last December, Hosokawa said in a memo to the Diet that he  borrowed the 100 million yen from Kiyoshi Sagawa, former  chairman of Sagawa Kyubin, through Tokyo Sagawa in September  1982 to buy a condominium in Tokyo and repair his home in  Kumamoto Prefecture, southwestern Japan.    He also explained he paid back the money by January 31,  1991,  using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor, in  addition to using the proceeds from the sale of a plot of land  in Tokyo.    But the LDP has pointed out that Hosokawa could not have  received the retirement allowance before he finished his second  four-year term as governor in February 1991, raising doubts  about the premier's accounts.    With the memo also showing that Hosokawa purchased the Tokyo  condominium in July 1982, two months before he borrowed the  money from Sagawa, the LDP and the Japanese Communist Party  (JCP) have charged that the premier used the money to secure his  campaign funds for a Kumamoto gubernatorial election one year  later.    Furthermore, Hosokawa's failure to submit to the Diet all  the  receipts he must have accepted from Sagawa if he really repaid  the money sparked a barrage of criticism from the opposition  camp that the premier took the money as an illegal political  donation, not as what he insists was a loan.    Dissatisfied with Hosokawa's explanations, the LDP and the  JCP successfully forced the lower house budget panel, in an  unusual move, to ask the government to submit to the Diet  detailed documents concerning Hosokawa's payment of the Sagawa  money.    Although the government presented some documents relating to  the loan last Friday, the two parties laughed them off and  refused to set a timetable for Diet discussion on the key budget  unless the government submits further detailed documents.    "If Mr. Hosokawa can have the public understand he really  paid back the money, we believe we do not have to question him  any further and discuss this matter any longer," Sadatoshi  Ozato, chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee, said Monday.    "But he has only widened doubts regarding the question of  how  specifically he returned it," Ozato said, adding that the party  will leave the matter of setting a schedule of budget discussion  up to a group of directors of the lower house budget panel for a  little longer.    The government and the ruling coalition aim to have the  fiscal 1994 national budget passed through the Diet by mid-May  and minimize the effects of the delayed Diet deliberations on  the ailing Japanese economy.    As Hosokawa postponed the formulation of the budget from the  end of last year till early this year to concentrate on Diet  deliberations on his cherished political reform, the start of  budget debate has been delayed until mid-March or later for the  first time since 1967.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UPGRADE AIRPORT  </P> <P> San Diego has become a world center for the biotechnology industry. In the 12  years since I co-founded Hybritech, more than 70 companies have started here.  </P> <P> The biotechnology industry is one that is built on strategic alliances with  other U.S., European and Japanese companies. This requires our partners to  visit us and us to visit them. In order for us to compete, we must have  efficient air service. San Diego does not have a first-class airport, nor  first-class air service. To get to any major city on the East Coast, Japan or  Europe, one must always go through connections. This uses valuable time, and  time is money.  </P> <P> The United States is currently the leader in biotechnology, and if we are to  stay that way and establish San Diego as a global industry center, we must make  the decision today to upgrade our airport and air service. If we don't, this  industry, which employs thousands of people and generates an ever-increasing  tax base, will not be able to continue in this city and county.  </P> <P> The decision-makers in this community must form a business plan to improve our  air service and meet the travel demands of their constituents -- now. In a few  years it will be too late.  </P> <P> HOWARD C. BIRNDORF  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

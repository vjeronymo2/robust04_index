			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Technology: Plastics get tough Construction costs could be reduced by hundreds of millions of pounds through the use of a new generation of plastic-based composite materials which are as strong as steel and concrete but much lighter and easier to handle. A group of UK companies, led by engineering consultants Mouchel, are combining to study the practicality of using polymers reinforced with carbon and glass fibre to strengthen bridges. They claim it would be possible to save Pounds 130m by using carbon fibre polymers instead of steel to strengthen 1,000 out of the estimated 10,800 British bridges that will require reinforcing to meet European Union 40-tonne weight restrictions. The three-year study, costing Pounds 1m, has attracted Pounds 425,000 of government finance under the Link Programme which supports collaborative research between industry and universities. Mouchel is providing 60 per cent of the private-sector contribution with GEC, the big British engineering group, providing a further Pounds 100,000. If the project develops a practical technology, it could promote export orders as well as rebuilding an important part of the country's infrastructure. The companies, which will be working with Surrey and Oxford Brookes universities, will be seeking to build on work by Urs Meier of the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research who demonstrated in the mid-1980s that it was possible to double the strength of a 150mm concrete beam by adding a 0.3mm carbon fibre reinforced polymer strip. A subsequent study by Brookes University showed that a 2.3-metre concrete span with a depth of 150mm could increase its carrying capacity by 230 per cent with addition of a 0.8mm reinforced polymer strip.</p>

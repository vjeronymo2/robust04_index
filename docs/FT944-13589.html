			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Cuba reforms extend to consumer goods Cuba's hard-pressed consumers, still digesting the novelty of farm produce markets opened on October 1, received a further dose of free market economic reform yesterday when the government authorised a similar system to sell scarce manufactured and consumer goods. Individuals and local state industries will now be able to sell goods directly to the public with traders, not the state, setting prices. A government decree said the goods would be offered through a network of shops, street markets and other authorised public vending points. 'People will be able to sell absolutely everything,' a commentator on state-run Radio Rebelde said. He gave as examples furniture, mattresses, household articles such as brooms and window blinds, spare plumbing parts and clothes. As with the farm markets, vendors will have to pay a tax on sales. The markets selling manufactured and consumer goods - which, like the farm markets, will operate in Cuban pesos - indicate a further easing of the state's grip on economic production. They will also create more opportunities for self-employed private manufacturers and crafts people. These were authorised to operate on a limited scale late last year and had started selling their wares at a small number of street market sites, which are expected rapidly to increase in number. Chronic shortages of even the most basic consumer articles have been a headache for Cubans for years. Problems worsened after 1990 when local manufacturing was hit by the collapse of Cuba's preferential trade relations with the former Soviet bloc. The continuing US trade and financial embargo applied an additional squeeze. Cubans turned to the black market, where an army of clandestine seamstresses, tailors, plumbers and mechanics sprung up. The farm produce markets have been well received by Cubans. Not only have shoppers been able to stock up with food staples, but prices are well below those in the black market. Authorities say the farm markets are easing food shortages and have dealt a blow to the black market. But they add it will be six months or more before they will be able to assess whether the markets have stimulated food production, particularly by small farmers.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (4): Ambitious targets to meet - Obstacles could dampen investors' enthusiasm Where the Americans once fought, they are now preparing to manufacture toilets. American Standard, the sanitary ware maker, recently held a party at Ho Chi Minh City's Unification Palace to announce plans to invest Dollars 17m in a factory in Vietnam. Similar parties are held each week by new investors, and the Americans (who were banned by the US embargo until February this year) are only the latest arrivals. The biggest investors are Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea; Daewoo of South Korea is investing more than Dollars 300m to make products ranging from pesticides to electronic components. Since Vietnam enacted a foreign investment law six years ago as the centrepiece of its economic reform programme, foreign companies have promised about Dollars 10bn of export-oriented and import substitution projects. They will transform the economy and help Vietnam to emulate fast-growing, export-driven south-east Asian economies such as Thailand and Indonesia. Commodities, such as crude oil and rice, still account for most of Vietnam's exports, but processed foods, garments, televisions and other goods manufactured in Vietnam will play an more important role in the economy as foreign investment projects come on stream. American Standard, for instance, says its joint venture in Song Be province will save Vietnam Dollars 10m of foreign exchange in its first year of operation alone by replacing imported toilets, basins and baths with locally-made wares. Eventually the factory may export products too. For all its success in attracting foreign investors, Vietnam may find it hard to meet its own ambitious targets. Of the Dollars 45-Dollars 50bn in capital Vietnam wants in the current decade to increase the income of its inhabitants, about Dollars 20bn is expected to come from foreign direct investment; but out of the Dollars 10bn promised so far, only about Dollars 3.5bn will have been spent by the end of this year. Although foreign investors will complete more of their promised projects and make new commitments in the years ahead to take advantage of Vietnam's market of 72m people and the opportunities for export, they still face numerous difficulties that could dampen their enthusiasm. The initial approval process for foreign investment is slow and bureaucratic, involving the State Committee for Co-operation and Investment (SCCI) and various ministries and local authorities. And once a project is approved, investors find that the laws and regulations governing their business are vague or non-existent and arbitrarily enforced. Physical infrastructure is inadequate - ports are congested and ill-equipped, for example - and the skills and raw materials required may be hard to find locally. Construction is a case in point. Investors keen to profit from the shortage of hotels, housing and office space often find themselves saddled with delays and budget overruns. Even materials which are locally available - marble, for instance - are sometimes of low quality because the equipment used to manufacture the product is old and worn. There is no clear process for approving building projects, investors say. The proposed Construction Law is in its 14th draft and has yet to be passed by the National Assembly, which meets for about a fortnight twice a year. When it is passed, subordinate regulations will have to be written by the relevant ministry. A barrage of complaints from investors has made the Vietnamese government aware of the obstacles to foreign investment and it has plans to simplify licensing procedures for new projects. 'Any investors coming to Vietnam face some major difficulties,' admits Bui Huy Hung of the SCCI in Hanoi. 'Our policy is to set up a one-stop shop system, but we cannot fulfil it in one day.' By the end of the year, the government is expected to announce a new package of investment promotion measures. Feasibility studies will probably no longer be required for smaller projects and the time taken by the authorities to evaluate and license them should be reduced to less than six weeks from three months or more at present. In line with World Bank recommendations, the central government is expected to devolve decision-making power to local authorities for some matters affecting new projects such as land pricing, although the central government will attempt to retain overall control. Mr Hung, who recently visited China, said the decentralisation he saw there was less viable in a smaller country such as Vietnam. 'Even in China they face a big problem with decentralisation,' he said. 'Each province issues another incentive. They forget the national way . . . each province issues a car assembly licence - it's a crazy situation.' Foreign companies have hitherto concentrated their efforts on investments offering a quick financial return in foreign exchange, such as hotels and light industry. In an attempt to lure money into infrastructure projects with longer payback periods, Vietnam this year announced special incentives for 'build-operate-transfer' (BOT) projects. The SCCI says Vietnam guarantees that BOT investors in such sectors as electricity generation and water supply can convert their dong profits into hard currency. In addition, BOT investors are allowed to mortgage their long-term land-use rights as security for loans from foreign banks. Vietnam has also started granting licences for the establishment of what it calls 'concentrated industrial zones' (CIZs) - the first should go to Nomura of Japan for an industrial estate in Haiphong - to complement the six export processing zones (EPZs) already approved. Factories in EPZs must export 100 per cent of their production, but CIZ factories will be permitted to sell some of their output to the domestic market.  -----------------------------------------------------               TOP 10 INVESTORS SINCE 1988  -----------------------------------------------------                                      Projects                                   in operation Country                     Total capital: dollars m  ----------------------------------------------------- 1.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vlastimil Stana: "As of April, Things Will Be </F> Different"]    [Text] The amendment of the law that has to do with  pay and emoluments for readiness to work in budgetary and some  other organizations will specifically change the Army's internal  implementing pay regulations.    The adopted amendment of the law is a reaction to experience  gained in applying the law particularly in terms of making some  provisions more specific because their language was subject to  varying interpretations and their application in practical terms  was connected with certain problems (for example, remuneration  for overtime work and holiday work). At the same time, the  amendment contains provisions allowing for the modification,  through generally binding regulations, of the procedure to be  adopted in regulating the amount of resources to be set aside  for pay and emoluments in return for the readiness to work.  <H5>  What Will Follow? </H5>   The effective date of Law No. 143 is set for 1 April 1994.  It  is the basis for the creation of additional decisive documents,  including government regulations and subsequently adopted  internal pay regulations in the Defense Department. At the  present time, finance components in the Ministry of Defense have  processed the results of the markup proceedings to which the  proposal for the government regulation was subjected. Any  incidental changes will be processed by the Ministry of Labor  and Social Affairs into the final text of the government  regulation, which the government will approve in March. This  document, stemming from the amendment to Law No. 143, will be  the starting point for the adoption of new pay regulations in  the Army. Among other things, these will include new tariff  groups (pay categories). At the same time, a solution is found  for the so-called overcoming of the transition period in April.  <H5>  Innovations Pertaining to Extra Pay for Leadership </H5>   Increases in the rates of extra pay for leadership are based  on the desire to maintain the desirable relationship with  respect to pay categories, the levels of which were raised  during the previous era. This led to a narrowing of the relative  differences in pay for rank-and-file and leading employees. What  is essentially involved here is a better reward for leadership.  Therefore, the employer must take into account, within the  framework of better pay for leadership, any possible overtime  work performed by the leading worker. A new provision also sets  better pay for leadership in the case of employees who are not  charged with being leaders but who are authorized to direct the  work of other employees. This rewards the demanding nature of  this kind of work, even at the lowest levels.    The amendment to the law also contains details of the span.  If we disregard the leading employees of central organs of the  state administration (for example, the minister and his  deputies, department directors, etc.), the span is as follows: A  leader who directs the work of subordinates (for example, unit  commanders)--500-3,000 korunas [Kc]; a leading employee who  directs several formations of an organization--Kc1,000-6,000; a  deputy of a statutory organ--Kc2,000-9,000; a statutory  organ--Kc3,000-13,000. An employee who is not a leader but who,  according to the organizational chart, is authorized to  organize, direct, and control the work of others is entitled to  extra pay for leadership, depending on the demanding nature of  such work, within the range of Kc330-1,500. The amount of extra  pay for the employee is determined by the employer or by the  individual who appointed the employee to his position or who  assigned him to that position.  <H5>  Overtime and Compensatory Leave </H5>   Even this institution has been completely redefined. For an  hour of overtime work, the employee is entitled to the portion  of his monthly pay reflecting an hour of work, excluding  overtime work, within the calendar month. The reward for  overtime work takes the form of extra pay. The basis for  computing this pay continues to be the average earning of the  individual.</p>

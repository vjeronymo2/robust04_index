			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Book Review: Right man at the right time AMERICAN ECONOMIC POLICY IN THE 1980s Edited by Martin Feldstein University of Chicago Press Dollars 75, 823 pages Do exceptional individuals make history or are they the blind instruments of deeper structural changes? In the case of economic policy in the 1980s, the personal ideologies of leaders such as Ronald Reagan now seem less important than pundits once thought. This, at any rate, is the drift of Professor Martin Feldstein's argument in this cool appraisal of a still controversial decade. Reagan's push for sharply lower tax rates, deregulation and smaller government (except defence) aroused intense opposition, especially among left-wing Democrats. Yet Feldstein argues convincingly that such reforms were a logical - probably inevitable - reaction to changed circumstances. He points out that the postwar Keynesian policies attacked by Reagan had become anachronistic. They were an emergency response to frighteningly high levels of unemployment and unused capacity in the Great Depression. The magnitude of this crisis prompted economists to drop their usual emphasis on incentives and efficiency and stress instead the importance of demand management and government intervention. Yet since demand deficiency was never a serious problem after 1945, at some point a renewed focus on economic incentives and entrepreneurship was all but inevitable. Within the economics profession, the shift began in the 1970s as economists such as Feldstein began to emphasise the adverse effects of high marginal tax rates and generous government transfer programmes. Meanwhile, the pernicious interplay of high inflation and an unindexed tax system destroyed returns on many forms of saving and investment, fuelling popular demands for reform. The claim that something akin to Reaganomics was inevitable gains plausibility if you recall that market-friendly reforms were adopted (to a greater or lesser degree) in nearly all industrial countries in the 1980s, including nominally socialist regimes. And although enthusiasm for free markets has waned somewhat since, there has been little backsliding - nobody seems to want the penal income tax rates of the 1970s. In Feldstein's view, Reagan was smarter than generally recognised. He handled meetings adroitly and managed to 'convey a clear sense of policy direction without limiting his future flexibility'. Unlike George Bush, he avoided theatrical 'read my lips' type commitments on future policy. He sincerely believed in low taxes and smaller government, but was not an extreme supply-sider: in private conversation he showed few signs of believing that income tax cuts would boost growth sufficiently to be self-financing. Feldstein has little doubt that Reagan was a net plus for the US economy. In the approach to the 1982 congressional elections, with the jobless rate above 10 per cent, Reagan staunchly supported the Federal Reserve's tight monetary squeeze, thus ensuring that double-digit inflation would be tamed. He improved incentives by reducing tax rates at all income levels, by indexing allowances for inflation and by eliminating many loopholes; the top rate fell from 70 per cent to 28 per cent, before rising under Bush. Although he failed to cut overall public expenditure, he did reduce domestic discretionary spending from 7.9 per cent of gross domestic product in 1980 to 6.1 per cent a decade later, no mean achievement given Democratic strength in Congress. There were setbacks. Despite an aversion to high taxes, Reagan signed a tax bill in 1986 that raised the capital gains tax by 40 per cent. He agreed a big increase in social security contributions, thus securing the long-term future of a public pension scheme that he once hoped to privatise. The biggest irony, of course, was that Reagan, a politician ostensibly committed to balanced budgets, presided over record federal deficits. Feldstein does not minimise the damage they did by depressing the US savings rate. But he does argue, plausibly, that having created deficits, other much-criticised aspects of policy then made sense. Thus the trade deficit enabled the US to borrow from abroad and sustain a much higher rate of investment than would otherwise have been possible. The dollar's volatility, meanwhile, was the only practical way of resolving the inconsistency between monetary and fiscal policy. There is one defence of deficits that Feldstein might have emphasised. This is that they acted as a crude brake on public spending. Had Republican presidents raised taxes to keep pace with the spending demands of congressional Democrats, expenditure would have spiralled upwards even faster. And if Bill Clinton had inherited a balanced budget, you can be certain that the US would today be embarked on a far more ambitious programme of public investment. Feldstein and other contributors leaven their analysis with vivid personal recollections, making this a surprisingly readable as well as scholarly volume. Topics covered include monetary, budget, tax, trade and regulatory policy. Yet there is one striking omission. Feldstein finds room for a chapter on health and safety regulation, yet unaccountably ignores the US labour market. There is little discussion of the Republican success in creating some 20m jobs or of its controversial policy changes, such as the phasing out of many public training programmes. And the book is silent on what has become the principal criticism of Reaganomics - the fact that stagnant or declining real wages for many workers led to greater inequality of income and wealth. Yet it was this shift that created the sour public mood of the early 1990s - a mood that enabled the Democrats to regain control of the White House.</p>

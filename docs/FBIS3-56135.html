			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Feature under the "Events of the Day" rubric containing </F> comments by U.S. Officials on President Clinton's Visit to  Moscow under the general heading "Americans Talking About  Russia: U.S. President Bill Clinton's Four-Day State Visit to  Moscow Begins Today. In Connection with This Event We Are  Publishing Comments on Russia by Well-Known American Political  and Public Figures"]    [Text] U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen:    Difficulties in the course of the reforms are no reason to  slow them down.    The fact that the Russian population is encountering serious  difficulties in the transition to the market economy is not  unexpected. However, this is happening not because the reforms  are moving too quickly but because they are developing too  slowly. That opinion was expressed by U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen at a meeting with a group of journalists organized  by USA TODAY.    The United States maintains relations with Russia at many  levels, L. Bentsen said. We are discussing not only nuclear or  military questions. We are also concerned about bilateral  economic relations. And we are trying to help Russia make the  transition to the market economy easier. One of the most  difficult tasks during such a transformation is to reduce  inflation, the high level of which in Russia is partly due to  the continuation of subsidies to some state enterprises on which  the whole social structure in some regions depends. They are  continuing to produce goods which are not wanted and whose  production is not in the interests of consumers. The progress  in this sphere is quite slow.    Nevertheless, Russia has managed to reduce inflation  somewhat. It has made "astonishing progress" in the  privatization of small enterprises, too. "In this sphere the  situation is heartening," L. Bentsen noted. The United States  is interested in creating more favorable conditions for U.S.  business investments in Russia. One such sphere is the oil  industry. The participation of U.S. companies in its  modernization could give Russia a speedy benefit in the form of  hard currency.    The treasury secretary stressed that Russia should work more  quickly to elaborate clear rules for the conclusion of contracts  with foreign companies. Then American firms would have greater  confidence in the legality of their investments and a clear idea  what they can expect when contracts are being concluded. "Some  progress has already been made in this regard. But even more  remains to be made," L. Bentsen stressed.    Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on what  he expects from the discussion of economic problems during the  U.S.-Russian summit meeting in Moscow, the treasury secretary  said: "I believe that the U.S. Administration will insist on  further progress in relations between international financial  institutions and the Russian Government." Efforts must be made  by both sides, L. Bentsen remarked. They must establish closer  contact and discuss Russia's observance of the terms for  granting loans. The United States is also urging the World Bank  to take measures to help Russia to resolve its social problems  connected with the dismissal of workers in major industrial  sectors.    The World Bank can grant loans to help rectify the  situation.  I hope that the bank will study these opportunities together  with the Russian Government, the U.S. treasury secretary said.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Labour irked by Panorama delay Labour yesterday accused the BBC of delaying the transmission of an investigative programme on Conservative-controlled Westminster city council to curry favour with the government. The Panorama programme, which expands on corruption allegations made in a recent district auditor's report, was originally scheduled to be broadcast tonight. It has been postponed until after the local elections on May 5 allegedly after protests from Conservative Central Office. In a letter to Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, Labour linked the delay in transmission to anxiety among BBC managers about a government review of its charter, expected to finish shortly. 'If this delay is not to be interpreted as buying the BBC's acquiescence in coverage of the local and Euro elections, then the BBC should show the Panorama programme immediately,' it said. The BBC yesterday issued a denial that the programme had been suppressed by senior management. It said it was 'completely untrue' that the documentary had been scheduled to be broadcast tonight. It said April 25 had been one of the possible transmission dates but the programme had run into legal difficulties and senior news and current affairs management had decided it could not be shown until those had been sorted out. Mr Birt had not been involved in the decision, the BBC said. The programme is believed to allege that Pounds 50m of public money was diverted into helping the Conservatives win the May 1990 local elections in Westminster. This is more than twice the figure quoted by the district auditor in his interim report on the council's alleged policy of selling council homes for votes. But Mr Neale Coleman, former deputy leader of the Labour group in Westminster, said the BBC's position was 'not tenable'. The corporation had been making the programme for three months and had had plenty of time to sort out any legal problems. Its stance might be more understandable if it had been advised that the programme could not be shown at all, he said. But to say legal problems had arisen which could not be resolved in time was 'simply not credible'. Privately, the BBC is said to be angered that the programme is being used as a political football, with the Tories wanting it postponed and Labour pushing for it to be broadcast before the elections.</p>

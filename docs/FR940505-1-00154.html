			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For this proposal the overall reduction targets are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed as a range of percentages; EPA anticipates establishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a specific percentage reduction target in the final rule. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on whether these stationary source emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction targets are appropriate for use with the military air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base control strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A military air base can utilize any of a variety of emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction options, at the discretion of the Department of Defense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the base commander, to meet the annual emissions target. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, reductions in ground equipment could be obtained through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSE electrification and restrictions on ground traffic within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base boundaries. If the final rule does include emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> military aircraft, a base commander may choose to restrict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft taxi procedures, perhaps by mandating specific direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routes to and from runways, or by towing aircraft into takeoff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position; certain training procedures could be altered to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize the frequency of high-emission operating modes within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basin mixing zone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Geographic Scope. The control program for military air bases will cover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three FIP areas: South Coast, Ventura, and Sacramento Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Basins. The Agency requests comments on the need to control air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base emissions in each area based on air quality effects or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equity considerations. In particular, EPA requests comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempting emissions from on or near San Clemente Island from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP control strategy, if aircraft are ultimately included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Control Period. EPA proposes to control military air base emissions only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the ozone season in each FIP area. Further, EPA proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require compliance with the program based on the season-long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average of emissions. As already described, such operations may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be highly variable. Although this variability tends to argue for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a shorter compliance (e.g., a monthly period as in the stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cap program), the longer period seems preferable to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> military commanders with the flexibility to conduct operations as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. EPA requests comment on the desirability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seasonal compliance demonstration versus shorter periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Key Regulatory Elements. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Summary. EPA proposes to specify in the final FIP a linear declining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cap on total mobile source emissions from military air bases in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each FIP area, excluding emissions from aircraft themselves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This declining cap will be designed to achieve the emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction targets for each area as described under ``Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Strategy.'' Military air bases will submit a baseline emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report and annual compliance determination reports similar to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those required for commercial airlines as discussed previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Military air bases are defined for the purpose of this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as facilities owned and operated by the Department of Defense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a primary mission of aircraft operation. The Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Defense also will be responsible for submitting baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions reports and annual compliance reports for military  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations that occur at civilian facilities in the control area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Baseline Inventory and Emission Caps. EPA currently does not have sufficient data for all subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission sources included in the proposed military air base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control program to establish a reasonable baseline inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA, therefore, will require each military air base in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control area to calculate and report total subject emissions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the baseline year of 1990 within 180 days following finalization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this rule. Information to be included in the baseline report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is described in ``Reporting and Recordkeeping'' below. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> military bubble will be the sum of emission inventories from all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air bases in the basin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on the desirability of using an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative baseline scheme, given the variability introduced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations related to Desert Shield/Desert Storm during 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One alternative could be to require air bases to submit data for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989 and 1990 so that a two-year average inventory can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated. The DOD working group recommended that installations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the option of identifying the baseline year, between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years 1989 and 1992, which resulted in the most representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total emissions. The DOD working group also requested a one time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment of the baseline inventory be allowed, based on actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory data, once the FIP requirements are in effect. The one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time adjustment could help eliminate errors based on assumptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and estimates used in developing the baseline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

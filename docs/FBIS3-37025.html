			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev--Asked by journalists on 10 February to comment  on Ukraine's stance on the prospect of bombing Bosnian Serbs,  the aggressors in the former Yugoslavia, Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk said, in particular, that the joint Russian and  Ukrainian position on this issue--that these countries spoke  against this action--should not be a surprise. Kravchuk said he  was convinced that Ukraine and Russia would also share common  views on issues relating to peace and security in the future.  While the Russian stance categorically objects, however, to the  possibility of bombing, Kravchuk noted: "This step should be  taken if there are no other ways to stop the insanity, but this  must be settled by the world community--through the United  Nations or the CSCE--rather than by one state".    On 11 February, Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Anatoliy  Zlenko telephoned the head of the Russia Foreign Ministry  regarding the initiative. They discussed the issue of  Russian-Ukrainian relations and the development of the  international situation. They examined the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, in particular, in the light of the latest  NATO Council's decisions. Both sides expressed the opinion that  the settlement of the situation should take place through  stepping up political efforts-- primarily within the framework  of the UN Security Council--rather than through escalating  combat actions.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COELHO TO RESIGN IN FACE OF PROBE; PARTY IN 'DISARRAY'  </P> <P> House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of Merced, facing a preliminary criminal  investigation by the Justice Department and calls for an Ethics Committee  inquiry into his financial dealings, has decided to resign from Congress next  month, a close congressional associate said Friday night.  </P> <P> Coelho's decision, coming on the heels of an apparent decision by House Speaker  Jim Wright (D-Tex.) to give up his post and leave Congress in the face of  similar ethics problems, stunned colleagues in both parties and threw the  question of Democratic leadership in the House into confusion.  </P> <P> "I've never seen our party in such disarray as it is now," said a Democratic  member who declined to be identified. "This is scary. There's going to be a  panic."  </P> <P> Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) said he was "absolutely stunned" by  Coelho's decision to quit. "It's a shame," Matsui said. "He's a hard charger.  He raised more money for the party than Democrats could imagine. Tony was the  oil that kept the engine moving, from a political perspective."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gingrich Stunned  </P> <P> Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who has led the crusade against what he claims is  pervasive corruption in the Democratic Party, said he was also stunned by the  news of Coelho's quitting. "But I think the fact that the No. 1 and No. 3  Democrats apparently will both leave in June says something about 35 years of  monopoly power," Gingrich said, referring to the fact that Democrats have  controlled the House of Representatives since 1953-54, the last time the GOP  had a majority.  </P> <P> Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), a friend of Coelho's and a member of the House  Ethics Committee, said the Merced congressman telephoned him Friday night to  say he was resigning. Fazio said Coelho apparently acted to spare his party,  his family and himself the ordeal of a protracted public inquiry into his  activities.  </P> <P> "He did not want to put himself and the party through that. He's confident he's  not in any legal trouble," Fazio said, "but he doesn't want to put the party or  his family through that. He's worked 10 years to create a better party, and he  didn't want to give the Republicans that kind of target."  </P> <P> "I feel very sad," Fazio said. "I'm going to miss him. He'll leave a vacuum in  our delegation and in our Caucus in the House."  </P> <P> He said Coelho did not discuss what he intended to do next.  </P> <P> Coelho's problems began several weeks ago when he acknowledged that he bought a  $100,000 junk bond underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with the help of  a $50,000 loan from Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. arranged by its chief,  Thomas Spiegel -- a loan the congressman failed to disclose as required by law.  Coelho and Mayor Tom Bradley, also the subject of a preliminary investigation  by the Justice Department, were later involved in a lobbying effort on behalf  of Drexel.  </P> <P> One of Coelho's congressional colleagues said the Democratic leader was  concerned that his financial affairs were being aired more frequently on  national television news programs and he feared the effect this might have on  his two teen-age daughters.  </P> <P> Coelho himself was in seclusion late Friday night at his home, a large brick  house on more than an acre of land in suburban Annandale, Va. The house was  guarded by two Capitol police officers in plain clothes who threatened to have  reporters arrested when they tried to contact the congressman.  </P> <P> Earlier Friday evening, Coelho had attended a high school class play in which  one of his two daughters had taken part.  </P> <P> House Democratic Leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said that Coelho's decision  came as a "shock and surprise" to him when he learned of it.  </P> <P> "I think it's a great loss for the House, and it's a very great disappointment  to me personally," he said in a telephone interview from Spokane. "Tony's been  one of the most creative and able persons who has ever been in the leadership  so he won't be easy to follow."  </P> <P> But Foley said there are Democrats who have already expressed interest in a top  Democratic post who could handle the assignment.  </P> <P> The No. 2 Democrat in the House and heir-apparent to the Speaker said he would  return to Washington on Sunday night, a day earlier than scheduled, to consider  the next step.  </P> <P> Coelho, who sought to have the news of his decision announced exclusively in  the New York Times, was quoted as saying he would leave Congress on June 15,  his 47th birthday.  </P> <P> In connection with Coelho's purchase of the junk bond, his lawyer later  acknowledged that the congressman had taken advantage of a tax break to which  he was not entitled when he sold the bond at a profit and probably owes the  Internal Revenue Service at least a few hundred dollars in unreported back  taxes on the transaction.  </P> <P> Coelho, who earned a $6,882 profit on the junk bond transaction in 1986, later  arranged a meeting for a Columbia lobbyist with a member of the House Banking  Committee to discuss issues of interest to Spiegel, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> Coelho arranged the meeting last March between Rep. Richard H. Lehman  (D-Sanger) and Norman Brownstein, a Denver attorney and lobbyist who currently  represents several savings and loan including Columbia, which is heavily  invested in junk bonds.  </P> <P> Robert Bauer, Coelho's attorney, said that setting up the Lehman-Brownstein  meeting was the only act by Coelho in the wake of his junk bond purchase that  could possibly be construed as a quid pro quo for Spiegel's help in obtaining  the $100,000 bond. But Bauer dismissed it as insignificant because Coelho  routinely introduces people to his colleagues in Congress.  </P> <P> On Friday, Common Cause, the citizens lobby that precipitated the current  ethics probe of Speaker Wright, called on the House Ethics Committee to  investigate Coelho's junk bond purchase.  </P> <P> The group asked the panel to look into whether the deal violated a House rule  prohibiting each member from accepting "favors or benefits under circumstances  which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance  of his governmental duties."  </P> <P> Spiegel, a close associate of junk bond king Michael Milken, has acknowledged  assisting Coelho by recommending -- and then helping finance -- the highly  unusual purchase of the bond, which was underwritten by Drexel.  </P> <P> The preliminary criminal investigations of both Coelho and Bradley have been  opened by the Justice Department's public integrity section in Washington in  connection with their financial dealings with the Drexel firm.  </P> <P> Although details of the investigations are not known, a central question being  examined is whether Bradley and Coelho, who have acknowledged that they made  investments through Drexel, illegally received preferential treatment. The  inquiry also is expected to examine whether investment opportunities may have  been made available to the two Democratic office-holders with the hope or  expectation of favored treatment from them in return.  </P> <P> Both have denied doing anything improper.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Bradley called Coelho to help launch a lobbying effort by  several California political figures on behalf of Drexel. The campaign  attempted to persuade the Securities and Exchange Commission not to require  Drexel, as part of a settlement of the agency's civil suit against the firm, to  move its junk bond operation to New York from Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Bradley could not be reached for comment on the Coelho  resignation, but one City Council member said it is certain to intensify  questions about Bradley's dealings with Drexel and officials at Columbia  Savings.  </P> <P> "It's a startling development and very ominous for the mayor," said City  Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. "It's a shock."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said: "Obviously something much more serious is going on here. How  this will affect the mayor, I don't know. But it certainly intensifies the  questions.  </P> <P> "Obviously Coelho's and Bradley's lives overlapped here," Yaroslavsky said.  "There may also be differences. So it may be dangerous to jump to conclusions.  But it is ominous."  </P> <P> City Councilwoman Gloria Molina said: "Obviously this is very serious. . . .  These constant revelations are making it much more difficult for the mayor. It  will create such a cloud that even if, in the end, the conclusion is that there  is nothing to prosecute, that he didn't use his office for personal gain, it  will still create a perception" that something was improper.  </P> <P> Staff writers Rich Connell and Frederick M. Muir in Los Angeles contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Geared shows 25% jump in net assets Fleming Geared Income and Assets Investment Trust raised net asset value per share by 25 per cent to 291.6p at the end of November, against 233.7p a year earlier. Net revenue for the six months to November 30 slipped from Pounds 1m to Pounds 944,000, giving earnings per share of 6.12p (6.66p). The interim dividend is 0.75p (2.97p) and there is a special 2p arising from larger than expected non-recurring accrued income received on redemption in specie of two unit trusts. At the last year end, the trust's sole investments were three unit trusts. Since then two of these have been redeemed in specie and the third redeemed for cash. The company is now invested in UK company shares. The directors said they still considered that their forecast current year dividend of 2p, excluding the special, to be the base level from which dividends should be able to grow in subsequent years.</p>

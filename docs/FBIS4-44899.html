			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Masato Yamano, chairman of the board of the </F> National Aerospace Development Agency of Japan; first paragraph  is source introduction]    [Text] In rocket development, which began decades ago with  the introduction of U.S. technologies, Japan has finally reached  a point where it can claim that its technology is 100 percent  domestically developed. Although it had problems for a while --  particularly in the development of the new two-stage rocket  engine -- it has succeeded in completing the entire job,  overcoming technological problems and the handicap of an  extremely small developmental budget and scanty facilities by  comparison with other countries. The completion of the job is a  result that promises an unending future for the space  developments of this country. Here is a summary of an interview  with Mr. Masato Yamano, the chairman of the board of the  National Aerospace Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), on the  development of the H-2 and its future tasks.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: You have just successfully  completed the long-awaited launching of the H-2 launch vehicle,  a rocket based on our own technologies. I am sure you are  thrilled with that huge success, but let me start with asking  you how you feel right now?    Yamano: Honestly speaking, I am greatly relieved.  The H-2 development project was indeed a crucially important  project for NASDA that lasted more than 10 years, and its  objective was to launch a world-class, technologically  state-of-the-art rocket based on Japan's own technology. This  year happens to be the 25th anniversary of NASDA, so that gives  me a greater pleasure to have been able to accomplish it this  year. With the success of the completion of this rocket, Japan  has come to be on a par with the leading countries of the world  in space development, at least in terms of the transportation  system. We are pleased to close this catch-up era, which lasted  for a quarter of a century. I believe we are at the threshold of  an age in which Japan will be able to play a leading role in the  world.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What was the critical point  in developing this rocket?    Yamano: We decided early on, as a basic direction,  to develop a new engine called LE-7 -- an engine based on the  two-stage combustion method, which, by its own right, is a  cutting-edge technology -- as the first-stage engine and a laser  gyro as the inertia guidance system to boost the lifting  capacity to four times that of the predecessor, the H-1.  Everything went quite smoothly, except for the LE-7 engine.    We ran into difficult problems in the development of the  LE-7. And the critical point was unquestionably the development  of the LE-7.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: You experienced a  substantial amount of trouble in the development, didn't you?    Yamano: Because of that trouble, we had to  postpone the launch twice. The first time, cracks were found in  the turbine blades of the hydrogen turbine pump; the second  time, the welded portion of the high-pressure piping fractured  as a result of high thermal stress. We never took any hasty  actions; we now see that we were right in making those two  postponements to do the job correctly.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Now that Japan has reached  the world level in terms of launch-vehicle development with the  success of the H-2, what do you think that rocket will enable us  to do in terms of space development?    Yamano: First of all, we will have the capability  of launching a wider range of satellites. For example, we can  build an enhanced version capable of placing a satellite  weighing up to 4 tons into geostationary orbit by improving the  first stage LE-7 engine and the second stage LE-5 engine and by  adding more booster rocket motors, or we can build a smaller  version capable of placing a smaller satellite weighing 1.5 tons  into geostationary orbit by reducing the number of booster  rockets. Secondly, the H-2 is technically capable of performing  moon and planet surveys. It will enable us to send a survey  vehicle to an orbit around the moon or Mars, as well as to bring  back samples from them.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What is your plan for the  development of the next-generation rocket?    Yamano: What we are pursuing with top priority at  this point are a space shuttle of our own, HOPE, which is  scheduled to be completed by the early part of the 21st century,  and an enhanced version of the H-2, which will enable us to  launch payloads of up to 20 tons, including HOPE. Also being  considered at this point are such improvements as making it a  reusable rocket or providing an apogee propulsion capability to  its second-stage engine to broaden the vehicle's capability.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Although it has many  promising features, the H-2 certainly has its fair share of  problems, doesn't it?    Yamano: The biggest problem is that its launch  costs are among the highest in the world. While we are confident  that the high reliability of NASDA's rockets is well  appreciated, we have to work seriously on cost reduction in  order to offer decent cost-effectiveness and be competitive in  the market. We have already initiated a study on cost-reduction  measures. The other problem is that the launch season of the  Tanegashima Space Center is limited to only 45 days a year and  is a season split in half -- one half being in the winter, the  other in the summer. However, we believe we can manage it for  the time being.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What kind of synergy effects  are possible as a result of the success of the H-2?    Yamano: A large satellite will be launched this  summer, one that is also based 100 percent on domestic  technology. If successful, Japan will secure its place among the  leading countries of the world in terms of both the  launch-vehicle technology and the satellite technology.    NASDA wishes to enhance its space activities in addition to  its traditional fields of communications, broadcasting, and  observation. I believe that a success this time will have a  major impact on the general industrial technologies as well.    [Boxed item]    It was 7:20 a.m., February 4, and the H-2 rocket rose into  the dawning sky over the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima  Prefecture as it made its maiden voyage into space and reached a  predetermined altitude that ushered this country into an  unending voyage to the moon, Mars and beyond. The  liquid-propellant, two-stage combustion engine developed for  this vehicle that is based on our own technology is at the  cutting edge and is equivalent to the engines used by the U.S.  Space Shuttle.    The successful H-2 launch was also the first milestone for  Japan in its quest to be competitive in the rocket business  among the leading countries of the world and a step toward the  role as leader of the world. While the professionals claim this  is only the "beginning of the first step," it is certain that  the country is entering an immense rocket age and is standing at  the threshold of the age of large satellites.    Moreover, if we succeed in increasing the power of this  rocket, we will be able to launch an ultraheavy satellite  weighing up to 4 tons to geostationary orbit, as well as a  Japanese version of the space shuttle weighing 20 tons.    This success in the challenge of the unknown was  accomplished  under the tight constraints of a much smaller budget (&yen;270  billion) and facilities that are meager by comparison with those  of other countries, and only 15 engines were destroyed in the  course of the development. That proves the soundness of the  technological levels of the companies that participated in the  project.</p>

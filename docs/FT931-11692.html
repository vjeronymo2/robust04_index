			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow draws strength from NAPM report Wall Street US SHARE prices staged a solid advance yesterday, aided by a bullish economic report from the National Association of Purchasing Management, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 22.15 higher at 3,332.18 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 3.74 to 442.52, while volume on the New York SE totalled 238.6m shares. The Nasdaq composite appreciated 5.43 to 701.77. The market opened firmer, buoyed by strong gains in overseas equities, notably in Tokyo, Frankfurt and London. On a lighter note, analysts were suggesting that superstitious investors may have been buying stocks yesterday following the Dallas Cowboys' victory in Sunday's Super Bowl. History shows that the stock markets do well in the years that follow a win by a team from the National Football Conferece - the Cowboys are from the NFC. Ultimately, however, the market drew its strength from the NAPM's January report, which showed that its index of manufacturing activity nationwide climbed from December's 55.4 to 58.0 last month, a bigger improvement than analysts had forecast. The NAPM figures were just the latest in a string of reports showing that the economic recovery is picking up pace. American Express was the day's feature, rising Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 24 3/4 on 6.6m shares traded as investors responded to the unexpected news over the weekend that Mr Jim Robinson, the company's much-criticised chairman, had resigned. Last week the share price fell sharply after Mr Robinson had apparently won a bitter battle to stay on at the beleaguered travel and financial services giant. Yesterday, Mr Richard Furlaud, a key member of the board of directors, was named non-executive chairman. RJR Nabisco put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 8 3/4 in volume of 6.9m shares on reports that the company is considering issuing a second class of stock pegged to its food business. RJR may also have been buoyed by an Illinois court ruling that rejected a smoker's allegation that tobacco companies deliberately concealed the full dangers of smoking from consumers. News of the court judgment aided other tobacco stocks. On the Nasdaq market, Lilly added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 23 3/4 after announcing fourth-quarter net income of 39 cents a share, almost double the 20 cents earned a year earlier. Leading technology stocks, which took a beating from profit-taking last week, were back in favour. Intel rallied Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 111 1/4 as 3.2m shares changed hands. Canada TORONTO ended on a slightly firmer note after fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 index gained 5.4 at 3,310.9 and rises led declines by 329 to 310. Volume came to 37.5m shares. Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded certain debt and securities of several members of the Edper group of companies, citing concern over earnings and significant share value declines. Among the stocks affected by the downgrades, Royal Trustco fell 48 cents to CDollars 1.22, Coscan Development 40 cents to 60 cents, Brascan 'A' CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 9 3/8 , Trizec 'A' 10 cents to CDollars 1.90 and Trilon Financial 'A' 55 cents to CDollars 2.15.</p>

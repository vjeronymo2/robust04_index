			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- It cannot be denied that  North Korea has extracted plutonium from the spent fuel of its  nuclear reactor, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Monday.    Kakizawa's remarks appear to contradict Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata's statement Saturday that he does not think North  Korea possesses nuclear weapons nor intends to build an atomic  bomb.    "Based on the report of the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), there is no denying that North Korea has  extracted some plutonium (from its research reactor in the  Yongbyon complex)," Kakizawa told the House of Councillors  Foreign Affairs Committee in response to a question.    Kakizawa suggested that Hata's remarks expressed  anticipation  of the truth of claims by North Korean President Kim Il-song  that North Korea has neither the will nor the ability to develop  nuclear weapons.</p>

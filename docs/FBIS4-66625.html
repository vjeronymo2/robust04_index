			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Letter to the editor from Mr. Latreche, the director of the </F> Lambese prison: "Corrections From the Director" -- first  paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] Following the publication of the article on the  Tazoult-Lambese breakout, which appeared in the 18-19 March  edition, Mr. Latreche, the prison's director, has sent in the  following update:    1. According to information obtained from my departments,  the  pseudowitness is reported to be a former prisoner who was  serving several sentences and was known throughout the area,  although no doubt better known for his crimes than for his  abilities as a witness and an observer. My comments, in fact,  pose the issue of the quality of such information.    The authors of the article, no doubt seeking something  sensational, did not fail to accept as truthful information  which, far from helping uncover the truth, has not failed to  enflame matters with their very debatable stand, all the while  offending the professional dignity of those who, like myself,  attempt to carry out a dangerous and very difficult mission to  serve the interest of public order.    2. According to his statements, 300 individuals armed with  Kalashnikovs had entered the village of Tazoult-Lambese at about  1700 according to a plan that had long since been drawn up in  minute detail. How could this witness have been in possession of  such information?    3. Furthermore, he claims to have seen two (2) vehicles, one  yellow J5 and one Lada automobile going towards the gendarmerie  and the police (now between the gendarmerie and the police there  is a distance of more than 800 meters as well as buildings).    How could he have seen or known if the two vehicles were  driving towards two different places, i.e., towards the  gendarmerie and the police?    4. He states he saw two Sonacome-make trucks parked in front  of the jail's main gate; so where could he have been?    5. The witness says he saw the director rush out of his  house  and speak to his guards saying: why have you shot your  colleague; he goes on to state that two (2) shots were fired at  the director, missing him. Now from the outside you cannot see  the director giving orders to his subordinates.    It is up to you to decide where this witness was in order to  see and hear everything that was being said (either at the  gendarmerie or at the police).    With respect to the professional qualifications of the  current director, it should be stated that his professional  skills and background are known to the prison administration and  in particular to his employer, who is in a better position to  appreciate his competence and service record.    Regionalism has never been one of the professional criteria  known to one and all.    Among other qualifications, the current director is an  electrician and has in addition a proven record of 27 years of  administrative experience.    I supply this correction so your readers and public opinion  may have the right information.</p>

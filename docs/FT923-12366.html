			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: Texas Instruments turnround continues TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer, yesterday announced a sharp improvement in second-quarter net income, helped by a better performance in its semiconductor operations. The group reported net income of Dollars 72m, or 73 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 157m, or Dollars 1.99 a share, in the same period of last year, when the company took a special charge of Dollars 130m for a cost reduction programme. Sales rose 11 per cent from Dollars 1.69bn to Dollars 1.88bn. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. This was Texas Instruments' second consecutive quarter of profits after six quarters of losses. The turnround follows an improving US chip market, extensive cost cutting, capital investment and a drive to better position the group in the lucrative custom chip field. The results were helped by royalty revenues of Dollars 124m, against Dollars 74m last year and Dollars 95m in the first quarter of this year. The period included one-time payments totalling Dollars 45m. US resales during the first half were the strongest since the first half of 1984. Europe was showing moderate expansion. Strong growth was continuing in the Asia-Pacific market, but the outlook for Japan had deteriorated over the past few months. For the six months, net income was Dollars 112m, or Dollars 1.10, against a net loss of Dollars 212m, or Dollars 2.76, while revenues rose from Dollars 3.3bn to Dollars 3.6bn.</p>

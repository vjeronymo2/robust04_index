			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Germans launch blitz on British palate - Expansion plans of Rewe, the food retailer A German businessman who describes himself as a lover of the UK is setting out on a personal mission - to corrupt the eating habits of the average British family. 'We helped to corrupt the food culture of Germany,' says Mr Hans Reischl, the man who has built up the privately-owned Rewe group into Germany's largest food retailer, 'and we are hoping to do the same in the UK.' Mr Reischl, who wears English-made shoes and spends two weeks of each year on holiday in the UK, said in a recent interview at the Rewe group's Cologne headquarters that the quality of food in mainstream British supermarkets was too high. 'I want to give the British consumer more choice about where he or she goes shopping,' Mr Reischl declared. 'We want to bring greater competition to the UK market. This will inevitably lead to a deterioration of your food-culture.' The process has already begun. Following the purchase of a 26 per cent stake in Budgens, the UK food retailer, Rewe has opened the first eight or nine stores in a planned chain of at least 40 discount food stores. Modelled on the down-market format which has taken Rewe's sales in Germany to DM33bn (Dollars 19.5bn) last year, these stores offer 1,200 to 1,300 items of stock compared to 6,000 in a normal Budgens store. Prices will be at least 10 per cent lower than in normal food supermarkets. 'There is no limit to our expansion plans,' said Mr Reischl. 'If we get the acceptance we expect, there will be a snowball effect throughout the country. We plan to open one or two stores a month next year.' Mr Reischl confesses an enormous personal admiration for the traditional UK supermarket groups. On his visits, he takes pleasure in walking around the Sainsbury store nearest to his hotel. He says he soon finds himself rapt in wonder at the range and quality of food on offer. 'Every now and again we have tried to introduce up-market food to our German stores, but the German housewife just won't buy filleted salmon,' he laments. 'Look at the sandwiches you can buy in an English supermarket - there is no way we could sell them at that kind of price to a German consumer.' He says poorer consumers get a raw deal in UK supermarkets, but philanthropy  -bringing cheap food to the poor - plays only a limited role in his thinking. More important is the profit motive. Rewe, like a number of other German retailing groups to have started opening discount stores in the UK, has its eye on the wide profit margins generated by the big four UK supermarket groups. UK supermarkets earn up to 7 per cent on sales which compares with 1 per cent earned by the Rewe group. This gap in margins represents a wealth of opportunity for the German discounters.</p>

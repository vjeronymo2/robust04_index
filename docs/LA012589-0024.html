			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL AGREES TO SEEK CHILD-CARE STUDY GRANT  </P> <P> Taking the first step toward achieving Mayor Maureen O'Connor's promise of  improved child care for city employees, the San Diego City Council agreed  Tuesday to apply for a $25,000 state grant to fund a comprehensive study of its  options.  </P> <P> But the vote did not come without lengthy public questioning from some council  members who said they are tired of studies and want to see action on the  pressing concern.  </P> <P> At the urging of Councilman Ron Roberts and others, the council agreed to speed  O'Connor's call for a city child-care coordinator by referring that proposal to  a council committee immediately. The child-care study, in contrast, could take  six to eight months.  </P> <P> "I'm concerned about studying it for another eight months, and the need grows  on a daily basis," Councilman Wes Pratt said.  </P> <P> "We're ready to go. In fact, the women of this city have been ready to go for  five years," Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer said.  </P> <P> During her annual State of the City address Jan. 9, O'Connor pledged that the  city would "take the lead" in providing on-site child care for city employees,  reading and recreation programs for school-age children and a "children's czar"  to coordinate child-care opportunities.  </P> <P> The application, due Friday in the state Department of Education, seeks $25,000  to determine how the city can best promote inexpensive, quality child care,  said Max Drumheller, an associate analyst in the city's Office of Community  Services.  </P> <P> At the urging of council members, it will also include references to the city's  plans for a child-care coordinator, a "public-private partnership" to promote  child-care opportunities and an advisory board on child-care issues, Drumheller  said.  </P> <P> Existing child-care opportunities for city employees include the downtown  Bayside Children's Center, which gives priority to city workers.  </P> <P> With only 10 of the $25,000 grants available, the city faces stiff competition  for the funds. About 150 other cities and counties are applying, including the  County Board of Supervisors, O'Connor said.  </P></p>

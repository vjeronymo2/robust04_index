			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union leaders search for progress on party links THE LEADERS of the two largest unions affiliated to the Labour party, the TGWU and GMB general unions, yesterday both suggested ways to head off the looming clash between the unions and the party leadership over union representation in the party. Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, pressed the idea of postponing the decision on how to select parliamentary candidates until next year's conference as the Boundaries Commission findings makes a decision at this year's conference unnecessary. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who wants the unions excluded from local selections, has made clear, however, that he does not favour postponement. Meanwhile Mr Bill Morris, TGWU leader, speaking at the union's conference in Bournemouth, said: 'If I was asked to advise Mr Smith I would just say 'talk to us'. We have to have movement over the summer because the conference is rapidly approaching'. He floated the suggestion of a code of practice on how unions consult their members paying the political levy over parliamentary selections and the election of the leader. He suggested that the code need not require ballots but could include mem-bers voting at branches. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, who was attending the TGWU conference, expressed interest in the idea of deferring a decision and in a union code of practice. 'The important thing is we have to get an agreed solution - there is good will on all sides,' she said.</p>

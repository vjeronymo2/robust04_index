[sentence as published]    The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Nationalist  Revolutionary Alliance]-Soldiers of the Filipino People-Young  Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU) raised the issue of continued  detention of six soldiers who participated in the series of  coups against the Aquino administration.    The RAM-SFP-YOU also brought up the continued attrition of  soldiers identified with RAM-SFP-YOU. Navy Capt. Danilo Lim,  RAM- SFP-YOU spokesperson, said many active soldiers were  removed from service on the basis of their involvement with the  reform group.    Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, head of RAM-SFP-YOU panel, said  the preliminary agreement signed by the two panels in December  1992 provided for the release of all detainees who participated  in the military rebellion. But to date, six of the soldiers  remain behind bars.    However, the government panel said the release of six is not  for the panel to decide but should be left to "judicial  discretion."    Of the six soldiers, two were charged with illegal  possession  of firearms and four were detained on orders by trial court  judges where their respective cases are pending. "The matter of  continued detention of these soldiers should be left to judicial  discretion. The government will not interpose any objection  should bail be applied for," Mr. Alfredo Tadiar, head of the  government panel, said.    On the other issue, Mr. Tadiar said government gave the  military rebels last week its policy on attrition for study and  evaluation.    The RAM-SFP-YOU said the policy on attrition failed to cover  all soldiers affected. "Ang attrition policy na pinalabas ng  Armed Forces ay hindi na-cover ang iba pa naming kasamahan na  apektado ng attrition. Ang hinihiling namin ay i-apply ito  equally sa lahat ng aming kasamahan [The attrition policy issued  by the Armed Forces does not cover other members affected by  attrition. What we demand is that this should be applied  equally to all our members]," Mr. Abenina said.    The attrition policy was prepared by Armed Forces of the  Philippines Chief of Staff Gen. Lisandro Abadia and studied by  National Defense Secretary Renato de Villa before it was signed  by President Ramos.    "Ang implication nito [The implication of this is that],  because it has already been signed by the President, hindi na  maiibalik ang mga kasama namin na natanggal sa tungkulin [our  members dismissed from duty will not be reinstated]," Mr. Lim  said.    The RAM-SFP-YOU voiced discontent over the explanations  given  by the government panel but reiterated earlier statements that  they will not pull out from talks.    Despite heated arguments on various differences in opinion,  the head of the government panel remained optimistic. "We have  promised each other that we will not give up the peace process,"  Mr. Tadiar said.</p>

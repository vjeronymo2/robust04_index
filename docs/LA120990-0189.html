			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM: RENT SQUEEZE  </P> <P> I think some people face discrimination because of their income level. When you  evaluate a person by (whether) they get government assistance, you are  stereotyping.  </P> <P> It's not a proper way of determining reliability.  </P> <P> California needs more reasonable rents. Prices here have become ridiculous.  Whatever happened to the two-bedroom apartment for $400? What happened to the  $200 one-bedroom apartment? The cost is beyond the monthly incomes of many  people. The governent could help by coming up with better programs to  supplement the income of people in need of housing. To expect people to find  good housing with the level of assistance provided is unrealistic in a lot of  cases.  </P> <P> Income levels are not the only factor in whether someone gets rental approval  from a landlord. However, if welfare recipients prove discrimination, I hope it  makes the guilty more considerate.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE REMOVES CITY, 3 OFFICERS FROM SUIT OVER BORDER SLAYING  </P> <P> A federal judge Friday removed the city of San Diego and three city police  officers as defendants in a $20-million wrongful-death suit stemming from the  shooting death of an illegal alien near the U. S.-Mexico border.  </P> <P> Police Officer Cesar Solis remains as the sole defendant in the case. Court  testimony indicated that a shot fired by Solis most likely resulted in the  death of Julio Arroyo Zaragoza, a 33-year-old illegal alien from Mexico who was  killed May 4, 1985.  </P> <P> After a weeklong trial, the case is scheduled to go to the jury next week. Both  sides rested their cases Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officer Saved by Vest  </P> <P> The shooting generated a whirlwind of controversy at the time. A Border Patrol  officer, Fred Stevens, was shot five times during the incident but survived,  thanks largely to a bulletproof vest, officials said.  </P> <P> Arroyo's family, which is pressing the suit, has maintained through their  attorney, Jose E. Tafolla of San Diego, that Arroyo was the victim of a  "summary execution" by members of the Border Crime Prevention Unit, a special  task force of officers from the San Diego police force and the U. S. Border  Patrol. Unit members patrol the border canyons seeking to deter crime against  illegal aliens.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge Gordon Thompson Jr. ruled that evidence indicated it was  "ludicrous" to contend that any city policy resulted in the alleged "execution"  of Arroyo. The three other officers named in the suit -- Larry K. Bender, M.  Mendez and M. Rosario -- did not shoot Arroyo and therefore should be dropped  as defendants, the judge ruled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conflicting Testimony  </P> <P> Much of the testimony during the trial has focused on conflicting comments from  pathologists as to whether Arroyo was shot at close range -- that is, whether  he received a so-called "contact" type wound that is associated with  execution-style slayings. Two experts called by the family testified that his  wound might fall into that category, while two pathologists called by the city  said the wound was inflicted from a greater distance.  </P> <P> Authorities have maintained that the shooting was justified because Arroyo and  his brother Jaime had been robbing aliens with weapons and attempted to shake  down the task force when the confrontation occurred. Jaime Arroyo, who survived  the incident, was convicted of conspiring to commit robbery and of attempted  murder and is serving a nine-year term at Soledad State Prison.  </P> <P> Arroyo's widow, Maria de Zaragoza, and her four children, residents of Mexico  City, have contended that the two brothers were guides leading a group of  migrants through the canyons when they were attacked by the officers, whom the  Arroyo brothers thought were bandits. The family charges that Julio Arroyo was  shot through the center of his forehead as officers were placing handcuffs on  his wrists.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: CAUGHT IN A STILL PLACE BY JONATHAN LERNER (SERPENT'S TAIL:  $9.95)  </P> <P> A weird, almost hallucinogenic novel of post-apocalyptic life in the Florida  Keys. Government has collapsed, leaving Jonathan Lerner's bizarre cast of  characters struggling half-heartedly to preserve the guttering flame of  civilization. Lerner seems to be offering a testament to the enduring powers of  love and friendship, but the two get rather muddled when a gay man and a  heterosexual woman inexplicably decide to become bedmates.  </P></p>

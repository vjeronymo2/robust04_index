The paper adds: Geneva summit confirmed that peace can be  genuine only if it is comprehensive and based on the UN  resolutions and the principles of international legitimacy and  justice.    AL-BA'TH stresses that the U.S. Administration would not  have  convened the Geneva summit if it were not convinced of the  importance of the Syria role in the peace process; a role which  President Clinton said is crucial to achieve a genuine peace in  the Middle East.    The paper adds: Political quarters and the media agree that  the Geneva summit undoubtedly dotted the i's and crossed the t's  to ensure a new launch for the peace process. This is  particularly the case when leader al-Asad reaffirmed Syria's  certain and firm determination to establish a just and  comprehensive peace on all tracks.    The paper stresses that the lessons of ancient and  contemporary history, as emphasized by President al-Asad,  confirm that separate peace and partial solution cannot  guarantee a genuine peace. Leader al-Asad very clearly  expressed Syria's firm belief that the just and comprehensive  peace is a necessity for everyone when he said: We seek a just  and comprehensive peace as a strategic option that guarantees  Arab rights, terminates the Israeli occupation, and enables all  the region's peoples to live in peace, security, and dignity.    For his part, U.S. President Clinton was clear in his  support  of President Hafiz al-Asad's view on the peace process when the  U.S. President publicly acknowledged three matters raised by  President al-Asad: Syria's principal role, which Clinton  considered a key to peace; that the peaceful settlement should  be comprehensive and not partial; and his administration's  desire to push forward the Syrian-U.S. relations to a new, more  important level.    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: The Geneva summit has provided  a new and rare opportunity to find a just and comprehensive  peace. Israel, as the media and political quarters feel, should  make a clear and candid stand away from the methods of deceit  and procrastination which it pursues to avoid the dues of the  just and comprehensive peace.    Within the same context, AL-THAWRAH says in a commentary:  The world was right when it considered Presidents  al-Asad-Clinton Geneva summit a historic event that will produce  an equally important results. From the statements made by  President Hafiz a-Asad and Bill Clinton, the world has learned  again that the Syria's position on peace and the peace process  is unequivocal; it is a clear position, based on objective  principles and absolute commitment to the foundations of the  peace process and the Madrid formula, as well as the pertinent  resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of  land for peace.    AL-THAWRAH adds: The emphasis laid by the Geneva summit on  the importance of the comprehensive peace and the achievement of  that peace banks on the implementation of UN Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace and  returning to Lebanon its occupied southern part.    AL-THAWRAH stresses that this emphasis will help put the  peace process back on its normal course, provided that Israel  abandons the policy of intransigence and provided that, as  President al-Asad has said, the Israeli rulers show enough  courage to respond favorably to a genuine peace based on justice  and comprehensiveness.    The paper adds: With the Geneva summit, the Arab position  has scored a historic triumph represented by this summit's  results and contribution toward affirming the credibility of the  Arab position, guaranteeing the rights of all Arabs, and  exposing the evasive nature of the Israeli policy. This would  not have been possible without President al-Asad's extraordinary  negotiating skills, his ability to convince others of the  justness of the Arab causes, and an unlimited ability to  represent Arabs and protect their national rights.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Activating the peace  process, which is the main objective of the Geneva summit, was a  subject of clear and full agreement between the summiteers. The  statements by Presidents al-Asad and Clinton confirmed the  importance of the comprehensive peace and the U.S. President  stressed the importance of Syria's crucial role in peace and the  peace process.    On the same subject, and under the headline "Summit of  Success," TISHRIN says in an editorial: President Hafiz al-Asad  did not need more political fame or credit or more spotlights  when he went to Geneva. With his persistent efforts and  principled positions and wisdom, he managed to win such things  before Geneva. Despite the distorted balance of powers in the  world and despite the deteriorating Arab situation, al-Asad  managed to make the world acknowledge Syria's pioneering role in  the region and the peace process.    The paper adds: If it were not for al-Asad, the summit would  not have been convened in the first place. Nor would the summit  have been convened on the basis of a precise parity between the  two parties.    The paper adds: Syria's standing was high before the Geneva  summit. It grew even bigger after the summit. In his  statement, President Clinton said more than once that Syria has  a crucial role in the region and that it would not be possible  to achieve peace in the region without Damascus or President  Hafiz al-Asad, who insists on playing a leading role in the  peace process.    The paper stresses that the Geneva summit has achieved a  major success because it gave credibility to the thesis of the  just and comprehensive peace and opened a new chapter in  relations between Damascus and Washington.    The paper notes that the summit has strengthened the world's  confidence in Syria's central and crucial role in the region and  foiled all attempts to encroach on Syria's weight and positions.    The paper notes that the summit provided a valuable  opportunity to build ties of mutual confidence and respect  between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton.    TISHRIN concludes by saying: President al-Asad went to  Geneva carrying the burden of the entire Arab cause. He  returned with his head high because he protected the nation's  dignity, strengthened its self-confidence, and revived its hopes  in the possibility of regaining its usurped rights.</p>

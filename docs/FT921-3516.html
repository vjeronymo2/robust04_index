			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Arts: The Barber of Seville - Palace Theatre, Watford I would like one day to see a Figaro Festival. It should include not only the three Beaumarchais plays that launched this character upon the world and the Mozart and Rossini operas that made him yet more famous, but also Horvath's modernist masterpiece Figaro Gets Divorced (staged in 1990 at the Gate), Renoir's classic film Les regles du jeu (inspired by Beaumarchais), the very cut Tito Gobbi film of Rossini's opera (seen last Sunday on Channel 4) and more. Here on the British stage is the father of all Figaros, Beaumarchais's Barber of Seville, seldom seen today. Figaro is a character who faces backwards and forwards in history. He is derived from the Harlequin of commedia dell' arte and from the comedies of Terence and Plautus; but he is also a symbol of the social forces that brought down the ancien regime. Unfortunately, this account is not greatly to be recommended. This play is much harder to bring off than its sequel, The Marriage of Figaro (or Figaro's Wedding, call it what you will). Beaumarchais's text is a thin fabric that seems once to have been embroidered with commedia vitality and incendiary nuance. Lou Stein's production fast-forwards over delicious crises that surely need to be prolonged to the point of delirium, and creaks through witty manoeuvres that should pass like quicksilver. Every role is undercast, but Figaro most so. Lee Cornes, a bland barber who blunders with the text, makes it impossible to understand why his is the title role. Helena Bonham Carter is a spoilt deb of a Rosine. Her pertness is appropriate, but she has not the warmth to make this role loveable, the elegance to make it distinguished or the vulnerability to make it touching. Oliver Parker is a yuppie Almaviva. Barry Jackson does nothing wrong as Bartolo, but not enough right. (Imagine the comic inventiveness that a Paul Eddington might bring to the role and you have a clue to how intoxicating Barber could again become.) The dancing of Gemma de la Cruz before and after each scene lends a welcome dash of Spain to proceedings, which is then vitiated by the cast's coarse pronunciation of 'Rosine' and 'Jose'. The translation is by Ranjit Bolt and follows his Marriage of Figaro, given last year by this theatre. Bolt is an irrenot resist turning bits of Beaumarchais's prose into verse. And his few outbreaks of rhyme here are better timed than the big one in Figaro. Bolt is the virtuoso of yuppiespeak, and greatly talented. But prose does him good; it sometimes stops him advertising his own cleverness. Even so, more than half the jokes here aren't by Beaumarchais; and some of Beaumarchais's best lines have been pruned away. Too often Bolt sounds like a loutish loudmouth, trying to make sure that his voice will always be heard over that of the original playwright.</p>

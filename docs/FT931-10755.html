			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ciments Francais confirms full-year loss of FFr1bn CIMENTS Francais, the ailing French cement group that has been clouded by controversy since the discovery last autumn of FFr1.05bn (Dollars 192m) off-balance sheet dealings, yesterday confirmed that it made a net loss of FFr1bn last year. The group, which made net profits of FFr401m on turnover of FFr16.45bn in 1991 and has disclosed a deficit of FFr740m for the first half of last year, will publish its full 1992 results on March 19. However, it verified yesterday, following a French press report, that it made a net loss of about FFr260m in the second half, bringing the total loss for the year to FFr1bn. Ciments Francais would not comment on the likely level of provisions for the second half. The off-balance sheet dealings produced exceptional losses of FFr655m during the first half, when it was affected by the sluggish state of the European construction industry. The French cement group, which fired its chairman, Mr Pierre Conso, when the off-balance sheet dealings came to light, is still waiting for the completion of an investigation by the Spanish stock market authorities into its investment in Cementos Molinos, the Spanish cement company. The Ciments Francais scandal has implications for Paribas, the prominent French investment bank which still holds a significant stake in the company and was, until last spring, its controlling shareholder. Paribas has been forced to repay FFr500m of the FFr6bn it received last year for a controlling holding in Ciments Francais from Italcementi, the Italian cement group. This reduced its profit on the sale to FFr500m excluding its share of Ciments Francais's 1992 losses. In the first half, Paribas's share of the cement company's losses amounted to FFr400m. Its share of losses in the second half is expected to be about FFr100m, making the full-year losses roughly equal to its potential profit on the renegotiated deal. Mr Andre Levy-Lang, Paribas' chairman, last week announced that the group had made a net profit of about FFr900m in 1992.</p>

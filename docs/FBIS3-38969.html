As  government spokesman Dieter Vogel reported in Bonn, Kohl  emphatically supported the U.S. position, which is largely  identical with French ideas. After the NATO decision Clinton  warned the Bosnian Serbs and others against continuing to shell  Bosnia's capital. Everyone who violates the decision, which is  also largely based on U.S. proposals, "must be prepared for the  consequences," Clinton said. The conflict itself "must be  solved by the parties involved at the negotiating table,"  whereby the United States will take over a more substantial role.    According to Minister of the Chancellery Friedrich Bohl, the  FRG has a "decisive share in the implementation of the ultimatum  to Bosnia." On the ARD "Morgenmagazin" program, he explained  that "behind the scenes and via diplomatic channels we made  great efforts to come to this result." The minister of the  chancellery does not see any parallels with the situation that  led to World War I. In contrast with 1914, the international  community this time is in complete agreement. The threat must  be upheld at all costs, however. Germany must "provide moral and  political support."</p>

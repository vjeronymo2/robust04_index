			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UN ponders Rwanda plan France ran into Third World opposition last night when United Nations Security Council members first discussed proposals for unilateral French military intervention in Rwanda, Michael Littlejohns reports from New York. However, the plan is still expected to be approved. Diplomats said a French resolution that would give the Council's blessing to the operation was likely to gain acceptance, mainly because the UN cannot deploy its own troops in substantial numbers for perhaps up to three months. Ms Madeleine Albright, US delegate, said Washington was 'supportive' of the French initiative. China, which has the power of veto, has not made its position known. New Zealand was the severest Security Council critic, arguing Paris should have offered troops to serve under UN command. Nigeria expressed serious reservations.</p>

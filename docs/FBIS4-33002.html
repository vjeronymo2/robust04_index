			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel Angel Rouco] </F>   [Text] Argentina will reject the Paraguayan request for  additional financial compensation to pay for damage caused by  the filling of the Yacyreta dam. A similar position will be  assumed with respect to the Uruguayan Government request that  Argentina assume a greater portion of the cost for construction  of the Martin Garcia channel project.    The government made this decision following a meeting  between  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Foreign Minister Guido Di  Tella.    During the meeting both ministers established the groundwork  for future negotiations with both countries to prevent further  economic damage against Argentina.    A spokesman said: "Negotiations will be difficult,  particularly considering the construction schedule for both  public works."    This schedule provides for the Argentine-Paraguayan  hydroelectric power plant to start operating on 1 September.  Ten days ago Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy warned  that the filling of the dam reservoir would be delayed until the  issue of expropriations and the relocation of people living on  the Paraguayan side are resolved. The area scheduled to be  flooded on the Paraguayan side involves some 40,000 hectares of  poor land, but with some settlements.    According to the Argentine Foreign Ministry, the problem  must  be resolved by the Yacyreta Binational Entity (EBY), which must  provide more funds to compensate Paraguayan settlers. "Those  lands are probably owned by people close to the Paraguayan  Government, and not by simple settlers. This is probably why  there is so much interest in Asuncion in modifying the mechanism  for compensation."    On the other front, Uruguay wants Argentina to pay  two-thirds  of the total cost of the Martin Garcia Channel dredging,  maintenance, and sign posting, while Uruguay pays the remaining  one-third.    "This demand is inadmissible, because both countries will  benefit equally from the project. The decision to navigate  through the Emilio Mitre Channel or the Martin Garcia Channel is  one of cost. Surely those using the Martin Garcia Channel will  dock at Uruguayan ports. In the end the benefit will be for  both countries, and thus our position is that each country must  pay half of the total cost," Transport Secretary Edmundo Soria  said.    The dredging of the Martin Garcia Channel will have an  initial cost of more than $100 million. The channel will permit  the passage of ships having up to 32 feet in draught, which  means that ocean ships will be able to enter the channel.  Maintaining the channel will cost some $25 million annually.</p>

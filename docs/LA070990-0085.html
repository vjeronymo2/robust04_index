			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE SALES DOWN 5% FOR 2ND STRAIGHT YEAR  </P> <P> Wine consumption in the United States dropped sharply for the second straight  year in 1989, with Mississippians drinking the least and tipplers in the  District of Columbia the most, a trade publication reported.  </P> <P> Drinkers in California, New York and Washington, the top wine-producing states,  drank the most per capita, but New Hampshire was the only state to show a gain  in consumption over 1988, according to Wines &amp; Vines.  </P> <P> Americans last year drank 2.11 gallons of wine per capita, the lowest  consumption of any major wine-producing nation and a 5.8% drop from 1988.  Consumption in 1988 was off 5% from 1987.  </P> <P> By comparison, Americans over 21 drank 33.7 gallons of beer, 2.16 gallons of  distilled spirits and about 35 gallons of coffee. Adult-only wine consumption  was 3.03 gallons per capita.  </P> <P> Reflecting a national trend against alcohol consumption, individual states  posted figures showing as much as a 19.5% drop from 1988. In Arizona, a  half-gallon less wine per capita was consumed last year than in 1988.  </P> <P> The domestic wine market, including imports, fell 5.2% to 523 million gallons.  It was a 64.1-million-gallon drop from a high point of 587.1 million gallons in  1986.  </P> <P> California wines accounted for 72.8% of consumption, while the other 42  wine-producing states held 12.6% of the market. The rest of the market, 14.6%,  was imports.  </P> <P> Wines &amp; Vines blamed the market drop on a continuing falloff in generic or  jug wines, nearly all of it produced in California's San Joaquin Valley, and a  16.7% dip in wine cooler sales.  </P> <P> Blush varietals such as white zinfandel and white grenache continued to gain  market share, while premiums, which cost more than $3 a bottle, increased 7%.  </P></p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Deposit protection A RECENT reply in Q &amp; A Briefcase (protection for a joint account) explains how each depositor in a joint account is protected by the Building Societies Act 1986. Can you tell me if similar protection is offered to each joint account holder in a) British mainland banks and b) bank and building society accounts in Jersey and the Isle of Man covered by their own schemes? Joint account holders in mainland banks are each covered as to 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 deposited. In other words, a husband and wife account would be covered in respect of 75 per cent of the first Pounds 40,000, with a maximum of Pounds 30,000. There is no deposit protection scheme in Jersey. The Isle of Man has a similar scheme to that on the mainland, with the provision for joint account holders the same.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Consortia buy E German energy assets Eastern Germany's largest electricity utility and its biggest brown coal field have been sold to a consortium headed by RWE Energie, the German utility, the Treuhand privatisation agency announced yesterday. The sale, which will be officially sealed next week, paves the way for a DM41bn (Dollars 27.3bn) investment programme by west Germany utilities in eastern Germany's energy sector. It also secures a future for brown coal, despite the environmental costs, and particularly in an election year when unemployment in eastern Germany is one of the key issues. Although the Treuhand will not confirm the selling price until next week, energy officials yesterday said RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk paid about DM8bn for Veag, eastern Germany's largest utility. The former state utility, which enjoyed a monopoly under the former communist regime, had a workforce of 29,000. That has been reduced to 14,500, and is expected to fall further. A consortium led by Rheinbraun, RWE's brown coal offshoot, and including Preussen-Elektra and Bayernwerk, bought the Laubag brown coal fields for an initial payment of DM2.1bn and a commitment to invest more than DM6bn over the next 20 years. Laubag, which now employs less than 12,000, compared to more than 60,000 before German unification, will fuel most of Veag's 12,300-megawatt capacity. Annual coal production will total about 55m tonnes, which is considered the minimum for the fields' economic viability. However, the long-term economic prospects for Laubag and Veag will depend on the consortia's ability to withstand increasing pressure from the expanding gas market and falling energy consumption in eastern Germany. Gas is quickly becoming a substitute for brown coal.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Bank warning STERLING'S ignominious departure from the ERM on September 16 of last year led not to perestroika, but to glasnost. Among other changes, the chancellor has announced a target range for inflation of 1 to 4 per cent. He also invited the Bank of England to comment on its chances of achievement. Yesterday's first report makes sobering reading. The economy is still bumping along the bottom, while inflation is expected to bump along at the top of its range, with the risks mostly on the up-side. The Bank's aim is to increase public understanding and thereby stimulate a more informed debate. But it is not, it insists, an independent central bank, which is why it leaves the implications for others to draw. This is a little disingenuous, for two reasons. First, the Bank's policy conclusion is evident from its emphasis on the risks to inflation of 'sustained further depreciation and a faster pass-through of the depreciation that has already taken place'. Second, the Old Lady of Threedneedle Street has been given a rod for the chancellor's back. The unanswered question is whether she will dare to use it when she should. On this evidence, she just might. The report is professional in its analysis of what inflation means and of how and why it has fallen. It is equally professional in its analysis of the risks. It shows, in particular, that the government continues to have a credibility problem. This will increase the real cost of achieving its targets, which must make its determination to achieve them less credible. The fundamental assumption underlying the exercise is that there is no long-run trade off between inflation and unemployment. That assumption is fully borne out by the UK's experience over the past 20 years, during which the price level has risen six-fold and the level of unemployment five-fold. In the short to medium term, however, things look very different. The Bank report shows that employment has fallen still more than at the comparable stage in the recession of the early 1980s. Meanwhile, both labour productivity in the economy as a whole and real earnings have risen rather more. The increase in unemployment will be durably reversed, hoever, only if real wages at last stop rising, just as the decline in inflation will be sustained only if the effects of depreciation on the prices of tradable goods are not passed through into wages. Pay inflation has to fall further and stay down, notwithstanding recovery and the lagged effects of depreciation. The Bank shows that achievement of the inflation target is far from secure. In the short term, that may not matter as much as how that target will be met. The target can be overshot temporarily, provided pay inflation continues to decline. If it does not, what price the government's target for inflation? How long before it too is thrown on the dustbin of history?</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Dah Sing agrees venture with UK fund manager Dah Sing Financial Holdings, the Hong Kong-listed banking and financial services company, has agreed in principle to set up an investment management group in the colony with M&amp;G Group, the London-listed fund manager. The proposed joint venture will carve a niche in both institutional fund management and unit trust business in Hong Kong, broadening out to China and other countries in the region. Dah Sing will have a controlling 51 per cent interest, with M&amp;G supplying the balance and seconding senior staff to the venture. It is envisaged that the British company, which is the UK's largest unit trust group, will also supply the venture's chief executive. Dah Sing last year expanded its presence in the colony with the purchase of the Wing On Bank, previously controlled by Hang Seng Bank, the Hong Kong banking arm of HSBC Holdings. This acquisition increased its branch network to 54 branches. The group has also entered a joint venture agreement to operate supermarkets in Shanghai.</p>

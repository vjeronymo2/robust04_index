			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Books: A domestic minister - The man from middle England MINISTERS DECIDE by Norman Fowler Chapmans Pounds 18, 372 pages NORMAN FOWLER has always seen himself in politics as the man from middle England. He represents a Midlands seat, Sutton Coldfield, where in the 1979 general election when Mrs Thatcher became prime minister he had the highest Tory majority in the country. As a former journalist - he was the home affairs correspondent of The Times - and one of the very few cabinet ministers to serve almost throughout Thatcher's administrations, he is well qualified to write about the experience. Perhaps not surprisingly, he has produced a middling sort of book. Some of it is very interesting, especially the parts about before he held senior office. Fowler is grammar school/Cambridge, part of what he describes as the Cambridge mafia which has held so many seats in recent Conservative governments. It was between school and university, during his officer's training course for national service, that he says that he discovered that the Britain of the 1950s was 'still a class-ridden society'. The less-well educated boys from the public schools looked down on the better educated products of the grammar schools. That is a revealing comment, which helps to explain what some of modern Toryism has been about. Politicians like Fowler, and indeed Thatcher, wanted greater equality of opportunity, and they wanted it within a competitive, efficient system. They had little to do with the old Tory paternalism, which too often went hand-in-glove with the paternalism of the trades unions. Nevertheless, the new Toryism had its limitations. Fowler records Thatcher saying as early as 1975 that she had spent all her time in home departments and now needed to learn about foreign affairs. Some of the new Tories left the learning process even later. Fowler spent his entire ministerial career in domestic ministries and never really caught up with Europe. At heart and in his head, he is a middle English nationalist. Curiously, that was what led to one of his most decisive interventions in government. By threatening to resign from the cabinet, he helped to stop the sale of the former British Leyland to an American company. In a way, he was right. The cabinet committee system had never thought to consult the member who sat in the heart of the motor industry. Fowler says that Thatcher promised at once that never again would regional and constituency interests of a cabinet member be so overlooked. By any but the very highest standards, Fowler had a successful ministerial career. He helped to bring about the management buy-out in the National Freight Corporation, one of the first of the privatisations. He pushed through the electrification of British Rail against the opposition of Sir Alan Walters. He was a prime mover in bringing in portable pensions. Mrs Thatcher must have been genuinely sorry to see him go when he decided that he wanted to spend more time with his children. Probably he should have been made party chairman. He understood the Tory party in the country, and he probably understood what makes middle England tick. He records that he did not vote for Thatcher in the fateful party leadership election in 1975, but along with Norman Lamont was instrumental in seeking to persuade Sir Keith Joseph to run. When that enterprise failed, he supported Sir Geoffrey Howe, but came quickly to admire the winner. In the leadership election last year, he voted for Thatcher in the first ballot and Michael Heseltine in the second. He thinks that Thatcher could have won on the first if only she had been in the country at the time and had bothered to campaign properly. As a former journalist, Fowler should be mildly ashamed about the length of his book. The more personal parts are the best. No-one would accuse him of using a ghost-writer and it is rather courageous of him to seek to remain in the House of Commons rather than accepting the peerage that would automatically come his way if he were to step down at the next election.</p>

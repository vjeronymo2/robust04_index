			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Northern Telecom expands in S Wales NORTHERN Telecom, one of the world's largest suppliers of digital telecommunications switching systems, is to enlarge its operation in Newport, south Wales. The move is expected to add 120 jobs over the next three years to its present workforce of 180. The Canadian company, which also has a factory at nearby Cwmcarn employing more than 800, is to move into a 150,000 sq ft factory next April being built for it by the Welsh Development Agency. The factory will enable the company to increase production of sophisticated cables and communications systems for naval underwater and Army uses. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said that the agency's joint-venture property scheme with the private sector was running at record levels and would lead to 900,000 sq ft of space being built this year - 100,000 sq ft more than in 1991-92. The agency claims to be one of the biggest property developers in Europe, with a portfolio of more than 20m sq ft. It expects to spend about Pounds 58m this year through joint ventures which should lead to a total public-private spend in this area alone of around Pounds 320m.</p>

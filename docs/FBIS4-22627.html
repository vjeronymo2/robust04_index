			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Academician V. Boyev, director of the </F> All-Russian Scientific Research Agricultural Economics  Institute: "Why Aren't the Reforms Working?"]    [Text] The profound crisis which is continuing in the  agrarian sector is forcing many to think seriously about why the  reforms being carried out in this sphere are not achieving their  transforming purpose. What is the opinion on this score of  agrarian scientists, first of all those who deal directly with  problems of the reformation of economic relations in the  village? Our correspondent, G. Vasilyev, has asked Academician  of the Russian Agricultural Academy and Director of the  All-Russian Scientific Research Agricultural Economics  Institute, V. Boyev, to share them.    Serious tactical errors in conducting it were committed from  the very beginning of the agrarian reform. In particular, this  applies to the priorities chosen, including the support of  entrepreneurship in the form of trader middlemen ahead of  agricultural producers, private and petty forms of farm  management ahead of large-scale, premature orientation on world  prices to the detriment of the parity of prices for agricultural  and industrial products.    Disparagement of the role of state regulation has had an  especially negative effect on matters in the agro-industrial  complex. This has been the consequence of treating it like the  forms of administrative influence on production, which is  incompatible with market relationships.    Of course, the market, by its very nature, is a  self-regulating system in many respects. However, it not only  doesn't exclude but even presumes the need for state  interference in order for it to invariably work for the  strengthening and growth of the economy. Such an approach to the  agro-industrial complex is determined by a number of objective  reasons. Among them is the diversity of natural and climatic  conditions in our country, given which it is important to create  a system for protecting agricultural commodity producers and for  insuring their activity. There is also the instability of prices  and revenues in the agro-industrial complex, which depend both  on natural factors and on market conditions. Moreover, a low  degree of monopolization in agriculture and a high degree in the  resource-supplying and service spheres is characteristic for  Russia.    The advisability of regulating the agro-industrial complex  is  confirmed also by the experience of countries with a market  economy. Thus, in the USA, despite agriculture's high  technological level, the state pays price subsidies to the  farmers, monitors the maintenance of price parity, and finances  the development of agricultural science and the social  infrastructure from the federal budget. Programs for the  construction of roads and social infrastructure facilties in  rural localities are implemented through the budgets of the  states and municipalities. The activity of state services in the  USA is directed to the creation of favorable conditions for the  market management of agriculture and at the same time it permits  the maintenance of an economically and socially acceptable level  of prices for food and other commodities.    Regulation of the agrarian sector in the countries of the  EEC  and other states is organized in a similar manner. Their  experience attests to the fact that, as market relations  develop, state regulation of the national economy not only  doesn't lose its significance but, on the contrary, becomes more  complicated and is perfected. Rejection of it would mean  rejection of the state itself.    However, the market is to be combined not with any means of  external influence. As conversion to it proceeds, fundamentally  new methods of regulation must become predominant. Among them  one should single out the program method. It means the  combination of mechanisms for the self-regulation of the  agricultural market with the development and implementation of  programs for the functioning of the market and the development  of the agro-industrial complex. The "planning-programming-budget  development" system introduced in the USA in the '60s can serve  as an example of such regulation. Planning was interpreted in  this case to mean determination of the long-range goals and of  the ways to achieve them. An average period program for its  achievement was developed for each of the goals. Budgets (annual  plans of activity, determination of revenue sources and the  distribution of resources) were calulated on the basis of the  programs.    Analogous systems operate with well-defined information in  Japan, Korea and other countries. This is especially  characteristic for the stages of the fundamental structural  reorganization of the economy. Objectively, such a process is  also inevitable for Russia.    At the same time the villagers expect from the state a  price,  finance and credit, and tax policy which would promote the  stabilization and development of agrarian production. Today we  observe the reverse image. The liberalization of prices, begun  in 1992, has led to the drastic deterioration of the economic  situation in the agrarian sector. This has occurred to no small  degree because of the monopoly position of the enterprises which  procure agricultural products and produce material-technical  assets for the village. The gap in the growth rates of prices  for industrial and agricultural products in 1993 has increased  to more than twice the 1990 level as a result.    One of the reasons for the ineffectiveness of price policy  is  the imperfection of the system being used for monitoring price  parity. The result is the lack of an efficient system for  restoring it. The entire tracking system comes down to the  indexation of prices (more or less reliable and not always  timely) and on this basis--to the subsidizing of the production  of specific types of products. Forecasting of the price  situation is essentially not being done. Hence the persistent  miscalculations not only at the lowest but also at the highest  level of the regulation of price relationships.    In our opinion, it is important for the balanced development  of the agro-industrial complex to achieve day-to-day tracking of  the movement of prices for industrial goods and the products of  agriculture and the processing industry, and of retail prices at  the republic, regional, and local levels. As far as the  monopolist enterprises of the resource-supplying sectors are  concerned, then it is advisable to set maximum (predelnyy)  prices for them and to adjust them periodically, taking the  increase in the cost of energy resources and the inflationary  growth of wages, as well as changes in tax and credit policy,  into account.    Under conditions of the absence of competition, the measure  being proposed appears warranted. Of course, the situation when  a price is established on the basis of free competition and  neither an enterprise nor the state is able to increase or to  reduce a price established on the basis of supply and demand is  the best. If a commodity producer and wholesale and retail trade  are in a position to arbitrarily increase a price, this is a  sign not of market, but what is contrary to it, of the monopoly  price-setting that we now observe.    As a result the villager is not able to purchase  agricultural  machinery and to acquire even the necessary minimum of mineral  fertilizers and other supplies. Such a situation has resulted in  the significant growth in the labor intensity of the production  operations being performed and in the prolongatiion of the  periods for field work and in a great shortage of products.    Serious errors have also been committed in financial policy.  The existing system of state support is ineffective so far. It  has not resolved the problems of stabilizing production,  increasing the interest of commodity producers in augmenting  food and raw material production and investment activity, and  improving living conditions. The necessary stimuli for  structural changes in the agro-industrial complex also have not  been created. This is one of the reasons for the proposals  recently advanced about the drastic curtailment or even  termination of the financing of the agrarian sector, which would  result in an even greater fall in agricultural production. As  practice demonstrates, it is essential, especially in the period  of the transition to the market, to strengthen financial support  as one of the forms of state regulation of the agro-industrial  complex and to impart to it a systems, goal-directed, and  stimulating character. At the present time it should be linked,  first of all, with overcoming the deficit of agricultural  products and made available chiefly to those who guarantee the  maintenance and, in the long run, the growth of production.    The tax policy being followed also is not up to the tasks of  stabilizing and developing the food market. Many of the taxes in  use do not create an interest in expanding agricultural  production and strengthening the village's material-technical  base. They are very burdensome for the peasants. That is why it  is advisable in their interests and those of the consumers of  agricultural products to decrease the weight of taxation. With  this aim in view it would be proper, at least for the period of  the formation of market relationships, to revoke the tax on the  profit of agricultural enterprises regardless of the structure  of the products and services being sold, and to approach the  setting of transfers to the employment fund differentially, by  not imposing them on farms experiencing a personnel shortage.    Exemption from the tax on the profit of agricultural,  agroservice, and processing enterprises which goes for  reinvestment (capital investments, reconstruction, technical  retooling of production), as well as for the development of the  social sphere, will help improve matters in the agro-industrial  complex. In order to interest the manufacturer of products for  the village in selling their goods at prices no higher than the  maximum (fixed), one should set a differentiated percentage of  reduction of the rate of the profit tax depending on the  physical volumes of production achieved. It is advisable to set  a maximum profit rate, and to not impose a tax on the profit  received, for new, highly efficient products over a period of  two to three years from the moment of their being put into  series production.    The granting of privileges to enterprises and organizations  of other branches of the national economy who direct a portion  of profit to the development of the agro-industrial complex  would yield a considerable effect. This would help increase the  inflow of capital into this sphere. There are also other  suggestions with respect to rational taxation. They all are  directed to creating favorable conditions for developing the  agro-industrial complex and stabilizing the food market.  Government regulation on the basis of well thought-out and  effective utilization of price, financial, credit, tax, and  other economic control levers should be subordinated precisely  to this.</p>

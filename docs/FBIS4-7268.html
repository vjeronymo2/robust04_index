			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New party Sakigake and  Group Seiun have agreed to form a joint parliamentary front, the  two parties said Thursday. Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura,  who was the chief cabinet secretary in the government of former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, will head the new group.    Sakigake controls 15 members in the 511-seat House of  Representatives, while Group Seiun consists of three lower house  members who quit Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) in protest at  his approach to the ruling coalition's core party Shinseito  headed by new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    Political sources said more JNP members may leave the party  and join the Sakigake-Seiun front.</p>

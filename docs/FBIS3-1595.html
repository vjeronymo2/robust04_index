This was confirmed by an agreement signed on Saturday [26  February] by visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and  Bangladesh Finance Minister M. Saifur Rahman.    The usage of the loan is to be decided between the two sides  later this year, according to Chinese sources.    Since the diplomatic relation between the two countries was  established in 1975, remarkable progress has been made in trade  and economy as well as many other fields.    The two sides have expressed their hopes to expand the  friendly relations, especially in trade and economic sector.    Qian, who is on an official goodwill visit to Bangladesh, is  scheduled to leave for Sri Lanka on Sunday.

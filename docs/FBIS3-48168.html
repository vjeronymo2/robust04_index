			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Some scholars and lawmakers yesterday called for  renegotiation of the Uruguay Round [UR] talks with the United  States in the agricultural field, mainly in relation to the  opening of the domestic rice market.    In a policy debate over the multilateral UR negotiations  organized by the opposition Democratic Party [DP], they also  called on the National Assembly to oppose ratification of the UR  negotiations and the people to stage a nationwide campaign to  deter the pressure to import rice.    Prof. Kim Wan-pae of Chungang University said, "We should  not  submit the documents pledging to carry out the opening of  agricultural and livestock product markets until late February,  the deadline set by the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade]."    "We have to appeal to the GATT and ask for more negotiations  with the United States," he added.    He called on the government to ask the GATT to acknowledge  trade between South and North Korea as an internal exchange  between the same people.    "We need to resume negotiation with the United States  because  it is attempting to reject the imports of some agricultural and  livestock materials to protect its domestic market," he added.    He asserted the Assembly special committee on UR  negotiations  needs to be operated constantly in a bid to come forward with  effective measures in this connection.    He also called for revolutionary changes in the rural  structure to ride the expected tough UR wave.    Prof. Kim Su-haeng of the Seoul National University said the  government must reflect the interests of the people in all  sectors of society in the pursuit of its internationalization.    "The government did nothing in connection with the  improvement of the welfare of the underprivileged, only putting  emphasis on strengthening the national competitiveness in  international society," he said.    "In a sense, further globalization will result in  destitution  of agricultural areas and the increase of jobless people due to  the rapid change of industrial structure toward autonomization,"  he added.    Cho Sung-u from the national emergency committee to protect  the rice market said, "The UR talks have yet to be finalized.  It is not true that the opening of the markets for basic  agricultural products including rice is inevitable."    "We have to embark on a national campaign to block rice  imports by collecting signatures and money to this end," he  added.    Rep. Kim Yong-chin of the DP said, "As an initial step in  the  UR talks, we have to call on the U.S. to resume negotiation and  to clarify our objections to the rice import."    Kim called for maintaining the production of rice and other  basic agricultural products at a proper level to prepare for the  upcoming national unification era, and other short and long term  developments.</p>

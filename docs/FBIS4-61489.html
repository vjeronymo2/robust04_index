			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] Head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Andrey Kozyrev  expressed hope that the meeting between Foreign Ministers of  Russian Federation, United States, European Union, and United  Nations on settlement of the Bosnian conflict would be held on  May 13 in Geneva. On Thursday day, during a short stop in  Moscow on his way from Cairo to St. Petersburg he reported that  two dates had been preliminary discussed by the parties.  "Moscow is in favor of an earlier date (May 13) in order to  prevent escalation of hostilities in Bosnia," said Kozyrev.    He underlined that achievement of an agreement on cessation  of hostilities in Bosnia and deployment of UN forces between the  parties involved in this conflict is the major issue of the  agenda.    Speaking about the situation in the Middle East after the  signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreements on Gaza Strip and  Jericho Wednesday in Cairo, Kozyrev noted that on the one hand,  Moscow intends to assist in implementation and development of  these agreements, and, on the other hand, it wants to assist in  establishing a Syrian-Israeli dialogue.    Meanwhile, during his conversation with our Interfax  correspondent a Russian diplomat in Cairo, who preferred to stay  anonymous, expressed his opinion that a breakthrough on the  Syrian-Israeli direction can be reached by means of "a quiet  diplomacy" and, probably, on a bilateral ground as it was during  the dialogue between Israel and the PLO.    At the conference to be held in Geneva on May 13 the heads  of  Russian and American diplomacies, the European Union and the  U.N. will address the warring sides in Bosnia with a joint  appeal to sign an agreement to cease hostile actions and start  drafting a document on a comprehensive solution to the conflict.  Interfax learned this on Thursday from a senior Russian  diplomat.    According to him, a contact group, which includes experts  from Russia (Interfax's note: Russia is represented there by a  high- ranking member of its Foreign Ministry, Aleksey  Nikiforov), the USA, Britain, France, Germany, the European  Union and the U.N., has been instructed to finalize a draft  agreement on ceasing hostile actions. "The document has to be a  compromise and take into account the wishes of both warring  sides. With this aim in view the contact group is cruising  between Pale and Sarajevo. On Friday it is expected to arrive  in Zagreb," the diplomat said.    According to him, the contact group is facing a complicated  task. "Neither the Serbs nor the Muslims in Bosnia seem to want  to heed anything, but their own arguments. This does not give  rise to optimism, of course," he said.    As Interfax's interviewee conceded, tensions around the  Bosnian city of Brcko remain high. Nevertheless he said that  the situation should not be dramatized. "A concentration of  Serb and Muslim troops was noted around Brcko, but noticeable  actions have been observed from neither side. Maybe the call  for refraining from provocations made by the chairman of the  U.N. Security Council had an effect on them. However there is  another explanation for their restraint: the mountainous  terrain and the abundance of rivers and rivulets rule out the  possibility of large-scale military actions in the area of  Brcko," he said.    The diplomat qualified the statement made in Cairo by  Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, and by the U.S.  secretary of State, Warren Christopher, as fundamentally  important. The two men called for taking immediate steps to  ease tensions and prevent offensive military actions in the area  of Brcko, and for withdrawing all troops from the fixed areas  around Gorazde."    Kozyrev and Christopher also called for immediately resuming  talks without preliminary conditions with a view to achieving a  comprehensive settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Letter: Open up Your report, 'ERM does not need reform, say central bankers' (April 13), states: 'The secretive (EC) monetary committee, which is unlikely to publish its analysis and recommendations, is believed to oppose significant changes.' Why should it be secretive? Why should not its analysis and recommendations be published? Are we allowed to know the names of the Titans who compose the committee?

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Tenneco to offer more shares in Case unit Tenneco, the diversified US industrial group, is to issue 15.6m more shares of its JI Case farm and construction equipment unit in a deal that will reduce Tenneco's holding in the company to less than 50 per cent. The share sale, which follows an initial public offering of Case's shares last June, is expected to net Tenneco about Dollars 320m, as well as Dollars 150m in cash benefits related to taxes. In the June offering, Tenneco sold 29 per cent of Case to the public at Dollars 19 a share, raising more than Dollars 380m. Case shares closed Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 20 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. The offering puts Tenneco in a race to reinvest the proceeds from the Case sales in a way that will replace Case's contributions to earnings. The second-largest farm equipment maker in the US, and the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of light and medium-sized construction machinery, Case had sales of nearly Dollars 4bn last year. During the fourth quarter, Case contributed Dollars 73m, or almost 20 per cent, of Tenneco's Dollars 363m operating income.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Japanese cabinet prepares for opening of rice market The cabinet yesterday adopted a plan to spend Y6,010bn (Dollars 62bn) to prepare rice farmers for the gradual opening of their market. The package, prepared by the three parties of the ruling coalition, clears the way for parliament to ratify the trade liberalisation bills needed to comply with the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Japan aims to ratify the Gatt accord in the present parliamentary session, ending on December 3. As part of the accord, a previous government agreed last year to import 4-8 per cent of its annual 10m tonne rice consumption over the next six years, and replace import quotas with tariffs some time after that. The farm aid package will be spent over the same period. The aid programme was criticised yesterday for failing to do enough to encourage large efficient farms, at the expense of traditional small paddy fields. The government is bargaining that the cash will at least compensate farmers for the opening of the rice market.</p>

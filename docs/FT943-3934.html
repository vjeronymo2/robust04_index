			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Tory chief admits 'yobs' gaffe was incompetent Mr Jeremy Hanley, Tory party chairman, agreed last night that questions had been raised about his competence for the job. The admission came after he had described a serious disturbance at a boxing tournament as 'just exuberance'. Senior Labour figures seized on the gaffe, which came only two days after Mr John Major, the prime minister, declared war on 'yob culture' and admitted that there was widespread fear in the community of crime and violence. Early yesterday morning Sir David Frost asked Mr Hanley on BBC television to comment on scenes at Saturday's super-middleweight bout in Birmingham between world champion Nigel Benn and Juan Carlos Gimenez of Paraguay. Chairs were thrown and several people were injured. Mr Frank Warren, the fight promoter, said that security had 'completely broken down' before the police arrived. Sir David asked Mr Hanley if the scenes in Birmingham had been an example of 'British yobs at work'. Mr Hanley, smiling broadly, replied: 'No, I think that sort of thing, you know, it's just exuberance . . .' He later described his comments as 'clearly an incompetent response'. Interviewed on Sky television, Mr Hanley admitted: 'Yes, as you say, it queries my competence.' He explained that he had not seen film of the events in Birmingham before Sir David had asked for his comments. Mr Hanley said: 'As soon as I saw the film I was absolutely horrified because it was exactly the sort of yobbish behaviour - indeed worse than that - that John Major was describing, and condemning quite rightly. Yes, I have made a mistake and I am very willing to apologise for it. This is completely my fault.' Later Conservative Central Office, of which Mr Hanley is head, denied that the chairman had admitted that his competence was in question. 'There is no question of Mr Hanley resigning or stepping down,' an official said. 'This was just a small mistake made on a television interview.' Mr David Blunkett, Labour party chairman, said: 'Mr Hanley's admission of his mistake and inexperience amply demonstrates John Major's mistake and continuing ineptitude in having appointed him to such a senior position in the Conservative party.'</p>

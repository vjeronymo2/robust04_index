			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (47): Handling data on 750,000 travel-related policies - User view MONDIAL Assistance (UK) is a fast-growing travel assistance company and its information technology (IT) systems must be able to cope with that growth, writes Michael Powell. The company markets a range of travel-related services, the best-known of which is its emergency breakdown cover. Mondial offers a 24 hours a day, seven days a week service to its clients, which is managed by a Sybase OLTP (see buzzwords, right) database. This keeps details of more than 750,000 policies, and allows access to that information when a customer calls in with an emergency. It was one of the first Sybase sites in the Britain. 'It was a bit unstable at first, but it is a good product now,' comments Richard Pemberton, information technology manager. 'We are happy with its client-server technology.' Mondial's business is entirely reliant on its computer system. To guard as much as possible against errors, the company has a back-up server system which, through the use of 'two phase commit' (see definition, below) is virtually a mirrored system, giving a 'hot back-up' - in the event of failure of the primary system, the second can be cut-in almost seamlessly to take over. Moreover, it allows back-up of data at any time, without needing to disable the on-line system. Mr Pemberton stresses the importance of an open systems strategy to Mondial - 'we chose Unix for expandability. We can strap on more disks almost seamlessly. We have already upgraded in a number of ways.' In a growing business, this allows the company always to have the appropriately-sized system for each phase of its business. Mondial's future plans are to use Sybase to develop a new travel business, which will include medical assistance. Mr Pemberton confirmed that all its future business systems will use it. BUZZWORDS Two phase commit: Any company intending to run more than one database, or using multiple hardware hosts, should be aware that database updating is not a simple process. A single transaction may need to update a number of records at a time. Moreover, when more than one processor is involved (as is the case in client-server and distributed databases) that transaction may need to interact with more than one, unsynchronised, processor. If there is a system failure at some point during this process, it may be impossible to tell how far each element in the transaction proceeded before this happened. One processor may have finished, another may be only part completed. In a single processor environment database management systems normally have the ability to 'roll back' or undo those transactions if necessary. In a multiple processor environment, more care is needed, since, to roll back the overall transaction, the system needs to know more information about each part of the transaction. For example, a personnel database could be distributed so that one processor held employee data, another departmental information. A user updating an employee's record might update both these databases with a single transaction. The fact that this update affected both databases would be quite transparent to the user. If the update started, and then a system failure occured before it completed, the departmental data update might have been completed, but the employee data may not. A conventional roll-back process would not return the department data to its previous state, although it would correct the employee information. Thus, the overall data would cease to be correctly synchronised. Two phase commit deals with this process in the following way: Firstly, a record is made of the transactions which will be performed on the various databases. This is a hard record which will be used, in the event of a failure of the actual transaction, to roll-back the individual database entries. Only when the various processors report that this information is successfully recorded is the second phase initiated. If the process fails during this first phase, no actual data has been recorded. Uncompleted first stage commit data will be cleared during the initial re-start, and have no further effect. The second phase consists of updating the actual databases. Only when each has reported that its update has happened successfully will the first stage data be removed. If a system failure happened at any point during this second stage, the first stage data is available to tell each processor how far to roll back. This ensures data integrity.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Anger at suggestion of 'moral obligation' BANKS and professional advisers to the Maxwell empire yesterday reacted with indignation to the suggestion that they have a moral obligation to help pensioners. However the National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, said yesterday that it will be the first to contribute to the government's voluntary trust fund to aid the Maxwell pensioners with a donation of Pounds 120,000 - a fraction of the hundreds of millions of pounds that the pension funds will require. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, announced on Monday the setting up of the voluntary trust into which financial institutions that had 'profited handsomely' from dealings with Maxwell companies 'might feel some moral obligation' to contribute. Ministers have been privately suggesting for months that both the pensions industry and the City financial institutions which had dealings with the late Robert Maxwell might help replace the pensioners' stolen funds. But the Financial Times yesterday contacted many of the institutions that did business with the Maxwell empire and found only one which said it would contribute to a voluntary fund - National Westminster Bank, which holds shares claimed by the pension funds. The chief executive of one large City bank said: 'It is out of the question that City institutions should dig in their pockets to help the pensioners. It is not our responsibility. The government has already damaged the reputation of the City internationally by suggesting there should be a begging bowl to help the pensioners.' He said that it was unlikely that any voluntary scheme to raise money from the City would work. Some City institutions regard the plight of the Maxwell pensioners as a problem which should be solved by the pensions industry. However the association has made clear that its members will not pick up the tab for the whole of the deficit. Mr Paddy Linekar, chief executive of M&amp;G Group, the fund managers, and chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers Association, said the association's view was that, while there was great sympathy for the pensioners' plight, it was up to individual members to decide whether to contribute. 'But speaking from M&amp;G's point of view, we wouldn't touch Maxwell with a barge-pole, and it seems a bit rich to ask us to cough up money.' Professional advisers to the Maxwell company pension schemes reacted with equal outrage at the suggestion that they aid pensioners. One adviser to the Maxwell pension schemes said: 'What about asking the people who clean the toilets at the Maxwell companies to contribute? After all, they benefited too. We were no different than they are.'</p>

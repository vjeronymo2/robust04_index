			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: SAN JOSE ST. STARTS LONG CLIMB BACK  </P> <P> With Nevada Las Vegas again representing the northern-most in basketball  quality, the big news in the Big West can be found at the southern end of the  standings.  </P> <P> There's a new worst team in the conference.  </P> <P> And its name isn't San Jose State.  </P> <P> That final score on the Bren Center scoreboard Thursday night -- San Jose 75,  UC Irvine 69 -- is for real. The basketball program that all but gave itself  the death penalty last season is not only fogging the mirror, but has a pulse  beating strong enough now to beat once-decent teams on their home court.  </P> <P> If this evening meant more heartburn for Irvine's Bill Mulligan, whose  incredible shrinking team is now 2-9, it meant history for San Jose.  </P> <P> For the first time since last Jan. 3, the Spartans won a conference game --  ending a streak of 17 consecutive Big West defeats.  </P> <P> For the first time since Jan. 14 of 1988, the Spartans won a conference game on  the road -- ending a 16-game streak.  </P> <P> And for the first time since the 1987-88 season, the Spartans can look down in  the conference standings and see another face staring back.  </P> <P> At 4-7, San Jose has become a genuine success story in this season in college  basketball.  </P> <P> About this time last year, the San Jose program was rocked by mutiny, with 10  players staging a midseason walkout and demanding the removal of then-head  coach Bill Berry. Berry stayed, long enough, at least, to finish 5-23 with a  patchwork roster of football players and team managers. But soon after the  season, he, too, was gone and former USC Coach Stan Morrison enlisted to build  anew.  </P> <P> If the cupboard inherited by Morrison wasn't entirely bare, it certainly gave  new meaning to the term San Jose spartan. Only three players made the  transition from spring to fall and when four of the Gang of Ten petitioned to  rejoin the team this October, Morrison decided to veto it and damn the  consequences.  </P> <P> "I did it for two reasons," Morrison says. "First, I did it in the best  interest of the (four) players. I didn't want them to be saddled with 10 tons  of bricks -- 'Oh, he's one of those guys.' At least this way, each of them can  continue their college experience without that hanging over them.  </P> <P> "Secondly, I couldn't give credence to that kind of action. You don't walk  away. That doesn't solve the problem. If you have a problem with a coach,  that's why schools have a campus ombudsman."  </P> <P> What Morrison was left with was a collection of guards as slow as they are  small and a crazy quilt of postmen candidates.  </P> <P> One, in fact, actually, was a post man. His name is Kenne Young. Last year, he  worked for the United Parcel Service. This year, Morrison calls him his best  player.  </P> <P> "Of our five postmen," Morrison says, "none of them played last year. Three  didn't even practice.  </P> <P> "One guy had a full-time job with UPS. One guy was a redshirt walk-on. Two guys  were Prop. 48 kids (academically ineligible). And the other played in high  school last year -- and was not a starter."  </P> <P> Morrison says he likes a challenge and sincerely wanted to get back into  coaching, but does anybody really miss anything this much?  </P> <P> "A friend of mine -- who shall go nameless -- saw a few of our first practices  and knew our schedule," Morrison said. "He told me, 'You can't win a game. Are  you ready for this?' "  </P> <P> Morrison wasn't sure. And for four games, neither were the Spartans, whose 0-4  start stretched the team's losing streak to 21 over two seasons. The school  record, 22, seemed destined to fall.  </P> <P> But on Dec. 11, San Jose stunned TCU, 70-69, and then came back with  back-to-back victories over Santa Clara and Idaho State. Three victories in a  row -- and a reason to believe.  </P> <P> "We're like an expansion team," Morrison says with a grin. "We have a few guys  we picked up on waivers -- and a few guys still on injured reserve."  </P> <P> Thursday's victory at the Bren Center was typical of the new San Jose style --  which, in itself, is anti-style. The Spartans don't do anything particularly  well except work up a sweat. But against Irvine, that was more than enough.  </P> <P> "You have to play -- and we played," Morrison said, groping for any kind of  compliment for the troops. "We played hard for 40 minutes. We didn't play  technically well for 40 minutes, but we played hard.  </P> <P> "I'm happy for the players. They deserved something to keep their heads up. . .  . Right now, the big thing is just to win a game. At home, on the road, in my  backyard -- it's a big deal, whenever we win."  </P> <P> Morrison estimates the rebuilding project will take "three to four years," so  patience will have to be a San Jose virtue. But, already, the Spartans have  matched their Big West victory total of last season and last place, at least  temporarily, has been vacated.  </P> <P> Do they know how to play in San Jose?  </P> <P> They're getting there, they're getting there.  </P></p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: SA Brewing makes headway SA BREWING, the Australian liquor and industrial group, yesterday revealed an increase of 11.3 per cent in interim net profits to ADollars 56m (USDollars 42m) and forecast a similar improvement in the second half. The Adelaide-based group said the improvement was caused by lower interest charges, cost-cutting, and the first full six-month contribution from Penfolds, the Australian wine-maker acquired last year. Mr Ross Wilson, chief executive, said he believed the second-half result would be 'similar,' but declined to forecast full-year profits because of uncertainty over Australia's economic outlook. 'Providing economic conditions do not deteriorate further, SA Brewing Group is confident of continuing to provide an above-average return to shareholders,' he declared. Mr Wilson said the group had seen no signs of an end to Australia's recession. He added that it did not expect an upturn in domestic economic activity until the beginning of 1993. However, he said the balance sheet was 'healthy' following a reduction in debt from ADollars 566m to ADollars 522m. The group was looking a several possible acquisitions, but no decisions had been made. The result, which was struck on a 7.8 per cent increase in sales to ADollars 1.04bn, was within analysts' expectations following significant cost-cutting, notably within the appliances division. The directors declared an unchanged interim dividend of 7.75 cents a share, fully franked. The shares closed 1 cent higher at ADollars 2.89 on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

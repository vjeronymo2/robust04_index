			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 10 (CTK) -- Although deciding at  its recent congress in Komarno, South Slovakia, to enter the  autumn general elections independently, the Slovak National  Party (SNS) does not reject cooperation with nationally and  Christian oriented parties, SNS Deputy Chairwoman Eva Slavkovska  told journalists today. However, SNS Chairman Jan Slota ruled  out cooperation with the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) led  by Jan Carnogursky, with ethnic Hungarian parties or the  Democratic Left Party (SDL) of Peter Weiss.    "I intentionally did not name Cernak's followers," Slota  stressed, referring to the National Democratic Party (NDS) of  Ludovit Cernak. According to Slota, the NDS, a faction which  split from the SNS, "is not a political entity."    Reacting to NDS representatives' participation in the KDH's  open election list of candidates, Slota stated that this was the  "alliance between the devil and the angel". "The strength of  freemasons is immense and whole of Western Europe is in their  grip," he added, referring to the KDH.</p>

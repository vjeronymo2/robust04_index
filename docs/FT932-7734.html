			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India lifts foodgrain production target THE INDIAN agriculture ministry has raised its foodgrain production target for 1993-94 to 188m tonnes, encouraged by indications that this year's south-west monsoon will arrive on time and that rain levels will be normal. Until recently the foodgrain production target was a subject of contention between the Planning Commission, which suggested a figure of 188m tonnes, and the agriculture ministry, which wanted it to be pegged at 183m tonnes. In addition to the monsoon hopes, the agriculture ministry has been induced to come round to the Planning Commission's view by a rise in the 1992-93 estimate from 177m tonnes to 180.3m. Few had expected that output would touch 180m tonnes as the monsoon broke late and there was drought in many parts. The restoration of subsidy on phosphatic fertiliser in response to pressure from the powerful farmers' lobby should make the increased production target attainable. The south-west monsoon, begining in June, is crucial for India's summer crop, which is bigger than the winter crop. Last year's summer foodgrain crop amounted to 101m tonnes. The Indian monsoon is considered normal if the rainfall is within 10 per cent of 88 cm; last year it was 77.4 cm. The Meteorological Department will this month issue a formal monsoon forecast.</p>

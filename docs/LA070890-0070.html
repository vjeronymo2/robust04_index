			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER'S ATTACK ON MANDELA TERMED SHAMEFUL  </P> <P> On June 26, the Orange County delegation, with but one exception, hid behind  the Orange Curtain and peeped out at Nelson Mandela in ignorance and fear.  </P> <P> Ignoring the honor bestowed upon Mandela by their peers in Congress, C.  Christopher Cox, William Dannemeyer, Robert Dornan and Ron Packard missed the  powerful and inspirational congressional address made by a man making history  in his country and our own.  </P> <P> You do not, gentlemen, represent this resident of the county. Your remarks on  the subject are an embarrassment, Willie Horton a ludicrous analogy.  </P> <P> Mandela cited American heroes and their deeds in the course of his speech. We  are indeed a proud nation -- brave, strong, and free. And make no mistake, we  have shed blood to protect our freedoms. We cannot claim the patience with  restrictions placed upon this freedom that has been endured by black South  Africa.  </P> <P> We must not fear the challenge to inequality and minority rule that inspired  our Declaration of Independence, or equate such a fight for freedom with  communism to lend legitimacy to our fears.  </P> <P> But, sadly, every coward has his yellow streak. And from behind the Orange  Curtain, it seems yellow and orange do make red.  </P> <P> EILEEN KANE  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Lloyd's loss review attacked MR STEPHEN MERRETT, deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, yesterday criticised a Lloyd's review into losses by one of his syndicates, Richard Lapper writes. The review was started in 1991 when losses from 1983, left open because of uncertainty about the eventual cost of claims, exceeded Pounds 19.6m. Syndicate 421, one of a number managed by Merrett Holdings, specialised in so-called long-tail business in which claims can occur many years after the policies' inception. Mr Merrett said in a letter to the 341 Names - individuals whose assets support the market: 'In our opinion the report produces virtually nothing that could be thought to be new and relevant information.' The Names face losses of Pounds 57,000 for each Pounds 10,000 traded. The review focused on the underwriting of seven run-off contracts, which generated most of the loss. Losses on the contracts, which reinsured other syndicates and insurance companies, initially arose from US asbestosis claims. The review says that 'the risks assumed resulted in Syndicate 421 having a substantial exposure to potential adverse developments on old years of account in respect of much older and larger syndicates, an effective concentration of risk into a new and small syndicate'. Mr Merrett said the review should have looked more specifically into the circumstances surrounding the deterioration of results in 1990, when claims from environmental pollution accounted for almost 90 per cent of a cash call for Pounds 5.6m. The Court of Appeal yesterday ruled that Lloyd's Names unable to pay their losses can sue their agents for negligence. Names originally won the case in the High Court in May.</p>

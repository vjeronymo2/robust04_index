			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Killing dents hopes of left in Brazil Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the left-wing politician who leads the opinion polls for Brazil's presidential election, due in November, is facing his first test in what threatens to be a dirty campaign, following the death last week of a Sao Paulo union leader. Mr Osvaldo Cruz Junior was shot four times in the back by a colleague in what seemed to be a personal argument about a plan by Mr Cruz to scale back the unions. But right-wing politicians and Brazil's media, largely controlled by figures of the centre and the right, have alleged a political motive for the killing and are using it to attack Mr da Silva, known popularly as Lula. The allegations stem from criticisms by Mr Cruz in November last of Brazil's largest union grouping, the CUT, which is the main backer of Lula's Workers Party (PT). Mr Cruz had claimed that CUT unions gave financial and other support to Lula's 1989 presidential campaign and to PT candidates in local elections in 1992. At the time, such support was illegal, but widely practised. Mr Cruz provided no proof and his allegations were strongly denied by the PT. Lula's opponents alleged Mr Cruz was killed to stop him making more damaging revelations about links between the CUT and the PT. TV Globo, the country's most popular television network, has changed its policy of ignoring Lula - despite his strong lead in the polls - and has focused on the case in detail his week. The right-wing Senator Espiridiao Amin, from the southern state of Santa Catarina, has used the controversy to call again for a special Congressional inquiry into the CUT and its funding. Such a probe, blocked because of its political sensitivity, now looks likely to go ahead, possibly this week. Mr Amin, like the mayor of Sao Paulo, Mr Paulo Maluf, is a member of the Progress and Reform Party. The mayor, with 12 per cent in the presidential polls, is the closest rival to Lula, who had about 30 per cent just before Christmas. An inquiry could be embarrassing for Lula and the PT. It is expected to last six months and would coincide with the official start of the presidential campaign in June. An investigation could also end the PT's so-called 'monoply of morality', which it has enjoyed since corruption allegations started to taint other Brazilian political parties last year.</p>

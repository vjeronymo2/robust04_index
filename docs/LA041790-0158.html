			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> CENTER FOR SENIORS MAY CLOSE DOORS  </P> <P> Crippled by mounting debts and a dwindling cash flow, a day-care center for the  elderly in Anaheim soon may be forced to close just 18 months after it opened.  </P> <P> The nonprofit Anaheim VIP Health Care Center is one of the few centers in the  North County that offer both medical assistance and social activities for  seniors.  </P> <P> Most of 24 clients of the center, situated in the northwestern corner of the  city, live with working relatives and need some place to spend their days. A  few live in board-and-care homes and visit the center a few days a week.  </P> <P> "I don't know where they would go if we close," said Shirley Cohen, executive  director of the Anaheim-based Feedback Foundation, the nonprofit organization  which operates the center. "It's more than just a place to park (seniors) for  the day."  </P> <P> Ethel Ward, 94, has been coming to the center every weekday since it opened.  She said she loves the activities and the food, and she plays the piano for the  others.  </P> <P> "It's a place where you meet people and you have friends," Ward said. "There's  a happy way about everybody here."  </P> <P> Ward's daughter, Carolyn Weigand, a visual arts instructor at Golden West  College, said she doesn't know where she would take her mother if the center  closes.  </P> <P> "I'm a real nit-picker, and I wouldn't take her anywhere that wasn't perfect,"  Weigand said. "This place is perfect -- it's happy, clean and it smells  wonderful."  </P> <P> Along with transportation to and from seniors' homes, meals and typical social  activities that most centers offer, the VIP Center also maintains a medical  care facility which offers physical and occupational therapy. A social worker  also is available to help clients research the various programs and benefits  available.  </P> <P> But late Medi-Cal reimbursements, clients with lower incomes and a lack of  donations have left officials of the 18-month-old center with little hope that  they can stay open beyond the next few months.  </P> <P> "We have focused where the needs are, but that's not where the bucks are," said  Shirleen Jones, the center's program director.  </P> <P> Most of the clients are Medi-Cal recipients, and that system is typically  sluggish with reimbursements, Jones said. In addition, the center offers a  sliding fee schedule, and most of those paying directly for the center are of  low income and pay less than the operating costs.  </P> <P> Jones said it costs about $50 a day per client to operate the center, but many  clients without Medi-Cal pay as little as $10 a day.  </P> <P> She said the center was established in Anaheim because of the lack of senior  day care centers with medical facilities in the North County. It now serves a  variety of seniors, from those who have suffered strokes or Alzheimer's disease  to those who simply want some daytime company and activity.  </P> <P> The foundation also operates a center in Santa Ana, which is facing less  serious financial difficulties, and runs the Meals on Wheels program,  distributing about 3,000 meals daily.  </P> <P> One other senior day-care center exists in Anaheim, but it does not offer  comparable medical care. The city has plans to establish an additional senior  care facility.LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

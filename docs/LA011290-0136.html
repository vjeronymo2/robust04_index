			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD AEROSPACE EXECUTIVES MEET TO WEIGH FIRM'S FUTURE  </P> <P> Top executives at Ford Aerospace are meeting today at company headquarters in  Newport Beach, and Donald Rassier, president of the firm, is expected to  discuss the company's sale -- in whole or part -- by parent Ford Motor Co.  </P> <P> Company sources said the early-morning meeting will include all the top  executives of the defense and space company, and officials including Rassier  will then fly to the Bay Area to meet with managers at the firm's facilities in  the Silicon Valley.  </P> <P> Word of the impending sale of the company began to emerge in late December, and  reports last week indicated that a final decision would be made by Ford  directors at a board meeting Thursday.  </P> <P> The company has declined to comment on the reports, and no announcement was  made after the board meeting. Ford's stock climbed 50 cents to $45 in trading  on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Ford Aerospace has revenue of about $2 billion and says it is profitable,  though Ford does not provide financial information about the subsidiary. The  Aeronutronics division in Newport Beach manufactures tactical weapons systems,  including the Sidewinder and Chapparal heat-seeking missiles, and employs 2,700  people.  </P> <P> Pentagon budget cuts are expected to result in hard times for many defense  contractors, and analysts say Ford is eager to marshal its resources in the  face of intensifying international competition in the automobile business.  </P> <P> Chrysler announced recently that it would sell its defense operations, though  General Motors has said it has no intention of shedding its huge Hughes  Aircraft unit.  </P> <P> Wolfgang Demisch, a defense analyst at UBS Securities, said "it would be  logical" for Ford to sell its defense business, noting that the firm had made a  major commitment in buying Jaguar and was generally facing a tough auto market.  </P> <P> But analysts note that it might be difficult to sell a defense business in the  current climate: "Who would want to buy them? Who would want to buy any defense  contractor now?," asked Michael Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense consultant.  </P> <P> Analysts speculate that Ford Aerospace might fetch anywhere from $1.5 billion  to $2 billion, and the list of companies commonly cited as possible buyers  includes Boeing, Martin Marietta, TRW, Rockwell, Hughes and Lockheed. Foreign  firms, especially Alcatel of France, might also be interested, though they  could run into political problems because 70% of Ford Aerospace's business is  with the U.S. military.  </P> <P> Ford might also choose to sell some segments of the business on its own, or  spin off parts of the unit to management or shareholders, analysts said.  </P> <P> In addition to the weapons division based in Newport Beach, Ford Aerospace has  satellite manufacturing, ground systems, and satellite tracking and control  operations in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. It also does engineering and support  work for the NASA space center in Houston, and manages training ranges for the  military out of its technical support division in Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> In 1988, Ford Aerospace bought BDM Inc., a Washington-area defense consulting  and engineering organization, for $425 million in what some had believed was an  indication of renewed commitment to the defense business.  </P> <P> Some analysts suggest that a buyer might keep some pieces of the business and  sell others, since the divisions operate on an independent basis.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHIVE CORP. REPORTS 39% RISE IN PROFITS FOR FIRST QUARTER  </P> <P> Archive Corp., a Costa Mesa manufacturer of tape drives for computers, said it  earned $3.2 million for the first quarter ended Dec. 30, a 39% increase over  last year's profits of $2.3 million.  </P> <P> Sales rose 36% during the quarter, to $36 million from $26.5 million last year.  </P> <P> The company said it had finished buying back 1 million shares of stock during  the quarter because it believes that the tape drive market will grow faster  than the overall computer market.  </P> <P> Tape drives convert information stored on computer tapes to signals a computer  can use.  </P> <P> Archive said it had also cut costs during the quarter to improve its gross  margin, a measure of efficiency obtained by subtracting the cost of the  products from sales revenues.  </P> <P> The company also began selling products for the Apple Computer Macintosh market  for the first time during the quarter.  </P> <P> Archive announced earlier this week that it had signed a multi-million-dollar  agreement with H. Ross Perot, who will invest in the development of new  products at the company.  </P> <P> Archive said the prospects for the remaining three quarters of its fiscal year  are "excellent."

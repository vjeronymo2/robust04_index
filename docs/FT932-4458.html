			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Letter: Water companies require price rises for investment Sir, The privatised water companies do not finance their diversification ventures from the profits of their main water businesses, as Mr Shutt (Letters, June 8) mistakenly believes. Nor are they permitted to do so. In raising funds for such ventures, the financial strength of the main businesses is undoubtedly important. But so will the technical and other experience gained from other ventures be helpful to the main water businesses. As regards what Mr Shutt calls the 'tax' on their customers, the water companies are well advanced with a Pounds 30bn investment programme. This will improve the security of water supplies. It will also enable them to meet very demanding EC environmental requirements, both in the quality of drinking water and the handling of waste. Investment on this scale could not be accomplished by less profitable enterprises. Nor, unfortunately, can it be achieved without price rises above the level of inflation. Janet Langdon, director and secretary, Water Services Association, 1 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9BT</p>

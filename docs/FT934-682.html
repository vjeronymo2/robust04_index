			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Observer: Banking habits What kind of company can spend eight months looking for a new chief executive only to decide it doesn't need one after all? Judging by the 5 per cent jump in merchant banker Kleinwort Benson's share price yesterday, the stock market has fallen for its odd excuse that it didn't want to risk breaking up a 'winning team' by bringing in an outsider. Instead, the job of managing a business of 2,800 people is going to be done by a new 'senior management structure' consisting of an executive chairman, a deputy chairman, two vice-chairmen, two joint chief executives of investment banking and the chief executive of investment management. The press release contains no mention of the finance director, operations director and the directors in charge of banking and the balance sheet. Nevertheless, Lord Rockley, the new chairman, assures Observer that they will continue to play a key role. The failure to find a chief executive wouldn't matter so much if Kleinwort had done its shareholders proud. But since Big Bang, its shares have underperformed the market by 40 per cent while Schroders' and Warburgs' have outperformed handsomely. It would be nice to think that Kleinwort's management might be subject to the same sort of awkward questioning as any other business in a similar state.</p>

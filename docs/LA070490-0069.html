			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSED DUMP'S EFFECT ON WATER SOURCE PROMPTS PACKARD LETTER TO EPA  </P> <P> In a letter co-signed by three state legislators, U.S. Rep. Ronald Packard  (R-Carlsbad) is asking the federal Environmental Protection Agency to study  what damage a proposed county landfill in Fallbrook might do to the area's  ground water.  </P> <P> Packard said he is concerned that contaminants from the landfill might seep  into the adjacent Rainbow Creek and flow into the Santa Margarita River, which  provides 70% of the drinking water for neighboring Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps base relies exclusively on underground water for drinking and  agricultural uses.  </P> <P> Packard said that, based on discussion with Camp Pendleton's water hydrologists  and a review of the county's draft environmental impact report, "we have  concerns that the (EIR) report may not properly address ground-water protection  measures."  </P> <P> "It is clear that failure of any or all ground-water protection measures  proposed (in the county's EIR) would result in grave consequences for Camp  Pendleton and San Diego County," Packard wrote.  </P> <P> The letter is expected to be sent to the EPA on Thursday, said John Weil,  Packard's administrative assistant.  </P> <P> The letter is co-signed by state Assemblyman Bob Frazee (R-Carlsbad) and Sen.  Marion Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), whose districts include Camp Pendleton and  Fallbrook, as well as state Sen. Bill Craven (R-Carlsbad), whose district  neighbors Pendleton to the south.  </P> <P> The Fallbrook landfill site is one of three being considered by county  officials to take much of North County's trash into the next century. The other  two candidate sites are Gregory Canyon, alongside the San Luis Rey River and  California 76, just east of Interstate 15, and Blue Canyon, along California 79  near Warner Springs.  </P> <P> Opponents also have criticized the selection of the other two sites for a  variety of reasons, including possible ground-water contamination and increased  traffic.  </P> <P> Already, the San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water  District, which provide wholesale water to the county's water districts, have  opposed the Fallbrook dump site, along Aspen Road just west of I-15, because it  sits astride four water transmission lines that deliver 90% of the county's  water from the north.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps has gone on record opposing the Fallbrook site because of  fears that its source of water might be tainted by garbage contaminants that  could seep from the landfill and into the nearby river.  </P> <P> County officials have maintained that the landfill could be constructed with a  bottom liner of clay and composite material in such a way that toxins could not  escape the landfill and enter the ground water.  </P> <P> But Packard said he's not so sure, and wants the EPA to study the issue.  </P> <P> "Camp Pendleton is self-contained in terms of water, and does a magnificent job  of managing its water," Packard said. "To run the risk of contaminating that  very source of water would be a tragic mistake.  </P> <P> "I recognize the dilemma of finding landfill sites, but when it comes to  ground-water resources, it would be very short-sighted to contaminate that  life-saving resource."  </P> <P> An EPA spokeswoman in San Francisco said the agency could not respond to  Packard's request until it received the letter.  </P> <P> "But we'll take a look at it to see what the congressman is asking us to do,"  said Ida Tolliver of the EPA.  </P> <P> Packard said he isn't concerned that the EPA's study might further delay the  county's efforts to select and develop a landfill in North County.  </P> <P> "I'm not trying to stick up impediments and stumbling blocks," he said. "And  I'm not opposing landfills. But I want to make certain we don't destroy our  water supplies. This shouldn't be railroaded through. It's far better to study  this now than to plunge ahead and have to live with a major, major problem for  decades. I'm not one for studying things to death, but when it comes to  something as critical as water, we can't be too careful."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has sent the  following congratulatory message to His Excellency President  Francois Mitterrand of the French Republic which reads:    Mr. President and dear friend,    We have learned with great satisfaction the French  Government's historic decision to dispatch troops to Rwanda to  provide humanitarian aid and to ensure peace there after the  two-month-old massacres resulting from the ethnic war in that  African country. This decision, Mr. President, is not at all  surprising to my government as it is in response to the  imperative need to preserve international peace as advocated by  the United Nations, whose (?fundamental) principles have always  been France's objective.    I would like to express to your excellency my government's  unflinching support for and solidarity with the French  Government in its efforts to save human lives in Rwanda. This  initiative should be supported unconditionally by the entire  international community.    Please accept, Mr. President and dear friend, the expression  of my sincerest support and solidarity as well as my kindest  regards.    For a better Equatorial Guinea.    [Signed] President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.

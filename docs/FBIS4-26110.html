Carter told reporters after meeting with U.S. Administration  officials at the White House that as far as he was concerned,  "there are no unanswered questions" following his talks with  DPRK leaders on how to resolve the unclear crisis.    Carter, who returned from the DPRK on Saturday [18 June],  had  about two-hour meetings at the White House with National  Security Adviser Tony Lake, Assistant Secretary of State Robert  Gallucci, Assistant Secretary of State for Asia Winston Lord and  other officials.    Before speaking to reporters, Carter talked by telephone for  about half an hour with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is  spending the weekend at Camp David.    "I personally believe that the crisis is over," Carter said,  "and I personally believe that Kim Il-song wants to be sure that  the crisis is over."    "I personally don't see any need to proceed with the  sanctions unless there is some violation of the agreement I have  received," Carter stressed.    Carter said he expected the third round of talks between the  U.S. and the DPRK could be arranged within the next few weeks  and that confirmation of the latest agreements through  diplomatic channels could get under way as soon as this week.    "It may well be that President Carter has brought back  something upon which we can build and defuse the situation,"  Gallucci told reporters after Carter left the White House.    He said the Clinton administration would move as quickly as  possible to meet with DPRK officials and discuss the proposals  brought back by Carter.    However, Lake said that the United States's efforts to  obtain  sanctions against the DPRK would only be suspended after formal  talks between the two countries begin.    "In the meantime," Lake said, "we are continuing to consult  on the sanctions" at the United Nations.</p>

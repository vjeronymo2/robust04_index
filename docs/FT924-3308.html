			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Bucking The Trend: Precision approach to following the market - An engineering group's recovery STAINLESS Metalcraft seems to have experienced the economic cycle the wrong way round. In the second half of the 1980s, when many were enjoying what some regarded as an economic miracle, company profits were plummeting. Now, in the depths of recession, profits are rising sharply. As if to commemorate the reverse, the company is changing its name of Ferraris. That may not strike a chord among the few who trade its shares on the unlisted securities market, but the cognoscenti of the medical equipment market will recognise it. So will those who use its asthma monitoring equipment. More than that, the new name is testimony that the company has manoeuvred itself into the medical equipment sector, dropping, for example, general engineering. Mr Kenneth Baker, the chairman, said: 'You attack a market which is there, rather than one which is disappearing.' Mr Baker cut his professional teeth at Metal Box and subsequently worked in US, German and other British groups. In the financial year to last August, Stainless Metalcraft, having made losses in three of the four preceding years, had pre-tax profits of Pounds 353,000. There should be more this year, and the company has Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, helping it in a search for acquisitions. Mr Baker said the losses were the result of 'a self-inflicted wound'. Stainless Metalcraft was a sub-contractor to a sub-contractor on a storage system for British Nuclear Fuels' waste. It was an unusually big contract for the company: the work was delivered on time, but obtaining payment turned into a welter of argument and arbitration. By the time the matter was settled, the management had become hardened to adversity and the recession had started. Stainless Metalcraft felt it early, 'when people started to reduce capital spending, which was our area of business', as Mr Baker put it. The company's strategy was, in short, 'to get out of metal bashing' and to develop the company along the lines of precision engineering 'with wider shareholdings and wider interests', Mr Baker said. The wider shareholdings meant diluting the interest of the Childs family, which now stands at 25 per cent. The development meant driving the company into higher-value-added, higher-technology products in the medical equipment area. Ferraris Instruments had been bought in 1986. Production settled at sites in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire - which generates about 70 per cent of turnover - Kettering, in Northamptonshire; north London; and Ohio in the US. 'All through the recession, the company has continued to invest in production equipment and the development of new products,' said Mr Baker. There has been concentration on 'improving productivity by improving methods of manufacturing in conjunction with our major customers.' The biggest customer is Oxford Magnet Technology, part of Oxford Instruments, for which Stainless Metalcraft has been making components for scanners and co-operating on design and manufacturing techniques. The result has been that the value of output for each Stainless Metalcraft employee has risen over the past three years from Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 58,000 a year. There is another side: as is usually the case with manufacturing investment, the more that is invested, the less the employment. At Chatteris 150 people are employed; in 1988 there were 350. Further, the company is on a financial tightrope. There are no complaints in the boardroom about banks. 'We needed a lot of support to enable us to stand our corner,' Mr Baker said. They still do. Support came from Barclays, with generous overdraft and loan facilities, as the percentage of debt relative to net assets went up from 70 in 1989, to 95 in 1990, and then to 154 last year, before coming down to 98 this year. Ferraris, then, has to keep a steady balance to stay on the tightrope. Still, there is some stability in the medical equipment market. Demand has kept up, in spite of the recession, but, Mr Baker said, 'there is pressure to keep down prices. If you can maintain your competitiveness, you can maintain your market share.'</p>

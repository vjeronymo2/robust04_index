			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Dumas placing proposals as losses increase DUMAS Group, the USM-quoted food manufacturer which requested the suspension of its shares last July pending financial clarification, has announced proposals for a placing to raise up to Pounds 2m and a reorganisation and reduction of capital. The company also reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 970,000 for the year to January 31 1992 against profits of Pounds 34,000 and further losses of Pounds 847,000 (Pounds 162,000) in the six months to July 1992. The directors propose to subdivide each existing 10p ordinary share into one share of 2p and one deferred share of 8p. They propose to cancel the deferred shares and reduce the share premium account to eliminate the deficit on the profit and loss account. The plans also include a placing of 938,750 cumulative redeemable 6 per cent preference shares of Pounds 1 each at par and of up to 22.22m new ordinary 2p shares at 5p. A change of name to John Lusty Group will also be put to shareholders. On completion of the share issues, Mr Arne Bergbrant will stand down as chief executive but will continue as non-executive chairman. A number of other management changes will also take place. Mr Bergbrant said that despite the disappointing results he was convinced that following the proposed refinancing the company would be in a position to capitalise on its potential. Losses per share for the year to January amounted to 15.34p (0.34p earnings) while for the six months period losses were 7.29p (3.71p).</p>

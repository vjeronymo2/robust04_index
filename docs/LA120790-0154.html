			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DAVIS RULES' BUMPS 'CLASS' FROM ABC ROSTER  </P> <P> ABC put its struggling sitcom "Head of the Class" on indefinite hiatus Thursday  to make room for another classroom comedy, "Davis Rules," starring Randy Quaid  as an unconventional grammar school educator named Dwight Davis.  </P> <P> "Davis Rules" will premiere Jan. 8 at 8:30 p.m. "Head of the Class" will have  its last 1990 broadcast Dec. 28.  </P> <P> "Davis Rules," the latest series from Carsey-Werner, also stars Jonathan  Winters.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, NBC said Thursday that Bridget and Jerome Dobson, creators of "Santa  Barbara," will return to the soap opera as head writers and creative production  executives.  </P> <P> The Dobsons were fired in September, 1987, after disputes over creative control  with NBC and New World Television -- particularly over whether the Dobsons had  the right to fire one of the show's staff writers. Lawsuits and counter-suits  were filed. An NBC spokesman confirmed that those suits have since been settled  out of court.  </P> <P> John Conboy, hired as executive producer after the Dobsons' departure, will  continue in that capacity.

Fortunately, the local  governments rapidly put the grain in stock on the markets, and  quickly brought the grain prices under control, and the wave of  panic purchases did not spread any further. However, this  aroused people's serious attention to the price tendency this  year.    This year is of crucial importance for the in-depth  development of economic structural reform in the mainland, so it  is called a "reform year." Taxation, banking, company,  investment, foreign exchange, price, housing, and wage reform  measures will put into practice. Reform will advance more  deeply, more broadly, more intensively and with greater  difficulty than in previous years. The unstable factors that  existed latently over a long time may become more intense.  Therefore, the authorities will strive to keep prices stable  and bring inflation under strict control. This will be a major  guarantee for reform's success.    In fact, the panic grain purchasing appearing late last year  was an event beyond the expectation of the authorities. Last  year, grain production decreased in Hebei because of the serious  drought, and also decreased by nearly 10 percent in Guangdong  because the construction of factories and the development of  real estate projects used too much farmland. However, grain  production in the whole country still increased by over 10  billion kilograms, and there should be no shortage in the  markets. According to analysts, the substantial grain price  increases and the panic grain purchases in Beijing, Guangzhou,  Fuzhou, and other cities late last year were mainly caused by  some psychological factors: First, as the central authorities  decided to increase grain prices in 1994, peasants were not  willing to sell the grain on hand. Second, the local  authorities did not take effective measures for regulating and  controlling the supply of grain after grain transactions became  free. Third, the masses misunderstood the reform measures put  into practice in 1993, especially the reform of the taxation  system, and thought that the new taxation system would certainly  bring about price increases. So they rushed to buy grain,  cooking oil, and other foodstuffs in order to preserve the value  of their income.    Although the recent grain price hike was mainly caused by  psychological and speculative factors, the phenomenon also  reflected people's fear of price hikes and inflation, and  indicated that society's ability to endure inflation might have  been overestimated. Now, the common people have become more  sensitive to and more fearful of inflation. Therefore, it is  necessary to carefully consider and decide the timing of  adopting the new reform measures and to pay close attention to  price tendencies. Otherwise, when the major reform measures are  put into practice this year, they may bring some shocks to  society and became a factor leading to economic and social  instability.    In fact, the retail prices in the mainland increased by 13  percent last year, and the costs of living in 35 large and  medium- sized cities increased by 20 percent. The rate of  inflation has caused a considerable pressure on the livelihood  of salary earners. According to the decision of the central  authorities, in 1994 the national economy will maintain  "sustained, rapid, and healthy" [chi xu kuai su jian kang 6688  4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development, and GNP will grow by  about 9 percent over 1993. Although this growth rate will be  somewhat lower than the 1993 figure of 13 percent, it is  expected that economic growth, as well as the size of  investment, in the first few months of this year will remain at  a high level, and it will be hard to effect the so-called  economic "soft landing." In addition, as tariff rates for  imported goods will be lowered, more high-priced imported goods  will pour into China; the potential credit demand will increase  after the exchange rate of renminbi was unified; and the prices  of some energy and farm products will be further increased. All  this may lead to a sharp increase in the inflation rate.    This shows that the task of macro-control that the central  government is facing this year will still be rather arduous. If  the intensity of economic regulation and control is appropriate  and effective in restraining the rise of the general price  level, then there will be no major market fluctuations. On the  contrary, however, if prices increase too rapidly, it will be  hard to prevent a high inflation situation, and a vicious cycle  may also come into being. Reportedly to prevent too serious an  unfavorable impact on the market and on the people's daily  lives, the central authorities have decided to strive to keep  this year's price increase index at a level below 10 percent and  to adopt such measures as increasing wages and allowances and  increasing peasants' income in order to offset this year's grain  and other price increases to guarantee that the people will  enjoy solid benefits in the course of reform.    Not long ago, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji stressed that  stabilizing grain prices and restraining inflation will be the  key to the smooth advances of reform in 1994. This showed that  the Chinese top leaders were soberly aware of the importance of  keeping the balance between reform and stability.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / At least five Somalis die as US troops open fire The chequered history of the failed US effort to restore stability to Somalia took another violent turn yesterday when US marines opened fire near a food distribution centre in Mogadishu, killing and wounding several Somalis. A US official said the marines, who were escorting US diplomats to a meeting with representatives of General Mohammed Farah Aidid, a Somali clan leader, were first fired on by at least two Somali gunmen. This account was not corroborated by a nearby detachment of Bangladeshi troops, and was contradicted by Somali witnesses who said US troops fired directly at the crowd. At least five Somalis were reported to have died in the incident. President Bill Clinton has set a March 31 deadline for the withdrawal of US troops. That withdrawal was ordered in response to criticism in the US Congress after 18 US soldiers were killed last October during a raid intended to capture allies of Gen Aidid. The United Nations has sketched out plans for a reduced international force of around 15,000 after the US withdrawal, with most of the troops deployed in the more settled areas outside Mogadishu. However, UN officers predict the peacekeepers will increasingly come under attack from gunmen seeking to test the resolve of remaining troops. US officials have acknowledged they are not hoping for much more than 'a sort of rough and ready coexistence' between the rival Somali clan leaders after the US troop withdrawal. Mr Clinton is expected to ask Congress in next week's budget for another Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m) to wrap up the US involvement in Somalia, bringing the overall cost since US troops first landed in December 1992 to more than Dollars 1bn.</p>

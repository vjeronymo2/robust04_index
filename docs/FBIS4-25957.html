			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China has issued a set  of industrial policies to guide the development of key economic  sectors in the last few years of the 20th century, a senior  government official announced here today.    Under the policies, China will, through industrial  restructuring, pinpoint the development of agriculture,  infrastructure and basic industries, electronics and machinery,  petroleum and petro-chemicals, trade, as well as the auto and  building industries, said Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State  Planning Commission, at a press conference.    Ye said that the "framework of national industrial policy in  the 1990s (FNIP)", worked out by the State Council, China's  highest governing body, laid down important policies on the  direction and targets of the country's structural adjustment in  the 1990s.    He said China encourages direct foreign investment in  infrastructure and basic industries. Investors in the transport  sector are expected to be given first priority in developing  real estate along the facilities they build.    To promote trigger industries, China will increase input  into  technological advancement in electronics and machinery, oil and  petro-chemicals, automobile and building industries. Those  sectors will also enjoy priority in issuing bonds and shares, Ye  said.    China will also readjust import tariffs in accordance with  the industrial policies to boost foreign trade, he said.    Under the just-issued policies, the vice-minister said,  China  will also rationalize the industrial organization, promote  technological upgrading, adjust economic location, continue to  develop service sectors, and accelerate the growth of hi-tech  industries.    According to Ye, the State Council will, in the near future,  spell out specific policies for such infrastucture and key  industries as transport, telecommunications, construction,  electronics and machinery, petro-chemical industry, foreign  trade, foreign investment and technology, so as to speed up  development of those sectors.</p>

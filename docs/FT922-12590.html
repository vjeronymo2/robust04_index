			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / City fraud squad arrests investment company director MR Kenneth Renton, a director of Wentworth Investment Services, was arrested at Heathrow yesterday by the City of London Fraud Squad, in connection with the alleged disappearance of Pounds 4.5m from four investors, according to Fimbra, the financial advisers' self-regulatory body. The City fraud squad said Mr Renton was helping police with their inquiries. Fimbra said that from yesterday it had suspended authorisation for Mr Renton to conduct investment business and the authorisation of Wentworth Investment Services. Other Wentworth directors were said to have been unaware that Mr Renton had been conducting investment business for the four investors. Fimbra called in the squad on Tuesday after hearing from four investors that Mr Renton had not been seen at his office at King Street in the City since Friday. The four had tried to obtain refunds from him. Mr Renton was a senior fund manager with the Tyndall banking and fund management group during the 1970s. In 1975 he helped the Bank of England sell its controlling interest in Mount Charlotte Investments, the hotels group, which the Bank had taken over from Slater Walker. Mr Renton became a director of Mount Charlotte shortly after and only resigned in October 1990 after the company was taken over by Brierley Investments. A review of the firm's records did not reveal records of the four investors seeking refunds and Fimbra called in the police. Fimbra is trying to determine if other investors placed funds with Wentworth Investment Services or with Mr Renton personally. Wentworth was admitted to Fimbra in March 1989 under so-called category three, allowing it to advise upon and arrange transactions in any investment business, so long as the investment was in readily realiseable investments through a regulated dealer. Mr Renton was also listed as a director of Waverley Fund Management, unit trust and investment managers.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SIX NEW WORKS PLAYED AT DOMINGUEZ HILLS  </P> <P> An admirable amount of expertise and polish marked the performance of six new  works presented Saturday night at the University Theater, Cal State Dominguez  Hills. Members of the Almont Ensemble and others gave insightful readings of  compositions that succeeded as provocative examples of various conservative  idioms.  </P> <P> A precise and carefully executed atonal style made North Carolina composer J.  Mark Scearce's "Five Poems in a Letter" for chamber quintet a wonder of complex  harmonies and melodic lines. Oboist Michael Ericson projected the prominent  solo part with bravura.  </P> <P> Charles Dvorak's "The Bones of the Greeks" supplied soprano Susan Judy and  guitarist Stuart Fox an opportunity to display a fitting neo-Renaissance  sensibility.  </P> <P> The world premiere of Marshall Bialosky's "Two Against One," for clarinet,  viola and piano, proved ambitious and satisfyingly complex, exemplifying the  composer's ability to work with an abstract idea. Nick Ariondo's "Matsuri  (Festival)" for accordion and piano synchronized sweeping tonal melodies  between the two keyboards, creating quirky if not comedic moments.  </P> <P> A neo-classic Piano Suite by Barbara Bennett gave pianist Charlotte Zelka an  opportunity to demonstrate her steady, comprehensive approach. Carlos  Rodriguez's relatively familiar Five Movements for Solo Amplified/Processed  Flute demonstrated an equally satisfying mix of technology and flute  techniques. GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

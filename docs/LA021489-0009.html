			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENTRAL CITY WEST  </P> <P> Any "big plans" for downtown's Central City West must include some  acknowledgement of its historic importance to Los Angeles ("Downtown  Neighborhood Awakening to Big Plans," Part I, Feb. 3). Oil from beneath this  neighborhood fueled the city's first industrial boom in the 1890s, and provided  hundreds of men and women with the opportunity to "strike it rich." Even though  the area's distinctive wooden derricks are gone, the mix of Victorian houses  and oil wells remains largely intact today, and the wells are still maintained  by family-run operators.  </P> <P> If Councilwoman Gloria Molina and her constituents proceed with foresight,  Central City West will be not only a nice place to live, but also a poignant  reminder of Los Angeles' modest beginnings.  </P> <P> DRUMMOND BUCKLEY  </P> <P> Palms  </P></p>

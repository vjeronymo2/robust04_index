			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 30 (AFP) -- Asia's "Dragons" will be  spitting fire over the next 18 months, with growth in their  economies picking up steam to reach a rate of nearly 7.0 percent  through 1995, the OECD said Thursday [30 June].    The main risk to their outlook now is inflation, the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  warned.    For the six Dynamic Asian Economies (DAEs) -- Korea, Hong  Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand -- are growing at  a pace barely below their estimated potential or capacity for  growth, it argued.    Forecasting average GDP growth of 6.9 percent in the six  economies both this year and in 1995, up from 6.4 percent last  year and 5.8 percent in 1992, it said the downtrend in annual  expansion that began in the DAEs in 1987 was clearly reversed  last year.    OECD projections put Malaysia in the lead with growth rates  of 8.4 percent in 1994 and 8.0 percent in 1995.    Next came Thailand (8.2 percent both years), Singapore (8.0  and 7.0 percent), Korea (7.0 percent both years), Taiwan (6.0  and 6.5 percent), and Hong Kong (5.5 and 5.0 percent).    Noting with a streak of envy that their 1993 growth was  "higher even than in OECD countries that were experiencing a  recovery," the OECD's semi-annual Economic Outlook said the  DAEs' trade performance was boosted by three factors.    First, domestic demand growth in China and in the DAEs  themselves was "very strong."    Second, recovery in the United States and other  English-speaking industrial countries increased demand for their  exports.    And third, the DAEs competitive position was improved by the  appreciation of the Japanese yen.    As an example, the OECD said the Korean car, steel and  telecommunications industries cashed in heavily on the yen's  rise.    They won large market shares in developing Asian economies,  especially in China, which almost doubled imports from Korea in  1993.    Pointing out that trade among the DAEs now accounts for  nearly 20 percent of their overall exports, the OECD said their  forecast brisk growth of output in 1994-95 could keep imports of  manufactures growing by some 10-11 percent, the same rates as in  1993.    This further boost to intra-regional trade could keep the  "Dragons'" combined current account balance broadly unchanged  after last year's rise to a surplus of just over 4 billion  dollars.    The OECD said that over the next 18 months, "the main forces  driving growth (in the DAEs) last year should continue to  operate, or even strengthen."    "As recovery gets under way in Japan and Europe, export  market growth for the countries in the area could rise to around  8.0 percent, permitting their export volumes to rise again by 10  percent or so," it said.    At the same time, domestic economic policies should continue  to have an "overall stimulative effect" throughout the area.    Monetary policy was eased last year in most of these  countries, helping to sustain buoyant domestic demand.    But the OECD said a tightening was probable if inflation  were  to accelerate beyond the projected average of 5.5 percent for  1994-95.    It said an uptrend in prices could be strengthened by such  factors as the acceleration of growth "to virtually its  potential rate," a high level of capacity utilization, and  special developments in some countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Political Department of the Croatian Army's  Split operational zone issued a statement today in connection  with yesterday's explosion in the military munitions depot at  Kukuzovac, near Sinj, in which two Croatian Army soldiers were  killed and one was wounded. The statement says that, following  an investigation, a commission established that mines and  explosive devices were stored in the depot in line with the  regulations on keeping and storing such devices, so that the  explosion did not spread. The statement also stresses that the  explosion occurred outside the warehouse, and was caused when an  explosive device of an unidentified type fell on the ground,  most probably during transport. The device damaged about 20  other mines. The Army's investigating judge is continuing the  inquiry into the incident.</p>

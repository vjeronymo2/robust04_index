			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / University clearing opens with arts course squeeze THE CLEARING system for UK universities starts today with indications that rejections of candidates for arts courses have been significantly higher than last year. But the Polytechnic Central Admissions System reported that two 'E' grades - the lowest grade of A-level pass - would be sufficient to gain entry into many science and engineering courses. Mr Tony Higgins, chief executive of PCAS, said: 'The absence of arts and social science courses is striking. But the place is seething with science and engineering courses.' He added that admissions tutors for arts subjects had had to adopt much stricter criteria. 'In normal years admissions tutors have three piles - yes, maybe and no. This year they need to be much more decisive, and the only piles are yes and no.' The Universities Central Council on Admissions (Ucca), which will merge with PCAS later this year, reported that more courses were still open than at the same stage last year, although vacancies in arts subjects were restricted to combined courses. It predicted that more applicants would qualify for clearing this year, leading to a higher proportion of ultimate rejections. The total number of students accepted by Ucca members, which exclude the old polytechnics, could slightly exceed that for last year. University vice-chancellors, who have lobbied intensively in the past week for the government to direct more funds to higher education - possibly by requiring students to take out loans - said that changes in government funding were to blame for the problem. The government has cut the fees which it pays universities for tuition in arts courses. The Committee for Vice-Chancellors and Principals said: 'Given the government's very clear insistence that it doesn't want to see the expansion continue for the time being, universities feel bound to be strict. They won't be able to offer alternative courses to applicants who miss out narrowly any more.' Yesterday the committee stepped up this campaign by calling for the government to increase 'access funds' for students, and to rename them 'hardship funds'. It said: 'They have no effect on access to higher education, since payment is not made until the student is registered. They are no more than a rather inadequate safety net.' Applications by students rose by 15 per cent between 1990-91 and 1991-92, but available funds rose by only 4 per cent. The committee suggested that funds should also be made available out of term, because vacation jobs were hard to find and students could no longer claim benefits. Total access funds in 1992-93 were Pounds 19.17m. The committee's efforts to blame the government for the sharp fall in the supply of arts and humanities places available through clearing seem, so far at least, to have found no resonance among Tory backbenchers. Mr James Pawsey, chairman of the party's backbench education committee, said he was 'a little disappointed' by the committee's attitude, given the expansion of higher education and the resources available for it since 1979.</p>

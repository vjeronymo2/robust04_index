			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (2): The political cauldron is simmering  -Premier Mahathir is in no hurry to retire, but there is talk of who will succeed him IN mid July Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, arrived back in Kuala Lumpur after a three day official visit to Albania. The prime minister's jet touched down at 7.20am. By 9am Dr Mahathir was in his office, chairing a cabinet meeting. Dr Mahathir, 67, sets a bruising pace. Though he had open heart surgery in 1989, the prime minister, in power for the past 12 years, shows no sign of wishing to retire. 'As long as I'm welcome and the people want me, I'll serve,' said Dr Mahathir in a recent interview. Yet these days Malaysia is bubbling with talk about the succession. The political temperature is rising, the rumour mill is working overtime. At issue are elections in November in the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the country's dominant political party and main grouping within the ruling Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition government. By tradition, the head of UMNO is also prime minister. It's very unlikely that Dr Mahathir's position as party head will be challenged in these elections. But there is an increasingly bitter battle for the posts immediately below Dr Mahathir, particularly the number two position. The theory is that whoever emerges as deputy will one day inherit the Mahathir mantle. There are two main contenders for the position of UMNO deputy leader - Mr Ghafar Babar, the present incumbent, and Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister. A genial, rotund man who makes no claims to great intellectualism, Mr Ghafar, 68, describes himself as 'just a kampong (village) boy'. He has been an UMNO party stalwart for many years. Look at the old black and white pictures of the early Malay leaders and Mr Ghafar is there, urging the crowds to fight for independence from British colonial rule. More recently Mr Ghafar has proved himself as a Mahathir loyalist. Renowned for his political contacts with UMNO's traditional bedrock of support in rural areas, Mr Ghafar was used by the prime minister to build up a new, Mahathir aligned, UMNO after a party split in 1987-88. Earlier this year Mr Ghafar was at the forefront of pushing through controversial constitutional reforms limiting the powers of the sultans, the Malay rulers. Mr Anwar is a very different politician, said to represent the 'Malay baru'  -or the new breed of Malay. The finance minister, still only in his mid forties, has had a meteoric rise through the party ranks, propelled in no small way by Dr Mahathir. He was once regarded as a firebrand and, as a former head of ABIM, the Islamic youth movement, a vocal government critic. For a time in the mid 1970s the present finance minister was detained under Malaysia's powerful internal security act. His image has changed since those days. To visitors he is genial and relaxed, his conversation ranging from literature and music to the problems of third world debt. But no one doubts the presence of an extremely astute and ambitious politician behind the finance minister's urbane exterior. Mr Anwar is felt to reflect the opinions and aspirations of an increasingly powerful part of the Malay community - the urbanised, sophisticated Malays who, it is felt, will be at the forefront of the country's next economic leap forward. Dr Mahathir has said he would prefer if Mr Ghafar's position as party number two were not challenged in the November elections. But for once it seems the prime minister's word is not being obeyed. Mr Ghafar's and Mr Anwar's political stormtroopers are already out in the towns and countryside rounding up support. Some have warned of a party schism. Mr Anwar has said he is a Mahathir loyalist - but feels he must obey party sentiment and stand for election. 'There will be no disunity in UMNO,' said Mr Anwar announcing his candidacy earlier this month. Meanwhile Mr Ghafar seems determined to retain his post, and with it the possibility of becoming Malaysia's next prime minister. 'I don't care if anyone says that I'm not prime ministerial stuff but please don't think that I'm not qualified enough to handle UMNO's deputy presidential post or even the presidential post,' says Mr Ghafar. 'I have been in UMNO long enough. I know exactly what UMNO is all about. I will defend the post even if only two party divisions nominate me.' Each candidate has his powerful backers, with the older hands in cabinet generally favouring Mr Ghafar, the younger, rising stars such as the state chief ministers, backing Mr Anwar. At a rally in Kuala Lumpur about 8,000 turned up to voice support for Mr Ghafar. Less than friendly words are being exchanged between the two sides. There is open talk of 'money politics' with funds being used to influence delegates' voting patterns. Mr Anwar, in particular, is charged with accumulating a vast monetary war chest to further his cause - a charge he vigorously denies. But it is clear that the impact of these elections is being felt well outside UMNO ranks. Politics and business have long been closely related in Malaysia. Though the UMNO leadership denies party involvement in business, the party is immensely rich. Brokers - and corporate leaders - talk openly of 'UMNO connected companies'. Stock market analysts look as much at who is in or out of political favour as they do at company balance sheets in assessing market performance. Race remains a key factor in Malaysia's political life. To an outsider it might appear strange that UMNO - a party which is, as its name implies, strictly Malay - is alone deciding who will run the country. The Chinese, Indians and other races, who together make up nearly 50 per cent of the population, are not involved in the process. The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), are UMNO's main partners in the Barisan Nasional. But neither party has much political clout. 'If you are a rich or ambitious Chinese or Indian you don't get involved with MCA or MIC politics,' says a local academic. 'Instead you quietly seek to align yourself with the main forces in UMNO - and give generously to UMNO party funds.' Opposition is limited to the Democratic Action Party (DAP), headed by veteran Chinese politician Mr Lim Kit Siang, and remnants of the old UMNO headed by Mr Razaleigh Hamzah, once a close colleague of Dr Mahathir, but now a fierce critic. The Barisan Nasional has 127 of the 180 seats in the lower house of parliament and the opposition parties can do little but snipe at Dr Mahathir's government. The DAP says there is an increasingly undemocratic trend in Malaysia, citing Dr Mahathir's enthusiasm for tinkering with the constitution as evidence that the basis of the country's democracy is being undermined. The DAP has also been forthright in attacking what it considers to be the increasingly cosy relations between senior government figures and leading businesspeople. The Barisan Nasional faces a more formidable opposition threat at state level - in the northern state of Kelantan, where the strongly Islamic Parti Islam Malaysia (PAS) holds power, and in Sabah in East Malaysia, which is controlled by the Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS). Dr Mahathir remains deeply suspicious of any opposition to his rule and has made considerable efforts to undermine both PAS and the PBS. But in deeply conservative Kelantan PAS remains strong. In Sabah, some senior politicians formerly aligned with UMNO have switched to join the PBS. While not a direct threat to the Barisan Nasional's rule, such developments are worrisome for Dr Mahathir's government. Many analysts forecast an early general election being called in the first half of next year: UMNO would not only seek to renew Dr Mahathir's mandate but also to unite the party after what many fear will be a bruising and divisive internal election contest. Dr Mahathir himself tries to play down the intensity of political feeling within UMNO. 'It might look like a bubbling cauldron of political activity but I don't think it's all that bad,' he said. 'We (in UMNO) are quite rational people. We have been quite rational all this while. We don't have that kind of very violent antagonism towards each other or total inability to work with each other,' said Dr Mahathir. Not everyone would agree.</p>

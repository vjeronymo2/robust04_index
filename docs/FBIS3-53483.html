'Adil Muhammad 'Abd-al-Baqi, a key member of Al-Shawqiyun  which is based primarily in al-Fayyum southeast of Cairo, had  decided to leave the organisation and declared he had repented  by condemning its terrorist activities, they said.    But the police provided no details on the conditions  surrounding his surrender or any possible charges that may be  brought against him.    Last month the ministry gave out rewards of 100,000 Egyptian  pounds (30,000 dollars) to three people who provided police with  information on a fundamentalist involved in a car bomb attack  that almost killed Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi on  November 25.    The ministry recently announced it would pay 100,000 pounds  to any person providing information leading to the arrest of a  wanted fundamentalist.    Muslim militants in Egypt have since March 1992 launched a  bloody campaign to topple the secular government of President  Husni Mubarak by targeting senior officials, policemen, tourists  and Coptic Christians.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET AGENTS WARNED BLOCH, U.S. SUSPECTS  </P> <P> Felix S. Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected of spying for the Soviet Union,  appears to have been tipped off by Soviet handlers that he was under suspicion  before the FBI first questioned him in June, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> As a result, by the time State Department investigators asked Bloch about his  activities as a U.S. diplomat in Vienna and Washington, he may have had time to  destroy evidence that could have strengthened a case against him, they said.  </P> <P> The apparent discovery that Soviet agents warned Bloch that he was under U.S.  scrutiny appeared to throw another complicating factor into a  counterintelligence investigation that was already laboring under an unusual  set of handicaps.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Information Lacking  </P> <P> The FBI has been shadowing Bloch, the former deputy chief of the U.S. Embassy  in Vienna, since at least June 22, but it still does not have sufficient  information either to arrest him or to provide an estimate of what kind of  intelligence he may have turned over to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The few officials who have been briefed about the investigation acknowledge  that the evidence against Bloch remains fragmentary and may never support a  criminal prosecution.  </P> <P> "This may become one of the great unsolved mysteries of our time," one official  said. Unless Bloch agrees to talk to federal investigators -- or defects to the  Soviet Union and writes his memoirs -- "we'll probably never know the full  extent of his activities," he said.  </P> <P> "It's hard to know what damage he's done until you get your hooks into him," a  former intelligence official added.  </P> <P> Far from cooperating with investigators, Bloch led a motorcade of FBI agents  and television camera crews on a brief chase through New York's suburban  Westchester County into Manhattan on Monday. He had been staying with a  daughter in the town of Chappaqua.  </P> <P> After Bloch entered an office building at 10 Columbus Circle, the agents and  media kept a several-hour vigil outside, with television reporters filing live  reports from the scene speculating on whom he might be seeing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deputy Chief in Vienna  </P> <P> Bloch, a 30-year veteran of the Foreign Service, was deputy chief of the U.S.  Embassy in Vienna from 1983 until 1987. He is currently director of the State  Department's office of regional political-economic affairs for Europe, a job  that oversees regional economic issues -- including limits on high-technology  exports to the Soviet bloc.  </P> <P> The apparent Soviet early warning to Bloch was first reported by ABC News on  Monday evening. A senior U.S. official said the report "appears to be true."  </P> <P> One of Bloch's Soviet contacts telephoned him earlier this year, according to  ABC, and tipped him off with a cryptic message: "A bad virus is going around,  and we believe you are infected."  </P> <P> The warning apparently occurred after U.S. counterintelligence agents  videotaped Bloch handing a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris earlier this  year. The discovery that Bloch was apparently involved in spying was  "inadvertent," one official said Monday, adding: "It happened while we were  seeing what a Soviet was up to."  </P> <P> After that incident, the FBI placed Bloch under surveillance, but apparently  did not catch him in another overtly suspicious act, officials said. U.S.  officials still do not know what the briefcase contained.  </P> <P> In June, officials said, State Department security officials confronted Bloch  with what they knew and questioned him briefly, but the diplomat did not choose  to cooperate with the investigation, an official said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On 'Administrative Leave'  </P> <P> On June 22, the State Department placed him on "administrative leave," meaning  he cannot work but still draws a full salary and benefits. The department also  canceled Bloch's building pass and began the process of revoking his top-secret  security clearance.  </P> <P> Shortly after those actions, Bloch was allowed -- under guard -- to remove his  personal belongings from the State Department building and to close out his  credit union account.  </P> <P> President Bush called the allegations about Bloch "most serious" and said he  had known about them "for some time," but he declined to discuss the details of  the case.  </P> <P> Asked by reporters about the case as he began a meeting with a group of  senators Monday morning, Bush said: "The minute I heard about it, I was  aggrieved, because it is a very tragic thing should these allegations be true."  </P> <P> Asked how the case might affect U.S.-Soviet relations, Bush said: "It doesn't  help," but quickly added: "I think everybody around this table knows that there  have been -- espionage goes on."  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Secretary of State James A. Baker  III had personally informed Bush about the investigation but refused to say  when. "Obviously, because it is an ongoing investigation, we're very reluctant  to comment on any aspects of it," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Among the issues under investigation, officials said, is whether Bloch may have  provided information to the Soviet Union about Western attempts to halt  high-technology smuggling to the Soviet Bloc. The issue is critical to Moscow,  which has often relied on illegally obtained military technology to improve its  own weapons systems, U.S. officials say.  </P> <P> For most of a decade, Bloch played a role in setting and negotiating U.S.  policy on the high technology issue, beginning in 1980, when he became economic  officer at the Vienna embassy.  </P> <P> "Vienna is a center of that trade, and we were constantly working to try to cut  off unauthorized exports of sensitive technology," said another official who  served in Vienna.  </P> <P> According to one official, Bloch opposed a U.S. move to crack down on Austria  in the early 1980s because of the country's relatively lax attitude toward  high-technology exports. But other officials said they did not recall that  Bloch had taken a visible position on the issue.  </P> <P> More recently in Washington, Bloch's job as director for regional  political-economic affairs in Europe gave him "a seat at the table" when  high-technology issues were being discussed, one official said. As recently as  last month, officials said, Bloch participated in the negotiations that led to  a decision to permit the sale of personal computers to the Soviet Union and  Soviet Bloc countries.  </P> <P> However, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler added, "I would not  characterize him as a key player."  </P> <P> In any case, another official said, the investigation is "a long way from any  kind of damage assessment."  </P> <P> And, it appears, it is still some distance from an arrest as well.  </P> <P> "It's awfully hard to make an espionage case out of a briefcase," one official  noted, "when you don't know what's in it."  </P> <P> Times staff writers John J. Goldman, in New York, and David Lauter and Jim  Mann, both in Washington, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

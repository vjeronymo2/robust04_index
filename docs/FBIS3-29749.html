			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wataru Kubo, General Secretary of the Social </F> Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), by an unidentified MAINICHI  SHIMBUN correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [Correspondent] A crack in the Hosokawa  administration has since deepened due to controversy surrounding  a possible cabinet reshuffle. What are your views?    [Kubo] If the aim of the reshuffle is only to remove certain  ministers from the cabinet, we should be told so. Although the  arbitrary power to reshuffle the cabinet is given to the prime  minister, it does not mean that he can do whatever he wants. If  he reshuffles the cabinet for reasons of political strategy, it  would become a problem for the ruling parties as a whole. There  are no grounds for a reshuffle because the administration is  only six months old. I do not think it should be done.    [Correspondent] When do you think the move toward political  realignment will gain momentum?    [Kubo] It may be difficult to hold a general election under  the new electoral system this year. A unified local election  and an election for the House of Councillors next year are  scheduled before the next general election for the House of  Representatives is due. I think the way the ruling parties  cooperate with each other in the House of Councillors' election  will influence the political realignment.    [Correspondent] What is the aim of the SDPJ at the next  general election, which will be held under the new electoral  system?    [Kubo] We should prevent the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]  from returning to power. The ruling partners should seek  thorough electoral collaboration.    [Correspondent] Do you mean the ruling parties should merge  into one "new party" -- the idea advocated by Komeito Secretary  General Yuichi Ichikawa?    [Kubo] When I view Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary  General Ichiro Ozawa's view of the ideal nation, I think it  impossible for the ruling parties to merge. Unless the ruling  partners share a similar view of Japan's future and how to  secure people's rights, it will be impossible to merge the  coalition forces into one political party simply to win an  election. Furthermore, Mr. Ozawa advocates a  two-conservative-party system. One is the party of "new  conservatives"; the other the same old LDP. We do not accept  this idea. Ozawa's proposed system may change the focus of  power, but I don't think it will bring a bright future for  Japanese politics.    [Correspondent] What kind of a political picture do you  think desirable?    [Kubo] Political forces that consistently adhere to the  principles of the Constitution, peace, democracy, and human  rights are necessary in Japanese politics. We need a new era in  which "new reformists" stand against "new conservatives." The  SDPJ should play an important role in the formation of the "new  reformists."    [Correspondent] What must the SDPJ do to bring this about?    [Kubo] We need to change the party by abandoning the old  character of the party. We will establish the common political  aims of "new reformists," including those who have been  "conservatives," and thus form a new political force. In  creating the new political force, it is also possible the SDPJ  will dissolve itself for the better without absorbing other  parties.    If the old LDP continues to exist, Japan will see a  "tripolar" political scene with "new conservatives," "new  reformists," and the "LDP." If the LDP reforms itself, we  might, perhaps, form a coalition government of genuinely  "tripolar" structure -- new conservatives, new reformists, and  the LDP.    [Correspondent] What distinguishes these three political  forces?    [Kubo] The issue of international cooperation is one factor.  We should stress that Japan bases its international  contributions on the spirit of the Constitution. Regardless of  what sort of international cooperation is proposed, I oppose  international contributions under which military troops are  sent. My ideal nation and view of the Constitution are  different from those of Mr. Ozawa, who says Japan needs to  become a "normal nation." Another point is whether political  forces adopt a "consumer-oriented" policy or a  "producer-oriented" policy. However, when the need to change  power is taken into consideration, we must establish a "common  basic policy" to stabilize politics.    [Correspondent] Who are the potential leaders of the new  political forces?    [Kubo] In politics, having a competent leader is more  important than promoting political arguments. Mr. Takahiro  Yokomichi (governor of Hokkaido) is one prospective leader in  view of his age and experience. Governor Yokimichi's term of  office expires in spring next year. I hope that, Hokkaido  citizens and events permitting, he will decide to return to the  political arena in Tokyo).    [Correspondent] Is the party prepared for the split that may  occur in the process of political realignment?    [Kubo] Within the party there are members who do not  recognize us as a member of the coalition government and act on  their own. But most party members are different and take a  different view of fulfilling the party's appointed task. A  political party can work for the people only when it comes to  power. I think it would be fairer to say that any member who  acts on his own is a highly questionable member of the party,  rather than that their actions may lead to a party split.</p>

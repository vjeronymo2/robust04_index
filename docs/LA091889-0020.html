			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Denver rock impresario Barry Fey, hired by Denver Symphony musicians to help  them set up a new orchestra, says he has never been to a symphony concert and  prefers the Beatles over Bach but he's still confident he can do the job.  Rescuing the financially beleaguered symphony should be "a walk through the  park" compared to dealing with the super-egos and super-salaries of rock stars,  he said. After months of uncertainty in the face of a financial crisis for the  orchestra, the musicians voted to sever their ties with the 55-year-old Denver  Symphony Assn. and band together under the banner of the Colorado Symphony  Orchestra. Part of Fey's low-overhead plan would pay each musician about  $22,000 a year, reportedly twice the figure offered by the Denver Symphony  Assn. Fey said he would leave it to the musicians to choose conductors and  music for a proposed 26-week season starting about Nov. 1. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

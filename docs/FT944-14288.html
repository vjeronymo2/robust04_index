			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Fresh governor at Bank of Greece Being governor of the Bank of Greece is hardly the world's most secure job. Loukas Papademos, who took over last week, is the third central bank boss in less than a year, writes Kerin Hope. His two predecessors were both former economy ministers and political appointees. Efthymios Christodoulou, the conservatives' choice, was sacked last November by the incoming socialist government and has since returned to the safety of the European parliament's back benches. His replacement, Yannis Boutos, was a close political ally of Andreas Papandreou, the socialist prime minister. But Boutos made the mistake of annoying other top socialists, among them Antonis Livanis, who does his best to ensure that Greece's state-controlled banks put the government's interests first. Boutos was keen to privatise Bank of Crete, kept under central bank supervision since a Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal helped bring down Papandreou's government in 1989. But the socialists thought it should stay in the public sector. Boutos had to go. Can Papademos stay the course rather longer? At 47, he is the youngest central bank governor ever appointed. He also has the advantage of being a technocrat, who taught economics at Columbia University in New York before joining the Bank of Greece 10 years ago. And as chairman of the EU deputy central bank governors' committee, he was taken seriously in Brussels. He must be hoping his own government will accord him the same status.</p>

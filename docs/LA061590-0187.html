			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MYRICKS' SUSPENSION UPHELD  </P> <P> A drug-control review board has upheld a three-month suspension of long-jumper  Larry Myricks, The Athletics Congress said today.  </P> <P> Myricks was suspended in April after testing positive for phenylpropanolamine,  a stimulant banned under International Amateur Athletic Federation rules.  </P> <P> Myricks said the stimulant was in a common cold medication he took a day before  the U.S. Track and Field Championships. Testimony at an initial hearing,  however, indicated it was unlikely a normal dose of the medicine would have  resulted in as high a level of phenylpropanolamine as Myricks' sample showed.  </P> <P> Myricks, 34, of Upland, will be eligible to compete after July 13, TAC said.  </P></p>

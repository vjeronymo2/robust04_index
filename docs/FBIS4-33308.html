			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of statement by the Guatemalan National Revolutionary </F> Unity, URNG, General Command; place and date not given]    [Text] Given the biased and confidential versions that the  Government of the Republic -- from the president down to his  official and unofficial spokespersons -- has allowed to be  disseminated on this last round of negotiations and on the  progress of the process in general, we charge before the  national and international public the following:    1. That the Government of the Republic, through its peace  delegation -- within the framework of a strong and deceptive  publicity campaign -- maintained, during the round of  conversations and afterward, a deceitful, incoherent, and  harmful position.    It is deceitful because it has attempted to label as  humanitarian its position, which ignores substantial aspects of  the uprooting of communities and the magnitude and social  trauma, reducing it to a ridiculous space in this worst and  ambiguous government policy that is being implemented.    It is incoherent because it rejects society's clamor and  demands of justice on such an important issue. This has been  expressed by the Assembly of Civil Society, as well as by the  URNG at the negotiating table.    It is harmful because it lays down as a first condition a  cease-fire in the areas of resettlement; this is totally  unwarranted. Besides, they know before hand that this is  rejected because: a) It does not deal with the agreement's issue  nor its validity; b) the areas of specific resettlement are not  areas of combat, and when and where these are determined is  based on the presence and actions of the military detachments;  and c) the faithful fulfillment of the Overall Agreement on  Human Rights and its immediate verification take into  consideration and guarantee the situation of the noncombatant  civilian population.    2. To try, as the government has proposed, to avoid having  the Commission on the Violation of Human Rights begin its work  until the issue of the displaced persons has been concluded is  outlandish, and it violates the official agreements signed and  established in the negotiating process. This vital and important  issue was the object of a specific agreement, expressed in a  special declaration on 29 March when the Overall Agreement on  Human Rights was signed. This special declaration established,  with no room for doubt and in an expressed manner, that during  the month of May a specific meeting should be held to deal with  this issue. Since there is no excuse or pretext to evade this  commitment, it was agreed that the meeting would be held in Oslo  on 11 June without any preconditions and that it would not deal  with any others issues.    3. Yesterday marked two months since a historic event: the  official signing of the Overall Agreement on Human Rights.  Sixty days have gone by, and the government continues to ignore  and not fulfill the majority of the points agreed upon. At this  time, we strongly demand that at least the national campaign --  in which the government and other institutions had made a  commitment to report and explain the agreements -- be carried  out immediately and in all its magnitude.    The explanations or justification given by the national  government of the Republic and internationally, alleging lack of  funds, fall short in both validity and credibility while they  only denote a serious want of political willingness to comply.    In this framework and before the national and international  community, we demand that Commander Everardo be handed over  alive. We reject the defense minister's explanations and  insinuations.    4. On 14 May, as part of a vast military plan, the  Guatemalan Army initiated a general offensive of a surprising  nature. The goal was to put the URNG at a disadvantageous  position for discussing the displaced persons' issue on 21 May.    The second phase of that national offensive was initiated  today in the Ixcan area. Here is where the six elite  battalions, including two paratrooper battalions, were  concentrated. They have been deployed to operate against the  communities of resistant people and against the camps of  displaced persons who have returned.    We reiterate our charges concerning the consequences and  implications this will have in the coming weeks at a national  and international level. The URNG reaffirms its willingness to  participate in the negotiating process with the best  constructive attitude, but we are not willing to accept any  distortion or coercing aimed at weakening or misrepresenting the  contents of the substantive issues and their development.    UNRG General Command    [signed] Commander Rolando Moran, Commander Pablo Monsanto,  Commander Gaspar Ilom, Carlos Gonzalez, secretary general of the  PTG's [Guatemalan Labor Party], CC [?Central Committee].</p>

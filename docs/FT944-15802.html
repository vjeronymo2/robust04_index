			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Management: The real face of Japanese R&amp;D in Europe - Christopher Lorenz examines why so few companies are doing integrated product development Guildford, a cathedral town in southern England, is an unlikely birthplace for an innovation which may revolutionise the world computer graphics industry. But Criterion Software, a 17-person company which was founded there last year, has launched a product which enables standard personal computers to produce three-dimensional graphics of a quality and speed hitherto feasible only on specialised and very expensive workstations. The reaction of the US software and multimedia industry, and of computer games programmers worldwide, has been one of disbelief followed by great excitement. The product, called RenderWare, is being bought by a string of leading software development houses and hardware makers. Unless Criterion's growth is crippled by the established leaders of the graphics industry as they rush to clone its approach, the company's sales should climb rapidly from this year's Pounds 1.5m. The Guildford company is also remarkable for a quite different reason. It is the second, fully-fledged new business to be spawned in just three years by the European research and development centre which Canon, the Japanese copier and camera maker, opened on Surrey University's research park there in 1988. The first spin-off was Canon Audio, whose innovative, hemlet-shaped hi-fi loudspeakers are impressing the specialist music trade. Sales are expected to grow from Pounds 3m this year to Pounds 5m in 1995. Exports to the US have already started, with Japan next on the list. Most other Japanese R&amp;D establishments in Europe, with the notable exceptions of Sony's and Nissan's, are more limited than Canon's. They are of two very different kinds. One 'upstream' group, also located in or near universities, monitors or actually conducts local research, mainly for transfer to Japan. The other, housed in or alongside Japanese factories in Europe, operates very much 'downstream', merely adapting product designs from Japan for local manufacture and sale. In theory, both kinds of operation are likely to expand gradually into the same central, or 'midstream', territory as Canon: the design, development and engineering of products for global markets. This closely linked set of activities creates more added value than either research or manufacture do on their own. Yet it receives far less media attention: the headlines are hogged by investments such as NEC's Pounds 530m new semiconductor factory in Scotland - announced last month. Many academics and government officials think the trend towards the midstream will occur automatically, as a series of pressures forces Japanese companies to do more design, development and engineering abroad. Apart from politics, pressures include the rising yen, the cost and supply of local engineers, the need to generate product designs direct from European markets, and a supposedly 'natural' cycle of organisational evolution among multinationals of any origin. Declarations of intent to join this trend have been made by Sharp and a few other Japanese companies which at present do only research or production in Europe. But the process is far less automatic than many people think. Organisational and other factors are hampering such an expansion of design, development and engineering away from the companies' home base. One long-standing barrier is the near-universal tendency to keep really key R&amp;D programmes close to head office. Masahisa Fujita, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says this applies especially in fast-moving technologies such as electronics - the very sector which accounts for most Japanese manufacturing companies in Europe. Extra brakes on more Japanese heading for Europe include three options which did not exist for the Americans: first, locating in south-east Asia, or indeed the US; Japanese spending on R,D&amp;D is already far greater in the US than in Europe, and growing faster. Second, doing more foreign design and development through alliances, rather than in-house. Third, subcontracting more work to the growing plethora of development consultancies in Europe and the US. The last two options - part of a gathering surge of so-called 'virtual R&amp;D' around the world - will still benefit Europe in various ways. But the commitment is less far reaching than when a Japanese company invests in its own European design and development facilities. The contrast between Canon's approach and that of most other Japanese companies was underlined this summer at the ninth annual conference of the UK-Japan High Technology Industry Forum, held at Gleneagles in Scotland. Of four presentations in a session titled 'Japanese R&amp;D in the UK', Canon's was the only one to deal with the complete process of innovation, including commercialisation. The other three companies at Gleneagles were Toshiba and Hitachi, both of which have basic research centres in Cambridge working on quantum physics with the university's Cavendish laboratory, and Eisai, a drugs company which is spending Pounds 50m on a neurosciences lab at University College London. 'Once we prove a project to be worth exploiting, it will be continued in Japan,' the conference was told by Yutaka Tsuchiya, the lab's administration director. By coincidence, the one-in-four ratio at Gleneagles reflects - slightly generously - the proportion of Japanese 'R&amp;D' units in the UK which do more than either just basic research or local modification of products. In continental Europe, the proportion is less favourable still. According to the latest official government figures from Tokyo, Japanese companies claim to have no fewer than 264 'R&amp;D facilities' in Europe. The UK has the largest number, 83, followed by Germany with 53. Kiyonori Sakakibara, an expert on international R&amp;D based at the London Business School, confirms that the UK figure - and, by implication, the German one - 'is an over-estimate. It includes all sorts of preliminary technical activities'. A better indication of the amount of real Japanese R,D&amp;D in Europe is the figure of 65 units which are classified as 'independent', or not factory-based; 19 of them are based in the UK, 18 in Germany. But even this classification is confusing. It mainly covers research units, including the three which presented at Gleneagles. But it also includes Nissan's European Technical (development) Centre north of London and NSK's ball-bearing facility near Nottingham, which are both linked to the companies' factories in the UK and elsewhere. Some of the reasons for doubting whether research operations will move downstream into design and development as automatically or smoothly as theorists suggest are examined by Sakakibara and Eleanor Westney of MIT in a paper on the evolution of cross-border technology management by Japanese companies.* One discouragement lies in the long success which many companies have had in collecting foreign technology for use in their laboratories back home. Even when top management makes a strategic commitment to push more real product development abroad, established relationships and patterns of communication lead the home country R&amp;D organisation to continue treating the growing local unit as just a listening post, say the academics. As a result, the unit finds it difficult to recruit and keep good local technical people. 'This difficulty reinforces the belief of the home country organisation that the local (unit) can never match the product development capacity in Japan,' say Sakakibara and Westney. A very strong commitment by top technical management is needed to overcome this problem, they argue. That may not be enough. Arnoud de Meyer, a professor at Insead in France, identifies a similar impediment, involving managers and technical staff at all levels. Foreign R&amp;D centres take an inordinate time to establish credibility with staff at their home country bases, he says. The French R&amp;D unit of Corning, a large American multinational took from 1969 to 1981 to win its spurs; it only did so when one of its research projects became a big commercial success. A further barrier cited by de Meyer is communication difficulties between foreign units and those at home. Electronic communication of various kinds is all very well, he says, but 'the thing companies don't understand is that information only becomes knowledge if it's consensually validated - if you can actually see people in the same room say yes or no, and feel how they say it. You don't get that on an electronic network. Even teleconferencing impairs the informality and openness which people need to work together in complete trust.' This is less a problem for stand-alone research units working on projects separate from those in the home country than for product development units working in an integrated fashion with the home base - and sometimes with each other. Although no Japanese company has yet had the time to develop as much research, design or development activity in Europe as US multinationals such as Ford or IBM, the Japanese are aware of these co-ordination problems. As David Cairncross, a UK academic, points out in a new book on Japanese multinationals**, most long-established US multinationals still do most of their advanced design and development work at home. So it is not surprising that the current level of 'real' Japanese activity in Europe is limited, however great its potential. By the same token R&amp;D spending abroad by Japanese companies is still outranked considerably by expenditure by foreign companies in Japan. The average size of foreign R&amp;D units in Japan is also much larger, Cairncross reports: many have over 100 staff, whereas Japanese facilities in Europe and the US employ between 10 and 50, except in the motor industry. Time may change this balance, but only gradually. That makes Canon's two spin-offs all the more striking. The true test of Canon's internationalisation, as for other Japanese companies, will be if it manages over the next decade or so to grow at least one big worldwide business based on products designed and developed abroad. It has made a better start than most. * Technology and the Wealth of Nations. Edited by Nathan Rosenberg.

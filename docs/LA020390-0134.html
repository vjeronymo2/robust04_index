			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN CITIES, BLACKS MARCH AND CHEER TO CELEBRATE LIFE-ALTERING CHANGES;  </P> <P> STREET SCENES: 'WE ARE PROBABLY SEEING HISTORY IN THE MAKING,' ARCHBISHOP TUTU  SAYS OF DE KLERK'S PROPOSALS.  </P> <P> Black taxi drivers honked horns and stopped traffic Friday and workers whistled  to celebrate President Frederik W. de Klerk's announcement of watershed  political changes.  </P> <P> Blacks surged into the streets in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg at the  news that the African National Congress and other organizations had been  legalized and many national emergency restrictions lifted.  </P> <P> They streamed into the dusty roads of townships to cheer, and marched through a  Cape Town train station chanting, "ANC! ANC!" while police watched passively.  </P> <P> "We are probably seeing history in the making in South Africa," said Anglican  Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who could not stop smiling during a news  conference.  </P> <P> "We had expected that Mr. De Klerk might deliver something, but what he said  has certainly taken my breath away," Tutu said.  </P> <P> Johannesburg whites stepped out of their shops to take photographs and smiled  as hundreds of blacks danced and marched through downtown, waving banners and  newspaper headlines that declared: "ANC Unbanned."  </P> <P> Drivers stopped their cars in the street, honking their horns and punching  their fists into the air. Black workers leaned out of office windows, whistling  and shouting.  </P> <P> Police halted the march with a line of yellow patrol vehicles, chased some  protesters and fired tear gas to disperse others. No injuries or arrests were  reported, and many protesters laughed as they ran from the police.  </P> <P> In Cape Town, thousands of blacks banged placards against the fence around  Parliament, chanting "ANC! ANC!" before De Klerk arrived to deliver his speech,  which granted many of their demands.  </P> <P> The announcement of the legalization of the ANC was picked up on a car radio.  The predominantly black crowd of 5,000 broke into cheers, whistles and more  chants as recently freed anti-apartheid activist Popo Molefe relayed the news  over a bullhorn from the back of a truck.  </P> <P> "We would be unreasonable if we failed to acknowledge that of all the  presidents, of all the leaders of the Nationalist government, that in fact De  Klerk has taken the most bold step and has emerged as the most courageous,"  Molefe said.  </P> <P> "Mr. De Klerk, in his speech, has moved rather swiftly to meet most of the  demands of the people," said the Rev. Allan Boesak, the president of the World  Alliance of Reformed Churches. "These are clear, decisive steps that will  undoubtedly, help to create a better atmosphere here."  </P> <P> A black youth climbed atop a statue near Parliament of Jan Christiaan Smuts, a  former South African prime minister, waving an ANC flag and brandishing a  wooden model of an AK-47 automatic rifle, the symbol of the ANC's military  wing.  </P> <P> But police riot squads remained out of view and there were no confrontations as  the crowd marched joyfully through Cape Town's streets.  </P> <P> Scores of white policemen and white shopkeepers watched silently from the  sidewalks, some shaking their heads.  </P> <P> Blacks and whites stood in groups with people reading the afternoon newspaper,  whose headline said, "ANC Legalized."  </P> <P> Street dancing broke out in downtown Durban as a group of black railway union  members marched through the city center to a crescendo of cheers.  </P> <P> After dark, thousands of blacks paraded through the townships outside Cape  Town, waving banners and singing hoarsely, while black men, women and children  came to the doors of their tents or tin-roofed shanties to cheer.  </P> <P> Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela,  sounded a less-optimistic note as blacks marched in Cape Town. Saying that the  black majority is not prepared to accept "a bone without meat," she said, "This  is not what we expected today. We expected him to tell us: Go to Victor Verster  (prison) and fetch comrade Nelson."  </P> <P> In Amherst, Mass., her daughter, Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, 35, beamed at hearing  the news from her homeland.  </P> <P> "The thing that really overjoyed me at 4 a.m. was the fact that my father's  release is definite," she said at a news conference at the University of  Massachusetts, where she is a Fulbright Scholar studying anthropology. "Even if  it didn't happen today, the thought that I will have a father back, that he  will be a free man again, is very, very good news to me."  </P></p>

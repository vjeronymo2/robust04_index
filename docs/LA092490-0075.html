			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON INSIGHT  </P> <P> BUDGET BLUES: Congressional preoccupation with budget negotiations is  distracting the lawmakers from other major agenda items and creating a huge  logjam of unfinished business. Besides the spate of appropriations bills held  up by the budget impasse, the two houses are moving slowly on other matters,  such as child care legislation. Even if a deficit reduction accord is reached,  the budget package still could take three weeks to clear both the House and  Senate, according to leadership timetables.  </P> <P> The seemingly endless budget talks have wrecked lawmakers' plans for an early  election-year getaway on Oct. 5. The backlog of money bills and other "must"  measures is now so large that Capitol Hill insiders believe the lawmakers  cannot adjourn until Oct. 20 at the earliest. That leaves only 16 days for  incumbents to get in their final campaigning before the voters cast ballots on  Nov. 6.  </P> <P> GROUSING ABOUT GEPHARDT: House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) is  drawing fire from fellow Democrats for giving away too much in the budget  negotiations with the Bush Administration. Although the tough-talking  Missourian has carefully cultivated an image as an aggressive, highly partisan  critic of GOP policies, rank-and-file Democrats complain that he has become too  much of a statesman in his role as the Democrats' chief budget negotiator,  agreeing to hefty concessions on Medicare and other longtime Democratic issues.  "He's become a lightning rod for all the rank-and-file complaints" about the  budget talks, one Congress watcher said.  </P> <P> Gephardt's defenders say he hasn't given up his partisan fervor -- for example,  he is still holding out for higher tax rates for the rich -- but that he simply  is trying for a deficit-reduction package that will protect Democrats from  getting too much of the blame if the budget talks fall apart. But hard-line  Democrats aren't buying that. Particularly irksome to them: President Bush's  praise of Gephardt for his cooperation in the budget talks.  </P> <P> FED FRUSTRATIONS: The past weekend's accord among the Group of Seven finance  ministers and central bankers to keep interest rates high may bolster the  dollar temporarily but isn't likely to ease the friction between the Treasury  and the Federal Reserve, analysts say. The two have sharply conflicting views  as to what should be done about interest rates and the dollar -- the Treasury  wants the Fed to lower interest rates, but the central bank is fearful that to  do so would only send financial markets into a tizzy.  </P> <P> So far, the markets are backing the Fed. The dollar has been plunging and, over  the weekend, finance ministers of America's economic allies served notice that  they expect the United States to join in holding monetary policy relatively  tight to ward off inflation. The man on the spot: Treasury Secretary Nicholas  F. Brady. Those familiar with internal policy discussions in the Administration  say that the rift between Brady and the Fed is leaving him increasingly  isolated.  </P> <P> GLOBAL PLANNING: Interest groups pushing to resume U.S. participation in global  family-planning efforts are counting on an abortion-rights majority in the  November elections to help boost their cause with Congress. The abortion-rights  advocates have two goals on Capitol Hill this year -- to increase overall  funding and to restore the U.S. contribution to the two major international  population-control groups -- money that Congress cut off in 1985.  </P></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Japan still the 'most competitive nation' but US closing JAPAN remains the world's most competitive nation but no longer outperforms its trading partners across the board, according to an international survey published yesterday. Japan's dominance among nations in the Organisation for Co-operation and Development is still unquestioned, but the US is again challenging for top spot, the survey shows. Britain, meanwhile, has slipped from 13th to 16th in the annual competitiveness rankings for 1993 compiled by the International Institute of Management Development and the World Economic Forum, both Swiss based. Germany has been pushed down to fifth place from second last year, as it continues to suffer the political and economic strains of unification. The US has regained the second spot from fifth, while Denmark and Switzerland rank third and fourth. Singapore heads the league table for industrialising economies, followed by Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia. Chile enters the rankings for the first time in fifth place, ahead of South Korea. The report rates 38 rich and poor countries according to 370 criteria influencing competitiveness. These cover economic strength, the openness of the economy, the extent to which government policy creates a supportive business environment, and the quality of infrastructure, management, technological and human resources. About a third of the indicators are derived from a survey of more than 2,000 executives. The report notes a growing concern among executives that improved competitiveness may be resulting in less employment as enterprises in industrialised countries seek to cut costs by job-shedding or relocating production in low-wage countries. It predicts a wave of white-collar unemployment in the 1990s. Clinton renews call to open Japanese markets, Page 4</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: EuroDollar ready to raise prices EuroDollar, the car rental company which was floated in July, said yesterday that it would try to act as market leader and increase prices in January. At the same time, it said better economic conditions in the UK were responsible for a 16 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.15m (Pounds 7.01m) in the six months to September 30. Turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds 43m. Mr Ian Mosley, chief executive, said volumes in November were up 30 per cent over last year, but that there would continue to be downward pressure on margins. Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 11p (9.5p). The interim dividend covering the period since the listing is 1.6p.</p>

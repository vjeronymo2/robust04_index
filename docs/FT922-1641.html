			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions SHARES AT Vosper Thornycroft, the ship-building and electronics firm, have been performing well since the beginning of the year. Following good year-end results, three directors have sold a total of more than 400,000 shares at 342p. The company did, however, report a strong order book at the time of the figures and, while others were selling, Martin Jay, the managing director and chief executive, bought 1,460 shares, increasing his holding by more than one-third. Perkins Foods, the food manufacturing and marketing company, has seen its shares underperform considerably over the past year. But the tide could be turning as Howard Philips, the chief executive, Ian Blackburn, the finance director, and Terence Finn, a non-executive director, have bought a total of 145,000 shares at prices around 100p. Each director already held a considerable number of shares but their investments remain significant in money terms nevertheless. Following interim results at Metro Radio, an independent local radio services provider in Tyne and Wear and Cleveland, Michael Johnson, an executive director, sold 40,000 shares at 175p. Within the past year he has sold approximately one-quarter of his holding.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                   Sector      Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bentalls                    Stor      24,000       33         2 Bowater                     PP&amp;P      45,116      368         1* BPP                         BusS       4,500       12         1 Carlton                     Mdia      70,890      464         1* Edinbrugh Inv Trust         InvT      10,000       24         1 European Colour             Chem     170,000       20         1 Hambros                     MBnk     185,000      527         2* Harng'ton Killbride         Mdia      50,000       84         1* Laird                       Moto      29,661       96         1* Metro Radio                 Mdia      40,000       70         1 Pittard Garner              Misc      22,000       23         1 Sherwood Grp                Txtl     239,000      371         1* Sinclair Wm                 Misc       7,000       19         1 Time Products               Misc      50,000       89         1 Vodafone                    Tele      37,000      138         1 Vosper Thornycroft          EngG     401,794    1,374         3 VSEL                        EngG     100,000      445         1 Warburg (SG)                MBnk      10,925       61         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Airsprung                   Misc       6,000       24         1 Barrett (Henry)             Metl      45,000       10         2 BTR (Nylex)                 OthI      50,000   A[ 120         1 Glaxo                       Hlth       2,344       18         1 Inoco                       Prop     250,000       15         1 MB Caradon                  Cong       5,000       15         1 McLaughlin &amp; Harvey         Cont      25,000       16         1 Owen &amp;Rob'sn A Pref         Stor     500,000      275         1 Penna                       BusS      24,000       32         1 Perkins Foods                FdM     145,000      144         3 Ropner                      Cong      12,333       15         2 Spears (J)                  Misc       3,700       11         3 Sunset &amp; Vine               Mdia      40,000       58         1 Vivat Holdings              Text      33,000       11         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

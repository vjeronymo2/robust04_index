			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mercedes gloomy on truck sales Recession has forced west German hauliers to de-register between 10 and 15 per cent of their truck fleets, according to Mr Bernd Gottschalk, head of Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicles division. This unused capacity will have to be absorbed before the group can expect to increase sales of new vehicles in its home market, where it claims 52 per cent of the heavy trucks business. Forecasting unchanged turnover for 1994 after a decline of almost 6 per cent to DM25.3bn (Dollars 14.7bn) last year, Mr Gottschalk said he saw no real prospects for recovery in Europe, with the exception of the UK, which had become the European Union's economic 'locomotive'. Some improvement might be seen in France towards the end of the year, he said, but there was no chance of better sales in Italy or markets like Spain, where deliveries had plunged by up to 50 per cent. The company could not expect to increase sales volumes in Germany this year, although output from its Dusseldorf works would be bolstered by a recent order for 8,700 vans for the Bundespost postal service. Private sector hauliers had de-registered trucks to save insurance and road taxes, after building up their fleets in preparation for the single European market which came into force a year ago, and then being hit by recession. Liberalisation of European transport policy had further sharpened competition. 'It all helps to explain the trough we are in,' Mr Gottschalk said. Reviewing 1993, when group deliveries fell 22 per cent in the EU and 7 per cent worldwide to 255,000 trucks, vans and buses, he said output from the group's west European plants had been cut 26 per cent to prevent an unmanageable build-up of stocks. By contrast, unit sales at Freightliner, the US subsidiary, had increased 37 per cent to 45,000 units. Mr Gottschalk promised a complete renewal of the group's product range, which will absorb most of the current DM6bn five-year capital investment programme, and a sharpened offensive in developing markets.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Call for tougher trademark bill likely Manufacturers of leading brands are vowing to continue their campaign for legislation to curb supermarket 'lookalike' brands, in spite of their failure to get measures included in the trademarks bill, which has its third reading in the Commons today. Several MPs are expected to call for tougher measures against lookalike brands, own-label products designed to resemble closely those of top manufacturers, but the bill is thought likely to be passed by the Commons without significant amendments. Brand manufacturers are hopeful, however, that they may extract a promise from Mr Patrick McLoughlin, a junior trade and industry minister, to look into the issue further. They want legislation to stop supermarkets not only infringing registered trademarks, but copying the overall look of branded goods, including the colour and shape of packaging. The manufacturers say existing safeguards, such as the threat of legal action against 'passing off', are inadequate, especially compared with legislation in continental Europe. The British Producers' and Brand Owners' Group, which includes companies such as Unilever, Mars and Grand Metropolitan, was originally formed as a loose alliance to campaign for measures in the trademarks bill. It is now expected to appoint a formal secretariat, with a constitution and agreed funding, to continue its fight against lookalike brands. The group's spokesman, Mr John Murphy of Interbrand, the consulting group specialising in branded goods, said brand owners had no alternative but to fight on. Own-label products now account for more than 50 per cent of turnover in superstore chains such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, but have been strongest in areas such as chilled and fresh foods and some packaged goods. However, after the launch of Sainsbury's Classic Cola as a direct competitor to Coca-Cola, manufacturers fear the supermarkets will take the battle into areas where branded goods remain dominant, such as soft drinks and branded alcoholic beverages, pet foods and cereals. Mr Murphy cites Sainsbury's recently launched peach schnapps, which brand owners claim is a lookalike of IDV's Archers, as another example of the trend. Sainsbury insists the drink is not a copy of Archers, and in fact more closely resembles some brands in continental Europe, where peach schnapps is a well-established drink. It defended its use of a frosted-glass bottle with the claim that this was necessary to protect the drink.</p>

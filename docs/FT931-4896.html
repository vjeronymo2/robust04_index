			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply-demand worries push oil prices lower AN ACTIVE OIL market pushed prices for North Sea Brent crude down by 25 cents yesterday to Dollars 19.20 a barrel for April delivery as traders worried about low demand and high output. The monthly oil report from the International Energy Agency, the west's oil watchdog, provided the focus for market fears and triggered a sell-off. The report highlighted the weakness of oil demand by pointing to an increase of only 100,000 barrels a day in OECD consumption in the first quarter - a rise of only 0.5 per cent compared with the same period last year. At the same time, the IEA estimated that production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries rose to 25.35m b/d in February from 25.2m b/d in January. Opec has agreed to cut output to 23.58m b/d from the beginning of this month. Within the Opec production forecasts, traders were concerned at the high level of Iranian output, estimated to have reached 3.8m b/d last month, with Kuwait pumping 1.7m b/d. Oil prices have risen by at least Dollars 1 a barrel in the past few weeks as Opec has reasserted its commitment to cut production. 'We've travelled some distance on the back of rhetoric, but I don't think we've broken down yet,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, who runs Smith Barney's energy desk in London.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Two large carriers announce big losses THE turmoil persisting in the US airline industry yesterday caused two of the largest carriers, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, to post heavy losses for the final three months of 1992, and for the year overall. UAL, United's parent company, said that it made an after-tax loss of Dollars 184m (Pounds 122m) in the final three months of the year, excluding one-off charges, and registered a Dollars 370m deficit for the year. Delta made a net loss of Dollars 126.3m in the October to December period. Delta accompanied news of the latest losses with an announcement that Mr Whitley Hawkins, its president, will retire in March after 38 years with the company. Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman, will add the roles of president and chief operating officer to his existing responsibilities, for 'the indefinite future'. Delta and United are two of the nation's 'big three' mega-carriers. The third, American Airlines, has already posted a Dollars 475m after-tax loss for 1992 (before one-off accounting-related charges). The latest red ink means that 1992 will be third year in which the US airline industry has made a multi-billion dollar loss; net losses from the nine largest US carriers topped Dollars 3bn in 1990, and exceeded Dollars 1.6bn in 1991. 'Unacceptable is the only way to describe our fourth quarter results,' said Mr Stephen Wolf, United chairman. 'The industry remains in a state of chaos.' Delta echoed this, blaming the December quarter loss on 'the continuing effect of uneconomical fare levels due to the implementation of a simplified fare structure earlier in 1992, discount fare promotions, and a weak worldwide economy.' Both airlines are currently engaged in major cost-cutting exercises, and are talking to aircraft manufacturers about further reductions and rescheduling of new aircraft orders. This month, United institigated a cost-cutting plan involving the axing of 2,800 jobs and the cancellation of plans to hire another 1,900, as part of an effort to slash Dollars 400m from annual operating expenses. Delta shares were down  1/8 at Dollars 51, while UAL were down Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 122 1/4 . Details, Page 21</p>

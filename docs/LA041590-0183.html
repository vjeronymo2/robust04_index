			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BALLET BACKING  </P> <P> In response to James Jones' column (April 1) lamenting the lack of a classical  ballet company in Orange County, I would ask anyone with similar concerns the  following questions:  </P> <P> 1. What local ballet company has been performing for Orange County audiences  for 25 years?  </P> <P> 2. What local ballet company performs 80 times a year with full subscriber  series for both adults and children?  </P> <P> 3. What local ballet company did 30 lecture-demonstrations for Orange County  elementary schools in the last 12 months?  </P> <P> 4. What local ballet company has the repertory, scenery, costumes and dancers  to offer local audiences full productions of "The Nutcracker," "Sleeping  Beauty," "Copellia," "Firebird" and other classics?  </P> <P> 5. What local ballet company was chosen to represent the western states at the  International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss.?  </P> <P> 6. And finally, what Orange County ballet company did the Los Angeles  Philharmonic ask to dance the pas de deux from "Romeo and Juliet" and a  variation from "West Side Story" at the Beverly Wiltern last month?  </P> <P> The answer to the above questions is, Ballet Pacifica, which is a good example  of a local dance company that could use support to hire its dancers full-time  rather than have them come to class and rehearse after working an eight-hour  day. Like Jones, a lot of us are tired of losing our local talent to ABT,  Joffrey, San Francisco, and European dance companies. Let's just support and  build on what we already have -- we don't have to reinvent the wheel.  </P> <P> CHARLES R. JOHNSTON  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

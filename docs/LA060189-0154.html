			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW 'PASSIVE' PEOPLE METER IN THE WORKS;  </P> <P> NIELSEN DEVELOPING A 'PASSIVE' AUDIENCE-MEASUREMENT SYSTEM  </P> <P> Three years from now, a new TV ratings device could be watching you watch  television.  </P> <P> But it won't be Big Brother time, officials of Nielsen Media Research  emphasized Wednesday in announcing an agreement with the David Sarnoff Research  Center to jointly develop and test a new "passive" audience measurement system  that involves a cameralike device in the subject's home.  </P> <P> "We would use this technology only in households where people had agreed to  have the technology installed," John A. Dimling, Nielsen executive vice  president, told a news conference here.  </P> <P> "We're not scanning the room to find out what they're doing," he added, only  identifying, on a "second-by-second" basis, who is watching what program and  when.  </P> <P> If the technology, methodology and value for cost proves feasible, he said, the  new system could start replacing the people-meter ratings technology three  years from now.  </P> <P> "If everything goes well, that's our goal -- to have a passive system for  measuring television audiences" that would replace the current system, Dimling  said.  </P> <P> He declined to say how much the new project will cost.  </P> <P> Officials at the three major TV networks said that Nielsen was to outline the  proposal for them later this week. But their initial response was cool.  </P> <P> "I think that the 'if all goes well' is a big if," said Barry Cook, NBC vice  president for media research. "Because there's a lot more to an audience  measurement system than a technology."  </P> <P> Nielsen's people-meter system, now used in 4,000 households, became the  industry standard in the fall of 1987. It is an "active" system in that  individual viewers must log on by pushing designated buttons on small boxes by  their TV set.  </P> <P> Costing NBC, CBS and ABC $5 million a year each, the people-meters replaced a  passive "audimeter" system that simply recorded what programs were being  viewed. The people-meter system was an effort to measure more precisely the  numbers and kinds of viewers watching TV.  </P> <P> Its first year of operation resulted in an overall 9% drop in audience size  that the networks partly attributed to the new technology.  </P> <P> The proposed new "image recognition" system would use a computer and cameralike  device in each participating household. The facial features of each family  member or friend would be stored in the computer, officials said. Then, when  the TV set was turned on, the cameralike device atop the set would start  scanning the room, identifying who was watching by matching what it sees with  the stored computer data, and then cataloguing them in Nielsen's national  tally.  </P> <P> If the camera-computer didn't "recognize" who was watching, it simply would  record the viewer as a "visitor."  </P> <P> Dr. Curtis R. Carlson, a research director at the Sarnoff facility in  Princeton, N.J., conceded at Wednesday's news conference that much still must  be worked out with the new system. Asked how the system would differentiate  between twins, for example, he said, "Twins are hard."  </P> <P> Despite Dimling's assurances that there are no Big Brother aspects to the  viewer-scanning system, some unease was expressed by network officials.  </P> <P> "We would be uncomfortable with that," said CBS research vice president Michael  Eisenberg. "But I'd have to hear more about it."  </P> <P> Viewers might also be uncomfortable with it, NBC's Cook noted, saying that if  the system were used in every room in a house that has a TV set, including the  bedroom, "people may want to throw a coat over the camera, so to speak."  </P> <P> NBC always has championed passive audience measurement systems that require  nothing of the viewer, Cook said, but Nielsen's proposal for one that watches  the viewer watching TV will itself require a long, hard look.  </P> <P> "It remains to be seen whether something which is so potentially invasive as a  camera -- which identifies you in the room -- is going to change the viewer  behavior," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: SNAKES LEAVE HER A LITTLE RATTLED  </P> <P> This is the time of year in Arizona when people look where they're going and  walk on the sunny side of the rocks. It's stinking hot and it's snake time.  </P> <P> We hear relatively few stories about snakebites, but Peter Aleshire reported an  incredible story in the Arizona Republic the other day: A man was bitten on the  tongue while kissing a rattlesnake.  </P> <P> Now here's the weird part. He decided to try a non-scientific, quack-type  remedy he had heard about to counteract snakebite. A word of caution: Do not  try this in your own home. He'd heard that if you run an electrical current  through the wound, it is supposed to break down the venom. So, after he was  bitten, he wired his mouth to a pickup battery and tried to jump-start his  tongue. It knocked him out cold, and he ended up in the hospital where he lost  part of his tongue and one lip. My views on snakes are well known. I do not for  a single minute believe they're as afraid of me as I am of them. They are not  trying to get out of my way when they see me coming, and people who keep them  around to keep the rodent population down should be heavily sedated.  </P> <P> When my husband and I first moved to this state, we were invited one night to  the town of Prescott to witness a festival celebrating Indian lore. It featured  a group of men with snakes tattooed on their arms who performed the famous  "Smoki Snake Dance." Our host was a "Smoki."  </P> <P> As a couple of dozen men danced around a circle to the beat of a tom-tom, each  dancer was given a snake (non-poisonous). He was to clench the snake between  his teeth closely behind the head and just out of striking distance while he  held the tail in his hand and waved it around as he kept the beat.  </P> <P> When the dance was over, we went down to the field to say good night to our  host. There was blood streaming down his face as he said, "Shoot, I got bit  last year. Next year, I've got to get a better grip on him closer to the head."  </P> <P> When I asked him where all the snakes had gone, he looked around him on the  ground and said, "We just release 'em when we're finished. They're probably  halfway to the parking lot by this time."  </P> <P> The University of Arizona Poison Control Center was quoted as saying that most  snakebites come from people kissing snakes, playing with them and handling them  on a routine basis.  </P> <P> Do you see a personality profile developing here anywhere?  </P></p>

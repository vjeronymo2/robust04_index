			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Allianz Allianz's announcement that it is looking for acquisitions abroad, including in the UK, comes only days after the purchase of Swiss Re's primary insurance business. A significant turning point has been reached: after several years of consolidation, the colossal insurer is ready for further expansion. The new willingness to pursue acquisitions coincides with signs of robustness in the domestic German market, the traditional mainstay of group profits. The underwriting cycle has turned: premium rates are rising, helped by economic recovery, and there has been a welcome fall in car theft. This summer's insurance market liberalisation has not led to a dramatic intensification of competition, as once feared. Foreign insurers still find it difficult to break into Germany, and domestic competition is muted. There are still headaches in the US, where Fireman's Fund lost DM164m in the first half on catastrophe risks, and the state of world financial markets will hit investment income. But on balance Allianz feels confident enough to revive a global growth strategy which has been on hold since 1990. Whether this will prove good for shareholders is another question. Some of Allianz's past acquisitions, for example that of Deutsche Versicherung, seem to defy normal pay-back criteria. But investors treat Allianz as a proxy for the German market. As a result, the economics of individual transactions matter less than sentiment on Germany as a whole.</p>

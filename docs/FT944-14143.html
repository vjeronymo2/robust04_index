			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Lifetime of learning plan for education The commission has made six proposals to reform the system of education and training, which it says is now 'designed to serve an academic elite and to fail the rest'. The commission wants to introduce a system of 'lifetime learning'. The educational reforms in the package build on proposals launched by other bodies in the past two years. They are: Universal pre-school education for children aged three and four. The prime minister made a 'cast-iron commitment' to introduce nursery education for all four-year-olds at the Conservative party conference two weeks ago. He left open the question of funding, but hinted that he would prefer a voucher system. The commission appears to endorse a version of the voucher scheme, with a system of fee-relief to allow low-income families to use private provision. A campaign against illiteracy and innumeracy. This would concentrate on work with young children rather than on adults. The commission suggests that more use should be made of volunteers, building on experience in inner-London primary schools. The abolition of A-level exams in their current form. They would be replaced with a unified examination system for 14 to 19-year-olds incorporating academic and vocational qualifications. This is a model backed by organisations ranging from the Headmasters' Conference, which represents the most prestigious boys' and mixed schools, to the Industrial Society and the Confederation of British Industry. A state-enforced minimum investment in training by employers. Employers would be expected to pay about 1 per cent of their wage bill - rising to 2 per cent or more over time - on training. This could be spent by companies on their own training, or contributed to the government to arrange external courses. Expanded higher education with graduates paying for some of their tuition. The commission praises the new system in Australia, where students take a loan and repay it via higher tax contributions, linking repayment to their ability to pay. But it gives no details for a new system. A new 'Learning Bank' which would fund all post-16 education on a common basis. This body would handle both employers' contributions to training and the funds produced by tax payments from graduates. It would provide people with individual learning accounts which they could use throughout their lives to fund any form of education.</p>

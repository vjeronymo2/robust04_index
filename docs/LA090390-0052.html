			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> ULTRASOUND REVEALS BIRTH DEFECTS  </P> <P> Ultrasound scans can be accurate enough to replace amniocentesis for checking  fetuses for spinal abnormalities and other severe birth defects, researchers  reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Amniocentesis, while generally safe, carries a small risk -- 0.5% -- of  triggering a miscarriage, whereas ultrasound poses no known risk to the growing  fetus.  </P> <P> However, doctors often recommend amniocentesis when routine blood tests given  to pregnant women show elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. While many things  can cause this protein to be higher than normal, there is a 1% chance that it  means the baby has a defect.  </P> <P> In the study, doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston reviewed the  ultrasound pictures of 51 fetuses with spina bifida and related abnormalities  that were delivered or aborted at the hospital. In every case, ultrasound had  correctly identified the birth defects.  </P> <P> The researchers conclude that if a woman has an elevated alpha-fetoprotein  level and a normal ultrasound scan, there is a less than a 0.1% chance that her  baby will have spina bifida or a related birth defect.  </P></p>

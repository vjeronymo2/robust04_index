			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Canadian new issue activity stalls A STRONG rally in the Canadian government bond market yesterday sparked expectations of supply in the Euro-Canadian sector. However, poor swap conditions and a lack of borrowers requiring Canadian dollar funding have temporarily stalled new issue activity. Canadian dollar Eurobond spreads widened as government bond yields fell faster than Eurobond yields, while swap spreads remained tight. 'The market has almost rallied too far (for Eurobond issuance),' said one syndicate official. The Canadian sector of the Eurobond market has traditionally had a substantial retail investor base, viewing the market as a high-yielding alternative to US dollars. With coupons for 10-year Canadian Eurobonds likely to be in the region of 7 1/2 per cent to 7 3/4 per cent, the market is no longer an obvious buy for European retail investors, who must now be persuaded that the currency is set to appreciate, dealers said. The steep yield curve means that shorter-dated deals will offer even lower yields. Meanwhile, Credit Foncier de France added a further Dollars 50m to its Dollars 150m issue of floating-rate notes launched on Wednesday, on a quieter day for the recently hectic floating-rate sector, as the market absorbed Wednesday's Dollars 500m offering by BankAmerica. The Royal Bank of Scotland has increased its Dollars 200m issue of preference share capital, launched on August 3, to Dollars 400m, making it the largest overseas bank issue in the US preference share market. 'This issue reinforces the strength of our capital base in a very cost-effective way,' said Mr Kenneth Thompson, group finance director of the Royal Bank. The shares, which pay a dividend of 9 1/2 per cent, qualify as tier 1 capital under international bank capital guidelines which come into force next year. Guinness has set up a Dollars 1bn programme, which provides for the issuance of listed Eurobonds as well as medium-term notes. The multi-currency programme, arranged by Morgan Stanley International, includes a D-Mark option. The company, which will use the programme to refinance short-term debt, expects to start issuing paper under the programme in the latter part of September.</p>

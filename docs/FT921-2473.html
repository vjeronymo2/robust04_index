			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts at odds on land prices THE PRICES of American farm land may be headed substantially upwards - or downwards - or they may stay the same in real terms, depending on which agricultural economist you are listening to. At a recent conference sponsored by Choices, the publication of the American Agricultural Economics Association, some agricultural economists saw US farm land values rising as much as 35 per cent in real terms in the 1990s. Mr Rex Wilcox of Stalcup Agricultural Service said they would outperform other types of investments in this decade. Rentals would yield 6 to 8 per cent, compared with 5 per cent on many certificates of deposit, he said. But others are deeply sceptical. The increasingly bleak prospects for US grain exports have convinced economists such as Mr John Scott of the University of Illinois that land prices will fall during the next decade. 'We're going to be locked out of Europe,' he said. A recovery in agriculture in the former Soviet Union and some eastern European countries would mean fewer markets and more competition in exports. Taking the middle road, Mr Philip Raup of the University of Minnesota said that land prices would keep pace with inflation during the 1990s and avoid the boom and bust cycles that have characterised land values over the past two decades. Whatever the prospects for the rest of the decade, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reports that the annual rate of increase in Midwest farm land values slowed in 1991 - continuing the decline that has been in progress since 1988. In a survey of agricultural bankers in the region late last year a majority believed that farm land values would remain flat in the first quarter of 1992.</p>

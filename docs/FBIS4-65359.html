			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Monory Wants UDF Candidate in </F> Presidential Election]    [Text] Senate Speaker Rene Monory thinks it would be  "appropriate for the UDF [French Democratic Union] to have a  candidate in the 1995 presidential election. He said so on  Radio J, adding that in the current context, a party without a  candidate finds it hard to exist. According to Mr. Monory,  should the majority have two candidates, "there would have to be  a gentleman's agreement between them." Asked whether he would  himself stand in the election, Rene Monory said that he was  "quite relaxed" about it. "What I am interested in," he added,  "is for the debate in the presidential campaign to be based on  truth."    Mr. Monory would not want the future president of the  Republic to be elected "on a fuzzy platform; otherwise, he would  ultimately fail." Even though the French may not like it, there  are a number of things that must be said.    Furthermore, any reforms being envisioned "must be announced  before the election. This is a matter of sincerity," he said.  As for the European election, Mr. Monory does not want to  delude himself. He believes that 35 percent of the vote will be  a good result for the majority's list. He also advises  [majority list leader and Toulouse Mayor] Dominique Baudis not  to get "too big for his britches" if he does achieve a good  result. This was Mr. Monory's answer to a question about Mr.  Baudis' intentions, which might be to stand in the presidential  election after the European one.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead BRITISH AIRWAYS, still struggling to restore its dignity following the Virgin Atlantic 'dirty tricks' affair, will report its third-quarter results on Tuesday. But a Pounds 30m exceptional charge for re-organisation at Gatwick after the Dan-Air acquisition will knock the quarter's profits back to about Pounds 10m (Pounds 100m). Profits for the nine-month period to the end of December are likely to be about Pounds 237m (Pounds 285m). Glaxo, the UK's largest pharmaceuticals company, is expected to report on Thursday that profits in the six months to December 31 will rise from Pounds 709m to about Pounds 775m. Sales growth of Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which accounts for about 40 per cent of the group's sales, has slowed as cheaper rivals prepare to enter the market. The profits rise has been held back by higher spending on r&amp;d and marketing. Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, will on Tuesday report its first-quarter results, covering the period to end-December. A small improvement is expected on the Pounds 226m pre-tax recorded a year ago - possibly up to Pounds 240m, excluding profits on disposals. Much of the increase, though, will come from the translation of dollar profits at a more favourable rate. And analysts will look for further clarification of Lord Hanson's comments at the recent annual meeting that UK margins were likely to be tighter this year. Dalgety, the food group, is reporting interim results on Monday for the six months to end-December. These are expected to show a small increase, to Pounds 56m, from pre-tax profits of Pounds 53.8m last time. UK trading is dull although there will be the benefit of Sooner Snacks, acquired in February. A good performance is expected from the US operation.</p>

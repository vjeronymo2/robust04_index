			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT;  </P> <P> FIRE-SPRINKLER LAW PASSED BY COUNCIL  </P> <P> A law requiring sprinklers to be installed in new buildings was passed this  week by the City Council.  </P> <P> Under the local ordinance, approved unanimously by the council, all new homes,  apartments and commercial buildings must have fire sprinklers.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ingrid McGuire expressed reservations over the law, saying that  the sprinklers would drive up the price of a new home by $2,000.  </P> <P> "I am somewhat concerned that the additional requirements . . . will make it  more difficult for people to buy new housing," McGuire said.  </P> <P> The city had received a letter from the Orange County Building Industry Assn.  urging that the law be rejected.  </P> <P> The sprinklers are "probably not popular with developers," said Councilwoman  Judy Curreri, "but we have a responsibility to do things that are helpful to  the quality of life."

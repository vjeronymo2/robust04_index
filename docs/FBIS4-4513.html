			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry has issued a statement on the  repatriation of 25,000 displaced Cambodians who fled the  fighting into Thailand. The statement says Thailand provided  assistance to the Cambodians by giving them temporary shelter on  humanitarian grounds, hoping that once the situation in Cambodia  returned to normal and was safe these people would return home  quickly.    Subsequently, from 15-27 March the Thai Government sent  these  Cambodians back to their own country via Ban Saptari, Soi Dao  District, Chanthaburi. The repatriation was the same as the  action previously taken by the Thai Government and complied with  the wishes of the Cambodians, who wanted to return to safe  areas. Moreover, the Thai Government absolutely would not allow  any armed group to enter Thai territory. The Thai Government  (?is ready) to cooperate with the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees and other international organizations in transiting  Thai territory to assist these suffering Cambodians in their own  country.    On this issue, the Thai Government has appealed to the UNHCR  to consult with the Cambodian Government on establishing a safe  zone in Cambodia for Cambodians fleeing the fighting in their  country.    Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong informed Prince  Norodom Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, of Thailand's position during the latter's 28-29 March  official visit to Thailand. The Thai Government hopes the  international community understands its actions in this matter.  Thailand had to shoulder the burden caused by displaced  Cambodians for over 13 years, and it does not want such a burden  again. The Thai Government has tried to implement its policy on  this issue by taking both its international responsibilities and  international interests into consideration.</p>

In its  statement published today, the ministry points out that this "is  another evidence of the annexationist policy" pursued by Yerevan.    The ministry stated that "all responsibility for the new  round of hostilities entirely rests with Armenia whose actions  doom the people of Azerbaijan and its own people to new victims  and sufferings" calling on the world community to condemn the  Armenian aggression and impose efficient political and economic  sanctions against it.    The statement points out that the Armenian side neglects  peacekeeping efforts by both international organizations and  individual states attempting to seize more territories of  Azerbaijan.    The ministry said Armenians had been shelling and rocketing  the bordering districts of Azerbaijan situated in the north-west  of the republic since December 26 as well as the village of  Sadarak belonging to the Nakhichevan autonomous republic.  Armenian units undertook an attempt to launch an offensive on  the north and south of Azerbaijan. The ministry said civilian  villages suffered heavy damages from hundreds of shells and  rockets leaving victims and destroying homes, schools, hospitals  and transport communications.</p>

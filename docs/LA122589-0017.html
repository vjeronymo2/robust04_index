			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> GUN MAKER WINS ROUND AGAINST LAW  </P> <P> A Bakersfield weapons manufacturing firm has won a preliminary injunction  barring state and county authorities from prosecuting it for producing and  selling guns banned under a new state law. Sacramento Superior Court Judge  Jeffrey T. Gunther agreed with Amerind Inc.'s contention that it should not be  prevented from manufacturing weapons for sale to the military, law enforcement  and out-of-state purchasers. Gunther said his ruling will stand only until the  issue can be pursued in the courts. A new state law, effective Jan. 1,  prohibits the sale or manufacture of assault weapons, including the Calico  M-900 assault carbines and the Calico M-900 pistols made by Amerind. The law  was enacted after a Jan. 17 shooting in a Stockton schoolyard that left five  children dead.  </P></p>

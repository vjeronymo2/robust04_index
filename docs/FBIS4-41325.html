On the final day of the visit the UNESCO director general  attended the opening ceremony of a UNESCO bureau in Moscow.  Mayor pointed out that the opening of the UNESCO bureau became  possible due to the desire expressed by the Russian Government  and the UNESCO Secretariat to deepen mutually advantageous  cooperation.    Mayor highly assessed talks he had in Moscow with the  Russian  President Boris Yeltsin, Chairman of the Russian Federation  Council Vladimir Shumeyko and Patriarch Aleksiy II, heads of the  Russian Ministry for Science and Technical Politics, Culture and  Education.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS Mayor said that during the  talks the sides summed up the results of activities aimed at the  realization of concrete projects included in a memorandum on  cooperation between Russia and UNESCO. These projects envisage  support to the Bolshoi Theatre, the Russian State Library and  the Hermitage. The sides also discussed prospects for the  development of cooperation in the field of communications, the  organisation of international conferences, the reform of  secondary education in Russia and the use of intellectual  potential of Russian scientists.    According to Mayor, UNESCO has allocated half a million  dollars to support various projects in Russia, predominantly  connected with the support to research centers, special schools  and a programme of studying the Russian language.    As a result of the talks agreements were reached to hold a  second world congress on information science and education and  establish an international department for human rights at the  Moscow State Institute of International Relations.    During his visit Mayor met with representatives of  intelligentsia, Russian mass media chiefs, the company of the  Bolshoi Theater and students of the Moscow State University.

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / EU auditors court hits at Brussels over fraud The European Union's Court of Auditors blasted the European Commission yesterday for lax financial management and a failure to tackle fraud, which it said had become endemic inside the EU. Commission officials called part of the court's 484-page report ill-informed, but Euro-sceptic Conservative MPs in the UK claimed it would stiffen opposition to legislation increasing British contributions to the EU, which will be announced at the opening of parliament today. Mr Andre Middelhoek, court president, said in Strasbourg that it was impossible to estimate how much money went astray from the Ecu64.2bn (Pounds 50.2bn) of EU funds paid out in 1993. 'Fraud exists everywhere. There's no question of it just being something that happens in one country as opposed to another,' he said. But the strictures by the court, the EU's main financial watchdog, on Union aid to east and central Europe, and the former Soviet republics - worth Ecu1.1bn and Ecu530m respectively last year - were dismissed. Officials working with Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner responsible for the programmes, said they were 'misleading, inaccurate, or by now outdated' . They 'reflect an insufficient understanding of how the programmes work or the specific circumstances on the ground', one official said. The court, for instance, says that EU food aid to the Baltic states undercut local food prices, driving an embryonic private sector out of business. Sir Leon's officials say that, in fact, food prices were already well below world levels, and the Commission and Baltic governments therefore set higher minimum prices to prevent former state-owned enterprises from undercutting private traders. The report identifies several serious cases of fraud, mismanagement or incompetence in the EU. Wine production has risen by one-fifth since 1989 despite EU spending totalling Ecu1.2bn to take vineyards out of production. The European Parliament failed to enforce competitive tenders for its new building in Brussels. The cost has risen from original estimates of about Ecu1bn to Ecu1.83bn. EU payments to persuade milk and wine producers to cut production are still being offset by political incentives to increase output. The report's appearance coincides with a planned Ecu600m increase in the EU budget in 1995, which could face opposition in some member states, notably the UK. Mr Bill Cash, a leading right-wing Euro-sceptic, seized on the report as evidence that British taxpayers were contributing to a 'bottomless, fraudulent pit'. Other rightwingers forecast a rebellion against the bill. But British ministers praised the Court of Auditors for identifying the fraud, and played down the prospects of a backbench rebellion.

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fyffes turns in 13.5% advance to IPounds 14.1m FYFFES, the UK and Irish fruit and vegetable distributor, reported a 13.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 14.1m on turnover down 7.6 per cent to IPounds 267m for the six months to April 30 1993. Interest and income from financial assets accounted for IPounds 6.6m of the pre-tax figure. The company said that sales volume increased in all its markets but turnover fell 'due to the unusually low fruit prices experienced during this period. In particular European banana prices were weak in the first six months in the lead up to the new EC banana regime'. Mr John Callaghan, chief executive, said the EC's new regime, which came into effect last Thursday, would be likely to cause some market disruption in the next couple of months. There could be surplus bananas on the market in the opening months - the last three months of Fyffes financial year - because fruit loaded before June 23 could still be accepted in the EC after July 1. 'I believe it is a well-based system and will work well once the settling down period has passed,' Mr Callaghan said. Fyffes' traditional sources of supply from the ACP countries have been supplemented in recent years by sources from dollar-producing areas to supply the continental European market, and will benefit from the new quota arrangements. The company said that interest income would be lower in the second half of the current year due to lower interest rates, and expects earnings per share for the year to be 'not be materially greater than that of last year'. Shareholders' funds stood at IPounds 187m with net cash balances of IPounds 91m at April 30. Earnings per share were 2.75p (2.23p). The interim dividend is 0.3904p, 10 per cent up on last year. Fyffes also announced it had acquires 50 per cent of Brdr Lembcke 'which supplies about 25 per cent of the Danish fresh produce market'.</p>

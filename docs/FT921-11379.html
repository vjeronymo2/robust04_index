			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / French steel group reports FFr3.1bn loss and job cuts USINOR SACILOR, Europe's largest steelmaker, yesterday estimated net losses for 1991 at FFr3.1bn (Pounds 317m) and announced plans to lose 8,000 staff, just over 13 per cent of its workforce, in the next three years. This is the French state-owned group's first loss since 1987. It is further evidence of the decline in prices and demand that has swept the US and European steel industries. Mr Francis Mer, chairman, said the downturn was 'worse than we feared', but that Usinor Sacilor was 'practically certain' to make a net profit this year on the grounds that most of its main markets would begin to stabilise. To support Mr Mer's guarded optimism, Moody's, the US credit rating agency yesterday accorded a Prime-1 rating to the French group's short-term borrowings. Moody's said Usinor Sacilor's operating cash flow compared well with European and North American competitors, it had achieved great efficiency improvements and its state ownership was a source of strength. The group's turnover rose from FFr96.1bn in 1990 to FFr97.1bn last year, though there was an underlying 7 per cent decline when adjusted for acquisitions. Operating profits collapsed from FFr4.4bn to FFr400m over the same period, mainly due to losses from the long products division - beams and wire for the depressed construction and engineering industries - which represents one-fifth of sales. However, the group made an operating profit from stainless steel, flat products - such as sheet for cars and household goods - and long products for the mechanical construction industries. French steel consumption fell 6.5 per cent last year, slightly faster than the 5 per cent decline in EC steel use, according to the French steel federation. The FFr3.1bn group net loss, compared with a FFr3.5bn net profit in the previous year, comes after a FFr700m tax charge and FFr2.8bn of provisions for restructuring. Most job losses will come from closures of integrated steelworks and long products plants in Lorraine and Normandy. The reductions are small compared with the 100,000 job losses Usinor Sacilor has made over the past 15 years. But they have been criticised by Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, who wants the public sector to help her campaign to reduce unemployment.</p>

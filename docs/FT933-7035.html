			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley shares at new high on record earnings SHARES in Morgan Stanley rose to a fresh high for the year yesterday after the US securities house reported record second-quarter profits of Dollars 224.2m, or Dollars 2.77 a share. At the same stage last year the firm earned Dollars 119m or Dollars 1.36. Morgan Stanley's strong earnings easily surpassed the firm's previous record of Dollars 198.8m, earned in the first three months of the current fiscal year, and provided fresh evidence that the record-breaking boom on Wall Street shows little sign of losing steam. Demand for the company's shares in the wake of the results, which exceeded many analysts' expectations, pushed the stock up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 79 5/8 , a new 52-week high, before closing at Dollars 78 7/8 . Morgan Stanley's impressive performance was driven primarily by trading revenues, which leapt 153 per cent to Dollars 517.9bn over the three months. Although the sharp jump reflects increases in both customer-related and proprietary trading revenues, earnings from the firm trading its own capital in US and overseas financial markets, particularly fixed-income markets, will have been especially strong. Mr William Hartman, securities industry analyst at the banking group JP Morgan, said: 'A lot of that (increase in trading revenues) came from Europe. They were able to capitalise on declining European interest rates.' The huge gains in trading revenues overshadowed improvements elsewhere. Strong growth in financial advisory services and in high-yield and structured debt underwriting boosted Morgan Stanley's earnings from investment banking to Dollars 318.2m, up from Dollars 284.2m a year ago. Revenues from broking commissions rose 17 per cent to Dollars 90.7m, while asset management and administration revenues climbed 20 per cent to Dollars 63.6m. Interest and dividend revenues rose slightly to Dollars 1.48bn. Overall, total revenues (excluding interest expense) rose to Dollars 11.5bn, up from Dollars 764m a year ago. Expenses climbed sharply because of a 54 per cent increase to Dollars 572.2m in compensation and benefits payments, which are tied to the firm's performance. Most of Morgan Stanley's other expense lines were little changed in the quarter, and total non-interest expenses came in at Dollars 787.8m, compared to Dollars 568.9m a year earlier.</p>

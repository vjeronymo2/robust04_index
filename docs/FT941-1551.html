			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Malaysian group expands in Sabah Mycom, the listed Malaysian gaming and property company, is moving into the timber business in the east Malaysian state of Sabah with the acquisition of UNP Plywood, one of the state's biggest timber operators. Mycom will be paying MDollars 350m (USDollars 130m) for UNP through the issue of 70m new Mycom shares at MDollars 5 each. UNP has an extensive timber mill operation in Sabah and several thousand hectares of valuable timber concessions. Many big Malaysian companies have announced plans to invest in Sabah following the recent transfer of power in the state to parties aligned to the ruling coalition headed by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. Mycom is rapidly expanding its activities. Earlier this year it announced that, along with Indonesian interests, it was taking a stake in Lamborghini, the Italian sports car manufacturer. Mycom had pre-tax profits of MDollars 85m in the six months to end-1993.</p>

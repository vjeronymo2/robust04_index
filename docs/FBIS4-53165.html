			<p>BFN     [Text] Two decades of plummeting oil prices have, at  times, come close to scuttling the $12 billion North West Shelf  [NWS] liquified natural gas project and have now forced the  partners into a massive rearrangement of spending priorities.    Woodside Petroleum Ltd, project operator, recently shed 429  staff in a bid to slash $100 million from its operating costs  and is screwing back capital expenditure to lift revenue from  the project.    When development of the North Rankin, Goodwyn and Angel gas  fields began, oil prices were around $US20 and expected to reach  at least $US40 over the next 20 to 30 years.    Steadily rising oil prices were expected to underpin the  massive borrowings required to fund the $12 billion project and  provide an adequate return on the total investment.    But oil prices defied the most pessimistic outlook and  lifted  the NWS project's payback period by at least a decade.    Now the project's revenue earnings must rise while operating  costs are cut to generate the kind of profit level required to  provide a decent return on the billions of dollars invested so  far.    Dramatic growth forecasts for LNG demand in Japan and other  Asian countries is underpinning future LNG sales with every  current Japanese buyer understood to consider a fourth NWS LNG  train a certain source of future supply.    The initial 20 year LNG export contracts signed between the  NWS partners and eight Japanese customers now barely cover the  project's cash operating costs, with the remainder used to repay  interest on the investment capital and reward shareholders.    The LNG contracts were expected to quickly repay the capital  and then generate large profits but the collapse in oil prices,  and by extension the LNG price, has dramatically changed the  North West Shelf partners' game plan.    Woodside has not yet repaid any of the principal of well  over  $1 billion it has borrowed to fund its share of the NWS project.    A radical rethink of future development options has seen  plans for a third offshore production platform deferred for at  least a decade and improved the prospects for the fourth LNG  train.    Lifting cash returns by better utilising the existing  off-shore and onshore assets more effectively means gas  production by North Rankin A and Goodwyn platforms will be well  above initial plans to feed possibly two new LNG production  trains.    The third offshore platform, on the Angel gas field, will  not  be built this century as planned, but will be delayed possibly  until as late as 2010, saving up to $2 billion.    To supply additional gas volumes, required for an extra one  or two LNG trains reserves closer to the existing Goodwyn A and  North Rankin A platforms are likely to be developed, either  using sub-sea well completions or by directional drilling from  either of the two platforms.    The North Rankin West field containing 0.45 trillion cu ft  (TCF) proved and probable gas reserves is a prime candidate for  development using directional drilling from the North Rankin A  platform.    A recent big seismic program around the Goodwyn/North Rankin  fields is likely to throw up more, adjacent, potential gas  reserves, with the exciting West Dixon discovery a principal  target.    Woodside managing director, Mr Charles Allen, said the staff  cuts would save about $50 million, with another $50 million in  savings expected to come from tight controls over operating  costs in addition to $50 million in savings achieved in 1993.    Mr Allen said the NWS partners expected to get full value  out  of the NWS project assets only once full plateau production had  been reached, due to occur in 1995.</p>

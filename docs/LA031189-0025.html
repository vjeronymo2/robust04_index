			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLS NEEDED FOR HIGH IQ CHILDREN  </P> <P> There are special schools for children whose IQs are 40 points lower than  average. We give these children small classes, special buses, special programs  galore, and what do we do for the children whose IQs deviate in the other  direction? Some kids who are blessed with IQs that much higher than average  feel they are punished for it. They are made to "learn" and "relearn" something  they knew before they sat down in class. When they get really bored, they start  trouble just to see if they can get out of the dull school, and then their  motivation for learning is down the tubes completely. They learn outside the  classroom, but inside they just daydream. This is a waste, and if the kids with  low IQs have a special school, the kids with very high IQs should have one too.  </P> <P> The individual should work up to his or her potential. This is not happening in  regular schools. Segregating children with high IQs into gifted classes is not  as good as a special school. Our gifted students should not have to wait for  college to start learning!  </P> <P> MARY JACOBS  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

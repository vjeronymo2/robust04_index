			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Gardner Merchant makes Dollars 100m acquisition in US Gardner Merchant, the largest contract caterer in Europe, yesterday doubled the size of its business in the US with a Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) deal to buy part of Morrison Restaurants' contract food division. The deal will make Gardner Merchant the fifth biggest contract caterer in the US. But it will remain behind Compass Group, which in April paid Dollars 450m for Canteen Corporation, the US number three. Gardner is acquiring the business and industry and education divisions of Morrison's Hospitality Group, which each operate more than 200 contracts. Mr Bob Cotton, director of corporate affairs, said that in 1993-94 the two divisions had turnover of about Dollars 225m and operating profits in the region of Dollars 10m. The acquisition would take the group into 40 states, up from the present 18, and the number of US employees would rise from 5,500 to 13,000. US turnover would rise from Dollars 180m to Dollars 400m, accounting for 25 per cent of total group turnover. Gardner, which was bought by its management from Forte for Pounds 402m at the end of 1992, will be financing the deal through increased bank debt, which will rise to about Pounds 225m. Last April the group reported annual profits before interest and tax of Pounds 46.9m on sales of Pounds 1.02bn. Strong cashflow had enabled it to cut senior debt from Pounds 200m to Pounds 163m. Mr Cotton said the group had been in the US for 15 years, but it remained concentrated in the business and industry markets in the north-east states. The deal will expand its share of the business and industry markets into the southern states, and at the same time take the company into the education market across the US for the first time. 'We have found the economies of the southern states are growing faster than the north-east,' said Mr Cotton. 'At the same time, margins are better in the education sector, where you can cater for 20,000 to 25,000 on a campus.' Morrison Restaurants, which is listed in New York, said it was selling the contract catering businesses because it was a small force on a large playing field, and was 'not likely to achieve dominance in the category'. It was seeking to invest in high growth businesses where it could attain a dominant market position.</p>

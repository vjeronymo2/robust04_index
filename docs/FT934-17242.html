			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan announces deregulation for securities trade JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday announced a series of measures aimed at deregulating the securities industry in the face of increasing pressure by the new coalition government for a reduction in controls. However, the 30 measures announced yesterday, which include an easing of restrictions on brokers' door-to-door sales of gold coins and a reduction of mandatory reporting procedures, failed to inspire the financial community in Tokyo. Japan's financial industry is still heavily regulated compared with leading western countries. Barriers between banking and securities industries have not yet fallen, and the number of investment products available is far fewer than in places such as New York and London. The government has also called for greater disclosure of decision-making procedures within ministries. The Ministry of Finance has been accused by foreign brokers and some Japanese institutions of inconsistency and a lack of transparency in its decision making. Of the 30 measures, only 10 were new and aimed at easing some procedural rules on securities trading. The ministry said the reduction in reporting of trading activities, including trading by foreign investors and brokers' own accounts, would help cut the amount of paperwork at the brokers. However, brokers said that the effects of the new measures would be minimal, since detailed trading reports are handed to the Tokyo stock exchange every week. The ministry said that the approval of brokers' entry into new securities related businesses stipulated in the report would not mean that new securities products would be quickly accepted.</p>

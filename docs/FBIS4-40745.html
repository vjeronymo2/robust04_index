			<p>BFN     [Text] Sergey Filatov, leader of the presidential  administration, declared that the criminal related situation in  Russia "is on the brink of an emergency one" and this explains  the necessity of Boris Yeltsin's decree on urgent measures to  protect the population from banditism and organized crime.    "When as many as ten explosions are registered over 24  hours,  it means that bandit formations force their ideology of life to  the society," he said in his interview with Interfax Saturday.    At the same time Filatov pointed out that part of the  society  expresses its disagreement with Yeltsin's decree due to the  provision on possible detention of the suspected for 30 days.  He recognized that this method "has been actually taken from  the decree on the state of emergency."    In Filatov's opinion, those, who say that this provision of  the presidential decree should be compensated in the legal sense  "by removing the old fear of the people in the face of the  unrestricted power of the law enforcement bodies," are quite  right. Filatov believes that it is possible to achieve this  involving the conciliatory commission in charge for the  implementation of the Agreement on Public Accord.    Filatov is known to be chairman of this commission.</p>

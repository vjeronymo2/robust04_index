			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bourse to probe Euro Disney share trade The Paris stock market authorities have launched a formal inquiry into the recent volatility of the shares in Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group desperately trying to negotiate a financial restructuring package. Euro Disney's shares have for the past fortnight been under surveillance by the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French market watchdog. This followed a sharp fall in the shares on November 10 when Euro Disney disclosed an unexpectedly heavy net loss of FFr5.3bn for the year ended September. The COB is investigating the circumstances behind the share price movements to see whether there was an unauthorised leak of information. Another area of investigation is the suspension of the shares on various European markets. The shares were suspended in Brussels before Paris, but continued trading in London. An official said the COB was also scrutinising this week's sharp fluctuations in Euro Disney shares. The shares, which were worth FFr43.7 before the loss announcement, had fallen to a low of FFr27.02 by the end of trading this Wednesday. The shares then rallied on Thursday and yesterday rose again to close FFr1.5 higher at FFr30.9. Meanwhile the 60 international banks that hold Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn net debt are finalising discussions for the formation of a steering committee to represent them in the restructuring negotiations with Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company. The creditors include Citibank, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, National Westminster, Mitsubishi Trust and Barclays. The steering committee is expected to have 11 members and to be led by Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) or Banque Indosuez, the French banks. The Euro Disney banks are believed to have rejected a proposal to form three separate committees - to handle the three different categories of the company's debt - in favour of setting up a single negotiating body.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Super-Charged To The Brink"] </F>   [Text] PREDICTABLY, the United States has reintroduced the  Super 301 trade law which will enable it to punish those trading  partners that it claims obstruct unfairly the sale of US  products in their markets. The decision, announced on Thursday  by Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, is aimed primarily at  cutting Japan's huge trade surplus with the US. This is not the  first time that Washington has decided to threaten sanctions to  extract concessions from Tokyo. In 1989, it used the same law  against Japan to boost its exports in wood products, satellites  and super-computers. Presumably, the US believes that it can  prevail again without having to act on its threat of  retaliation. Under-Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten has  said that Washington will be aggressive in seeking to increase  its exports and open up the markets of its principal trading  partners. Commercial interests, he added, had never been so  important as they are now to US foreign policy.    Granted, Japan has been slow in taking steps to give foreign  competitors a fair chance in its market. This has caused  growing frustration in the US, which ran a trade deficit of  US$60 billion with that country last year. But reviving Super  301 is a retrogressive step. As the secretary general of Gatt,  Mr Peter Sutherland, remarked, it is misguided and dangerous.  Instead of acting unilaterally, which will make the US open to  charges of unfairness, Washington should be settling its  disputes through multilateral mechanisms under Gatt.  Unilateralism also violates the agreement reached at the  Uruguay Round of trade talks last December. If it is applied to  Japan, it can also be directed at other trading partners with  which the US has trade friction. If this happens, it will  undermine free trade, which must be preserved at all costs.    Super 301 is perhaps meant to pressure Japan ahead of the  market- opening measures it has promised to announce soon. But  by resorting to it, Washington is taking the obvious risk of  having to carry out its threat of sanctions if Tokyo fails to  make an offer that it considers acceptable. Even if it  retaliates selectively under that law, this will do considerable  harm to both sides at a time of economic slowdown. It will also  weaken their political and strategic ties, which are essential  for the stability of the Asia- Pacific region. Handling their  disputes outside multilateral forums also means that the  situation could get out of control since they are democracies  and, thus, vulnerable to domestic pressure groups and public  sentiment.    Fortunately, the procedures under Super 301 are such that it  could take more than a year before Washington can activate  punitive measures after it has blacklisted what it considers  offending partners. There is no imminent danger of trade  retaliation. But the issue must be resolved at the earliest to  prevent tension from building up to a dangerous level. It is  reassuring that President Bill Clinton wants to avoid sanctions,  which he conveyed to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on the  telephone before the law was announced. He has, nevertheless,  put the ball in Japan's court without waiting for Tokyo to make  its new offer.    Thus far, Japan has been indecisive in responding to US  calls  for greater market access. Rifts within the ruling coalition  have sapped its ability to govern effectively. Mr Hosokawa's  failure to reshuffle his divided Cabinet raises the question  whether he can act firmly to defuse tension with the US. He and  his coalition partners must heed the lead that has come from the  private sector. Toyota plans to import US car parts to observe  a voluntary target of US$6 billion in 1996. Other Japanese car  manufacturers are also expected to be forthcoming. But it is  imperative that the US does not make patently unfair demands,  such as managed trade, now that it has revived Super 301. As  the world's pre-eminent economic power, it must act responsibly.</p>

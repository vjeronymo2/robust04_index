			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAURENCE PETER DIES; THEORIZED ON INCOMPETENTS  </P> <P> Laurence J. Peter, the psychologist and professor of education whose 1969 book  "The Peter Principle" unmasked incompetents with searing satire and contributed  a phrase to the language, has died of complications from a stroke, his wife  said Sunday.  </P> <P> Peter, 70, had also suffered from heart trouble before he died in his sleep  Friday at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, said his wife, Irene. He had  suffered a stroke two years ago, she said.  </P> <P> With the publication of "The Peter Principle," its author became an  international celebrity with a runaway best-seller for the principle he  expounded: "In a hierarchy, individuals tend to rise to their level of  incompetence."  </P> <P> This means, he wrote, that if you can do your job to your superior's  satisfaction, you will be promoted. If you function appropriately in your new  position, you are eligible for promotion again.  </P> <P> Eventually, however, you will be promoted to a job you cannot do -- and there  you will remain, "bungling the job and eroding the competence of society."  </P> <P> In time, Peter noted, every post tends to be occupied by someone too  incompetent to carry out its duties.  </P> <P> And, he said, the only people who accomplish any useful work are those who have  not yet been promoted to their level of incompetence.  </P> <P> The Peter Principle took its place alongside Murphy's Law -- "Whatever can go  wrong will go wrong" -- and Parkinson's Law -- "Work expands to fill the time  available for its completion" -- as penetrating aphorisms for the technological  age.  </P> <P> Peter had written the book with free-lance writer Raymond Hull several years  before its publication, but 13 publishers rejected the manuscript -- proving  the book's central point.  </P> <P> The book had grown out of his hobby of writing satire as a respite from his  complex and difficult research on training teachers. After enduring the barrage  of rejection slips from publishers, Peter submitted an article to The Times,  applying the principle to California.  </P> <P> His examples -- Ronald Reagan took the oath of office three days before Gov.  Pat Brown's term expired, Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty was out of town when  Watts exploded in urban revolt -- left publishers "almost lining up at my  door," Peter once said. "So I just dusted off the manuscript and handed it to  the one I decided was the best."  </P> <P> The book sold more than 8 million copies, earning its author enough to retire  in 1970 to devote all of his time to exploring ways to improve teaching.  </P> <P> He also found time, however, to write several more "Peter" books, among them  "The Peter Prescription," "The Peter Plan," "Peter's Quotations," "Peter's  People and Their Marvelous Ideas," "Why Things Go Wrong" and "The Peter  Pyramid."  </P> <P> Peter was born in Vancouver, Canada, on Sept. 16, 1919 and grew up amid  poverty. His father, a railroad worker, died in a drowning accident.  </P> <P> "It was a primitive style of life," Peter once recalled. "In order to survive  we had to make everything functional, getting maximum use of our limited  resources.  </P> <P> "Our home was just a shack. We cut wood out of the bush to give us fuel. We  grew most of our food in the garden. It was unthinkable to waste anything."  </P> <P> He earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Western Washington State College  and a doctorate in education from Washington State University.  </P> <P> Peter taught in Vancouver's public schools and later as a psychologist at the  University of British Columbia.  </P> <P> He had long been preoccupied with the study of teacher competence -- he called  it his life's work -- and he set out to initiate some reforms in the way  teachers were prepared at the University of British Columbia in 1963.  </P> <P> "The lack of sequential, cumulative step-learning continued to amaze me," he  told The Times in a 1975 interview. "Student teachers were told to observe  children, given time to observe children -- but never, ever shown how to  observe children."  </P> <P> In 1966 he moved to Los Angeles where he had accepted a job as professor of  education at USC -- a post that enabled him to continue the project begun in  British Columbia. The result was the four-volume study "Competencies for  Teaching: System of Accountability for Teacher Education."  </P> <P> Peter said tests and studies with his system "can improve teacher performance  and student learning by, in some cases, several hundred percent."  </P> <P> Along with his wife, Peter is survived by two sons, John and Edward Peter of  British Columbia, and two daughters, Alice Boren of Falls Church, Va., and  Margaret Denney of British Columbia.  </P> <P> There will be no services.

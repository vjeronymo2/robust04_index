			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Livestock shipping ban 'may cost farmers Pounds 200m' British farmers stand to lose up to Pounds 200m a year in trade from bans on the export of live animals to the Continent imposed by ferry companies. The figure was given yesterday by the Association of Livestock Exporters one the eve of today's start of the ban by P&amp;O. There was more bad news for farmers yesterday as it became clear that a new service for transporting live animals was unlikely to be able to start immediately. MDT Holdings, a London-based shipping company, plans to unveil a service from Harwich to get around the ban on live exports which has now been imposed by most large ferry companies. However, the agriculture ministry said yesterday that the company's vessel had not yet been approved by its inspectors and was unlikely to receive the go-ahead for a service to begin today. 'The company hasn't submitted any formal papers for export yet,' the ministry said. P&amp;O introduced its ban because it was unconvinced by tough measures introduced by Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, to improve the treatment of live animals on long journeys. 'We are looking to Brussels for some action - there needs to be European-Union-wide enforcement of the measures,' it said. The ban in effect cuts off business for UK farmers, as the company carried 60 per cent of live exports. Stena Sealink and Brittany Ferries, with 10 per cent of the market each, have already introduced bans - although Brittany's ban covers only animals destined for immediate slaughter. Livestock markets are already feeling the effects of the ban. The Meat and Livestock Commission, the industry's marketing body, reports prices for Friesian bull calves down 30 per cent this week to Pounds 99 a head against the same week last year. Prices have dropped sharply in recent months from Pounds 170 per animal at the end of June. This can be explained partly by a seasonal increase in cattle coming to market, but much of the drop in the market is attributed to uncertainty among farmers over the ferry ban.</p>

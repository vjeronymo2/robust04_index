			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Prudential buys 25% of Thai Sethakit Life Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, has bought a 24.99 per cent stake in Thai Sethakit Life for about Pounds 13m cash, and plans to bid for further shares. Thai rules do not allow Prudential to acquire a stake of more than 25 per cent in TS Life, and the tender offer will be made jointly with the Khun Goanpot Asvinichit. Prudential bought the stake from the Asvinichit family, which still controls a significant part of the company following the sale of 7.72m shares. The tender offer is expected to begin in February, and will involve a bid of Bt65 per share - the same price as recently paid. Prudential is hoping to acquire a further 10 per cent of the company through the joint offer. At present, TS Life is the second smallest of the 12 Thai insurance companies, with about 0.7 per cent of the market. Prudential believes that in seven years this can be increased to a share of about 7.5 per cent through organic growth, and that the market itself has great capacity for growth. Only about 7 per cent of Thais are insured. TS Life has set up a working team to decide how to maximise the benefits of the alliance. It is likely that Prudential will provide TS Life with technical support, international expertise, new product development, computer systems, training, marketing and management skills. Representatives of the UK insurer are intended to join the TS Life board shortly. Prudential already has operations in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, has highlighted the opportunities for growth in the Asia Pacific markets, compared with Europe. He believes there will not be a pan-European medium and long-term savings market until after 2000.</p>

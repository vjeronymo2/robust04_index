			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Bonds: SNCF issue underlines demand for long maturities THE appetite of investors for French franc bonds continued to draw issuers to the international market yesterday, with SNCF, the French state-backed rail company, launching an innovative FFr3bn 31-year issue with warrants. The deal, the longest maturity Eurobond ever issued, underlined the enthusiasm of investment institutions for long-duration exposure to the French market. On Wednesday, Finland launched a FFr4bn 11-year issue. The debt warrants, which offer investors the right to buy new bonds fungible with yesterday's issue, offer additional 'geared' exposure to market. Lead-managed by Paribas Capital Markets, the deal sold mainly to big portfolio investors in Europe. The bonds pay a coupon of 8 7/8 per cent and the bond-plus-warrant package was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 98.71. At this level the paper yields 30 basis points more than the French government OAT maturing 2023. If all the warrants are exercised on February 11 next year, when holders can buy additional bonds at 99.55, the issue will grow to FFr4.5bn. Bankers expected the warrants trade separately from the bonds, creating a liquid derivative instrument on the long end of the French market. Elsewhere, the strong tone of the Australian bond market attracted borrowers. The Australian government bond market rallied overnight following the release of poor unemployment statistics. The figures increased speculation that the government will ease monetary conditions again, following a  3/4 point cut in rates last week. Credit Local, the financing agency for French local government, launched a ADollars 250m five-year global bond issue, which can be traded in both domestic and international markets. The deal, lead-managed by Hambros, carries a 7 1/2 per cent coupon and was priced to yield 20 basis points more than Australian government bonds of the same maturity. The bonds are used by many institutional investors as a proxy for government debt. Hambros also lead-managed a ADollars 125m, 10-year issue for Banque Nationale de Paris. The bonds carry a higher 9 per cent coupon and attracted primarily retail investors. Another retail-targeted deal was launched by Guinness Finance, lead-managed by NatWest Capital Markets. The 8.25 per cent six-year bonds were priced to yield 53 basis points more than government paper. Both deals were seen as tightly priced by participants, but likely to sell over time. The Canadian dollar sector has also rallied this week, spurred by an agreement between the provinces on constitutional reform. Eurofima launched a CDollars 150m three-year issue, lead-managed by Goldman Sachs International. The top triple-A credit rating of the issuer attracted investors, despite the low 6 1/2 per cent coupon on the bonds. The World Bank fixed a 5 7/8 per cent semi-annual coupon and 99.425 issue price on its Dollars 1.5bn five-year global bond issue launched on Wednesday. At this level the bonds yield 5 basis points more than US treasury bonds, at the lower end of the indicated range. Salomon Brothers yesterday launched the first warrants on loans to Poland. The warrants give investors the right to buy loans covered by Poland's debt deferral and restructuring agreement (DDRA) with its principle commercial creditors at 26 per cent of face value. Yesterday, Polish DDRA debt was trading just above this level in the secondary market.</p>

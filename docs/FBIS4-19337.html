			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Government Must Respect Labor </F> Accords, Ciampi Says"]    [Text] (ANSA) Verona, April 15 -- Outgoing Prime Minister  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on Friday [15 April] praised the agreements  reached last summer with trade unions and private employers and  indirectly warned future governments not to renege on them.    Speaking at a conference of private industrialists, the  former central bank chief gave an overview of his one year in  the premier's office, saying that popular consensus around his  executive was obtained thanks to the "triangle" formed by  government, business and unions in times of decision-making.  "Governments come and go but the players in the economic scene  remain to guarantee the agreements made," Ciampi said, stressing  that respect of the accords is also "a guarantee of social  peace, economic development and financial stability."    Trade union leaders have recently expressed fears that the  new right-wing government, expected to replace Ciampi after new  parliamentary speakers are elected, may decide, in the name of  neo-liberal free market ideology, not to comply with two accords  signed in 1992 and 1993 by the government, the private  employers' association Confindustria [General Confederation of  Italian Industry], and the three major trade union federations.    In his address, Ciampi commented that those who profess  abstract free-market ideologies may see the "triangle" as a form  of elitist "associationship" responsible for all of Italy's  problems and that must be done away with, but he emphasized that  there is a difference between this form of associationship and  "consensus." The former, Ciampi said, "weakens autonomy and  responsibility, damages decisions and prevents the government's  work from being seen as action." The latter, he said, "is the  sort of air a democratic government should always breathe in a  complex and difficult democracy with an open market."    Ciampi then recounted the achievements and actions of his  government since he was sworn into office on April 29, 1993,  stressing the issues of industrial relations, public finances  and privatizations. He said his economic policies focused on  five topics: labor market wages and policies; monetary and  exchange policies; righting public finances; privatizations and  industrial relations; public administration reforms. "All of it  aimed at re-launching the economy and increasing employment," he  said.    Ciampi claimed that the "basic conditions for a boost in  production" have been created thanks to lower interest rates,  lower labor costs, a more flexible job market, a "more  competitive" currency, monetary stability and an influx of  capital into the bond market.    Commenting on recommendations by conservative economic  experts (and campaign promises by right-wing parties) to slash  taxes, Ciampi said it would be very difficult to reduce fiscal  pressure without incisive and further spending cuts.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Housing bodies to fight fraud THE HOUSING Corporation, the regulatory body covering Britain's 2,200 housing associations, has urged its members to review their audit procedures after a large-scale fraud at one of the biggest associations. The fraud at Circle 33, estimated to have netted between Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 1m, was discovered in its eastern area maintenance department. Mr Grahame Coleman, in charge of contracts in the office, and Mr Graham Dossell, a building contractor whose company carried out much of the work under investigation, have been traced by detectives to Thailand after they disappeared from their jobs earlier in the year. Police, who want to question the men about the fraud, have sent a dossier to the Crown Prosecution Service. They are hoping to apply for extradition of the two men. Circle 33 provides low-cost rented housing for more than 8,500 households, mainly in London and the home counties. The association said yesterday that it had centralised its maintenance contracting work and introduced new controls. The fraud, involving over-invoicing on contracts, led to the Housing Corporation suspending Circle 33's 1993/94 programme of works worth Pounds 43m, including a Pounds 27m grant from the corporation. The programme was reinstated in August after the association introduced new safeguards.</p>

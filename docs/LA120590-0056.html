			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'OPERATION SMOKER' NETS POLLUTERS AT SAN YSIDRO  </P> <P> In an attempt to clean up the noxious air that often envelopes the San Ysidro  border crossing, drivers of cars that spew too much exhaust were issued  citations Tuesday as they entered the United States.  </P> <P> U.S. Customs Service inspectors ordered 292 vehicles to pull into an inspection  lot, where state law enforcement officers waited, said Customs spokeswoman  Bobbie Cassidy.  </P> <P> The drivers were singled out because their cars were emitting smoke or because  the driver didn't have proper identification or vehicle registration.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol and the state Department of Motor Vehicles issued  more than 160 citations during the crackdown, which was held from 6 a.m. to  noon, Cassidy said. Sixteen were for excessive exhaust only, and the rest were  for excessive exhaust and other vehicle violations, including expired  registration tags and failure to show proof of insurance.  </P> <P> Many cars entering the United States from Mexico do not meet U.S. emissions  standards and are major contributors to the growing air pollution problem in  San Ysidro, Cassidy said. The pollution is concentrated at the 24-lane San  Ysidro Port of Entry, where one out of four cars waited more than 25 minutes to  get through in September. Workers suffered from nausea, headaches, runny eyes  and noses, she said.  </P> <P> Although Customs inspectors can check a license plate number against a  computerized database to see if a vehicle has been reported stolen or involved  in a crime, the database has no information about vehicle code violations, so  inspectors can't check for outstanding citations, Cassidy said.  </P> <P> After a vehicle code violation is issued, it is up to the courts and the  district attorney to deal with the offender. A CHP spokesman said the citations  for excessive exhaust require a court appearance and proof that the problem has  been corrected.  </P> <P> This was the fourth time that the three agencies got together for "Operation  Smoker," said Customs spokesman Jim Brown. The first was in October, and more  sessions are planned.  </P> <P> "It's a constant problem," he said.  </P></p>

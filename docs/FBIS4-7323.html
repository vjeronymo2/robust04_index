			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 25 Apr -- The hunger strike that was  maintained for two weeks in the center of the Mongolian capital  by representatives of opposition parties calling for the  government's resignation ended today. This development follows  Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray's refusal to sign  with the activists the document they had insisted upon. At his  meeting with the hunger strikers he justified his refusal by  saying that neither the country's Constitution nor the law on  government contained any provisions about prior conclusion of  agreements with individuals or organizations on the resignation  of the cabinet of ministers.    The prime minister urged the hunger strikers to respect the  stand taken by the president, the recommendations brought by the  National Security Council, and the decision passed by  parliament, who all asked them to end their action.    At the same time the government pledged to take into  consideration a number of demands issued by the hunger strikers.  Laws on press freedom and on the struggle against corruption are  to be drafted in the near future.</p>

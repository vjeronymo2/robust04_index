			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by independent analyst Andrey Novikov: "Engineer </F> Kurginyan's Hyperboloid: This `Thing' Is Somewhat Stronger Than  Prokhanov's DEN, but Even the Latter Comes a Distant Second to  the Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia"]    [Text] Rybinsk--Lyudmila Chernaya drew an analogy in  LITERATURNAYA GAZETA of 17 November between the beer-hall putsch  in Germany and the events of 3-4 October in Russia.    The talk about Russian fascism is undoubtedly topical. But  it  should at the same time be grasped that the cancerous tumor of  fascism can no longer, in my view, be surgically removed.    It seems to me that Yeltsin gave the opposition  carte-blanche  in that... he smashed it. Everyone understands that there has  been no real crushing defeat. But the confrontation has turned  into some new, very dangerous channel.    Let us look at the situation from the viewpoint of political  metaphysics. If something is uttered and put on screen by the  mass media, it actually exists, consequently. DEN actually  exists. It expresses some innermost social intention, not yet  realized but already identified. This is why DEN continues to  appear under a different name. Combating the red-browns with the  aid of a curfew is utter nonsense (I'm afraid that the curfew  itself could become red-brown.) To ideology we need to  counterpose ideology. An adequate measure of talent. A  counter-Dugin, counter-Prokhanov, counter-Kurginyan is needed.  This is very serious--historical victory is measured always not  by social support but the measure of talent. They have already  become fashionable. DEN's jokes are already being retold in the  smoking-rooms. This is what is most frightening, for the main  function of fashion is reproduction.    It is possible, for that matter, that the most odious  variety  of fascism, this entire red-brown theater treading mainly the  Moscow boards, has, truly, ceased to exist. It is possible that  it can be banned even. But what of this?    In 1923 Hitler staged a "beer-hall putsch" and came to power  10 years later. We must reconsider the highly prevalent view of  the genesis of fascism, according to which fascism is some  byproduct of political modernization, a marginal stratum  inevitable at a time of major historical reforms. In actual  fact, fascism is the result not of a "transitional period" but  of national revanche.    The most difficult time for Germany were the 1920's--peak  inflation, peak unemployment. Political marginals in the form of  the Hitler party and two dozen such organizations emerged. But  at this time Hitler remained on the fringe of politics. He came  to power only in 1933, when Germany had entered a period of  economic upturn and national revanche. Hitler knew how to  harness the vector of this revanche and conclude an alliance  with Germany's financial and industrial elite, and only for this  reason was he successful.    Russian fascism may come to power only as Russian  revanchism,  that is, as a phenomenon more complex than what we have thus  far. It is essential to recognize that what happened was not  simply the defeat of communism but the national defeat of  Russia, a most powerful geopolitical collapse and a loss of the  character of political subject bordering on national  nonexistence.    I am a conservative in this respect and think in traditional  categories, we will never remove the geopolitical component. It  is necessary, therefore, to prepare for the worst--a Russian  conservative revolution. A conservative revolution is not in  itself tantamount to fascism but something similar inevitably  awaits us. National collapse is the dreadful prologue to a  Russian Reich. The spring is coiled to the maximum, just a  little more, and it will begin to unwind with terrifying force,  sweeping aside all in its path.    Russian fascism may come to power only by having imbibed new  energies: liberal, oligarchic, criminal. It is at the  intersections between Russian liberalism, Russian  fundamentalism, and the Russian criminal world that the outline  of the future Russian Reich will emerge. Of course, this will be  an entirely different generation of fascists, new leaders and a  new ideology. It is not Prokhanov, who has condemned himself to  small-time opposition theatrics, who will be the winner. The  winner will be Kurginyan.    Prokhanov fought modernization to the bitter end and was  swept aside by it, simply having failed to understand its entire  historical inevitability. Kurginyan, on the other hand, will  join the ranks of this modernization, harness it and channel it  in the right direction. Kurginyan is the man who knows how to  conclude an alliance with Russia's financial and industrial  elite, as Hitler did on the eve of his accession to power.    Strictly speaking, it is not a question of Hitler at all but  of Krupp. As long as the red-browns are smashing shop windows,  they are not dangerous. They will become dangerous when Mr.  Borovoy or Mr. Khizha concludes a deal with them. You think this  is not possible? Look at Zhirinovskiy, look at Dmitriy  Vasilyev--they have already become integrated in Yeltsinism.  They are being viewed askance as yet, but sooner or later our  entrepreneurs, our Krupp, will have need of patriotism. The most  important techniques today are ideological techniques. The  Kurginyan center is producing just such techniques.    It is now important to launch a preventive ideological  strike  against the Russian Reich and to create a conceptual SDI around  it. Otherwise yet another red wheel awaits us....</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Many jobs are 'filled by word of mouth' NEARLY half of all job vacancies in Britain are filled through informal 'word of mouth' contact, according to Mr Mike Fogden, chief executive of the Employment Service, the agency which runs government Jobcentres. Mr Fogden said that between 40 per cent and 45 per cent of jobs are filled by informal contacts. The agency, which he has run since 1987, accounts for about 30 per cent of placements, with the rest covered by classified advertising and private agencies. He said that as many as 25 per cent of the workforce may have experienced unemployment between April 1990 when joblessness started rising and February this year when it fell. The total number of new claimants of unemployment benefit since April 1990 is 13.2m - but that includes many people who have been counted more than once. Mr Fogden said that the broader geographical and occupational spread of unemployment in the recession 'may have been a factor in the early fall in the jobless figure'. In the recession of the early 1980s the jobless were concentrated in declining industrial regions far from where jobs were being created, while in the latest recession the jobless have been closer to new jobs, he explained. However, Mr Fogden warned that the proportion of people out of work for more than one year will rise to about 40 per cent of the jobless total from the current figure of just over 30 per cent. Currently, said Mr Fogden, about 25 per cent of all the unemployed are back to work within one month and two-thirds are back within six months. Jobcentres deal with only about 20 per cent of vacancies in the London region, but up to 80 per cent in parts of northern England. The centres concentrate on finding jobs for semi-skilled and skilled manual workers and clerical staff. They deal only rarely with employees earning more than Pounds 25,000 per year. Mr Fogden said that about 70 per cent of his staff deal with benefits and 30 per cent with job placement. The Employment Service's market share of job placements has risen slightly during the recession. The service has been widely praised in recent years for an improvement in image and performance. Yet critics say that it has simply found ways to push more people off the unemployment register.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO MOVE WEST, SAYS RATHER  </P> <P> Dan Rather, while discussing CBS' increased emphasis on coverage of Japan and  the Pacific Rim, was asked if he thought the day might come when a network news  program such as his would move West permanently to better cover the East.  </P> <P> It's unlikely, he said, although "I've urged us to do this for years, to move  to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "But I'm the only person around there who believes it's a practical idea," he  added. "Some people laugh at me, and others call for the guys in the white  coats from Bellevue."  </P> <P> Relocating from New York doesn't seem to be in the cards, he said, noting that  it would cost a lot of money. Another important reason: New York is still the  home of the networks' parent corporations.  </P> <P> "Power," he said, "is in direct proportion to proximty.....With the corporate  network headquarters in New York, it makes a lot of sense for the news  divisions, all three, to remain headquartered there."  </P></p>

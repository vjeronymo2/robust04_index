			<p>BFN     [Text] London, Al-Tayr [April] 9, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY  -- The American assistant secretary of state for international  security said in a press statement on Thursday that Iraq, Iran,  Libya and North Korea must be prevented from obtaining some  types of sensitive technology.    America suffers from power-mania, practices a strange racial  discrimination, deals with world resources and peoples' rights  in a tragic manner and mankind are being threatened as a result  of American behaviour.</p>

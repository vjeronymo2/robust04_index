			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Status quo on taxes is not perfect but it's the best we have Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, December 15) quotes my conclusion to Paying for Public Spending: is there a Role for Earmarked Taxes? (Fiscal Studies, November 1994), which rejects large-scale earmarking in favour of the current practice of spending from general revenues, and comments: 'It is precisely this unrealistic demand for omniscience by governments which convinces some of us that there must be a better way.' However, I did not 'demand omniscience'. My support for the status quo was not unqualified. In particular, I wrote 'scepticism that earmarking would not greatly promote democracy is not a rejection of the public choice 'black box' criticism of the traditional approach'. I do not think that it is perfect, but it is the best we have. The political right wants earmarking to lead to opting out and privatisation. However, James Buchanan (guru of the right, a leader of the public choice school and critic of big government), in a seminal paper on earmarked taxes, drew attention to the variety of practical and cost problems which made him very tentative about recommending earmarking. In particular, he noted that if decision-making costs were included in the segregated revenues model this might make it 'inefficient' relative to consolidated revenue schemes'. He also pointed out that services that benefited sub-groups in the community (eg education, health services) would suffer from earmarking. I think that the right, which expects that earmarking would lead to spending cuts and opting out, is more likely to be correct than those, like the Liberal Democrats, who think that it would get people to pay taxes more willingly.

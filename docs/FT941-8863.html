			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Canon hurt by strong yen Canon, a leading Japanese camera and office equipment maker, reported its first profit decline in seven years for the year ended last December, due to the yen's sharp rise against the dollar. Canon said that in spite of efforts to restructure its operations so that it would be able to make profits at an exchange rate of Y100 to the dollar, annual parent pre-tax profits plunged 51.5 per cent to Y37.4bn (Dollars 362m), due to Y1.1bn in foreign exchange losses. The company said it managed to offset 80 per cent of its foreign exchange losses by increasing its prices and cutting costs. But sales, 79 per cent of which derives from exports, fell 2.5 per cent to Y1,036.9bn, while operating profits declined 32.5 per cent to Y44.1bn. After-tax profits fell 49.8 per cent to Y20.3bn. Sales of copiers fell 5.3 per cent to Y315.1bn and information equipment fell 6.7 per cent to Y106.7bn, but its mainstay computer printers rose 7.3 per cent to Y435.1bn. Camera sales plunged 20.7 per cent to Y132.6bn due to price cuts amid the current downturn in the domestic economy. For the current year, Canon hopes an increase in computer printer sales will help its performance. On the assumption that the yen stands at Y107 against the dollar and Y65 against the German mark, the company is forecasting a 6.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y40bn on a 3.1 per cent increase in sales to Y1,070bn. After-tax profits are expected to rise 8.3 per cent to Y22bn.</p>

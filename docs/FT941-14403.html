			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Loss worse than expected at AMR AMR, parent company of American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, slumped into worse-than-expected after-tax losses of Dollars 253m in its fourth quarter after a brief period of profitability in the proceeding two quarters. The main reason for the losses was a damaging strike by the airline's flight attendants which lost the company nearly all its passenger revenue for five days in November. AMR said yesterday the strike had cost Dollars 190m, compared with its earlier estimates of Dollars 160m. It had warned the strike would bring fourth-quarter losses and the company would show a loss for the year but the figures were worse than most analysts had predicted. The share price rose Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 71 1/2 as investors looked to a recovery in the airline's performance in the current year. Fourth-quarter revenues were up at Dollars 3.59bn from Dollars 3.58bn, while the net losses of Dollars 253m, equivalent to Dollars 3.55 a share, compared with losses in the previous year's fourth quarter of Dollars 200m, or Dollars 2.66. AMR said the latest figures had been hit by restructuring and other charges costing Dollars 62m, or 82 cents a share. For the full year, revenue rose to Dollars 15.8bn from Dollars 14.4bn and net losses fell to Dollars 110m from Dollars 935m. Losses per share were down to Dollars 2.23 from Dollars 12.49. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines will keep a 20 per cent stake in the ordinary share capital of Northwest Airlines after Northwest's share issue, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. The Dutch flag carrier said it would exchange Northwest preference shares into new ordinary shares to maintain its stake in the US airline, which announced a Dollars 400m stock initial public offering.</p>

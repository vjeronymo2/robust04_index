			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Man in the News: Crown prince of Camelot - Tim Holley The pictorial coverage of the UK National Lottery announcement this week was evenly split between Richard Branson the Loser, and Sir Ron Dearing the Winner. The Virgin chairman was photographed in various disconsolate poses while Sir Ron, chairman of Camelot, the winning consortium, was doing the things photographers expect winners to do - waving his arms in the air, or offering champagne toasts to the camera. In a few pictures there was another man, smiling less extravagantly: Tim Holley, the 54-year-old chief executive of Camelot, who put the bid together, saw off seven rivals and who is responsible for making sure that the first multi-million draw of the lottery goes ahead as planned, probably on Saturday, November 12. It will almost certainly be Sir Ron, former chairman of the Post Office and chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, and the Northern Development Company, who will be handing out cheques that turn ordinary citizens into millionaires most weeks of the year. Behind him Holley, calm, undemonstrative, will be running, if forecasts prove correct, a start-up business with revenues of Pounds 32bn over the next seven years. From that, Pounds 9bn will go to the government's 'good causes' - the arts, charities, the national heritage, a fund to mark the millennium, and sports. Colleagues describe Holley, whose gambling has been limited to an occasional bet at a horse race, as 'exceptionally clear-minded and focused', and 'very steady under fire'. Outside the computer industry, the former chairman of Racal Data Communications group is hardly a national business name, yet his meticulous preparation and planning put Camelot well ahead of the other bidders and created an unambiguous winner. Camelot was the first to begin large-scale recruiting of staff within weeks of the formal bids being submitted on February 14. Interviews were conducted and conditional offers made. The job offers have now been confirmed and the pivotal staff will report for work on Monday week. 'We have done a rigorous amount of planning and testing, and we started to produce our applications as soon as the draft invitations to apply came out,' Holley says. During his career he picked up several skills relevant to launching a national lottery. After school in Somerset, his first job was as a Barclays Bank trainee. He thus has some knowledge of retailing and life in the high street. He then worked in computer programming and marketing at ICL, the computer group, before spending the last 12 years at Racal, where he specialised in data communications. He led the team that won a government data network service contract, linking government departments, that could be worth Pounds 400m to Racal over 10 years. More intriguingly, while in his 20s, Holley set up his own think-tank to suggest ideas on raising money for a charity he was associated with - the Muscular Dystrophy Group. Charity balls were organised. Several million pounds were raised by ideas such as persuading pubs to compete against each other to see which could come up with the most cash. A show business personality then presented a cup to the winner. 'You put charity collection boxes in pubs and nothing happens,' says Holley. But give people the chance to compete, the chance to win and the money rolls in. Holley represented Racal in talks with potential shareholders of the lottery consortium, and three approached him separately, asking if he would become chief executive. 'Then Ernie Harrison (Sir Ernest Harrison, Racal chairman,) came to me and asked whether I would be prepared to be chief executive, and whether I would be acceptable to the other shareholders,' says Holley, who has been running companies with several thousand employees for years. 'Clearly, running something that will affect people all over the country is something rather different, and that's a new challenge,' he says. The strength of Camelot, he believes, is that all the partners - Cadbury Schweppes, Racal Electronics, ICL, De La Rue, the banknote and document printer, and G-Tech, the US lottery equipment manufacturer - have all brought contributions to the consortium. Racal has a communications network which handles information for 42 government departments; ICL has a manufacturing base to make G-Tech lottery terminals in the UK; De La Rue has security expertise; and Cadbury has contributed retail knowledge. Already the lottery is off and running, although details of the licence have still to be hammered out with Mr Peter Davis, director of the National Lottery. The planned launch date may slip a week because it is on Remembrance Day weekend. BBC1, which will probably carry the lottery draw, traditionally broadcasts the commemoration live from the Royal Albert Hall. Retail outlets are being signed up daily. The total is approaching 2,000, including the Post Office and chain stores. Camelot also hopes to hold discussions with Marks and Spencer, which reserved its position on the lottery until the winner was announced. The announcement has prompted a surge of interest, with so many calls coming into Camelot's temporary headquarters in Windsor - 1,200 on Thursday alone - that special message desks have been set up. 'I think two-thirds of the adult population will play within the first year, although not every week,' says Holley. 'People will play regularly and get a lot of excitement and I think that's wonderful, at the same time as raising a lot of money for good causes.' Unlike some of his customers, however, Holley will have to continue working for a living. There will be no windfall for him. Along with the rest of the Camelot staff, he will be banned from paying Pounds 1 to choose six numbers out of 49 to take part in their own lottery. 'It's a penalty of the job,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAB GUNMEN SLAY ACTING MAYOR IN WEST BANK TOWN  </P> <P> Masked Palestinians shot and killed the Israeli-appointed deputy mayor of a  West Bank town Saturday evening because he had defied activists' orders to  resign.  </P> <P> The masked assailants burst into the home of Deputy Mayor Yusuf Mohammed Milhem  of Qalqiliya and shot him at least six times in the chest, Arab reports said.  </P> <P> An army spokesman said Milhem, 46, was rushed to an Israeli hospital, where he  died of his wounds. An Israeli army spokesman said police have begun an  investigation.  </P> <P> Milhem and his house had been attacked several times by activists demanding  that he resign. In January, 1989, while he was being treated at Qalqiliya  Hospital, masked men entered his room and stabbed him.  </P> <P> Milhem's superior, the mayor of Qalqiliya, moved to a nearby Israeli town after  he was threatened for refusing to resign. The underground leadership of the  Palestinian uprising has repeatedly called on Israeli-appointed officials to  leave their posts.  </P> <P> After the shooting, the army ordered all the people in the area into a nearby  field for questioning, Palestinian sources said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a knife-wielding Arab passenger stabbed the Israeli driver of a bus  and tried to force the vehicle off the road at the same site where 16 people  were killed in a similar attack last June.  </P> <P> Other passengers grabbed the attacker and the bus remained on the road,  according to news reports.  </P> <P> In the occupied territories, Palestinians brought business and transportation  to a standstill Saturday in a general strike to mark the beginning of the 22nd  month of the uprising against Israeli occupation. The army said Nablus, the  West Bank's largest town, was under curfew for the eighth consecutive day as  troops and security agents searched for uprising activists.  </P> <P> An off-duty Israeli police dog handler was burned badly when a Molotov cocktail  was thrown at his car, police said.  </P> <P> Reuven Perlmutter, 28, who was driving alone, received burns over 25% of his  body and was in serious but stable condition in an Israeli hospital.  </P> <P> Israel Radio said four suspects had been detained.  </P></p>

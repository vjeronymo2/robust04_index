			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Observer: Gloss on the presidency Whatever next? Not only has the normally staid Royal Institute of International Affairs burst into glossy colour with its pamphlet to mark Britain's EC presidency, but there's a cartoon on the very front page. Captioned 'Multi-Speed Europe? The Community Beyond Maastricht', it shows European leaders roaring down the road away from the once little-known Dutch town. Helmut Kohl's Mercedes hogs pole position hotly pursued by Francois Mitterrand, whose Citroen is slipstreamed by John Major's Rolls. Other member-states follow in a huddle, except Denmark which has slewed off the road in a cloud of steam. Way back, still approaching Maastricht, is a minibus marked Efta, while far in the rear rumbles eastern Europe, an ancient lorry belching noxious fumes. The glitzy brochure comes courtesy of RTZ, neighbour of the institute (familiarly known as Chatham House) in St James's Square. At a meeting there to mark the presidency, Chatham House members were warned by Niels Ersboll, secretary general of the EC Council of Ministers, that the Danish No-vote was a problem that 'can only be solved by Danes', who, he said, 'must reflect on what it could mean, and come forward with proposals'. Since Ersboll is himself Danish, his job could well depend on the outcome.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok June 16 ITAR-TASS -- The Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS] is about to set up a special  department to detect and detain criminals, FCS chief Sergey  Stepashin said at a press conference in Vladivostok today. He  also said the special services of Japan, North Korea and China  have stepped up their activities in the Maritime Territory.    Responding to an ITAR-TASS question about interaction  between  the local branches of the Federal Counterintelligence Service  and the local internal affairs authorities in light of the  president's decree on emergency measures of protecting people  from gangs of bandits and other forms of organised crime,  Stepashin said he would sign an agreement with the Interior  Minister Viktor Yerin next week to boost interaction and divide  powers between the two government agencies.    According to Stepashin, it has been decided to put an end  "to  certain competition between the agencies". Counterintelligence  agents will tackle corruption in the top echelons of state power  and jointly with the Interior Ministry will trace a number of  organised criminal groups active in in the field of  international terrorism and the narcobusiness. The Federal  Counterintelligence service will help the Interior Ministry also  by supplying it with special equipment.    Stepashin said the president would soon sign a decree  setting  up a special department within the service in the centre and its  territorial branches in the regions of the Russian Federation.  They will enable the counterintelligence service to take direct  part in detecting, detaining and destroying those who encroach  on the law, human life and rights.    Stepashin said the president's decree was "very tough" and  expressed confidence that it would be supported by an absolute  majority of people in Russia. "But on one condition - if  tangible results are achieved. If the Federal  Counterintelligence Service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs  and the prosecutor's office of the Russian Federation fail to  implement the decree, the question will have to be raised about  personal responsibility".    Stepashin left for Nakhodka today.</p>

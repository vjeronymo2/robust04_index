			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / People: Harvey Nichols' Maney replaced by Wan The replacement of Dick Maney, managing director of Harvey Nichols, with the group finance director of its new Hong Kong parent Dickson Concepts, surprised and saddened the London retailing community yesterday. When young businessman Dickson Poon took over every Sloane Ranger's favourite store last August, he promised 'no dramatic or immediate changes'. Yesterday, the new managing director 38-year-old Joseph Wan alleged that 'someone from Hong Kong can be more effective and efficient' in carrying out Dickson Concepts' plans in Europe. Maney, a stylish and talented American retailer, was brought in by John Hoerner, then chairman of Debenhams, from Lord &amp; Taylor in 1987, and was credited with successfully enlivening the upmarket fashion store. Only in April he was giving details of the store's plans for the future and claiming 'we are delighted that in the present economic climate Harvey Nichols can have such a positive approach to 1992'. But, increasingly, he must have found that approach being dictated by head office. Wan, who qualified as a chartered accountant with Peat Marwick in London, and worked for the firm also in Hong Kong, says the idea - greeted by other experienced retailers with some scepticism - is 'to take Harvey Nichols further upmarket'. Wan joined Dickson Concepts as group finance director five years ago; he steps down from that position and says he is in London to look after 'existing and future strategy' of the Hong Kong group in Europe. Immediate plans include two new restaurants and a food hall - all located on the fifth floor - as well as a boutique opening in Hong Kong. Harvey Nichols cost Dickson Poon Pounds 60m last year, and Wan says he must 'achieve a profit level to justify the investment'. 'I do have some retailing experience,' he adds in competent though not immaculate English. 'We have over 100 retail outlets, and I have participated in the management of them. Dickson Concepts also has exclusive distribution rights in the Far East for many of the famous brands Harvey Nichols carries.' ***** Christopher O'Donnell (right), md of SMITH &amp; NEPHEW's medical division, has been appointed to the main board. ***** Brian Onions, formerly finance director of Glynwed's leisure division, has been appointed md of EARTHSPAN, part of Kingsway Group, and Clifford Fudge its technical director. ***** Ronald Reid has been appointed finance director of TAKARE. ***** Jeremy Campbell, formerly director of human resources at Rothmans International, has been appointed company secretary and solicitor of EAST MIDLAND ELECTRICITY on the retirement of Derek Wells. ***** John Henderson, a member of the World Health Organisation advisory panel on mental health, has been appointed director of the Mental Health Foundation's grants and projects division. ***** Jim Beeston, deputy chief executive of Birmingham Heartlands Ltd, has been appointed chief executive of the BIRMINGHAM HEARTLANDS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. ***** Steve Bernard, a former md of RCA/Columbia Pictures Video UK, has been appointed md of INGRAM ENTERTAINMENT; he succeeds Raymond Laren. ***** Jon Edis-Bates, formerly group company secretary of Bunzl, has been appointed group company secretary of FORTE on the retirement of Tom Russell. ***** William Woodward, formerly assistant group secretary of Blackwood Hodge, has been appointed company secretary of BRITISH FITTINGS GROUP. ***** Roger Wain, currently non-executive chairman, has been appointed executive chairman of FERROMET GROUP.</p>

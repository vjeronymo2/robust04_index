			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (15): The start of a process - Summit is 'a unique opportunity,' says Michael Howard MICHAEL HOWARD, the UK's new environment minister, claims to have played a special role in the realisation of the Rio Summit. It was during his recent trip to Washington that the US agreed to the proposed Convention on Climate Change which opened the way for President Bush to say he would attend Rio. Whether or not Mr Howard was the honest broker who brought this about, he maintains that the compromises made on the convention were well worth it in order to get the US on board. 'It is very important that the US is going to Rio,' he says. 'All should be involved in this event.' Not that Mr Howard has had a chance to build up a track record on the environment. He only got the job after the Conservatives won the election in April, having previously held positions in the trade and employment departments. And he was quickly denounced by the green lobby for engineering a sell-out over the Climate Convention. But Mr Howard is prepared to lay considerable store by Rio - 'it is a unique opportunity which must not be squandered,' he says. Although he hopes to see 'meaningful agreements' signed in Rio, he stresses that 'it is not the end but the start of a process.' Efficient arrangements will have to be put in place after the event to monitor the implementation of the agreements. As a representative of one of the leading industrial countries, he will be under pressure in Rio to contribute to the enormous funding requirements of the Third World to meet environmental targets. But this is one subject on which he prefers not to comment in detail. 'The UK commitments remain to be seen,' he says. He recalls that the Tories' election manifesto committed the UK to increasing its aid to the equivalent of 0.7 per cent of GNP. And his predecessor, Michael Heseltine, pledged that the UK would make 'new and additional funds' available for Rio. But, as Michael Howard points out, there was no timetable. Mr Howard is not alone among environment ministers from the developed world who are reluctant to show their hands ahead of what are likely to be tough negotiations over the money. And this heightens the danger that the Rio Summit will fail to deliver on its promises. Michael Howard advises people to be cautious in their hopes for the summit - 'if they think it will solve all the problems, they will be disappointed,' he warns. 'But I hope they have more realistic expectations. This is, after all, the first attempt to tackle global problems on a world scale.'</p>

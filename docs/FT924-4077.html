			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Sapin's single money target FRANCE and Germany want to build on the stability between their two currencies to achieve the 'ultimate stability' of a single money by the end of the decade, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris. Speaking just before the Franco-German summit opened in Bonn yesterday, the French minister liberally invoked German backing in the long-term goal of monetary union and in the short-term task of fighting off this week's speculative attacks on the franc. As during the franc's September crisis, he claimed: 'Those who want to break the franc-mark link will find themselves confronted by the solidarity of the two ministers (of finance) and the two central banks.' The franc closed higher yesterday, at FFr3.40 to the D-Mark against FFr3.41 the day before. Mr Paul Hammett, a Paribas analyst, said there was no economic or political reason to believe the franc would be devalued. He said France supported the idea of an EC growth initiative.</p>

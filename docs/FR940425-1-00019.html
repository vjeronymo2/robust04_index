			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon completion of the 6,400-mile test, the adjusted wear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate for a candidate tire is extrapolated to the point of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wearout, which is 1/16th inch of tread remaining, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treadwear grade established. A grade of 100 represents a tire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of achieving approximately 30,000 miles to the wearout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point, as measured on the San Angelo course. A tire graded at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 150 should achieve approximately 50 percent more mileage than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the one graded at 100, assuming both are run on the same course  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and under the same conditions. It should be noted, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that tire treadwear grades are not intended to be indicative of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a tire's actual expected mileage. The tire quality grades are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended as indicators of relative, not absolute, performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actual mileage a tire achieves will depend on many factors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as geographic location, individual driving habits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance of proper tire pressure, load, type of road  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surfaces, climatic conditions, and road configurations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has noted significant changes in treadwear ratings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the UTQGS became fully effective in 1980. Early in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UTQGS program, the treadwear grading criteria specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;575.104(d)(2) produced consistent results. As the years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progressed, however, treadwear ratings have drifted steadily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upward in both manufacturers' and NHTSA's testing results to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the point that many of the ratings appear to be questionable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, one brand of tires (brand A) recently tested on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the San Angelo course resulted in a test grade of 832 which,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when rounded off to the next lower 20-point increment as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by 49 CFR 575.104(e)(2)(ix)(F), would be labeled with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a treadwear grade of 820. That figure suggests a degree of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative superiority in treadwear of brand A tires over lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tested brands that appears significantly disproportionate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the differences in the likely actual mileage of those tires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA understands that tires are of higher quality, perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better and last longer than tires produced even a few years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ago. Such improvements result from industry developments such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as improvements in rubber compounds, cord materials, tire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designs, and tread configurations. The agency does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe, however, that tires have improved to the point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested by the test results for brand A, which suggests that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the San Angelo course, the tire would last over 240,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> miles. This situation suggests either that the characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the course itself are changing or that other factors as yet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unidentified are responsible, or both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Course Monitoring Tires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the wear rates of tires can change on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> daily basis because of such conditions as road surface,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature, humidity, and precipitation. To compensate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those changes in conditions when conducting agency compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, candidate tires are tested concurrently with course  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring tires (CMT). Before 1991, CMTs were built to strict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA specifications. Since that time, NHTSA has required that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CMTs be built to the specifications of the American Society for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing Materials (ASTM) standard E1136. CMTs are specially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to have narrow limits of variability and, in fact, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed to be invariant among tires of a given batch, or lot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CMTs are procured by NHTSA in lots of 500&hyph;1500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whenever a new lot is procured, a new base course wear rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (BCWR) is established for that lot. This is accomplished by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treating the new CMT as a candidate tire and determining its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted wear rate in the same manner prescribed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;575.104 for candidate tires. The new CMT is tested in a convoy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> along with the old CMTs. A course severity adjustment factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (CSAF) is determined by dividing the BCWR for the old CMTs by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wear rate of the old CMTs in the test. The wear rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the new CMT in the convoy is then multiplied by the CSAF to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain the adjusted wear rate of the new CMT which then becomes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the BCWR for the new CMTs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the BCWR for a new lot of CMTs is established, those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new CMTs can then be used to grade candidate tires. Upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion of the 6,400-mile test, the BCWR is divided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average wear rate of the 4 new CMTs in the test convoy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the course severity adjustment factor. That factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is then applied to the wear rates of the candidate tires being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> graded in the same convoy. The adjusted wear rate of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> candidate tire is then extrapolated to the point of wearout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1/16th inch tread remaining) which is then converted to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treadwear rating for that tire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has noted over the years that significant changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have occurred in the BCWRs. Although the actual measured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treadwear rates of CMTs have varied from 3.27 to 6.96 mils per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,000 miles since 1975, the adjusted BCWRs have steadily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decreased from 4.44 in 1975 to 1.56 in 1992, as shown in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 1, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

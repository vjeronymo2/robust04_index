			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 20 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- According to an  Energy, Mines, and Parastate Industry Secretariat (SEMIP)  report, Mexico will maintain its oil extraction and export rate  at 1.3 million barrels a day. In London, Mauricio Toussaint  Ribot, director of SEMIP hydrocarbon policies, said Mexico's  production of liquid hydrocarbons, which was 3.131 million  barrels a day in 1993, surpassed the all-time high reached in  1982 for the third consecutive year.    A SEMIP communique stated that the Mexican official  explained  in London, before international experts, that of that amount,  1.794 million was for domestic consumption and 1.337 million for  export. Toussaint Ribot said the increase in hydrocarbon  reserves over the past three years allowed the country to  replenish three quarters of its production, thus reversing a  trend of several years.    In the meeting where experts present their countries'  hydrocarbon policies, he said 38 oil fields have been discovered  in the past three years -- the same number discovered throughout  the preceding six years. For this reason, he gave assurances  that Mexican Petroleum [Pemex] will invest over $20 billion  until the year 2000 to recover the cash flow that had diminished  in the 1980's. Pemex currently invests $3 billion a year.    He added that Mexico's policy allows it to become integrated  into markets worldwide with its competitive oil industry, which  can face the uncertainties of international markets and remain a  dynamic factor in the national economy.</p>

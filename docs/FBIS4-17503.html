			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Pulse of the Planet" rubric: </F> "Y. Rabin Looks Forward to Meeting With Russia"; from the  "evening edition"]    [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated in an  exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent that during  his visit to Moscow, which begins on Sunday [24 April], he  intends to discuss with President Boris Yeltsin and other  Russian leaders questions concerning a peaceful settlement to  the Near East conflict and the further development of bilateral  relations.    In connection with this the head of the Israeli Government  noted in particular: "I am looking forward to my visit to  Russia. It will be my first visit to Moscow, and these will be  my first meetings with President Boris Yeltsin and Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. I have already met Foreign  Minister Kozyrev several times, and in my view, he is a very  intelligent and businesslike person. I have also met with other  figures from the upper echelons of the Russian Government. I  intend to discuss a number of questions concerning bilateral  relations in the sphere of the economy, trade, and agriculture.  During my visit certain agreements may be signed. In addition  I will be going to St. Petersburg -- the native city of my  mother and her family."    Touching on the problems of the Near East settlement, Y.  Rabin especially stressed that "Russia, as one of the cosponsors  of the Madrid Conference, could help to create conditions  facilitating direct talks between ourselves and other  participants in the conflict. Peace cannot be imposed, but the  cosponsors can help to bring it nearer." [last sentence omitted  in later "Nighttime Edition" of newspaper]    Dwelling on Israeli-Russian relations, Yitzhaq Rabin noted:  "Russia is a large country. Many Israeli citizens were born in  Russia, so that Russian culture has had a huge influence on  Israel. This applies to music, literature, and poetry. Many  new immigrants, arriving here from Russia, brought with them  their extensive abilities in the most varied spheres. I can  state with confidence that Israel has numerous and deep roots in  Russia."</p>

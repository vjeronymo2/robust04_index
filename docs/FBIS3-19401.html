At 11 percent, it  has reached an alarming level in the European Union. There are  hardly any signs that this tendency will reverse once the  current recession is overcome.    In the United States, where the economy has been growing  again in the past two years, a number of new jobs have been  created but expectations have not been fulfilled as far as the  quantity and, above all, quality is concerned. Developments in  the labor market will in the future no longer primarily be  determined by the economic ups and downs but by structural  factors that are difficult to eliminate.    This is one of the reasons that the United States organized  a  conference of the seven major industrialized nations -- the  United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, and  Canada -- in Detroit on Monday [14 March] and Tuesday, which was  exclusively devoted to this topic. The responsible finance,  economics, and labor ministers discussed the causes of the  problem in four working groups, seeking a solution to the  problem. Quick successes were not to be expected. Yet German  Ministers Waigel, Rexrodt, and Bluem got the impression after  exchanging views with their counterparts over a day and a half  that the trip to Detroit was useful.    One of the concerns the Germans wanted to discuss in the  automobile capital was removed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in  his opening speech: "Let us start by acknowledging the  fundamental reality that private enterprise, not government  action, is the engine of growth in the economic sector and in  the creation of new jobs." Thus, he made it clear from the  beginning that the conference was not designed -- or at least  only to a very limited extent -- to persuade the visitors to  adopt programs to boost the economy, which in the past only led  to straw fires before elections.    Clinton believes that the tasks the state must fulfill offer  the enterprises the required preconditions for growth and  preparing the population for a working life in the new  environment of the global competitive economy. How the tasks  are to be defined and how they can be fulfilled was one of the  most important subjects of discussion in Detroit.    Difficulties arose quickly in this respect because the  economic and social realities in the United States and Europe  are completely different. In the United States, over 35 million  new jobs were created in the past 20 years -- many of which  required high qualification and were well paid, but many of  which offered employment for workers with low qualifications at  low wages. Generally, real incomes in the United States have not  risen during this period. The difference between high-income  earners and have-nots has increased dramatically and does not  only threaten "the economic strength of the United States but  also the social structures of our democratic society." (Clinton)    In Europe, the enterprises postponed restructuring measures  for a long time. This had the effect that the real incomes of  those who had jobs continued to increase considerably, but that  overall employment declined. Social peace was preserved because  the unemployed and short-time workers received relatively high  social benefits.    In view of these different developments, are we only faced  with a choice "between poverty in the United States and  unemployment in Europe," as economic scientist Barry Bosworth  from the Brookings Institution in Washington asked ironically?  U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich considers this a wrong  alternative: "We must combine the education and training  systems that exist in Europe and Japan with the dynamic mobility  and flexibility that exists in the United States," he suggested.  Yet there is the danger that not the good but the bad aspects  are exchanged.</p>

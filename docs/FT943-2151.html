			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Zulu court split will reshape Natal politics: Buthelezi and the king square up in struggle for traditional support Two bulls cannot share the same kraal, runs an old African proverb. This traditional wisdom is about to be tested in the South African province of KwaZulu/Natal as yesterday the stage was set for a confrontation between Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party and minister of home affairs in the government of national unity, and the traditional monarch of the 9m-strong Zulu nation, King Goodwill Zwelithini, his nephew. The outcome of the confrontation, triggered by the king's decision yesterday to dismiss Chief Buthelezi as his 'prime minister', will shape the politics of the province for the foreseeable future. For it could determine whether its loyalty shifts from Chief Buthelezi, whose IFP secured 51 per cent of the provincial vote in this year's election, to Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. What tipped the balance in the April election was the overwhelming backing for the IFP in rural Natal, conservative, traditional and loyal to the king, for the ANC's strength lay mainly in the towns and cities. It is over this rural turf that Chief Buthelezi and the king will now be fighting for control. By dismissing Chief Buthelezi from the honorary post of traditional prime minister to the royal house, the King is attempting to deprive the chief of his most powerful political weapon: the ability to claim to act on behalf of the Zulu nation. Political analysts estimate that between 15-30 per cent of Inkatha's vote was the direct result of the king's entry into the political fray on Inkatha's behalf. Although Inkatha's powerful political machine and complex patronage network will continue to be able to mobilise large numbers of supporters, many floating voters may now shift their allegiance to the ANC, damaging Inkatha's prospects in next year's planned local elections. It may also re-inflame political passions in KwaZulu-Natal, where Inkatha and ANC-supporters have been in a virtual state of war that has claimed thousands of lives since the mid-1980s. Since the election, and Inkatha's decision to serve in the constitutionally mandated government of national unity with the ANC and the National party, violence has dropped markedly. In the ongoing dispute between the ANC and Inkatha in the provincial legislature on the allocation of cabinet posts and the location of the regional capital, the king has remained studiously neutral. However, in recent months there have been persistent rumours that the relationship between the king and the chief had started to sour, partly as a result of an apparent thawing of the king's attitude to the ANC. King Goodwill has also dismissed his former bodyguards, who were political appointments from the KwaZulu police controlled by Chief Buthelezi, replacing them with national troops, and also held several personal meetings with President Mandela. For his part, Chief Buthelezi has consistently denied reports of a rift with the king. However in the last two weeks he has lashed out at attempts to 'vilify' him by members of the royal family - an apparent reference to the growing influence of Prince Mcwayizeni Zulu, a long-standing rival of Chief Buthelezi's and a member of the ANC's national executive, in the Royal Household. The row over President Mandela's planned attendance at Shaka Day celebrations this weekend, a ceremony central to the Zulu nationalist tradition as a tribute to the kingdom's founder, appears to have brought matters to a head. Although President Mandela announced after meeting with Chief Buthelezi and the king on Monday night that he had decided not to attend the ceremony, the king appears to have chosen to use the issue as an excuse to break off ties with Inkatha. The roots of the conflict run back to King Goodwill's accession to the throne in 1971. Before his coronation, the prince had sought to marginalise Chief Buthelezi in Zulu politics. However after the coronation, the chief used his newly-formed Inkatha movement to take control of the Zulu 'homeland', forcing the young monarch to follow his lead. The chief also used his position as the king's uncle to claim the post of traditional prime minister. In the late 1970s Chief Buthelezi forced legislation through the KwaZulu parliament that severely circumscribed the king's political independence and since then has used his power over the KwaZulu budget, which provided the monarch's salary, to insure that the king took no action contrary to Inkatha's interests. It is ironic that the King's new freedom to speak out against his former mentor is in part the result of Chief Buthelezi's success in playing the royal card during negotiations with the ANC earlier this year. By making recognition of the monarch's status a condition of his participation in the election, Chief Buthelezi was able to entrench the position of the king as traditional ruler of KwaZulu in the new constitution. As a result, King Goodwill's status and salary are no longer dependent on Inkatha and Chief Buthelezi has no direct authority over the king. The king yesterday was reported to have cancelled the Shaka Day celebrations this weekend. So far Inkatha officials are putting a brave face on the split and insist that the celebrations will go ahead with or without the king's participation. However without the monarch's blessing, Inkatha will find it difficult to generate the level of support the celebrations have traditionally enjoyed. 'It's a bit like celebrating Christmas without acknowledging the Christian tradition,' said Mr David Welsh, political scientist at the University of Cape Town.</p>

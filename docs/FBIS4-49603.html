			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The economic and trade  cooperation between Guangdong Province, south China, and Macao  has developed smoothly and steadily in tandem with the rapid  economic development in the two places in recent years.    Guangdong, one of the economic giants of China, has reported  year-on-year increase in absorbing foreign investments, which  reached 9.65 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, with a large part  coming from Hong Kong and Macao.    Statistics show that Macao's investment in China's mainland  totalled 4.3 billion U.S. dollars and Macao-funded enterprises  reached 2,300, most of them are located in Guangdong Province,  especially the Pearl River Delta area.    As of the first quarter of 1994, Macao businessmen have set  up more than 780 joint or solely-funded firms in the neighboring  Zhuhai special economic zone. These firms are mainly involved  in textile, electronics, medicines, food production,  cloth-making and real estate industry.    Meanwhile, there are also a great number of enterprises from  Guangdong which have invested in Macao to set up enterprises,  contract projects, run real estate or export and import  businesses. Their total investment in Macao stands at about 1.5  billion U.S. dollars.    Moreover, trade between Macao and Guangdong has also  developed rapidly in recent years. In 1982, some 40 percent of  Macao's exports to China's mainland went to Guangdong Province,  while the figure increased to 80 percent in 1992. Additionally,  some 40 percent of Macao's imports from China's mainland came  from Guangdong.</p>

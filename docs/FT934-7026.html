			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Observer: Buying time Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which has brushed up the image of everyone from Boris Yeltsin to Britain's Conservative party, is not one to duck tough assignments. So it is perhaps not surprising that the latest - and perhaps oddest - political figure who may seek its help is former Nigerian president General Ibrahim Babangida. Babangida stood down in August after eight years in charge, but at 52 he seems too young for permanent retirement. He now lives in some splendour in his home town of Minna, but his aspirations for statesmanship appear to be resurging, now that his erstwhile right hand man, General Sani Abacha has got rid of the interim government, led by civilians but backed by the military. Word is that Babangida may be prepared to pay handsomely for the top-notch marketing advice available from the likes of Saatchi, to smooth the path for a possible comeback when elections are held in a few years' time.</p>

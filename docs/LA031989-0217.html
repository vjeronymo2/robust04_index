			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION AND COUNTY TAXPAYERS  </P> <P> Regarding the possible consolidation of the transportation agencies of Orange  County: I don't think consolidation is good for the transit riders and  taxpayers of Orange County.  </P> <P> I don't know how it will affect the handicapped. I don't know how it will  affect bus fares. County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton wants the handicapped and  senior citizens to have free Dial-A-Ride and no van services for the general  public.  </P> <P> If van service is free for the handicapped and senior citizens, how much will  bus service fares be? Somehow the agency will have to make up the lost revenue.  The only way to make up the lost revenue is to raise the bus fares over $1 and  charge for the transfers.  </P> <P> I think that state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and Assemblyman Gil  Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) should ask the Orange County Transportation  Commission and Supervisor Stanton how much consolidation will cost the citizens  of Orange County.  </P> <P> Transit riders and the taxpayers of Orange County should know how much the bus  fares will be after consolidation, if it happens.  </P> <P> I think that all citizens of Orange County should know all the language in the  consolidation bill. The consolidation can be very costly to the taxpayers and  the transit riders of Orange County.  </P> <P> GARY A. MUDGE  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

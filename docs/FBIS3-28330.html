The agreement calls for lightening the tax burden on capital  gains on real estate. It also proposes making land used for  public purposes such as parking subject to tax relief on a new  land tax called the land value tax, they said.    These measures will be included in a tax reform package  expected to be announced early next week, they noted.</p>

Now, they have returned to the Beijing Children's Welfare  Institute, where they have lived since they were deserted by  their parents, completely recovered from congenital glaucoma and  ear deformity.    They are starting a bright new life.    The two children are among handicapped orphans from the  institute who were selected to receive free medical treatment, a  charity move by the city's public health bureau.    The Beijing Children's Welfare Institute is the country's  largest, housing more than 600 homeless children, 90 percent of  whom are handicapped.    Many children in the institute are confined to bed all year  round, due to illnesses ranging from heart disease to congenital  handicaps. Half of them have been in urgent need for medical  treatment.    Although staff try their best to take care of these  children,  it is impossible for the institute to raise the huge amount of  money needed.    Last August, two deputies to the Beijing People's Congress  revealed the problem in a report to the city's public health  bureau.    Zhu Zonghan, head of the bureau, went to the institute  himself for an inspection. He then made the decision to arrange  operations for the children.    Two months later, the bureau organized experts from five  hospitals to examine 40 children. Thirty-two of them were  selected for operations.    On December 3, the municipal public health bureau called on  all hospitals in Beijing to offer free treatment to save the  handicapped orphans.    The proposal won wide support. Twenty-six hospitals  committed themselves to perform operations, while many other  hospitals provided assistance in technology, equipment and funds.    A hospital volunteered to accept five hare-lipped children,  and promised to look for foster parents for them.    The Beijing children's hospital promised to take all the  child patients the other hospitals could not.    On January 12, all the 32 children suffering from severe  problems, such as large-scale scalds, hydrocrania, heart  deformities or harelip, were sent to the 26 hospitals for the  best of treatment.    Various enterprises gave money to help in saving the  children. A Beijing-Taiwan joint venture handed over 20,000  yuan (2,100 U.S. dollars).    Many organisations, such as the city's association for the  handicapped, the department of civil administration and the  women's federation have also shown their concern in a practical  manner.    Zhu Li, wife of Premier Li Peng, and Lin Jiamei, wife of  China's former President Li Xiannian, have visited the children  and brought them toys.</p>

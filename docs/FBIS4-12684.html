			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> unidentified reporters; place and date not given: "Israel:  `Fanatics Will Not Stop Peace'"]    [Text] [BILD AM SONNTAG] Following the Hebron massacre,  the Palestinians have been carrying out bloody acts of revenge  the past few days. The Islamic Hamas resistance group has  threatened to start a war in the occupied territories. Can  there be peace at all and an agreement between the PLO and  Israel under these conditions?    [Peres] The Israeli Government will continue to fight  against terror with all its available means. Yet, we will not  interrupt the peace negotiations for a single moment and we will  continue with great determination to put the Gaza-Jericho  agreement into practice. These murderers not only want to kill  innocent people, but they want to stop the peace process. Any  interruption of the negotiations would be a reward for these  murderous terrorists.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you fear retaliatory acts by radical  Jewish settlers?    [Peres] Fanatics on both sides are trying to sabotage the  peace process. Yet, our desire for peace is stronger than these  fanatics. After the Hebron massacre, we arrested radical  settlers and disarmed others.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Will the group of international observers  be able to stop the violence?    [Peres] A total of 160 observers from Italy, Denmark, and  Norway will be arriving here before too long. As soon as this  group arrives in Hebron, we hope the atmosphere will calm down.  However, I would like to repeat and emphasize: There can be no  substitute for cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians;  together we must create the basis for coexistence in peace.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] What assistance for a peaceful solution do  you expect from the international community of states and from  Germany, in particular?    [Peres] The international community of states and Germany  have already committed themselves very strongly. They support  the economic development of the countries in the Middle East.  Of particular importance is the improvement in the  Palestinians' standard of living. If we manage to improve their  lives, then we will also be able to convince other Arabs who are  our neighbors that peace is an advantage for everyone.</p>

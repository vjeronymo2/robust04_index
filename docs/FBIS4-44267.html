			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Summit: Berlusconi on </F> Domestic Issues"]    [Text] (ANSA) Corfu, June 25 -- Long-running rumours of  government moves to help the Italian auto industry with sales  incentives on the lines of those offered in France were quashed  by Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi for budget reasons here  today.    Although he said the government would study the French  measures, he told reporters that one could not forget budget  limitations, adding that many of the measures the government had  imagined in support of industry had been shelved for budgetary  reasons.    In particular, he said Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini and  the Auditor-General's Office were particularly zealous in  telling the government that certain things cannot be done for  financial reasons.    Asked about how he plans to keep the government on course in  sorting out the public debt crisis while maintaining electoral  pledges not to increase taxation, he said he had no reply "apart  from indicating the work that needs to be done." In particular,  he suggested that the money he needs could come from  re-organising major budget sectors such as health, education and  defence and containing expenditure on them. He also claimed the  restructurisation he has in mind would maintain jobs or find  alternative jobs for those working in some sectors.    "In this way, as soon as possible, we'll also find a way of  making different investments for the money that comes from all  of us," he said. "It has to be done, even if it isn't easy and  can't be put into effect at once."    The national health service seems to be one budget item in  Berlusconi's sights. Pointing to what he said was the "low  quality" of the services offered, he also noted the waste  involved, quoting union figures indicating that as much as 40  percent of health service expenditure can be considered as waste.    According to Berlusconi, whose electoral platform rested on  pledges designed to place Italian economic management on new  foundations within a year or so, seemed to indicate that the  time-scale should now be lengthened since even health service  reform could take years.    "It's a big job, and the government will do it," he  promised.  "It's a job that can only be done in the course of years. It's  a hope and it's a commitment. But one can't imagine doing it in  a short time or without sacrifices."    In other domestic points, he said he was unable to say  whether Italy intends to move to obtain French radar traces  recorded at the time of the Ustica tragedy in June 1980, when an  Italian airliner crashed into the sea north of Sicily, killing  the 81 passengers and crew on board.    The crash has been explained variously by structural  failure,  a bomb on board or a missile. The preponderant view is that a  missile was responsible and may have been fired by French or  American vessels believed to have been in the area at the time.    "I'm not omniscient," said Berlusconi of reports that Italy  would be seeking more active cooperation from France on the  affair. "I am unable to answer. These are things I know  nothing about."    Berlusconi also said he was thinking of creating a  complaints  or suggestions office at Palazzo Chigi, the Prime Minister's  official residence.</p>

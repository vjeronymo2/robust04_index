			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / A chance to clean up in European white goods: The Electrolux-AEG deal When Electrolux of Sweden paid DM80m (Pounds 31.7m) last year for a 10 per cent stake in AEG Hausgerate, the household appliances unit of Germany's struggling AEG industrial group, it set a poser for observers of the industry and rival manufacturers. Was the purchase by Europe's largest producer of white goods - washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators and cookers - a prelude to a full takeover of the AEG unit? Or was it simply designed to cement a limited co-operation in manufacturing and product development while preserving the German company's independence? Whatever the original intentions, Electrolux was last week offered the opportunity to buy the remaining 90 per cent of AEG Hausgerate, as AEG, part of Daimler-Benz, launched a radical shake-up. Less than 18 months after the original deal, a full takeover looks to be programmed into the Swedish multi-national's wash cycle. If a deal is agreed, analysts believe it could cost Electrolux a further DM800m. The merger would be the most important takeover in the European appliances industry since Michigan-based Whirlpool completed the two-step, Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 730m) purchase of Philips' large domestic appliances business in 1991. In white goods alone, a takeover would enable Electrolux to challenge Whirlpool, its most powerful rival, for the title of world's largest producer. Whirlpool's sales last year, excluding financial services, were Dollars 7.1bn, identical to the combined white goods sales for Electrolux and AEG. Whirlpool, however, produces only white goods, and if appliances such as vacuum cleaners are included, the combined Electrolux-AEG group would be comfortably the world's biggest appliances producer with pro-forma sales of Dollars 9.2bn last year. Electrolux would also extend its leadership in the European white goods market, with a share of as much as 30 per cent, against 15-19 per cent for Bosch-Siemens of Germany, 11-15 per cent for Whirlpool Europe and 10 per cent for Merloni of Italy. The development of market shares and companies of this size is due in large part to the rationalisation of the white goods industry over the past 20 years. In 1970, 400 companies had 80 per cent of the European market, but soon only six or eight will control 80 per cent, Mr Vittorio Merloni, chairman of the Italian producer, said earlier this year. The inexorable concentration of the industry has been driven by the need for global or pan-European manufacturing efficiency. This 'behind-the-scenes' rationalisation in humdrum areas such as component sourcing gradually frees companies to spend more on their sophisticated brand strategies, and to spread the heavy cost of product development over a wider sales base. Electrolux foresees considerable benefits from a deal with AEG, in areas such as purchasing, research and development, logistics and warehousing. Electrolux will be able to supply AEG with compressors, for example, or motor fan units for vacuum cleaners, both of which the German group currently buys in. But the benefits of a takeover would go a long way beyond manufacturing and distribution. The big players in the European white goods business each have two or three pan-European brands pitched at different types of consumers, and regional or national brands where appropriate. Electrolux would be adding a third pan-European brand, AEG, to complement its Electrolux and Zanussi brands. While all three are well-known names across Europe, AEG is strongest in Germany and neighbouring countries, Electrolux in northern Europe and Zanussi in southern Europe. In particular, the deal would give Electrolux an unrepeatable chance to boost its market share in Germany, one of Europe's big four markets along with the UK, France and Italy, to around 35 per cent. Electrolux has about 20 per cent of the German market, but the majority of its sales are through Quelle, the big mail order company. Owning the AEG brand, along with the recently revamped Electrolux brand, ought to make it a much more powerful challenger to Bosch-Siemens, the market leader. Clearly, Electrolux can make a lot more of the manufacturing and marketing synergies through a full takeover of AEG Hausgerate than if it was to retain a 10 per cent stake - it has an option to acquire another 10 per cent, but that will probably be subsumed in the wider deal. As Mr Anders Scharp, Electrolux chief executive, said: 'Considering the possible synergies between Electrolux and AEG, as well as AEG's very strong position on many markets in the middle of Europe, we view an acquisition as strategically correct in the long-term.' And even though the AEG unit was profitable last year, it faces a better chance of developing under the ownership of Electrolux than as part of a company grappling with big losses in other businesses. With a European white goods market share of about 6 per cent, AEG could easily have found itself caught uncomfortably in the middle of a polarising industry - between the increasingly powerful big boys and the many remaining niche players.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              IMPACT OF POTENTIAL ELECTROLUX-AEG MERGER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- White goods market shares in western Europe  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Electrolux                                             20-25 percent Bosch-Siemens                                          15-19 percent Whirlpool Europe                                       11-15 percent Merloni                                                   10 percent AEG Hausgerate                                             6 percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Global white goods sales 1992 (Dollars bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Whirpool Corporation (excluding financial services)    Dollars 7.1 Electrolux (75 percent of appliance sales)             Dollars 5.8)                                                                   ) 7.1 AEG Hausgerate (85 percent of total sales)             Dollars 1.3)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Global appliance sales 1992 (Dollars bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Whirpool Corporation (including financial services)    Dollars 7.7) Eletrolux                                              Dollars 7.7)                                                                   ) 9.2 AEG Hausgerate                                         Dollars 1.5)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Industry  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

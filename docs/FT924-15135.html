			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Economic gloom brings savage losses THE LONDON stock market yesterday suffered its largest one-day fall since the October Crash of 1987 as concern over the plunging UK currency was engulfed in wider worries over the European and US economies. A final blow came when Wall Street collapsed in early dealings, driving the FT-SE Index back to its day's low of 2,446.3 for a net loss of 103.4, or four per cent, on the session. There was a moment of near-disaster at mid-afternoon when the early fall of more than 100 points on the Dow Industrial Average prompted such a rush to mark shares down in London that the Seaq system, unable to handle the pressure, went 'indicative only' for a few minutes; marketmakers are not bound to deal at indicative screen prices. But the institutions were not heavy sellers of shares in London yesterday. Much of the loss reflected frantic marking down operations by the marketmaking firms, which were also actively arbitraging between equities and the futures market. The day's Seaq volume fell to 477.6m shares from 599.9m on Friday, when retail business was worth Pounds 1.1bn. London equities fell by significantly less than some other leading European stock markets and several strategists suggested that the UK might benefit from European-wide moves to restore economic confidence. Traders also took some encouragement from a cash bid of Pounds 780m by Hanson Group for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the food company. Following on the heels of last week's raid on Trafalgar House, this move indicated a revival in corporate activity. UK share prices fell away quickly yesterday morning as the stock market reacted to the renewed setback in sterling at the beginning of a trading week which will be highlighted by the annual conference of Britain's governing Conservative party. Hopes of a further cut in UK base rates evaporated on Friday and the City now fears that political unwillingness to raise rates during the Tory conference may leave sterling at the mercy of currency speculators again. When the December futures contract on the Footsie opened at a discount to the cash market yesterday morning, pressure on the blue chip stocks was intensified by basket trading, where falls in the stock index future are matched by sales of the underlying stocks. Shares extended their losses as sterling fell by nearly six pfennigs against the D-mark and by mid-session the Footsie was 80 points off. The London stock market has now lost about two-thirds of the hurried rise which followed sterling's departure from the ERM network. Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon warns that, if the rally in the Footsie is truly over, then the index could fall to 2,200, if not 1,620 before looking for the next bull phase. The continuing slide in sterling, coupled with uncertainty over interest rates, has undermined comparative valuations of UK equities and government bonds at the opening of the final quarter of the year. Nervousness in the stock market was enhanced by further rises in yields on long-dated gilts yesterday.</p>

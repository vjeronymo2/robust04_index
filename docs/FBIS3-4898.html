Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told a National Assembly  Committee that he would look into the matter, adding that the  Ministry's director-general of the American Affairs Bureau was  planning to call Hubbard, officials said.    During a seminar held Feb. 25 at American University,  Hubbard  said South Korea and the United States differ on "how to respond  on some regional and global issues."    "And despite heartwarming success in establishing democracy  and marked improvement on the human rights front--or perhaps  because of them--the United States still wishes the Republic of  Korea would repeal the National Security Law," Hubbard said.    The remarks were deemed sensitive because Hubbard is the top  U.S. representative at working-level talks with North Korea.    Ministry officials were busy denying speculation that the  remarks were somehow related to discussions between North Korea  and the United States at their recent nuclear negotiations.    The U.S. report on global human rights issued last Feb. 1  also cites South Korea's National Security Law, basically  anti-communist in nature, for undermining personal freedoms.    Ministry officials claim that the U.S. State Department must  address the issue "off and on" to placate American human rights  lobbyists, who reportedly receive "quite a few" petitions about  the South Korean security law.    "The matter has never been raised bilaterally by a  diplomatic  agency," one ranking official said.</p>

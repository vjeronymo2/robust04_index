			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Alphandery confident on economy THE French government yesterday quietly vaunted its cautious monetary policy as helping to stabilise the economy, despite the news that unemployment rose further to 11.7 per cent in July, from 11.6 per cent the month before. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, claimed, in highly qualified terms, that 'the hypothesis of (the economy) emerging from the tunnel (of recession) at the end of this year or at the latest at the start of 1994 is far from unrealistic'. In his interview with La Tribune newspaper, the minister, evidently chastened in his public pronouncements by the recent monetary storms, said that after the rate of decline in industrial production had slowed in the first half of this year, 'to all appearances, we are therefore now at the bottom of the cycle, at a weak level of economic activity'. But with long-term interest rates still slightly below those of Germany, and short-term rates finding again their pre-August crisis level, the minister said the government had no intention of 'changing the direction' of its economic and financial policy. The one lesson to draw from the recent crisis of the European exchange rate system was that 'economic convergence is a precondition for monetary convergence', Mr Alphandery said, in a marked shift from the position held by previous French ministers during the Maastricht treaty negotiations. France's conversion to the necessity for convergence with Germany was reflected, Mr Alphandery said, in the decision by Bonn and Paris to work together in preparing medium-term budgetary plans. Despite the claims of ministers to see light at the end of the economic tunnel, the government itself has forecast that unemployment will keep rising until early 1994. It has moved to improve the cash position of companies by refunding their VAT payments more quickly, but most are reluctant to hire new workers until they see real evidence of a pick-up in consumer demand. Mr Alphandery said there was now evidence of improvement in the beleaguered construction sector, but admitted many sectors were still in recession.</p>

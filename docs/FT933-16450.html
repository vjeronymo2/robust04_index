			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: London Electric static at Pounds 145m - Charge for withdrawing from appliance retailing holds back advance A CHARGE of Pounds 20m for withdrawing from the electricity appliance retailing business left London Electricity, the capital's main electricity distributor, with only a small profit increase in the year ending March 31. The company, however, raised its total dividend for the year by 16 per cent to 19.5p,compared with 16.8p, putting it among the leaders in the regional electricity companies' dividend race. Pre-tax profits for the group were Pounds 145.5m, up Pounds 3m on the year before and were also after lower interest payable of Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 11.2m). Earnings per share were shown up from 47.5p to 49.5p. The Pounds 20m exceptional charge related to the decision last March to sell or close down the group's 96 retail units because of accumulated losses. Mr John Wilson, the chairman, said it had been a year of 'considerable change and progress'. He cited the sharp improvement in the contracting business, which had transformed a Pounds 17m loss into a small profit, and the Pounds 90m acquisition of BAA's electricity distribution networks at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. He said the company 'had cleared the decks' and it was time to signal confidence through a strong increase in the dividend. The rise in the pay-out, the second highest in the current electricity results season, followed a lag in dividend growth relative to earnings growth in the two years since privatisation, and 'you can't dissociate yourself from what's happening around you', according to Mr Wilson. Costs had also been reduced through higher productivity, manpower reductions, lower bad debts and a pension surplus. Real cost savings amounted to 6.6 per cent. London Electricity is passing some of the benefit on to customers through a 2 per cent tariff reduction in April and a Pounds 7.50 rebate next autumn. Mr Roger Urwin, the chief executive, said that London's future strategy would be to diversify into areas close to the core business, utilising the company's skills and its strong financial position. COMMENT Clearing the decks is the word for it. London has now sorted out its non-core business, and though the price was high, that is more than can be said for a lot of other RECs. Meanwhile, the BAA deal shows promise, and lies close to London's skills and operating area. Another healthy sign was the reduction in gearing despite the acquisition. The strong dividend growth was basically a catch-up after two years of slow growth, though it leaves the level of cover at the low end in the sector. The shares rose 10p to 476p in a strong market. Warburg Securities has London on a prospective yield of 5.8 per cent, which is above the sector average, and probably generous given that the clean-out has now been accomplished.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / AA fees 'liable to 3% tax' The 3 per cent tax on insurance premiums announced in the November Budget will apply to many other types of commercial contract, including membership fees at the AA, RAC and similar organisations, according to City solicitors Lovell White Durrant. It said that, because of the way the finance bill was drafted, the new tax could apply to payments for guarantees, indemnities and performance bonds issued by banks.</p>

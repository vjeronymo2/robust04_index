Kohl, who is running for Ludwigshafen the sixth time,  received 69 of the 72 valid votes in the meeting of the  constituency delegates. Three delegates voted against the CDU  federal chairman.    Kohl's Social Democratic Party [SPD] opponent in the  constituency is Doris Barnett (40), head of the social  administrative office in Ludwigshafen, who was nominated in late  November 1993. In his nomination address to an audience of 300,  Kohl strongly warned against slackening determination to  struggle for European unification. Germans would have "to pay  bitterly" if they wanted to opt out of the unification process.    Kohl called for a rethinking process, and said people should  not expect the level of benefits and rights to continue to rise  forever. To maintain international competitive strength,  enterprises in Germany must be made more flexible. The current  round of wage talks offers an opportunity for this, as can be  seen by the agreement achieved in the chemical industry.</p>

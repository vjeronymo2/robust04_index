The relevant department has  already tuned down its propaganda on economic development this  year, and this kind of change has once again led to  disagreements between the central and local authorities.    According to an authoritative and informed source in  Beijing,  since New Year's Day, the development principle publicized by  the CPC has already been changed from the "six-character  principle" of "sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu,  jiankang, 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 1660]" development at the  end of last year, to the amended "16-character principle" of  "grasping opportunity, deepening reform, promoting development,  and maintaining stability [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, cujin  fazhan, baochi wending, 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 0553 2395  7245, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 0202 2170 4489 1353]."    According to information, the "16-character principle" is  thorough and encompassing. It talks about reform on the one  hand, and development on the other, and it talks about  opportunity on the one hand, and stability on the other.  Compared with the "six- character principle," it is thorough  and concrete, more mature, less biased, and less extreme. The  "six-character principle" emphasizes "rapid" development which  is realized by "healthy" development. The 16-character  instruction stresses "reform" and is eventually to be realized  by the two characters of "stability," and its implication is  clear without explanation.    The central leadership's rationale is that reform needs a  relaxed environment, and that if the strings of economic  operations are overstretched, this is not helpful to deepening  reform. Reform has to be promoted, a certain development speed  has to be maintained, inflation has to be checked, and social  stability has to be maintained. The question of how to adjust  relations among these four things is certainly a major topic .    Jiang Zemin's speech to the Third Plenary Session of the  14th  CPC Central Committee, carried by newspapers in Beijing  yesterday, once again talked about "properly handling the  relations between reform and development." In his speech he  said that it is necessary to create a more relaxed environment  for reform, and that the old ways of extensive operations, which  is characterized by the blind pursuit of output value and  expansion of the scale of investment, cannot be followed again.    In his New Year speech, Premier Li Peng lowered the  development speed target to 8-9 percent, and repeatedly stressed  the importance of stability; this in fact fixed the tone for  "cooling down the temperature" this year.    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has talked about the economic  situation on many occasions and has always reminded local  officials "not to act too hastily," not to compare speed, and  not to blindly make investments and randomly launch projects.  He has always been critical of the "craze for development  zones" and "craze for real estate," and he does not agree with  the "extraordinary" and "high- speed" proposals.    Li Lanqing, another vice premier, said recently when  inspecting Zhejiang and Shanghai: "A new series of important  reform measures will be announced this year, and we must pay  special attention to maintaining social stability, check the  upsurge of prices, and control the scale of investment in fixed  assets to reduce risks and create a good external environment  for expediting reform. The inflation problem must receive  special attention."    On 16 January, the government's RENMIN RIBAO carried on the  front page with a major headline a commentator's article,  entitled: "Prevent Blind Development of Real Estate." The  article criticized some localities, departments, and units who  are presently authorizing projects unduly without observing the  relevant state regulations, and some even acted in their own  ways and blindly launched projects: "the craze for real estate  has reemerged." It is alleged that the spirit of the article  came mainly from Zhongnanhai.    However, what is clearly opposite to the attitude of the  central leadership is that local officials have never ceased  calling for "vigorous work and rapid growth." Shanghai leaders  have said on many occasions that to Shanghai, low-speed  development equates to no development and that Shanghai must  grasp the opportunity granted to it by history and utilize  various conditions to expedite its own development itself.    The front page of BEIJING RIBAO on 12 January carried, with  a  major headline, a speech by Chen Xitong, the party secretary of  Beijing Municipality. The speech was entitled "Boldly  Emancipating the Mind." He said that to establish a new system,  it is necessary to "boldly charge forward, to blaze a new trail,  and to take risks"; and to continue emancipating the minds, it  is also necessary to "boldly charge forward, to blaze a new  trail, and to take risks."    Chen Xitong said that only by emancipating the mind can new  ways of thinking be found and bold measures be taken. If one  fears the wolves in front and the tigers behind, like a woman  with bound feet who dares not do this and that, doing minor  things but not big things, then one cannot walk at a big pace.    Chen Xitong urged his subordinates to "stretch your arms and  work vigorously, get started, and run quickly," to expedite  reform and opening up.</p>

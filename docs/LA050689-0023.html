			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREVIN-FLEISCHMANN CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> I think Fleischmann went to hear for himself why droves of concert-goers stay  away when Previn conducts; he heard every phrase expire (not even die, for that  would be too dramatic); he noted that Previn believes slow is beautiful,  torturing the notes by stretching them. The Philharmonic is well rid of Previn.  </P> <P> WILLIAM M. SMITH  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter: "General Measures for </F> Macroeconomic Regulation and Control in 1994 Put Forward by the  Project Team for the Analysis and Forecasting of Economic  Situation Under the Institute of Quantitative and Technical  Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences"]    [Text] The rapid development of the economy and the  successive introduction of various reform measures have  attracted people's enthusiastic attention, as never before, to  the orientation, force, and actual effects of the macroeconomic  regulation and control policy. The appearance of this pleasing  phenomenon not only demonstrates a deepening of people's  understanding of the connotation of establishing a socialist  market economy structure, but also reflects people's strong  demand for a healthy, sustained, and rapid development strategy  for the national economy, having suffered several economic  fluctuations. Recently, the experts and scholars of the project  team of the Institute of Quantitative and Technical Economics of  the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' which is devoted to  analyzing and forecasting the economic situation, (hereafter  referred to as the Project Team) have studied this issue. Their  principal viewpoints are excerpted in the following.    Considering that the 1994 economic growth rate remains  at a rather high level, the general measure of macroeconomic  regulation and control should be the policy of a "soft landing."    The Project Team believes that the policy of appropriate  retrenchment, which was implemented in June and July of 1993,  has obtained a certain effect. It will cause the 1994 economic  growth rate to fall back somewhat. However, currently the  investment growth rate, currency growth rate, etc., are still  too high, and the balances of financial income and expenditures  and of foreign trade, and so on, have not fundamentally  improved. Therefore the 1994 economic growth rate will still  remain at a relatively high level. Reasons for this are:    1. Investment will remain fairly large-scale. Large numbers  of newly started projects of the past two years need to  continue, so that the scale of projects under construction is  rather large, while at the same time, some new important  projects are waiting to be launched. The adjustment and  optimization of the industrial structure, and the intensified  construction of infrastructure and basic industries still  require the input of large amounts of funds. People's savings  deposits continue to increase in large quantities, and the  banking system -- after consolidation -- also has a fair  concentration of capital. This has provided investment with  domestic sources of funding. The investment of foreign  businesses is now at a second peak. The first peak was between  1985 and 1988, during which the growth rate of foreign capital  used was 30-48 percent of the fixed-asset investment growth of  society as a whole. Beginning in 1992, the second peak of  foreign investment occurred. The growth rate achieved by foreign  capital reached 44.5 percent. Currently, economic revival in the  world's major industrial countries is weak, and large quantities  of capital are looking for new locations to invest. The social,  political, and economic situation in China looks good and offers  advantageous conditions to attract foreign capital. In this  foreign investment peak, foreign investment is not limited to  the coastal regions only, but has penetrated to the interior.  It has not been restricted to processing industries, but has  expanded to infrastructure and basic industries.    2. The people's consumption demands will increase steadily.  In the last two years, the people's income level has seen a new  rise, the consumption structure also is attaining new heights,  and the need for choices in shopping has strengthened further.  These are intensifying and rejuvenating competition in the  consumer goods market, which was sluggish a few years ago when  economic growth was at a low point. The increase in people's  consumption will promote growth in industries and tertiary  industries.    3. Beginning in the latter half of 1993, the contradiction  between supply and demand in transportation, energy, and certain  major raw materials was somewhat alleviated. In 1994, viewed  from the perspective of the production capacity and  import-export adjustment of these bottleneck departments, a GNP  growth rate of around 10 percent likely will be sustained.    4. If a certain speed of growth is maintained so that the  economic growth rate falls back smoothly, a large drop between  two years can be avoided. This is beneficial for ironing out  economic fluctuations and can prevent major chain reactions and  shocks between various links of social reproduction as a result  of excessive slide.    Based on these analyses, the general measure of  macroeconomic  regulation and control in 1994 should be one of "soft landing,"  that is to say, an appropriate retrenchment policy -- neither  forceful expansion, nor total retrenchment. One must be very  cautious of the weight of macroeconomic regulation and control.  The major economic indicators of macroeconomic regulation and  control should be set as follows: The GNP growth rate should be  controlled at around 10 percent and the industrial output value  growth rate at around 16 percent. Fixed-asset investment of  society as a whole should be set at around 1.36-1.4 trillion  yuan, with a 20 percent nominal increase over 1993. Deducting  the price-rise factor, the actual increase should be at around  12 percent, which is slightly higher than the GNP growth rate,  but slightly lower than the industrial growth rate. Newly  increased loans should be set at around 550 billion yuan, an  increase of around 20 percent over 1993. New increases in  issuing currency should be set at around 100 billion yuan, with  an increase of 17 percent over 1993.    Given the soft restraints of structure and the hard  restraints of bottlenecks, it is a fundamental measure of  long-term significance to change the structure, readjust the  industrial structure, and strengthen bottleneck  departments. Since reform and opening to the outside world,  compared with before, China's economic fluctuations have seen  profound changes in certain respects, while in other respects,  no fundamental changes have occurred. The Project Team believes  that the changes that have occurred include:    In terms of the nature of the fluctuations, the past  domination of a classical fluctuation has changed to the  domination of a growth-type fluctuation. The so-called  classical fluctuation implies that in a period of economic  contraction, major economic indicators such as the GNP, national  income, or gross industrial output value, all demonstrate a drop  in absolute volume, i.e., negative growth. The so-called  growth-type fluctuation implies that in a period of economic  contraction, major economic indicators do not demonstrate a drop  in absolute volume, but show a slowdown in growth rate. This  change in the nature of economic fluctuations indicates that  China's economic development has acquired a stronger power for  growth and for combating decline. The scale of the fluctuations  obviously has been reduced. This indicates that China's  economic development has gained a certain degree of stability.  It also indicates that the government has made great progress  in deciding the direction and force of macroeconomic regulation  and control. In terms of the generating mechanism for  industrial fluctuation, the role played by state-owned industry  already has been reduced, while the role played by  non-state-owned industries grows stronger day by day. In  industrial fluctuation, non-state-owned industries already have  become the leading wave. In terms of the generating mechanism  for investment fluctuation, with the diversification of  investors, investments from independently raised funds and from  bank loans already have become the leading wave in investment  fluctuation. In terms of transmitting information on the  fluctuations, price signals have began to play a role.    In the following two important aspects, however, no  fundamental changes have occurred. One is the soft restraints  of the structure. Viewed from China's economic fluctuations in  the past, the source of the investment scale inflating out of  line with the country's capacity lies in the traditional planned  economic system, which lacks responsibility and control  mechanisms. The problems created by the high-speed economic  growth rate in the first half of 1992 are rooted in the delayed  reform of the investment, banking, and fiscal and tax systems,  and the delayed reform of state-owned enterprises. That is to  say, the "chaos" in the economic order caused by structural  factors is the root of economic "overheating." Therefore, the  basic solution is to accelerate both reform and the pace of  building a socialist market economy structure. The Project Team  believes that whether or not the "soft landing" of 1994 can  succeed, and whether or not the economy can grow steadily will  be an objective test of whether these reforms are successful.    The second aspect is the hard restraints of bottleneck  departments. Viewed from China's economic fluctuations in the  past -- apart from political, structural, and policy factors --  as far as the material factors are concerned, most economic  expansions eventually have had to slow down because of the hard  restraints of such bottleneck departments as agriculture,  transportation, energy, and important raw materials. Therefore,  an important step to iron out economic fluctuations, raise the  efficiency of the entire national economy, and guarantee the  sustained and steady growth of the economy is to make great  efforts to readjust the industrial structure and to  fundamentally break through the hard restraints of these  bottleneck departments.    The Project Team points out that in light of historical  lessons, what is worth mentioning is that one must not  misunderstand this alleviation of problems as success in  adjusting the industrial structure, or that bottleneck  restraints no longer exist. There are two types of adjustment  of industrial structure: one is adaptive adjustment with only  short-term significance, i.e., after the high-speed expansion of  the economy, the proportionate relations among various  departments are temporarily balanced on a lower demand level by  suppressing demand. When the next round of high-speed expansion  takes place, this balance is quickly broken again. The other  type of industrial structural adjustment is a fundamental  adjustment with long-term significance, i.e., to persistently  strengthen the construction of bottleneck departments and  fundamentally break through the restraints of bottlenecks, hence  pushing forward the growth of the entire national economy.    The various cost pushes generated by price adjustments  and price deregulation during the transition to a market economy  still objectively play a considerable role in commodity price  increases. Thus, controlling both investment expansion and the  over-issuing of currency becomes a crucial link.    To forecast price trends during 1994, one first must analyze  the major causes of price increases during 1993, and then see if  these causes are still operating in 1994, and to what degree.  There were four major reasons for price increases in 1993: The  first was a long-term deep-level cause, namely, the transition  from the original planned economy to a market economy, which  inevitably brings price increases. The second is the direct  influence of price adjustments and deregulation. The third is  the demand-push by investment expansion and the over-issuing of  currency. The fourth is the chaos in economic order, especially  the influence of the chaotic banking order on price increases.    In 1994, the fourth cause mentioned above is being resolved.  The first and second causes, namely, the various cost-pushes  generated by price adjustments and deregulation in the  transition to a market economy, will still objectively play a  considerable role in pushing prices up. The remaining, third  cause, namely, the demand-push of investment expansion and the  over-issuance of currency thus has become a crucial link. This  is where we will see the effect of macroeconomic regulation and  control in 1994. If, in exercising macroeconomic regulation and  control in 1994, we can appropriately curb investment expansion  and the over-issuance of currency so that the economic growth  rate can be brought down a little, then the scale of price  increases may be reduced somewhat. On the other hand, if the  growth rate of investment and currency, and of the whole  economy, bounce back too early and too high, then the scale of  price increases will increase even further on the basis of the  first and second causes.</p>

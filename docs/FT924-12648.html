			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (8): Conglomeration of economies - US Regions CALIFORNIA is suffering its most severe recession since the Second World War. Yet the state of Washington remains relatively buoyant. And in New England, which has been struggling with recession for four years, there are the first, faint, glimmerings of recovery. The US is not so much a single economy as a conglomeration of regional economies, each with its distinctive cycle of growth and recession; each with its comparative advantages and disadvantages. A business planning to locate in North America cannot afford to ignore these differences - or forecasts of relative long-term growth and population movement. The recession of 1990-91, from which the US is emerging with painful slowness, hit the west and east coasts of the country far harder than the middle. New England was the first region to slide, as the so-called 'Massachusetts Miracle' - of above national average growth - came to an end. The region's important defence industries suffered from Pentagon budget cuts, its large computer companies floundered, over-optimistic speculative building left a huge property overhang, and one of the largest regional banks was left insolvent. However, the economy now appears to have stabilised, with further cuts in defence-related jobs offset by pick-ups in other areas such as health care. But while house-building is picking up, economists suggest any sustained recovery will be extremely slow. Over the long term, this crowded region, with relatively high property prices, will face a fight for jobs with the fast-growing and cheaper Sunbelt region of the south. But the term Yankee ingenuity originated in New England and the region's comparative advantages include a highly educated workforce, a concentration of fine universities, and a complex of high technology businesses. New York and the Middle Atlantic region, just down the coast from New England, have also been hit hard by the recession. Wall Street, critical to the health of New York City, has enjoyed booming securities markets over the past year but this has not translated into jobs. Securities firms have been busily paring the fat they built up in the 1980s and commercial banks are in the throes of a big consolidation wave. New York needs to get its high labour and property costs more in line with the rest of the country if it is to prosper long term. It will remain the world's leading financial centre for many years, if not indefinitely, and its position as the most cosmopolitan of America cities will continue to attract international businesses. The south-east, which ranges from Virginia through to Florida, has been harder hit by the recession than any region other than the north-east, although it was one of the fastest growing regions of the country in the 1980s as companies and population moved south to take advantage of its low costs and pleasant climate. The region is expected to grow somewhat faster than the national average as the US emerges from recession. Florida will be helped by Miami's increasingly important role as a Latin American trading centre. Atlanta, Georgia, currently the most popular city in the US for corporate and government relocations, is also expected see good growth, helped by its high technology and service industries and its capture of the 1996 Olympic Games. The mid-western Great Lakes region, centred on Chicago, has suffered only the mildest of recessions, thanks to a property market which never became too overheated in the 1980s and the restructuring during that decade of its heavy 'rust-belt' industries. It is expected to perform well as the nation moves out of recession and demand picks up for its consumer durable goods and capital equipment. The west-central and mountain states regions, including such states as South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, have been the strongest performers in the US over the past two years. The mountain states have grown at about 2 per cent a year, albeit from a very small economic base compared to other regions of the country. But it is the region's very lack of development which is now spurring growth. Businesses are attracted by its low costs and taxes and a positive work ethic in areas such as Utah, with its large Mormon population. Employees are attracted by the region's wide, open spaces and dazzling mountain scenery. Some economists are forecasting an acceleration of growth to 4 per cent as the nation comes out of recession. The mountain states have been a prime beneficiary of problems in California, where high taxes and property and labour costs, coupled with very restrictive environmental regulations, have been encouraging companies to relocate elsewhere. The north-western region, centred on Seattle, has also benefited economically from the Californian malaise, as large numbers of Californians have migrated north, attracted by lower living costs and the area's scenic beauty. The north-west, which has enjoyed above-average growth in recent years, could suffer badly if Boeing, the aircraft company headquartered in Seattle, is hit by a prolonged recession in the airline industry. Over the long-term, however, the region stands to benefit strongly from Boeing's presence, a growing high technology sector and important trading links with Japan and other Asian countries. Despite California's problems, the state remains a mecca for Americans migrating from other states, and Mexicans heading north, although the flow has diminished from the dramatic population expansion witnessed in the 1980s. California has been hit much harder by recession than most economists forecast, with job losses in its important defence industries, financial services and the construction industry. To this have been added a string of earthquakes, forest fires and the destruction caused by this year's Los Angeles riots. The Business Forecasting Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, which has tended to be more pessimistic than rival analysts, now suggests recovery may not happen until the final months of next year. Texas, which suffered a severe recession in the mid-1980s thanks to a wild construction spree and falling oil prices, has since bounced back and grew about 1.5 per cent last year, thanks to an industrial diversification which makes it far less dependent on the energy sector. The region has become an important high-technology centre and stands to benefit more than almost any other from the increased cross-border business which will follow the establishment of a North American Free Trade Area.</p>

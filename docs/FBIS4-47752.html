			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ike Motsapi] </F>   [Text] African National Congress Premier-elect for the  Eastern Transvaal Region Mr Matthews Phosa has unveiled a  six-point plan on how he intends to run the area. Phosa also  told SOWETAN in an interview that urgent steps needed to be  taken in "order to avoid money being misused by people who are  presently in state offices".    He said his plan would be to:     -  Immediately put in place strict monitoring of government  and administration in KwaNdebele, KaNgwane and the Transvaal  Province Administration;    -  Decentralisation of power;    -  Kick-start all the structures of state so that they should  function in a cohesive manner;    -  Finalise the policy position of all 29 regional structures;    -  Start reconstruction and development;    -  Identify the needs of the people and immediately begin to  deliver and;    -  Management of the expectations of the people must be  people-driven. People should know what is happening so that if  there is a delay in fulfilling their needs, they would be in the  know.       Phosa said: "Government must develop a culture of  communication because this will help to solve problems that  might arise.    "The people of South Africa have managed to liberate  themselves and this they did by communicating their aspirations  through the ballot box," said Phosa.</p>

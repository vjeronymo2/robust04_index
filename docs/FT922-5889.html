			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below 18,000 on arbitrage unwinding STRONGER crude oil prices, a weaker yen and higher bond yields prompted profit-taking and arbitrage-related selling of equities and the Nikkei average fell below 18,000 for the first time since May 6, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 382.08, or 2.1 per cent, to 17,822.56. The index opened at the day's high of 18,167.10 and fell to a day's low of 17,648.03. Late afternoon buying by investment trusts helped it recoup some ground. Volume improved from 209m shares to 300m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 865 to 136, with 120 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 19.22 to 1,352.61, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.70 to 1,066.00. Heavy arbitrage unwinding on the back of a weak futures market, triggered by institutional selling, depressed the Nikkei. An increasing number of arbitrageurs are expected to unwind positions ahead of the June futures contract's expiry next month, since the rollover into the September contract has been delayed due to low liquidity and prospects of a continuing sluggish market. Institutional investors and foreigners were seen selling blue chip electricals. High-technology companies have been reporting weak results for the past fiscal year to March, with Japan's five leading computer groups announcing this week pre-tax profit falls ranging from 43 to 69 per cent. NEC dropped Y35 to Y956 and Sony Y130 to Y4,080. Mr Barry Dargan, electrical analyst at James Capel, said investors remained uncertain about the industry outlook, and some foreign investors, who had bought the issues before the recent rally, were locking in profits. Speculative stocks which have been sought by short-term traders and individuals lost favour. Bio-technology and environmental 'theme' shares fell on profit-taking, with Morinaga Milk shedding Y19 to Y841. Low liquidity component stocks of the Nikkei index declined sharply due to heavy index-linked selling. Shimura Kako lost Y45 to Y640 and Shinagawa Refractories also Y45 to Y780. On the bright side, oil and resource-related issues gained ground. Lion, the detergent maker, jumped Y10 to Y35, a high for the year. Investors were encouraged by the company's research into production of automobile fuel from palm oil. In Osaka, the OSE average weakened 469.75 to 20,441.75 in volume of 17.7m shares. Roundup THE DECLINE in Tokyo had little effect on the rest of the Pacific Rim region yesterday, with markets generally reacting to domestic influences. HONG KONG set another record high in spite of profit-taking just before the close. The Hang Seng index finished 30.62 stronger at 6,082.70, after touching 6,101.89. Turnover was around HKDollars 6bn. Rumours that Hutchison Whampoa planned to privatise Cavendish led to the suspension of both stocks. Parent Cheung Kong climbed HKDollars 1.10, or 4.5 per cent, to HKDollars 25.70. Other suspensions included Hong Kong Land and HK Macau Developments, on rumours, confirmed after the close, that the latter was part of a consortium which had paid HK Land HKDollars 3.8bn for an office development. HSBC Holdings gained HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 46.75 after the bank ruled out any plan to raise its bid for Midland Bank. SINGAPORE broke through 1,500 for the first time in three months, the Straits Times Industrial index rising 12.25 to 1,506.54 in volume of 83.54m shares. Banks and property groups registered the largest gains, although a rumoured interest rate cut did not materialise. SEOUL's composite index put on 15.72 to 585.23 on reports that the government would help investment trusts in financial difficulty. KUALA LUMPUR was weaker as many investors awaited today's listing of Tenaga Nasional, the electric utility. It has been trading in the grey market at MDollars 7.60 and some analysts forecast volatile trade today, with reports that some brokers are short of stock. The composite index dipped 1.32 to 591.20. MANILA fell on profit-taking after recent gains. The composite index was off 19.08 at 1,421.83 in combined turnover of some 315m pesos, down from 442m pesos. BANGKOK was weaker as political unease continued to affect sentiment. The SET index lost 13.83, or 1.9 per cent, to 715.75 in turnover of Bt4bn. BOMBAY fell more than 4.5 per cent in volatile trading. The BSE index closed 153.96 lower at 3,144.78. AUSTRALIA came off an intraday low following half-year results from ANZ Banking which were in line with expectations. The All Ordinaries index closed 8.3 easier at 1,665.9 in turnover of ADollars 357.4m. ANZ firmed 5 cents to ADollars 4.30, but Westpac was 11 cents lower at ADollars 3.52 following last week's disappointing results. TNT receded 13 cents to ADollars 1.94 after reporting worse than expected nine-month figures on Tuesday.</p>

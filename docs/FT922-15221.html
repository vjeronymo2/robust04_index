			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Early fall in India's tea production INDIA'S TEA production in the first two months of 1992 has fallen by 5.83m kg to 23.81m kg because of adverse weather. The production shortfall is almost entirely in the tea estates in south India, where the crop in January and February amounted to 20.65m kg, compared with 25.99m kg in the corresponding period of last year. North Indian tea production was 3.16m kg, down from 3.65m kg last year. Plucking of tea leaves in Assam, Darjeeling and north Bengal picks up from March, coinciding with the end of the winter. According to industry officials, tea production has also suffered in Sri Lanka, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Indonesia. India, which harvested a record tea crop of 741.7m kg in 1991, will be fixing the production target for the current year once the March figures are available.</p>

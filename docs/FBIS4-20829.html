			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vil Mirzayanov: "In Jail There Is `Neither Jew </F> Nor Greek'"    [Text] I have experienced many pangs of conscience. As I  worked on chemical weapons I could not help but realize for what  purpose they were being made. Just as I realized that by  breaking my silence I would end up in jail sooner or later.    A few days ago I came back after spending 27 days in  custody.  There I realized that it is not just the "chemical generals" who  are willing to go to any length to settle scores with those who  would spoil their comfortable and peaceful lives under the veil  of secrecy. The same kind of "generals" are to be found in the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, the procuracy and the courts. Some  of them poison bodies and some of them poison souls, and it is  hard to say which is worse. In a word, politics is poisoned.    But the generals are not the only problem. We have become  too  accustomed to slavery to behave like free people. When released,  former prisoners often attempt to forget the nightmare of  degradation that they have experienced -- it no longer concerns  them! But to forget is to condone the tyranny that is now being  imposed on others.    Until recently my images of prison and prisoners were  derived  solely from movies. I thought that criminals and their behavior  were a terrible world inaccessible to us. And, as an ordinary  individual, I was actually glad that I did not understand it.    The initial holding cell at Matrosskaya Tishina is  legendary.  It is the waiting room of hell. Dirty, worn walls and slovenly  guards. A 16-square-meter box into which 50 people are crammed,  going for almost 24 hours at a stretch without sleep, food or  water. The very first morning proved just how little the life of  a prisoner is worth, a prisoner whose guilt might never even be  proven. A drunk guard brutally beat a Kurd who was trying to ask  for something. "You scumbags," he screamed, "you bandits -- I'll  destroy anybody who talks back to me!" Then a few more hours of  humiliation: photographs, fingerprints and, finally, one's "own"  cell: four iron bunks and three mattresses for seven people.  When the doors slammed shut behind me I inwardly cringed,  expecting a continuation of the mockery. But the first thing I  heard was: "Sit down! Do you want some tea?" They saw that I had  brought nothing with me and offered me some food. Simple human  gestures...    This may shock some people, but in our inside-out world, in  a  world poisoned by politicians, prison is genuinely fair. People  will share the only thing they own with you without expecting  anything in return. There is no hypocrisy and no lies. Over  there is a murderer, and I am a political prisoner -- yet we are  the same. I am respected for my mind, not for my past  achievements. You are perceived for what you are. In everyday  life -- I am a Tatar myself -- one can often hear people used  words like "chuchmek" [derogatory term for person of Central  Asian origin] or "natsmen," [ethnic minority] and as for calling  a Jew a "Yid"... In prison there is neither Greek nor Jew, and  ethnic hatred does not exist as a concept. I saw people help a  Vietnamese man. He could not understand a thing -- and people  explained things to him, interpreted for him, showed him... But  look at how foreigners are viewed in Moscow -- "as if we didn't  have enough criminals of our own." The newspapers print it,  television broadcasts it and the Moscow government takes  measures to eradicate crime "by persons from the Caucasus  region." But in prison there is none of this.    I was told: do not worry, in prison no one will ever lay a  hand on you. Anyone who breaks the truce faces complete  ostracism, because for the slightest infraction they drag out  everyone, beat them up and throw them in solitary. Anyone who  causes a row is not just putting himself at risk.    In order to survive there you must become an optimist. In  the  larger cells, where there are 100 or more prisoners instead of  just 25, there are "families" of 5-7 individuals. They share  everything they get from outside. Those who get no packages do  the dirty jobs and get a piece of sugar -- the common currency  here -- from each of the others.    One cellmate of mine in Cell 238 was a businessman who sells  woodworking equipment. He was just driving along, at a roadblock  they found a pistol in his car -- and now he is doing four  months' time. That is not much. A driver from Sheremetevo used  to take whatever he found lying around. One prisoner is a  pickpocket, another is in prison for petty theft, and yet  another is there for brawling. None of them likes the Duma or  Zhirinovskiy. "He," they say, "is a fascist, just like our  prison guards."    In prison I realized that human rights are just as important  a struggle as the fight against chemical weapons. Many people  have been in prison for three or four years without a trial. The  chairman of Tellur Cooperative is in his fifth year in prison  for "embezzlement of socialist property": he used a short-term  loan to buy computers instead of food items. Yet the law states  that no one may be held longer than two months without trial.  Our constitution and laws, imperfect though they may be, are our  only protection against those who have the power. Even in prison  you have rights and obligations under the Investigative  Detention Center Charter. But you will not be allowed to look at  that charter -- it is "for official use only." Yet as long as it  applies only to the prison guards, every one of us is in danger.    My former colleagues are still afraid to speak up, both  those  who work for the defense industry and those who are already  retired. It has been almost a year and a half since I came out  publicly, but still I am the only one. Whether they will put me  in jail again (going to jail is one of those things that are out  of my hands) will depend on the new general procurator. I hope  that things will be easier for those who come after me...</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: YACHT CLUB'S FIRST FEMALE MEMBER SAYS IT WAS JUST A  MATTER OF TIME.  </P> <P> Sure, it's exciting and a privilege and all that to become the first woman  member of the Catalina Island Yacht Club since its founding in 1924. But Cheryl  Muat is still surprised that it's drawn any notice.  </P> <P> How surprised?  </P> <P> "When you called, I thought you were calling about a subscription," Muat told a  reporter recently. "I mean, it's an honor to be the first woman member. But I  didn't do this for any fanfare, and I'm still sort of stunned at the  attention."  </P> <P> Stunned because the cheery mother of two joined the 200-member club to make  friends, not waves.  </P> <P> "It wasn't like my husband and I said, 'Let's see if we can stir up a  commotion,' " said Muat, 37, of Huntington Beach. "We just put in my  application, waited and found out that I was accepted."  </P> <P> Muat's path to the club was paved just over three years ago when its members  amended the group's bylaws to permit women. The move was prompted by the hubbub  facing another Santa Catalina boaters group, the Tuna Club, whose all-male  membership came under scrutiny as it sought a new 10-year lease on an Avalon  city building.  </P> <P> "At the time, there weren't any women clamoring to get into our club," recalled  Ray Miller, publicity chairman for the yacht club.  </P> <P> But when the Tuna Club's all-male membership became an issue, Miller said, "the  board saw what was happening and said, 'Oh oh, we better do something to  forestall any problems.' They decided the time had come to end discrimination."  </P> <P> When that happened, Muat's parents urged their daughter to apply for  membership. "My dad's a member and my mom's in the auxiliary. So when the  bylaws were changed . . . I decided to apply," Muat said.  </P> <P> With its membership strictly limited at 200, Muat had to wait several years, as  does any new member, for a vacancy. And when it arrived last month, the San  Pedro-born daughter and granddaughter of fishermen was at last a member of the  club.  </P> <P> "Being the first female member is an honor. The island means so much to me and  my family," said Muat, whose children, Chris, 15, and Shauna, 12, have spent  most of their summers on Catalina. Her husband, Drake, is a captain with the  Newport Beach Fire Department.  </P> <P> "I like being in the club just to be there. I like boating. The club is a nice  place to go. The people are good people, fun people," she said. "And my husband  and I felt this was a way for us to sort of have a piece of the island and the  club." The family's 40-foot sportfishing boat is moored in San Diego.  </P> <P> As for breaking new ground, Muat said, opening the doors to women, be it a  yacht club or a fire department or almost anything else, just makes common  sense.  </P> <P> "There's no reason not to allow women or men or any group into an area if  they're qualified," said Muat.  </P> <P> "When fire departments first allowed women, it was a shock to a lot of people.  Now, my husband works with women. He accepts them. He respects them," said  Muat, who works for the Ocean View School District. "So long as someone's  qualified, they should be accepted."  </P> <P> That philosophy, Muat said, has guided her for some time. Ten years ago, she  remembers, the director of her son's Little League was shocked when she walked  into his office and told him she wanted to coach the team.  </P> <P> "The guy said, 'Oh, you want to be the team mother.' And I said, 'No, I want to  coach.' The guy was just floored," says Muat, whose record was 15-3 that year  as a Little League coach.  </P> <P> Now, as she becomes a member of the yacht club, her husband is about to become  the first male member of the women's auxiliary, whose bylaws also were changed  several years ago.  </P> <P> And how does he feel about it? "Are you kidding? He's in seventh heaven about  joining a club of all women," Muat said, laughing. "He's a fireman." Greg  Krikorian  </P></p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Shake-up of airtime selling at ITV A SUBSTANTIAL shake-up in the selling of ITV advertising time will be announced today with the creation of two super-sales houses. The changes will yield the ITV companies savings on overheads and research costs, and could could give the grouped-together ITV companies more clout with advertisers. Granada and Scottish Television are combining their sales operations in a grouping which will include Grampian and Border Television. Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV company for the south of England which has been selling its own airtime since it took over from TVS on January 1, is joining forces with HTV, the company for Wales and the west, in a 50-50 joint venture. It will also represent Westcountry, Channel and the Welsh Fourth Channel. The move means there will now be four main sales houses selling most of the ITV advertising time. In addition to the two new joint ventures, neither of which has a name yet, there is TSMS, which links Central, Anglia and Ulster. Earlier this year London Weekend Television took a stake in Yorkshire Tyne-Tees and at the same time announced that the London company would in future be selling Yorkshire Tyne-Tees air time. The move leaves Carlton Television, holders of the London weekday franchise, as the only one of the 15 ITV companies selling airtime on its own. The deals have been approved by the Independent Television Commission which has the power to prevent any ITV company or group of companies gaining a dominant position in advertising sales. The ITC is reluctant to allow any group more than a 15 per cent market share. The four sales houses have about 20 per cent each.</p>

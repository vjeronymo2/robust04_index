			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F> INTERFAX agency journalists "specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI";  at INTERFAX Moscow headquarters, date not given: "Leonid  Kravchuk: God Forbid Our Peoples Should Quarrel! During the CIS  Heads of State Conference in the Russian Capital Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk Visited INTERFAX Moscow Headquarters  and Answered the Agency Journalists' Questions"]    [Text] [INTERFAX] Leonid Makarovich! Ukraine has signed  an agreement on joining the CIS Economic Union as an associate  member. Why that status in particular, and what will that  status provide for Ukraine?    [Kravchuk] I think that the division into "full" and  "associate" membership of the Economic Union is currently a  negative thing. I will explain why. While the CIS as a  structure is in the formation stage, it does not seem possible  to make a clear distinction between full and associate members  of the union. For instance, we have signed all the economic  documents which were put to the CIS Heads of State Council.  Thus, I believe that in actual fact there is no difference  between those classed as full members and us associate members  of the Economic Union.    We realize that this may be an artificial distinction at the  moment, but there is still a "but." The fact is that the  Ukrainian parliament, when it examined the Treaty on the  Formation of the CIS, made some appropriate comments and  stipulations. These are in force to this day. And I as  president cannot sign any documents ignoring those stipulations.  This is the explanation for our legal status of associate  member of the Economic Union. But I would repeat that we are  playing and will continue to play the most full and active role  in the Economic Union.    [INTERFAX] The second question is also partly connected with  the form of cooperation. There has been talk about the  Kazakhstan president's proposal to set up a Eurasian union. A  number of politicians, not least in Russia -- Sergey Shakhray,  for instance -- are even calling for an international group of  experts to be set up to elaborate an overall concept for the  economic integration of the former Union republics (those which  want to participate, of course). What is your attitude to these  proposals?    [Kravchuk] I could reply in the words of the sages of old:  "Do today what can be done today; what cannot be done today (if  the time is not ripe), postpone until tomorrow."    The conditions for integration on the broad scale that  certain politicians are assuming (taking the EC as their model,  presumably) are not yet in place here. I do not believe that as  soon as you sign any decision it starts being implemented all by  itself; that we signed a decision and the CIS started operating;  or that we can sign another and the Eurasian union will start  operating tomorrow....    For this union to work and operate properly the conditions  for it must be prepared. Step by step.    What goals and tasks are we setting? How should we approach  such goals and tasks? After all, it is no secret that the EC  has taken 35 years to reach its current position. We have only  been in the CIS for a few years so far, and we have been unable  to elaborate the mechanisms for the Commonwealth's activity  during this period. Many other questions have not been resolved  either. Not because we have no desire to do so, but because we  have no opportunity, no conditions. You need to have the right  conditions to solve any problem -- all the more so when it comes  to solving such major problems.    Second, we must ultimately resolve them in a civilized  fashion. We need to instruct experts to work seriously on the  whole range of issues and then consult with the people. Look  how tolerantly and respectfully the population is treated by the  European states, where a whole variety of opinion polls are  carried out. But our mentality is to say that we have met and  signed another agreement, so it should start operating! That  the people will see the results later. Actually, this is  probably not quite correct.    That is, I do not reject the idea itself; I merely do not  want it to immediately become a subject of a political decision,  because then it will end badly. We cannot yet answer all the  questions which will be of concern to people in connection with  the implementation of this proposal.    [INTERFAX] It seems that there is currently a certain amount  of concern among Russian social and official circles about the  results of the Ukrainian parliamentary elections. The gist of  this concern is that different political forces with  diametrically opposed views won in different parts of your  country. This presupposes a potential either for sharp  confrontation or, conversely, for state power -- in its desire  to consolidate society -- to try to play the nationalist card.  Events in Odessa and all the problems connected with the Black  Sea Fleet can partly be explained by this theory. What is your  view on this?    [Kravchuk] We need to ask the question as follows:  Consolidation around what, or confrontation with whom and  against what? After all, profoundly different forces were also  victorious in the December elections in Russia, but nobody in  Russia is yet proposing that that state join with Ukraine.  Moreover, if some Russian parliamentary deputies allowed  themselves to suggest as much, they would probably be considered  not very serious people, to put it quite politely. More  accurately, the question would arise of whether Ukraine would be  an independent state in friendship and alliance with Russia or  whether it would come under Russia. As president I say that I  want to be in friendship, cooperation, and partnership with  Russia. But I do not want to be under Russia.    Certain people claim that it is wrong to argue in this way,  on the grounds that such a thing could not happen. Well,  unfortunately, history has shown that when two states unite,  tendencies toward a strong ethnic thrust are victorious in the  historical aspect and in development. That is inevitable.    The 340 years of unification with Russia and the 70 years in  the USSR confirmed that the Ukrainian language has already  started to disappear from Ukraine and certain traditions of our  national culture have begun to die off.    That is a real fact. It is the reason why we need to  elaborate a mechanism to ensure that Ukraine and Russia live in  friendship and partnership as two good-neighborly states. To  this end we need to resolve some acute issues hampering  good-neighborliness.    For instance, one of these is the nuclear issue. It strikes  me that we have already resolved it one way or another. I  personally am glad that the tripartite agreement on issues  relating to the elimination of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian  territory are beginning to be fulfilled, albeit with difficulty.    Then there is the Black Sea Fleet problem. I think that, on  the basis of the agreements that have been reached, we will be  able to solve this problem as well. I want the Odessa incident  -- without going into details or analyzing who was right or  wrong -- to be seen as a signal for the immediate and  constructive resolution of the Black Sea Fleet problem. I want  to stress that when such complex issues are being resolved we  must all be guided by good intentions. There can be no other  approach.    If the Russian military say that the entire fleet and its  entire infrastructure should go to Russia, while the Ukrainians  strive to give nothing, then it is clear that both of these  positions are both wrong and unrealistic.    In confirmation of this I myself would raise the following  question -- in 1992 prices, the entire Black Sea naval structure  is worth 35 trillion rubles [R] (the ruble-dollar rate being  1-1,000 at the time); consequently, the value of the fleet is  $35 billion (made up of $17.5 billion for Russia and the same  amount for Ukraine). Ukraine's debt to Russia is $2.5 billion.  Thus, Russia should pay Ukraine $15 billion and then the ships  could go to Russia. But this must be done in such a way as to  ensure that the cost of the ships is paid for first. If we  recall Ostap Bender, he reaffirmed that we should not first hand  the ships over and get the money for them 10 years later. But  is Russia capable of paying this amount of money at the moment?  It is important to realize that this is not a question of  nationalistic or imperial aspirations. It is simple economics  -- will Russia be able to transfer $15 billion to Ukraine? Of  course not. So we need to proceed on the basis of the actual  situation and the actual interests of both countries.    The Black Sea Fleet problem can be resolved, but it has to  be in a phased manner. We should begin by dividing up the fleet  and separating it into different bases. If there are two  commanders in the same "galley" they are bound to quarrel. I  recall the period when the Black Sea Fleet was commanded by  Admiral Igor Kasatonov and the Ukrainian Navy by Admiral B.  Kozhin. Initially, all was sweetness and light between them.  But they lived together for a month and the fighting started.    I. Kasatonov was replaced by E. Baltin, while B. Kozhin was  replaced by V. Beskaravaynyy. The first month went well, but  then the fighting began again. Thus, if the fleets are not  split up, I am sure that no good will come of it.    In the second phase we need to settle the question of the  Russian naval base, proceeding on the basis of international  principles. But if the Russian military say that the base means  not just Sevastopol but Feodosiya, Odessa, Izmail, Nikolayev,  all the airfields, and so forth, then I in my turn will say:  "Do you seriously believe that?" Twelve Russian naval bases in  Ukraine?! Can that be taken seriously? I think not. In any  case, this decision is parliament's prerogative. In other  words, the question should be viewed not from the standpoint of  the navy which the Soviet Union had, but from the standpoint  solely of the Russian Navy. But the military are unwilling to  come to terms with this approach; they are pressuring the  political leadership on both sides. And, under this pressure,  the political leadership has been constantly postponing the task  of finding a solution to the Black Sea Fleet problem.    For instance, Ukraine has already said several times: "Yes,  we agree to give up part of our navy, since we do not need such  a big navy." But, in order to define how to sell it or transfer  it to Russia, we must be able to examine all the fleet's  documents. We must know how much it is currently worth, what  its initial cost was, where the ships are, and what condition  they are in. We are not trying to monitor every ship, but  merely to study the necessary documents. But we have not had  that opportunity. Why is Ukraine being deprived of the right to  know what it is giving up? There can be no avoiding a political  decision in this area. Moreover, nor should we be guided by the  intentions of the naval leaders and the military, because each  naval leader wants to be a great man. And they see their  greatness in simple terms: The more ships they have under their  command, the more important they are.    I am convinced that the Russian president understands me  perfectly. And that is already quite an important first step.    [INTERFAX] A conflict between Russia and Ukraine is the most  terrible thing that could happen. Presumably you too have given  some thought as to how to prevent even small conflicts, not to  mention big ones?    [Kravchuk] That is the main question for us. We must not  quarrel even over the Black Sea Fleet -- although this is a  painful issue for Russia. I understand that. Particularly  Sevastopol. It is a painful and historical issue for the  Russian mentality and the Russian leadership.    Russia's leadership cannot get away from the Russian  mentality because, if it did, it would not be the Russian  leadership. And the Russian leadership should defend Russians,  as I must defend Ukraine. But we must not go our separate ways  and end up in a state of mutual enmity. We must not allow our  peoples to quarrel. Ultimately, this is the most important  point. This has never happened in the past 340 years. God  forbid we should ever quarrel. But to prevent this we need to  display incredible willpower to avoid getting drawn into  conflict. We need to remember that conflicts are almost always  started by armed people. Politicians are becoming hostages. All  of us must prevent this from happening!    [INTERFAX] But surely, it is not only armed people who can  bring about a conflict. Take the problem of energy sources. It  is no less painful....    [Kravchuk] True, but that is a different sphere. We can  also include the banking system and loans, and there are  international norms. We are not confronting one another here  either, just because we have weapons. After all, weapons can be  fired! A single shot can cause so many complex problems and  exacerbate them to such an extent that it may later be not just  hard but sometimes even impossible to stop a snowballing  conflict. There are examples of this -- Azerbaijan, Armenia,  and Georgia.    Unfortunately, we already have lessons from which we should  learn. That is why I advocate that everything should be  resolved swiftly, without delay. I understand those military  men who are trying to delay resolution of the issue. They are  doing this in the expectation that their flag will be raised on  some ship and that this ship will then de facto go to one or  other side. Others are counting on the new Crimean leadership to  conduct its policy in such a way as to "help" to unilaterally  resolve the Black Sea Fleet problem. But this "help," I am  convinced, could turn into a tragedy for the two peoples. We  have no right to quarrel, even over the Crimea. Although I also  understand the Crimea's role and importance for both parties.  We need to ensure that the Crimea does not drive us or our  peoples apart. Because leaders come and go, but peoples remain.    [INTERFAX] We get the impression that, when you start  working together with the Russian president on the most acute  issues, you find acceptable solutions. Tell us, do you find it  easy to work with Boris Yeltsin on a purely personal level?    [Kravchuk] When I talk about this subject the main thing for  me is that each people chooses the leader it wants. The  Russians chose B. Yeltsin, and the Ukrainians chose L. Kravchuk.  Whether we match each other in character or not, we have to  find the ability to work together. As for Boris Nikolayevich  personally, I am able to resolve questions with him, I am able  to raise problems and to meet with an appropriate reaction --  sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but always clear-cut and  precise. Yes, when we are together we resolve the tasks facing  us.    [INTERFAX] Do you often contact the Kremlin by phone?    [Kravchuk] Of course, and not only Boris Nikolayevich. For  instance, when the Russian president was in Spain and the  "Odessa incident" occurred, I contacted Viktor Stepanovich  Chernomyrdin several times. And I can also reach mutual  understanding with him.    But, unfortunately, our mutual understanding with the top  Russian leadership is sometimes eroded in the structures "under  us." And it is at those levels that people start quoting  arguments, finding legal norms of some kind, remembering some  international principles that are by no means to our mutual  advantage, and making a huge number of proposals of all kinds.  And the main task facing both sides is sometimes lost sight of  under such a huge pile of documentation....    That is why I would reiterate that the Ukrainian and Russian  leaderships need above all political will, patience, and  determination.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> America's major veterans groups, armed with a new poll, called on Congress to  act quickly to protect the flag from desecration. At the same time, a former  prisoner of war cautioned members of a House Judiciary subcommittee to not  damage the Constitution because of the flag issue. Members of the American  Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Disabled American Veterans presented  initial results of a Gallup Poll that found 66% favor a constitutional  amendment. The survey was taken July 7-17 and included 272 respondents. But  James Warner, a former Marine flight officer who was held as a prisoner in  Vietnam for 5 1/2 years, argued that while desecration of the flag caused him  "immeasurable pain," the Constitution should not be tampered with.  </P></p>

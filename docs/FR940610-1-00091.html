However, the lag time to realize this level of benefits over a 20 year period might be greater since FDA's estimates apply to the U.S. adult population and the proposed rule on school meals will begin to have effect with those children in school at the time of implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fat and saturated fat reductions estimated to accompany the proposed regulation assume that: (1) Students do not replace school meal fat and saturated fat reductions by increasing fat intake at other times of the day or on non-school days, (2) that the dietary improvements at USDA school meals do not result in similar improvements at other meals or on non-school days and (3) that the improvements by program participants do not result in changes by non-program participants. If students did replace fat and saturated fat at other eating occasions, a smaller health benefit would result. If improvements on school days serve as a positive models which, when combined with nutrition education, result in improvements to non-USDA school meal, a larger improvement would result. The findings from the Menu Modification Demonstrations indicate that the daily fat intakes of NSLP participants would decline if their fat intakes at lunch were lower, but the effect on non-school meals is less clear. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Four sites at geographically dispersed locations (Chattanooga, TN; Denver, CO; Princeton City, OH; and San Bernadino, CA) received grants to test reduction in the fat content of NSLP meals. Dietary intakes of fifth grade NSLP participants at lunch and over 24 hours were collected both at baseline and after the reduction of fat in the NSLP meals. The demonstration found that the percent of calories from fat over 24 hours declined either significantly or marginally at all sites for both boys and girls. In addition, the reduction of intake in grams of total fat over 24 hours was greater than or equal to the reduction at the NSLP meal at three of the four sites. At the fourth site (Princeton City), despite an NSLP reduction in fat, 24-hour calories and grams of fat increased. At the San Bernardino site, which achieved the largest reduction in fat at the NSLP meals, the reduction of grams of fat over 24 hours was significantly greater than the NSLP reduction. On balance, the results of this demonstration indicate that when fat at the NSLP meal is reduced, students usually do not replace these calories by increasing fat intake at other eating occasions. While there is some indication that an accompanying reduction in fat at other eating occasions may be more common than an increase in fat at other eating occasions, findings are mixed and therefore not robust enough to influence benefit projections. Accordingly, the analysis in this section assumes that changes in NSLP fat levels do not affect fat intake at other occasions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

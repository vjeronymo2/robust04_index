			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / NHS reforms 'damaging cancer research' National Health Service reforms are damaging cancer research by rewarding hospitals for success in treatment rather than research and by forcing doctors to do administrative work, a survey warned yesterday. Half of doctors conducting trials report difficulties in continuing their research, said the UK Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research, which represents large groups funding cancer research. The advent of NHS trust hospitals has cut the time and cash spent on clinical trials of new treatments, it said. Professor John Smyth of Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, who is one of the report's authors, said drug companies contributed to the cost of trials but only those on new drugs where a high price could eventually be charged. NHS researchers also looked at other drugs that could provide cheaper treatments. It was this research that was suffering, said Prof Smyth. He said: 'We're not against trusts, but the concept of research is diametrically opposed to the market-driven approach.' The government rejected the findings. Mr John Bowis, a junior health minister, said NHS changes did not 'signal any lessening' of a commitment to clinical research. He said: 'We have set a target of increasing research and development expenditure to 1.5 per cent of total NHS spending.' He added that a report on NHS research and development policy commissioned by the government from Professor Anthony Culyer of York University would be published next month. Prof Culyer would take into account the findings published yesterday in which most respondents blamed their difficulties on the increasing burden of administrative work, lack of time and staff shortages. Dr Jonathan Waxman, cancer consultant at the Hammersmith Hospital in London, described how a team of specialists last month had to abandon its normal work to teach a health authority representative the basics of cancer treatment. He said the government had tried to address the problem with grants to teaching hospitals designed to compensate them for their high overheads and time spent on research rather than revenue-earning treatment. But Prof Smyth said the government's own advisers had seen that this did not help other hospitals where many clinical trials were conducted. The report, published in this week's British Medical Journal, outlines proposals to limit the damage it says is being done to cancer research. They include making clinical trials a government priority, allocating funds to support the cost of trials and central co-ordination of work by the NHS. The government yesterday published for consultation the names of drugs it proposes to put on its 'limited list' of products available on the NHS. The move is designed to produce cuts by extending the list of disease areas in which only a small number of products can be prescribed by NHS doctors. Drug companies have argued against limited lists, saying they stifle research into new treatments. The list of 26 products in 10 areas includes Arret capsules for diarrhoea, Dermacort skin cream and Audax Ear Drops. Patients can already buy most of the listed products without a prescription.</p>

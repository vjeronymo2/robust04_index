			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook chief accepts merits of role change MR ROBERT Montague, founder and executive chairman of Tiphook, the container leasing and transport rental group, has accepted the merits of splitting his role. The company said the board was also likely to sanction the appointment soon of a further two independent non-executive directors. Whether Mr Montague will continue with the group is up to the group's bankers and shareholders. Last week Tiphook's shares fell by 49 per cent after the lossmaking group issued its third profits warning this year and said it would breach lending covenants. Shareholders will vote at an extraordinary meeting on October 25 on a proposal to allow the group's gearing limit to be increased from 500 to 600 per cent. Tiphook currently has debts of Pounds 1bn and gearing approaching 500 per cent. Tiphook shares rose by 15p to 138p yesterday after it published its first monthly fleet utilisation figures. Average utilisation for September for its operating container fleet was 82.25 per cent, up from 81.99 per cent in August but down from 85.94 per cent in the same month last year. The statement showed that at September 30 the operating container fleet totalled 497,020 TEUs (20-foot equivalent units), down 566 from the previous month. Tiphook's European truck trailer fleet stood at 24,825, an increase of 334 over August. Average utilisation for the month was 73.22 per cent, up from 69.36 per cent in August, 1993. Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations, but were welcome because they contained no unpleasant surprises. The figures gave no indication of the rental rates being achieved in a period when the market is known to be soft.</p>

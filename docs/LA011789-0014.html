			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: EXIT LINES  </P> <P> When Johnny Carson was honored Sunday night at a celebrity-studded dinner to  raise money for scholarships in his name to Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he  noted that a large telescope was being built in Hawaii and said: "Even with  that telescope, I still wouldn't be able to see why Hebrew University is  honoring this Gentile." Jihan Sadat, the wife of slain Egyptian President Anwar  Sadat, praised Carson as "an American who is a household name throughout the  world, a man who has humorously chided us for our shortcomings and brought  laughter into our lives."

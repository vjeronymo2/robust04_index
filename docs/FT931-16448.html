			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Pennzoil to use Chevron stake to help raise Dollars 350m PENNZOIL, the Houston-based oil company, is using part of a controversial share stake it built up in rival oil group Chevron more than three years ago to help raise Dollars 350m. In an unusual convertible issue being launched simultaneously in the US and the London-based Euromarkets, the company is selling bonds convertible into around 3.6m shares in Chevron. This represents just over 1 per cent of Chevron's ordinary share capital. Pennzoil paid Dollars 2.2bn for nearly 9 per cent of Chevron in December 1989, prompting a fierce battle between the two oil companies. It agreed last October to reduce its stake to just over 5 per cent, or 17.2m shares, swapping the other part of its holding for some of Chevron's US oil and gas reserves. The deal also marked the end of a protracted legal dispute between the two. Chevron had claimed that Pennzoil illegally disguised an intention to gain partial control over it. It remained unclear whether the convertible bond issue marked the beginning of a move by Pennzoil to dispose of its entire Chevron stake. Investors will be able to exchange the bonds at any time over the next 10 years into Chevron shares at a premium of between 18-20 per cent over their current value, though Pennzoil will have the right to repay the bonds after five years at their issue price. The coupon of between 6 3/4 -7 per cent on the bonds, which are being issued at par, is only fractionally above the current yield on 10-year US government paper, though Pennzoil debt only just classifies as investment grade. It is ranked BBB and BAA2 by the two big US rating agencies, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. The terms, which will be finalised early next week, were generally thought attractive yesterday, and the bonds were quoted at nearly a point above their issue price in the grey market in London late in the day. The joint lead managers to the issue, Lehman Brothers and Lazard, hope to sell Dollars 225m of the bonds in the US and Dollars 125m internationally, though these amounts may be varied depending on demand. The issue is one of the largest equity-linked deals in the international market for some time.</p>

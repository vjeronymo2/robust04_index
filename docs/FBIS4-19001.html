			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- More intensive cooperation with the  United Nations was the main issue for the beginning of UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's talks in Bonn. After his  arrival on Tuesday [12 April], he first received FRG Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Federal Government's guest house at  Petersberg for a brief courtesy visit.    In a newspaper interview on Monday, Butrus-Ghali had said  that he wants to advocate a German contribution to a permanent  UN blue helmet task force of about 3,000 soldiers. By stating  this, the UN secretary general, who expressly based his  calculations on 1 percent of the strength of the national armed  forces, seemed to expect a strength of only 300,000 men for the  German Bundeswehr (currently 370,000 men).    As during his previous two working visits, the Federal  Government will have to point out to Butrus-Ghali its hope that  such decisions will become possible as a result of the ruling by  the Federal Constitutional Court about armed alliance missions.  The foreign minister expects such a ruling in summer 1994 at  the earliest. Kinkel linked the issue with Germany's efforts for  a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. However, this seat  is not issued by Butrus-Ghali but depends on a discussion of the  United Nations.    The foreign minister urgently asked Butrus-Ghali for help  with evacuating the 11 employees of Deutsche Welle in Rwanda.  The United Nations, which has long had observers in the African  country, has helicopters and other means of transportation, with  which the Germans could be taken out of their isolated station.  The UN secretary general promised to immediately examine that  matter.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Kinkel also want to emphatically  discuss with Butrus-Ghali an appropriate and representative  settlement of UN organizations in Bonn. It was stressed in the  Foreign Ministry that the promised transfer of the small UN  information authority from Geneva does not fulfill this  condition at all.    On Tuesday, Butrus-Ghali also met with Bundestag President  Rita Suessmuth and had dinner with the Foreign Affairs  Committee. The UN secretary general will attend the meeting on  Wednesday as the guest of honor.</p>

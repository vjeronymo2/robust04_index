			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Doubts surround Yeltsin agreement on early poll MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has appeared to agree to an early presidential election but has left open the timing of the poll and the law under which it would be held. His decision at the weekend to call elections contradicts earlier statements that he wished to serve out his term of office to 1996. However, it is unlikely that elections can be held this autumn as there is no majority among regional leaders and the time is too short to prepare for the poll. Parliament must approve the calling of elections, and as yet there is no agreed electoral law, no deal between the presidency and the parliament on the division of powers and no agreed draft constitution. Mr Yeltsin also moved to strengthen his position at the weekend by issuing a decree confirming Mr Yegor Gaidar as first deputy premier, appointing Mr Nikolai Golushko as security minister and putting Mr Yuri Skokov, a close ally, in the powerful role of secretary of the Security Council. Mr Gaidar has repeatedly underscored the need to curb state spending to bring inflation and the budget deficit under control. However, in a call for lower taxation he appears to conflict with the stated aims of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finance. Mr Yeltsin also stripped General Alexander Rutskoi, the dissident vice-president, of his one remaining right - to stand in for Mr Yeltsin during his absence from the country. Mr Yeltsin is to continue his series of high-profile visits to military units based near Moscow. In the past fortnight he has visited tank, paratroop and Interior Ministry bases.</p>

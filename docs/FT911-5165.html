			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / AT&amp;T ousts chairman and three directors of NCR AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) has succeeded in ousting four directors of NCR, the fifth-largest US computer manufacturer, including the chairman, Mr Charles Exley. NCR said that following certification of the results of a shareholders' vote last month, it was expected that AT&amp;T's four nominees would replace Mr Charles Exley Jr, chairman and chief executive; Mr Gilbert P. Williamson, president; Cathleen Morawetz; and Mr William Bowen. AT&amp;T had tried to win control of NCR's 12-member board of directors as part of its hostile takeover bid. NCR claimed victory in the proxy battle, however, because AT&amp;T failed to remove all its directors. NCR has also said that it might expand the board to reinstate any ousted directors. AT&amp;T launched a Dollars 90-per-share bid to acquire NCR last December. Subsequently, it raised the offer to Dollars 100 per share, or Dollars 6.8bn (Pounds 3.8bn), if NCR would agree to a merger and remove its anti-takeover defences, or if the entire board were replaced. NCR's board has rejected the Dollars 90-per-share bid as 'grossly inadequate' and Mr Exley has said that a price of Dollars 110 per share, or about Dollars 7.5bn, is not open to negotiation. At NCR's annual and special shareholders' meetings on March 28, AT&amp;T won votes from 52.6 per cent of the computer group's shareholders at the special meeting and 51.5 per cent at the AGM. The votes give AT&amp;T the simple majority needed to replace four of NCR's directors, but fall far short of the 80 per cent required to replace the entire board. Mr Exley said: 'We are especially pleased with AT&amp;T's low total vote in light of AT&amp;T's pre-meeting predictions that they could achieve an 80 per cent vote to remove our entire board.' NCR also reported its first-quarter results yesterday. Earnings for the quarter fell 12 per cent, partly due to the expenses involved in its struggle against AT&amp;T. First-quarter earnings were Dollars 46m, or 70 cents per share, down from Dollars 52m, or 73 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue rose to Dollars 1.36bn from Dollars 1.27bn in the same period a year ago. NCR said earnings would have been 6 cents-per-share higher had it not been for the special charges of Dollars 7m related to the AT&amp;T bid.</p>

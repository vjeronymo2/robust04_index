			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV URGES 'LAND FOR PEASANTS' IN SWEEPING REFORM OF AGRICULTURE  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in one of his most far-reaching reforms  yet, Wednesday detailed a complete reorganization of the country's  state-managed agricultural system, which has proven increasingly incapable of  feeding the nation.  </P> <P> Urging the return of "land to the peasants" after nearly 60 years of  collectivized agriculture, Gorbachev called for a new, highly decentralized  system encouraging the country's 25 million farmers to work in small  cooperatives and even independently in an effort to increase harvests.  </P> <P> Food shortages, which have been chronic for so long in the Soviet Union, are  now the country's most pressing political and social as well as economic  problem, Gorbachev told a special meeting of the Communist Party's  policy-making Central Committee. Further delay puts the whole reform effort and  even the country's stability at risk, he warned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2-Hour Address  </P> <P> "We still lag behind the developed countries, both large and small, in the  productivity of labor in agriculture, in the yield of our harvests, in  livestock productivity and in the diversity and quality of food products,"  Gorbachev said in a two-hour address, which was broadcast later on national  television.  </P> <P> "The gap, rather than narrowing, is growing wider. The food shortages create  social tension, and they are generating not just criticism but actual  discontent." he said.  </P> <P> The "food problem," as the increasingly severe food shortage is called here, is  now "our society's biggest wound," Gorbachev said, declaring that its solution  has become "the main direction of our entire political course, an organic part  of revolutionary perestroika."  </P> <P> Although the immediate intention is "to restore the farmer as the master on the  land and, once and for all, solve the food problem," as Gorbachev told the  party meeting, the proposals will require such fundamental changes in the  country's whole economic system as to amount to a redefinition of Soviet  socialism.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Laying the Foundation  </P> <P> Such basic economic concepts as private ownership, market forces, competition,  capital formation, entrepreneurship and central planning will all need to be  rethought, Gorbachev acknowledged, for the steps taken in agriculture will have  a wide impact -- and are intended, in fact, to lay the foundation for much  broader measures.  </P> <P> For this reason, he acknowledged, the proposals have encountered widespread  opposition from those wanting to improve but preserve the present system and  from others who see a serious threat to socialism as a result of the changes.  </P> <P> He resolutely rejected such conservative criticism, virtually quoting recent  speeches by Yegor K. Ligachev, the party secretary in charge of agriculture.  But he also declared his intention to preserve the overall framework of state  and collective farms as the reforms proceed.  </P> <P> Debate today by the 300 members of the Central Committee and other participants  in the two-day meeting will be intense, according to informed Soviet officials,  but the final resolution, already the result of more than a year of  experimentation, discussion and compromise, is likely to win firm approval and  become a key element of perestroika, or restructuring, as Gorbachev's reforms  are known.  </P> <P> The essence of Gorbachev's proposal is to lease the land, the livestock, the  equipment and most of the other productive assets of the Soviet Union's 49,200  state and collective farms and 7,600 other agricultural enterprises to groups  of farmers or workers and even to families and individuals on the basis of  negotiated contracts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Up to 50 Years  </P> <P> These contracts, which could run for as long as 50 years, with a son inheriting  the land his father had leased, will require rental payments and initially  delivery of specified amounts of produce. But they will free farmers from the  day-to-day supervision of the multi-layered bureaucracy that now administers  Soviet agriculture and permit them to sell on the open market whatever they  produce beyond the contracted amounts.  </P> <P> "The point here is to transfer the land and other means of production to  lease-holders and to give them real control over these means," said Gorbachev,  himself the son of a southern Russian peasant.  </P> <P> Farmers, from next January, will also receive significantly higher payments for  the produce they sell to the state as a further spur to increase their output,  and they have been promised more and better quality farming equipment at lower  prices as well as easier and cheaper bank credits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Broad Opportunities'  </P> <P> "The essence of economic change in the countryside should be in granting  farmers broad opportunities for displaying independence, enterprise and  initiative," Gorbachev said. "We should resolutely overcome the alienation of  rural workers -- and, by the way, of all working people -- from property that  belongs to them in name only."  </P> <P> In a major step toward that goal, Gorbachev proposed disbanding of the State  Agro-Industrial Committee, a super-ministry that he formed in November, 1985,  in an earlier attempt at agricultural reform.  </P> <P> Taking its place would be a state commission to coordinate purchases of  agricultural produce, still necessary to ensure fair distribution of food at  stable prices around the country, and decentralized regional bodies whose  mission would be to support, rather than supervise, the farmers.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said the government hopes that the measures will increase farm output  by 16% during the five-year plan that begins in 1991 and with improved  transport and processing that the production of foodstuffs would grow by 26% to  30%.  </P> <P> Even in years with good harvests -- grain production dropped nearly 8% to 195  million tons last year -- the Soviet Union cannot feed its 285 million people  without extensive imports of wheat, corn, meat, vegetable oil, fruits, sugar,  vegetables and other food products.  </P> <P> But declining oil prices have reduced by almost a third over the past seven  years Moscow's ability to make up its food deficit with imports.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intervention Cited  </P> <P> Gorbachev traced the origin of the problem to the forced collectivization of  agriculture in the late 1920s and early 1930s under the dictator Josef Stalin,  who adopted policies that the founders of Marxism had warned would be ruinous  for socialism.  </P> <P> The Soviet political system was seen in its "ugliest form in the forcible  methods, accelerated pace of complete collectivization and the (arbitrary)  intervention in the processes of production, of exchange and distribution,"  Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> "The individual's aspiration to be a master on his own land, the aspiration  that had been legislatively recognized, was declared to be a leftover of the  private-owner mentality. . . . . Any economic independence of collective and  state farms was ruled out, and their members were put in the position of day  laborers."  </P> <P> The problems were compounded over the years despite several attempts after  Josef Stalin's death in 1953 to reform the system, Gorbachev said, offering an  extensive review intended to justify his radical proposals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Stranger to Farming  </P> <P> "A new agrarian policy, which the countryside so needed, has never been  elaborated," he said, though his first Kremlin job was as the Central Committee  secretary in charge of agriculture.  </P> <P> But Gorbachev, under considerable pressure not to abandon the system of state  and collective farms and to cushion the impact that the reforms will have on  their workers, said the party's goal would be to develop "the huge potential  inherent in the collective system" through innovative policies.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Felipe Gonzalez today asked the PSOE [Spanish  Socialist Workers Party] to make an effort toward unity and  integration during the series of regional conferences that start  in April and continue onwards. This is how the PSOE secretary  general summarized part of the debate that took place at the  first meeting of the executive committee of the Socialist Party  elected at the recent Socialist federal congress. The decision  of who is to be spokesperson was postponed until next Tuesday [5  April], although Felipe Gonzalez hinted that the new secretary  of the organization, Cipria Ciscar, might take up the job.  [passage omitted]    Ciscar, Benegas, Marugan, Obiols, and Almunia belong to a  commission that is to suggest names and ideas for the European  elections -- elections after which Gonzalez is sure he will not  dissolve parliament. Moreover, he is optimistic about the  results.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] There will not be any  dissolution.  There will not be a causal effect between one process and the  other whatever the result may be. And may I add, I think the  result is that we will win. [end recording]    Gonzalez also says he is not too worried by the approval  [ratings] of his leadership shown by some polls, nor is he  worried by what the polls have to say about PSOE election  results. He thinks this data is linked to the crisis and that  the results will improve as soon as the citizens become aware of  the economic upturn.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] I think that the citizens are  holding us responsible for the excess of internal divisions. So  if we are able to demonstrate two things -- more internal unity  and more success on the economic front, thanks to the  considerable efforts being made -- I think that the tendency  will change.

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Protests grow as Portugal faces up to Euro-integration: Lisbon's social democrats are under attack on several fronts JUST AS everything was running smoothly with Portugal's six-month presidency of the European Community, a wave of protests has acted as a sharp reminder of the difficulties for the country as it faces the demands of European integration. The protests have different origins - mainly pay for public-sector workers, working conditions for some professions and an unpopular exam for students - but they have brought to the surface discontent and thrown the social democratic administration of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva on the defensive. The scale of student protests took everyone by surprise. For several days last month, thousands of students carried out wild-cat actions blocking streets, causing traffic chaos and leaving the police bewildered. Lisbon faces more chaos today, with another public transport strike and possible further disruption by students. The students want the controversial PGA exam - the key to higher education and university entrance - to be abolished. They say it favours better-off students by focusing on broad cultural questions which are often not covered in the official syllabus. They have won widespread sympathy, and support from the opposition socialists, who were delighted to find a popular issue with which to attack the government. Mr Diamantino Durao, the education minister, hastily declared his own doubts about the PGA, agreed to review the exam's content and said dissatisfied students could sit it again in May. In the public sector, wages are the main concern. A government offer of an 8 per cent pay rise, in line with its inflation forecast, for public administration employees was thrown out by the unions who want double-digit rises. Demonstrations followed, and the unions called a one-day nationwide strike, which prompted the government to retreat from its 'final' offer and enabled it to reach an agreement with the more moderate of the two main unions for a basic 10 per cent rise which, according to economists, will increase the total wages by around 14 per cent. Nevertheless, the strike went ahead, paralysing public transport and disrupting public administration, the health service, education, and the judiciary. The left-wing CGTP union confederation has called for another day of nationwide action later this month. The number of strikes is rising: there were 60 strikes and stoppages in January, almost double that in January 1991 and the worse record since 1986. The private sector has been practically strife-free, but that may change as restructuring begins to hurt traditional industries such as textiles where extensive lay-offs are inevitable. The deepening crisis in agriculture is another source of concern and area of potential conflict. Small farmers, who see their livelihood threatened by the advent of the EC single market, gave a foretaste last July of their likely reaction to any deal to reform the Common Agricultural Policy. They rose up against their own unions, blocking roads with tractors until paramilitary police cleared the way. The government's problem is that it must make tough adjustments now to meet its ambitious targets for European economic union in the second half of the 1990s. The budget deficit and inflation have to be reduced substantially, while growth and investment must be maintained at higher than the EC average. Its dilemma is that giving in to popular demands would undermine its economic convergence strategy; resisting the pressures would deprive it of more popular support. In theory, the government is safe from political upsets. The ruling Social Democratic party (PSD) won an absolute majority of votes and parliamentary seats in last October's general election, and Mr Cavaco Silva - as the architect of that victory - has his party firmly under control. The opposition is in disarray, and the Socialist Party (PS), which is the only political force potentially able to challenge the government, has just elected a new leader in an attempt to revamp its image following its poor showing in the elections, when it received less than 30 per cent of the vote. Mr Antonio Guterres, the party's new general secretary, will need to apply all his political skills if he is to provide the fractious socialists a new sense of direction. For the time being, public and social pressures will worry the government most, especially as it is keen to avoid unrest during its stint in the EC presidency.</p>

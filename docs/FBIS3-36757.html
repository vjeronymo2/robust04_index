An Administrative Reform in the Kremlin: All  Information Provision Departments Will Be Abolished"]    [Text] While observers' attention is centered on the  ongoing reorganization of the government and the replacement of  "shock monetary" reforms by "non-shock and non-monetary" ones,  the gradual reorganization of presidential structures is  successfully and inconspicuously coming to an end. According to  information in possession of SEGODNYA, a corresponding  presidential edict may be signed before the end this week.    The latest variant for the organization of these structures  to be approved by the edict bears the obvious marks of  behind-the-scenes struggle. The new scheme for the presidential  structure enshrines the effective exclusion of the power  ministries and the Foreign Affairs Ministry from the government  and their inclusion into the presidential administration.  Furthermore, its most characteristic feature is the emergence  of a "dual power" situation within the presidential  administration: Viktor Ilyushin, the president's first aide, is  equated in his "weight category" with the figure of the  presidential administration chief. Consequently, the first  aide, who in the new hierarchy is above the Security Council  secretary and power ministers, emerges from a formally secondary  figure into a full-fledged official.    The presidential structures plan originally envisioned that  the Analytical Center, the president's business management, the  State Legal Directorate, and the Oversight Directorate would  pass under the control of his first aide. The administration  chief's jurisdiction was to include the remaining "vital"  services, such as departments within presidential commissions,  departments on matters of citizenship, state awards, pardons,  and so forth.    The latest version of the plan features a number of minor  but  -- from the inner-party viewpoint -- extremely important  provisions. Separation of powers in the administration  leadership has not been delineated so clearly as in the past  (which leaves room for apparatus improvisations). Furthermore,  the new plan has obviously reflected the results of  behind-the-scenes bargaining between the administration and the  president's first aide.    The new version does not provide for the president's  national  security adviser -- a relatively independent post currently  occupied by Yuriy Baturin. Presidential regional  representatives have been moved from the jurisdiction of the  administration chief "under the first aide." The leadership of  the State Legal Directorate and the Oversight Directorate has  been formally removed from the control of the first aide and  placed under the president: the question about their  jurisdiction has therefore been left open. And finally, the  Information Resources Directorate (IRD) has been abolished  within the presidential administration while its remains are to  be transferred to the Federal Government Communication and  Information Agency under the president (FGCIA).    After a year and a half in the shadows, Viktor Ilyushin  officially legitimates his first role in the president's  entourage. This is not only a matter of a clash of personal  ambitions by the first aide and the presidential administration  chief, who does not have such close contacts with the apparatus,  but a tough political struggle under the table.    The direction and meaning of this struggle are reflected  most conspicuously in the fact that FGCIA (a former government  communications committee under the USSR KGB) has successfully  "swallowed" the last relatively independent information  provision service in the presidential structures -- the  Information Resources Directorate. The easy and generally  accessible information channels created by IRD allowed the  presidential team to establish effective interaction with the  regions during the crises in August 1991 and in April and  September 1993. This was especially important in the situation  when some former KGB generals who came to head the "renewed"  federal agencies showed a propensity for "falling sick" on 21  September, "getting lost" immediately after the order arrived on  disconnecting communication channels in the White House, and  playing a double game with Rutskoy and Khasbulatov till the last  moment.    FGCIA has taken repeated steps to assume control of the  entire "policy in the information provision sphere" in Russia.  As of the moment IRD is abolished, FGCIA -- a former  specialized subdivision of the secret police designed to ensure  confidential communication channels (the "hot line" and so  forth) -- officially takes control of information provision,  including open information channels of all state structures:  the Federal Assembly, the government, and the presidential  administration. The secret police information services did not  enjoy such powers even in the Soviet period, when they could so  easily disconnect the USSR president from running the country.    According to some sources, the backstage changes in the  presidential circles reflect the general trend: After two years  of painstaking work to overcome the undesirable consequences of  the August 1991 events, the "underground Sverdlovsk [Yeltsin's  home base] Obkom" in the Kremlin, in close contact with the  "underground Gazprom" in the White House and other such like  structures, is finally restoring both informational-political  and organizational control over Russia's top state leadership.  Invaluable assistance in this undertaking is coming from the  still intact "democratic administrators": Against the  background of their get-together in the Kremlin, the  "obkomists'" teamwork and cohesion produces a particularly  strong impression and leads to especially effective results.  According to a source, the best analogue for the incumbent  democratic leadership in the presidential administration is the  White Rabbit and his administrative team in the entourage of the  Queen from Alice in Wonderland. Frenetic activity with zero (if  not negative) effect may help forget for a while that what is  happening is a mere deck of cards being reshuffled by quite  other players.    The mechanism for making major decisions by the president is  rather peculiar because it envisions the possibility of making  last- minute adjustments, from slightly changing the essence of  the decisions made to reversing them. Therefore the impending  comprehensive informational-political and organizational  isolation of the president by his apparatus is rather  reminiscent not of Foros-'91, but Gorkiy-'23 [Lenin's last  retreat].</p>

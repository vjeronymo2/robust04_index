			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] in  Zambezia Province has described as antidemocratic the behavior  of the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], which continues  to forbid other political forces from doing political work in  Renamo-controlled areas.    Speaking to the Radio Mozambique's correspondent in  Quelimane, (Domingos Jambe), Frelimo provincial secretary for  organization and mobilization, condemned what he described as  the prevailing one-party system in areas under Renamo's control.  (Jambe) said that it was dishonest for Renamo to do its  political work with impunity in government-controlled areas  while preventing other parties from doing the same in its areas.</p>

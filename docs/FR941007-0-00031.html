This AD supersedes an existing airworthiness directive that currently requires a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to ensure that the flight crews verify the accuracy of data provided by the Flight Management Computer (FMC) under certain conditions. This amendment requires a revision to the AFM to ensure that the flight crews verify the accuracy of data provided by the FMC under all conditions. This amendment is prompted by a report that the ``check/confirm V speed'' message may be inhibited when the flaps are extended to within three degrees of the takeoff flap setting that was entered into the FMC. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent FMC miscalculations that may result in excessively high takeoff decision (V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ) speeds, which may adversely affect accelerate-stop distances and may lead to the failure of the airplane to stop prior to departing the end of the runway during a high speed rejected takeoff. This amendment also revises the previously issued telegraphic AD by correcting a typographical error in the listing of the part numbers for the FMC's. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective October 24, 1994, to all persons except those persons to whom it was made immediately effective by telegraphic AD T94&hyph;19&hyph;51, issued on September 14, 1994, which contained the requirements of this amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before December 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Information concerning this amendment may be obtained from or examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;160&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Thomas A.

That AD does not require that these procedures be followed if the runway is dry, if the field length is balanced, or if the ice protection is turned off. That action was prompted by a report that certain Honeywell FMC's provided erroneous V speed data when the anti-ice system was turned on during flex temperature takeoffs. The FAA determined that this phenomenon may occur on McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F series airplanes equipped with Honeywell FMC's having part numbers 4059050&hyph;906, &hyph;907, and &hyph;908. That condition, if not corrected, could result in the airplane failing to achieve sufficient climb gradient, which may result in the airplane failing to achieve obstacle clearance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report that the ``check/confirm V speed'' message may be inhibited when the flaps are extended to within three degrees of the takeoff flap setting that was entered into the FMC. Under normal operating conditions, the FMC calculates V speeds based on data the pilot enters into the FMC and data the FMC receives from the aircraft sensors, including total air temperature (TAT). Investigation revealed that on hot sunny days, the TAT probe may indicate an erroneously high ambient temperature that is up to 15 degrees Celsius higher than the actual ambient temperature. The FMC, however, was supposedly designed and certified to account for this error in the actual ambient temperature by continually recalculating the V speed data and indicating a ``check/confirm V speed'' message when the calculations indicate that the V speeds differ by more than two knots from the V speeds entered into the FMC by the pilot. However, if the flaps are set to the takeoff position prior to the TAT probe temperature reaching the ambient temperature, that message would be inhibited and the pilot would not be notified that the indicated V speed is incorrect. The FAA has determined that such erroneous indications may result in an FMC calculation of the takeoff decision speed (V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) that is up to six knots greater than the actual V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  speed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

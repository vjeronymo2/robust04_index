			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Appointments: ECGD to maintain service Britain's exporters can relax. The government has decided to appoint a department of trade and industry veteran - 51-year-old Brian Willott - rather than a hachetman from Her Majesty's Treasury as the next chief executive of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. Willott, currently head of financial services division at the DTI, takes over on January 13, replacing Malcolm Stephens who resigned in December 1991 to become chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce. Willott joined the Board of Trade in 1967, after doing research at Cambridge and the University of Maryland on low temperature physics. After a number of posts, he joined the Treasury for a brief spell before returning to the DTI. From 1981 to 1984 he was chief executive of the British Technology Group, and from 1984 to 1987 head of the DTI's information technology division. Most recently Willott has been involved in advising the government on EC investment services and the introduction of Taurus, which is designed to remove the paper from securities trading. In recent months the short-term insurance arm of ECGD - accounting for roughly 40 per cent of ECGD's workforce - has been sold to the Dutch, and Willott is conscious that he is joining an organisation where morale is low. 'In today's uncertain world, I know that project exporters will continue to look to us to provide the vital support they need to achieve export success,' says Willott. 'I shall do my very best to ensure that ECGD continues to provide an effective service to industry.' He says that previous posts, such as at BTG, have given him plenty of experience of high-risk jobs. Another Rutlish grammar schoolboy makes good. Michael Doerr is to take over as group managing director of Friends Provident, one of Britain's top three mutual life insurers. The 56-year-old Doerr, who went to the same school as prime minister John Major and qualified as a fellow of the institute of actuaries in 1954, will succeed the 60-year-old Fred Cotton, in charge for the past 11 years. Cotton, who will step down as an executive after the annual meeting on May 27, will remain on the board and will play a representative role in developing Friends Provident's Eureko partnership. Doerr takes the helm at a particularly difficult time in the history of the 159-year-old company. In terms of the introduction of new computer technology and investment performance, Friends Provident compares well with its peers. With over Pounds 8bn of funds under management and close to Pounds 1bn a year of premium income it is one of the fastest growing and most successful life insurers. However, it is having to sever its ties with Abbey National following the latter's takeover of Scottish Mutual, a smaller and less successful insurer. Doerr says that the loss of the Abbey business is 'not a catastrophe' and he believes that the the combination of new distribution channels plus his firm's European partnership will make good any business shortfall.</p>

The capital, Lusaka, already  branded the center for the international illegal drug trade, is  now being branded the center of another criminal racket. It  seems if you have an expensive car stolen in southern Africa, it  is quite likely to turn up in Lusaka, as Joe Mwinga reports in  this fax from Lusaka:    An international ring of car thieves is doing a roaring  business, swooping top cars for hard drugs, and into the bargain  causing the Zambian Government extreme embarrassment. Last  month, a Mercedes Benz car belonging to the Namibian Prime  Minister, Hage Geingob, surfaced here in Lusaka a few days after  it was stolen from Windhoek. Three weeks later, seven cars,  including a Toyota Land Cruiser belonging to the International  Labor Organization, were stolen from Mozambique. They were  later intercepted in Lusaka, and now yet another car belonging  to a leading politician in the sub-region has surfaced in  Lusaka. The ANC [African National Congress] president, Nelson  Mandela, recently had his family car, a Mercedes Benz, stolen  from South Africa. Investigators traced the car to Lusaka,  where its new owner, a senior bank official is insisting he  bought the car through the normal channels and has refused to  relinquish it. The ANC representative in Lusaka, Jaffat  Ndhlovu, told me this morning that the Mandela family is taking  legal action to get the car back.</p>

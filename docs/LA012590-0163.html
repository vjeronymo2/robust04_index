			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH WINS ROUND OVER NEW POLICE  CONTRACT  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge on Wednesday refused to stop Long Beach city officials  from imposing a new contract with the police union against the union's wishes,  propelling the matter into the appeals courts.  </P> <P> Mike Hannon, attorney for the Long Beach Police Officers Assn., said he would  immediately appeal Judge Dzintra Janavs' opinion. Deputy City Atty. Thomas M.  Reeves said the city would start enforcing provisions of the new contract right  away, but Hannon said he would request a court order blocking such action  pending appeal.  </P> <P> The Long Beach City Council declared an impasse in police negotiations last  November and voted to unilaterally adopt the city's last contract offer.  </P></p>

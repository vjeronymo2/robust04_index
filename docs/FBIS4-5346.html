			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Anti-U.S. Protests of South Korean </F> Students and People"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- It is only too natural  that the South Korean students and people rose in struggle under  anti-U.S. slogans, says a NODONG SINMUN analyst today,  commenting on various meetings, rallies and demonstrations which  have taken place almost every day these days in nearly all  places of South Korea against the U.S. imperialists' new war  provocation moves.    The news analyst goes on:    After unilaterally aborting the third round of talks with  the  DPRK on unreasonable pretexts, the U.S. imperialists openly  talked about stepping up military threat and pressure on the  DPRK and have massed their aggression forces in and around South  Korea. The racket of confrontation and war against the DPRK  kicked up by the Kim Yong-sam group of traitors by taking  advantage of it has now reached an extremely reckless phase. It  goes without saying that should their such reckless military  moves be overlooked, peace and security on the Korean peninsula  would be disturbed and our nation would suffer a holocaust of  nuclear war.    South Korean students and people could not tolerate it, so  they rose in vigorous anti-U.S. protests to remove the source of  their misfortunes.    Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique are ruthlessly  cracking down on the people's righteous patriotic struggle at  the point of the bayonet. This is an anti-national criminal act  that could be done only by such sycophant traitors as the Kim  Yong-sam group which is seeking to prolong its stay in power  under the patronage of outside forces, bartering away the  dignity and interest of the nation lock, stock and barrel.    Nothing can break the unshakable will of the South Korean  people to live in a peaceful and reunified country free from  foreign domination and interference.</p>

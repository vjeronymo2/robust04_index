			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Allowing CCDBG grantees to include foster care in their definition of protective services not only gives grantees the flexibility to work within existing child protective services systems, it is also consistent with the goals of the recently enacted Family Support and Preservation Act. This Act promotes integrated and comprehensive services for families already receiving supportive and/or interventive assistance from social services agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantees electing to include foster care in their definition of protective services will be required to state this in their Block Grant Plan. Those grantees choosing to exclude foster care from their definition of protective services must define eligibility for participation in CCDBG child care subsidies in terms of the foster parent working, in education or in training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Certificate Availability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 658E(c)(2)(A) of the CCDBG Act requires States to provide assurances that parents are given the option of (1) Enrolling their children with a provider who has a grant or contract to provide services, or (2) receiving a child care certificate with which to pay the provider of their choice. The Act also requires that children who are to be enrolled in contracted slots must be placed with the provider of their parents' choice whenever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CCDBG regulation elaborates on the choice between grant/contract child care and a child care certificate by requiring that a certificate must be offered when child care services under &sect;98.50 are made available to a parent. We do not propose any changes to this requirement which is stated both at &sect;98.30(a) and &sect;98.30(e). However, we do propose removing &sect;98.30(e) because it is redundant to a clearer and more expanded presentation of parental choice set forth in &sect;98.30(a) (1) and (2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also using the opportunity provided by this proposed rule to clarify the certificate requirement and to offer examples of grantee systems which have successfully met this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our restatement of the regulatory position that certificates must be available whenever services under &sect;98.50 are offered does not preclude grantees from entering into grants or contracts for child care services. Depending upon the child care needs of the eligible population in discrete geographic areas of service, grants and contracts may be necessary to provide stable child care for participating populations or specific communities. In essence, the provision requires a good faith effort by the grantee to balance the allocation of funds between grants/contracts and certificates to ensure that parents have optimum choice among quality child care options as stipulated in the legislation and reinforced in the existing regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conducting on-site program reviews over the past two years, we have found that grantees are operating certificate programs which offer parental choice. Some grantees are offering only certificates. Others are committing funds on a proportional basis between certificates and contracts based on the particular needs of individual areas or populations. Some grantees, however, have experienced that stable child care is more difficult to find in rural or inner-city areas, for infants, or for children with special needs and have therefore contracted with competent providers to specifically address these shortages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In planning the distribution of funds for grants/contracts and certificates, grantees should establish sufficient fiscal flexibility to ensure that parents who choose certificates are not placed on a waiting list while substantial numbers of contracted slots in the same area remain un-utilized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, most grantees are reporting that the need for subsidized low-income child care far exceeds the available funding. Thus, if certificate funds are fully reserved for children who are already enrolled, and no subsidized slots are available (either filled or not part of the grantee's program), it may be necessary to begin a waiting list for certificates. Similarly, because many grantees are allocating funds on a locality by locality basis, waiting lists may result in some parts of the State while services are still available in other areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We want to clarify that although certificates must be an option for parents whenever &sect;98.50 services are offered, it is not necessary to offer certificates whenever &sect;98.50 services are being used. For example, if all CCDBG funds available in a community are ``reserved'' for specific children in contracted and certificate-funded slots, the grantee is not actually offering services and need not offer additional certificates. Thus, a local program might not offer new child care services during some portion of the program year because all available funds have been assigned to specific children and are being used or ``reserved'' for those specific children. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Other Authorized Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Currently, CCDBG grantees may spend up to 10 percent of CCDBG funds authorized under &sect;98.50 (the 75 percent monies) for program administration and activities to improve the availability and quality of child care services. If expenditures for operating the certificate program and related consumer education equal or exceed 10 percent, grantees may petition for an additional five percent for other authorized activities, for a total of 15 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on information provided by grantees in their annual reports and during on-site program reviews, we now propose to allow grantees to use up to 15 percent of funds authorized under &sect;98.50 for ongoing activities related to program administration, quality and availability without further justification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: Try fino to wash down those tapas - Giles MacDonogh samples Andalusian cuisine THE TAPAS of Andalusia can be delightfully simple, much more so than those prepared in such more prestigious gastronomic regions of Spain as the Basque country or Catalonia. In the very fine Egana Oriza restaurant in Seville (San Fernando 41, tel. 422 72 54), I had caper pickled on their thick stems with thyme and garlic and the fattest green olives I had ever seen. The style across the road at the ravishing Alfonso XIII Hotel (San Fernando 2, tel. 422 28 50) was appropriately ornate, the star dishes being those fat, spicy little cocktail sausages called chistorras; monkfish marinated in lemon juice and deep fried in batter; and the nuttiest, most delectable of Jabugo hams or smoked loin. Down on the coast, in the slightly dowdy fishing port of Puerto de Santa Maria, there were razor fish and clams and shrimps cooked in batter. The strangest tapa available was tigre, a mollusc which looked like a scaled-down version of an old-fashioned custard cream cornet. Piles of these monsters lay in the cool cabinets of the bars, their heads lolling drowsily out of their shells until, sensing the presence of a hungry man, they retracted swiftly into the false security of their carapaces. A local speciality are the tiny red mullet, the size of whitebait, which are served in the bars; or fish from the sole family, just 2in long when fully grown, which are consumed whole - bones and all. As a special treat, my host took me to a bar the size of a broom cupboard - then watched with ill-concealed amusement as I ate an anonymous-looking tapa covered in bread crumbs. This was a criadilla, or bull's testicle: a great delicacy available only after the corrida. In Andalusia, the drink favoured for washing down tapas of this sort is a fino sherry or a glass of manzanilla. The fresh, tangy character of bone-dry sherry seems the perfect accompaniment and not just for the fresh sea and shell fish: it also matches Jabugo ham to perfection. I returned from Andalusia, however, with one question unanswered: what do you eat with the marvellous old solera sherries, amontillados and olorosos? So I sought the help of John Bertram, a well-known London chef, and Gonzalez Byass, a company based in Jerez near Sevilla, which is famed justly for the quality of its old soleras. It came as no surprise to anyone that the company's crisp Tio Pepe fino went well with the fishy tapas - bread-crumbed balls of lobster; oysters grilled swiftly under the lightest of gratins; red mullet cooked with garlic and tomatoes; whitebait; or a proper Iberico ham from near Salamanca made from the native breed of pig and allowed to munch freely on acorns. Where the fino worked less well was with creamier foods. The old soleras - the dry Amontillado del Buque with its huge nutty character; the Apostoles, an oloroso with a fine, honeyed sweetness overlaying an excellent bite; and the rich, sweet oloroso called Matusalem - were not destined to be drunk with fish. My suspicion was they would be at their best with Spanish cheeses. The dry Duque proved the most versatile here, especially with the ewe's milk, Manchego-style Guzman. The Duque was also good with the blue, Cabrales-style Picos cheese with its acid tang but, in general, the tasters prefered the fuller, sweeter style of the Apostoles with the blue cheese. It was also voted the best partner for the meaty, goat's milk Cabra del Tietar, and there were one or two people who found it went well with the Andalusian goat's milk Sierra de Zuheros with its hard, soapy flavour. The bigger old solera wines proved too flavoursome for the lighter, creamier cheeses. A young Manchego was far better with Tio Pepe (in Spain, Manchego is often served as a tapa with a glass of fino). Nor should it have surprised anyone that the slightly salty, creamy Iberico cheese, made from ewe's milk, should have married so well with the fino - salt and fino seem suited ideally for one another. Much more difficult was finding a partner for the super- sweet Matusalem. A series of desserts created by Bertram were not ideal. Someone swore by its effectiveness with Christmas pudding; but I felt it should be drunk on its own, perhaps with some dried figs or a few walnuts. Expect to pay between Pounds 6.99-7.99 for a bottle of Tio Pepe and between Pounds 19.99 and Pounds 25 for any of the old solera wines (while stocks last. Oddbins is selling both the Duque and Matusalem at the bargain price of Pounds 15.99). Stockists for the cheese include Harvey Nicholls (which also stocks Iberico ham), Harrods and Selfridges shops (all in London); Valvona and Crolla in Edinburgh; and the Fine Cheese Company in Bath.</p>

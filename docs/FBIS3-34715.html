			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Israeli names as received] </F>   [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 11 (AFP)--Operation Rainbow, the  Israeli Army's plan to withdraw on the Gaza Strip and the West  Bank town of Jericho, is ready following the Cairo security  agreement for Palestinian autonomy, officers say.    "As soon as the government gives the order, we will start  the  withdrawal," a military spokesman told AFP, but he refused to go  into detail.    "We are wound up and ready to go into action," one senior  officer told Friday's [11 February] YEDI'OT AHARANOT newspaper.    Military officials said planning is complete for the  operation which will see troops pulled out of Jericho and  redeployed in Gaza. Army bases will be dismantled and moved from  built-up areas on the strip where Israeli forces will remain to  protect the 4,000 Jewish settlers.    Chief of Staff General Ehud Baraq has already appointed the  appropriately named General Hagai Shalom, a logistics  specialist, to carry out Operation Rainbow.    The Army has asked the government for another 100 million  dollars on top of 83 million already allocated for the  withdrawal.    More than 50 million dollars is being spent to build a  60-kilometre (36-mile) fence around the Gaza Strip. A seven  kilometre stretch has already been completed.    The fence, the same as one put up along the border between  Israel and Lebanon, is intended to prevent infiltrations. The  system includes electronic gates and continuous patrols.    Southern region command will oversee the operation on the  Gaza Strip and the Central Region Command will take care of  Jericho.    As soon as the orders are received, Army bulldozers and  trucks will move to take down the razor fences, the watchtowers,  observation posts, water and fuel storage facilities and so on  which clutter the landscape of the occupied territories.    All the equipment removed will be stored in temporary camps  while new installations are built. Soldiers from combat units  will have to sleep in tents until new barracks are constructed.  Water pipes, drains and electrical systems will be destroyed.    Palestinians have watched with great pleasure the first  moves  with the Army quitting several posts in Gaza in recent weeks and  the departure of the hated occupier from the refugee camps is  expected to produce an outpouring of emotion.    According to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres Israel will  strive to pull troops out without further delay,    "We are not committed to the April 13 deadline," Peres said  referring to the target date for Israel to complete the  withdrawal under the September 13 agreement.    "However I think we will all make a real effort to reduce  the  delay because our people also wants to be convinced that the  agreement is workable."    The start of the pullout, scheduled for December 13 under  the  agreement, has been held up by disputes centered on the security  aspects of autonomy.    Israel and the PLO settled most of the differences in Cairo  on Wednesday night, although Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is  insisting all outstanding issues on autonomy, including  economic, be resolved before the withdrawal begins.    Rabin said he expected that to take at least another month  while senior Army officers said it would take only one month for  the withdrawal to be completed.</p>

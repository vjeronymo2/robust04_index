			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 1 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Ministry  said Tuesday [1 March] it considers the radical and effective  strike of NATO air force against Galeb combat aircraft in Bosnia  to be an important step in the direction of respecting the  decision of the U.N. Security Council on no-fly zone in Bosnia  and Herzegovina.    The statement, handed to CTK, says that after the recent  NATO  ultimatum which contributed to the removal of heavy weaponry  from Sarajevo and its surroundings, the alliance has again shown  a determination to create conditions necessary for political  talks on resolving the crisis.    The ministry holds the view that those forces who sent the  combat aircraft, thus trying to expand the warfare from ground  to air, are responsible for the use of military power in Bosnia  and Herzegovina, says the statement.    The ministry voiced the hope that the shooting down of the  Galeb aircraft will not provoke attempts to retaliate against  the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Froces] troops. Should this  development occur, a previous decision of the U.N. Security  Council on the protection of the UNPROFOR troops, including the  possible use of the air force, should be implemented, the  statement says.</p>

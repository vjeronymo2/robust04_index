			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Russian Deputy Foreign  Minister Aleksandr Panov said today that Russia would adopt "a  flexible stand" in the effort to solve the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula.    He suggested that the nuclear issue be resolved through  bilateral negotiations or within the framework of the UN  Security Council.    If both failed to work, then the possibility of an  international conference should be explored, he said.    He added that China, Japan and South Korea did not oppose  Russia's proposal for holding an international conference to  guarantee the security and non-nuclear status of the Korean  peninsula.    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) at present  favors holding talks with the United States to find a solution  to the nuclear issue.    Panov said that the DPRK nuclear issue should not be  considered as only a bilateral question as it affects the  international community, especially the neighboring nations of  the Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Istanbul, Mar. 30 (A.A.) -- Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said on Tuesday [29 March] that his fundamentalist Prosperity  Party (RP) won local elections in six mayoral races and 22  borough representative races.    "The wall put between the RP and the people will be removed  much more easier from now on," Erdogan said.    After his victory in the Istanbul mayoral race, the biggest  metropolitan center in Turkey with a population of 10 million,  Erdogan held a press conference.    He said that the 14,627 ballot boxes that have been counted  showed that his RP received 913,580 votes or 25.84 percent of  the total vote in Sunday's elections.    "The people will witness the practices of the RP and will  run  to a bright future with us," he said.    He also claimed that the "mentality of RP which has been a  minority so far, will be a majority in Turkey."    The RP's sweeping local elections victory and its new mayor  for Istanbul worried many over what the future would bring.    A statue of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern  secular Turkey, stands in historic Taksim Square.    But Erdogan declared Tuesday: "I will build a mosque in  Taksim."    During his election campaign, Erdogan promised to invite  Pierre Cardin to arrange a women's fashion show for  Islamic-style dressing. He also said he would close Istanbul's  brothels.    The anti-Western and anti-Israeli RP, which also won many  borough representative races in Istanbul, has caused concern  among Western-educated Turks. It also has women worrying  whether they would be forced to wear the chador (head-to-toe  black Islamic garb).    Beyoglu, Istanbul's picturesque and cosmopolitan district,  is  threatened with the closure of its bars, amusement places and  brothels.    And there may be no more new year's celebrations at Beyoglu.  "That's a Christian tradition," says Beyoglu borough  representative-elect Nusret Bayraktar, "we cannot allow a  prophet's birthday to be celebrated with drinking, gambling and  prostitution."    Intellectual Turks, upper middle class people, minorities  and  foreigners who form the mosaic of this city and meet in the  melting pot of Beyoglu say a new, unwelcome era has dawned on  Istanbul.    Although the new fundamentalist mayor as well as his  district  colleagues promised a better Istanbul in their post-election  statements, the intelligentsia is not convinced.    The resurgence of women in Islamic dress with heads covered  and religious bearded men wearing turbans worries followers of  Kemal Ataturk, who adopted the Western dress code and declared  Turkey a secular republic.</p>

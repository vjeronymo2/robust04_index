			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Same Party Behind the Two Crimes at the </F> Ibrahimi Mosque and the Lebanese Church"]    [Excerpt] It seems that there is a hostile scheme to drown  the Arab cordon [al-tawq] states in blood.    There is no doubt that Israel and its agents are behind this  odious scheme.    Israel has started to play the tune of sectarianism to sow  seditions.    Israel carried out the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron  and  also perpetrated another reprehensible crime at the Lebanese  Sayyidat al-Najat Church.    The timing of these two odious crimes is not a coincidence,  but is the result of a studied and premeditated plan. In view  of these crimes which have greatly pained the Jordanian leaders  and people, Jordan, under his Majesty King Husayn, took the  initiative and acted on all Arab, regional, and international  levels to acquaint the entire international community of the  hideousness of this type of terrorism, which undoubtedly is  Israeli terrorism. [passage omitted]    His majesty the king was the first to realize the dimensions  of this treacherous scheme that is hostile to the cordon states  and to the peace process which is based on the international  legitimacy resolutions. His majesty linked the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre and the Lebanese Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre, in  that there is one party which planned for these two odious  crimes.    His majesty also held consultations with the Lebanese and  Syrian presidents to contain this odious scheme which seeks to  drown the region in blood and sow sedition so as to foil it  before it becomes uncontrollable.

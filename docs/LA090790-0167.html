			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> PART OF LA HABRA BLACKED OUT  </P> <P> A construction crew working at the La Habra Fashion Square damaged a power line  this morning, causing a 45-minute blackout that affected a local hospital and  an unknown number of stores and homes in a half-mile-square area of the city.  </P> <P> Emergency generators at the Friendly Hills Medical Center on Lambert Road were  automatically activated after the 9:15 a.m. power failure.  </P> <P> No patients were in danger, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> La Habra police spokeswoman Cindy Knapp said the blackout also knocked out  traffic signals at four major intersections, and police directed traffic until  power returned about 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The power failure was limited to an area bounded by Beach Boulevard on the  west, Lambert Road on the north, Idaho Street on the east and Imperial Highway  on the south, Knapp said.  </P> <P> Police think a heavy-equipment operator at the Fashion Square mall, which is  being renovated, inadvertently cut a power line, Knapp said.  </P> <P> Edison spokesman Bob Goodlow could not confirm the cause of the outage, saying  only that investigators for the utility company were at the scene gathering  information.  </P> <P> An operator at the local Bullocks, the only store still operating at the  shopping center, said that the store did not lose power and was opened without  any delays.  </P></p>

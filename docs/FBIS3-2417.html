			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 9 (AFP)--Hong Kong's oldest  trading firm, Jardine Matheson Ltd., said Wednesday it had not  approached Hong Kong's stock exchange over a planned request for  exemption under the territory's takeover code.    Jardines said in a statement that "no approach has been made  to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong", regarding an exemption from  the British colony's takeover code.    But it said that following the adoption of a new takeover  code in Bermuda last December, it had informed shareholders it  would continue its discussions with the Securities and Futures  Commission (SFC) over the relationship between Hong Kong's and  Bermuda's takeover code.    Earlier, Jardines company secretary Neil McNamara said talks  with SFC for an exemption from the British colony's takeover  code were still under way, but would neither confirm nor deny  whether a delisting of any or all of the six Jardines-controlled  companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange might result if the  exemption fails to come through.    The takeover-code issue stems from Jardines' announcement in  1984 that it would register in Bermuda, another British colony,  before Hong Kong is returned to China in 1997. It now wants to  be subject exclusively to Bermuda's takeover code, which comes  into effect in July this year, thus avoiding the legal  uncertainties of a post-1997 Hong Kong. In particular, the  Bermuda code would allow Jardines to resist a hostile takeover  attempt in the Bermuda courts and, in the case of a final  appeal, through the Privy Council in London.    However, legislator Chim Pui-chung, financial services  representative in the Legislative Council, said Jardines should  not be exempted from Hong Kong's takeover code. He said that  "under Hong Kong common law and takeover code, all companies, no  matter how big or small, must obey the rules of the Securities  and Futures Commission and Stock Exchange of Hong Kong."    Founded in 1832, Jardines is Hong Kong's most pervasive  conglomerate, involved in almost every sector from real estate  and stockbroking to supermarkets and parking lots.</p>

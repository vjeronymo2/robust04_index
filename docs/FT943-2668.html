			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: A prima donna gets her show on the road - As the Romanian opera plans its trip to Britain, Martin Hoyle visits the company in Bucharest Men bow to her, female employees back nervously away, voices drop to an awe-struck whisper as Madame sweeps majestically into the room. For just over a year now the director of the Romanian National Opera in Bucharest has been Eugenia Moldoveanu. Much as Barbara Jefford epitomised the diva in Fellini's And the Ship Sails On, so this beautiful and imperious ex-soprano (she sang at Covent Garden under Colin Davis) has 'prima donna' emblazoned on her as if by Central Casting. She has a hard task. It is not pre-empting my musical colleagues to note that, as in many ex-eastern bloc countries, the current operatic production style is less Cecil B. de Mille than DW Griffiths, despite such nods to chic as a faintly ridiculous ballet (Nabucco) and hints of lesbianism (Samson et Dalila, where Delilah's enjoyment of her handmaidens' caresses explains much of her attitude towards Samson). Nabucco and Samson will be touring Britain from this month with Madama Butterfly. The Verdi was seen for a single performance in an outdoor performance at Rochester Castle last year, when robust attack garnered an unexpected crop of favourable reviews. The English promoter has been disconcerted by new touches in the design and choreography. Long and bitter arguments have ensued on the artistic front with the state-subsidised agency Artexim. This organisation illustrates the difficulties of a new mixed economy. Rumour has it that some of the old regime's placemen have made a comeback, even in the corridors of the ministry of culture. Pressures of another sort are exerted by the private sponsors now vital to state enterprise; for Romania too has its multi-millionaires, white-suited, open-necked, jewelled crucifixes on bare chests, boasting Italian connections and not to be questioned too closely on the source of their new wealth. Because private sponsorship is a recent phenomenon, patrons are not quite sure of their function. The news that the tour of a 200-strong tour, from Bristol to Edinburgh, entails a certain risk and might not accrue a jackpot profit, has taken some time to sink in. Allied to continual pressure from officialdom, the resultant hiccups in negotiation have resulted in brinkmanship up to the moment the trucks began to load the scenery for their ten-day journey across Europe. But at last the company is trundling towards an unsuspecting Bristol where the tour opens. Financially things are patched up, politically there are a few bruises. Musically the company shows the symptoms of the new freedom. The outstanding Butterfly, between engagements in Vienna and Paris, has stipulated no more than a handful of appearances. The company fields three Cio-Cio-Sans. I heard the third in Bucharest: movingly acted, intensely projected, even turning strained higher and lower registers to advantage with dramatic use of words, she enjoyed the most integrated production of the three works on offer. In Butterfly the dead hand of tradition has been broken and a sacrosanct 40-year-old production has been conceded 'refreshment' by a young director and designer, possibly because the octogenarian director is in no position to object - unlike the begetter of the Nabucco and Samson stagings, officially replaced but still a potent power in the wings. The young Stefan Neagrau, only recently elevated to artistic directorship, has a background in film and ambitious ideas that align him with such internationally known Romanian directors as Serban and Pintile. His previous productions, including an Elisir d'amore with Dulcamara dispensing prohibition-era whisky and Nemorino signing on not for the army but the secret police, marks him as a member of the 'producer's opera' era. Of course, there are some who prefer the old style, in art as in politics. The Romanian National Opera is at the crossroads. It must fight free of both Loadsamoney philistinism and bureaucratic politicking. But then the same might be said of Romania. The Romanian National Opera opens in Bristol on Sept 20, visiting Oxford, Sunderland, Edinburgh and Canterbury. A concert performance of Nabucco will be given at the Albert Hall on Oct 17.</p>

Radio 3 starts the evening with a live relay from London's Festival Hall of a concert by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Andrew Davies. He conducts Elgar's Introduction and Allegro, Vaughan Williams' Fantasia On Christmas Carols, and Holst's Planets Suite (7.30). That is followed by The Rebirth Of Nationalism presented by Robert Wistrich: 'The half baked theories of chauvinist intellectuals have percolated to the lowest depths of Russian society where they have been eagerly adopted by neo-Nazi groups ..' (9.30). At the same moment Radio 5 begins a series called Teen Lurve which is precisely the sort of material being mourned now that this network has been selected to commit hara kiri in favour of a 24-hour news channel. Where else on radio would you find a series of teen-romance dramas? In today's opener Julie's retro punk boy friend, who plays guitar in a thrash band, fails to gain approval from her parents.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Surprise visit to Iraq by UN weapons team THE United Nations yesterday announced a surprise weapons inspection visit to Iraq, disclosing that experts would fly in at dawn today, Reuter reports from Bahrain. 'We have a certain operation ahead of us,' Mr Nikita Smidovitch, the team leader, said last night, nine hours before a UN aircraft was due to leave for Baghdad. But he would not elaborate on the objectives of the visit. Another team of UN inspectors already in Baghdad extended its stay beyond the planned departure date yesterday, after saying it had gathered fresh information on Iraq's ballistic missile programme. UN officials in Bahrain said that team was likely to stay at least until tomorrow. Mr Smidovitch insisted there was no link between the two visits.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / China steps up reform of state sector China plans to earmark some 10,000 state-owned enterprises for an appraisal of their stocks and assets, including real estate, as part of a new drive to reform the ailing state sector. Mr Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic and Reform Commission, speaking at an international business seminar in Beijing yesterday, unveiled proposals to speed a process of corporatisation, a Chinese half-way house between rigid state control and privatisation. Mr Wang's remarks were the most detailed exposition of China's plans to rationalise its debt-burdened state sector, and indicate that the authorities may have advanced further than expected with their plans for enterprise reform. The Chinese official also disclosed that 'watchdog' supervisory boards will be imposed on some 1,000 state enterprises as part of attempts to improve their economic performance. Some 100 state-owned enterprises would become shareholding companies under a pilot programme to facilitate their removal from stifling state management control. The states' share in these enterprises would be assessed according to a valuation of their assets. Mr Wang identified difficulties in establishing the value of assets and a redefinition of the relationship between the state as a substantial shareholder and the managers of enterprises as one of the largest challenges to far-reaching reforms of the state sector. He discounted the possibility of any rush to privatisation, saying the 'state economy could not be replaced by other sectors of the economy' without undermining the system. 'Our enterprise reform will, on the premise of adhering to public ownership, explore the approach of accelerating the development of enterprises and effectively realise the form of public ownership,' he said. Mr Wang noted that China's 11,000 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises accounted for 0.16 per cent of total industrial enterprises in the country, yet their output value and tax were respectively 36.67 per cent and 51.6 per cent of the total. He did not provide details of the 10,000 state enterprises chosen for an appraisal of their assets. Estimates of numbers of large, medium-size and smaller enterprises range between 150,000 and 200,000. China's State Statistical Bureau reported that at the end of March nearly 50 per cent of China's state enterprises were in the red, compared with 32 per cent a year earlier. Losses to March amounted to Yuan15.6bn (Pounds 1.2bn), up 80 per cent on the same period last year.</p>

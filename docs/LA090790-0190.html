			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TALKS TO BRING 'MISS SAIGON' TO N.Y. 'CORDIAL'  </P> <P> Talks between British producer Cameron Mackintosh and officials of Actors  Equity union over the casting of the Broadway production of "Miss Saigon" have  been "cordial and constructive," it was reported today.  </P> <P> Mackintosh met Thursday with Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Equity, and  scheduled another meeting Monday.  </P> <P> He arrived earlier this week from London at the invitation of Eisenberg to  clear the way for the opening of the $10-million hit musical at the Broadway  Theater next April.  </P> <P> Mackintosh canceled the opening in a dispute with the union over casting  British actor Jonathan Pryce in the Eurasian starring role that Pryce  originated in London.  </P> <P> Early last month, Equity barred Pryce from playing on Broadway as the result of  pressure from members of Asian background who oppose trans-racial casting  because it takes roles away from Asians.  </P> <P> Mackintosh said he could not allow abridgement of his artistic freedom to cast  as he pleases.  </P> <P> Equity's governing council reversed its decision on Pryce on Aug. 23 and asked  Mackintosh to come to New York to discuss reinstatement of "Miss Saigon," which  already had broken the Broadway record for advance ticket sales by taking in  $25 million at the box office.  </P></p>

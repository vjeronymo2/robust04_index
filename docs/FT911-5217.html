			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Japan halts Dollars 500m loan to Poland: Tokyo action displays disapproval of US debt forgiveness policy JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance is blocking approval of a Dollars 500m loan promised to Poland, underlining its disapproval with a US-sponsored plan to forgive at least half of Poland's debts The money was pledged by Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, on a visit to eastern Europe last year. But the Ministry of Finance is blocking approval following an argument with the US Treasury over a plan to cancel at least 50 per cent of government loans extended to Poland, and to make similar concessions to Egypt. A deal was struck last month at the Paris Club of creditor governments in effect to write off at least half of Poland's debts. Japan - owed Dollars 1.4bn by Poland - agreed extremely reluctantly. The Japanese finance minister, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, underlined the Japanese position to an international audience last week. If Japanese government loans were forgiven, 'then it will become extremely difficult for Japan to provide new loans to that country,' he said. Mr Hashimoto met the US Treasury Secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady, on Sunday in London for a meeting that lasted longer than expected. Mr Hashimoto described the meeting as a 'friendly argument', although he did not make it clear what was the cause of the dispute. The row highlights Japan's growing assertiveness in international financial affairs. As the world's largest government aid donor, it feels the size of its contribution earns it the right to influence policymaking. Finance Ministry officials say that allowing one debtor to write off debts will encourage others to do the same. Moreover, Japanese officials argue that the US too used to insist on making debtors pay. It is Washington which has changed its tune for political reasons, say Japanese officials. Japan fears other countries will be favoured for similar non-financial reasons, including Egypt. In the meantime, far poorer countries in Africa and Latin America are not being considered for special treatment. The argument comes at a time when Japan also wants to inject more political content into its aid policy. Last week, the Japanese government approved a new overseas development aid policy under which Japan will check on a country's defence spending and arms exports before extending support. States with large military establishments or extensive records as arms exporters could find their aid curtailed. The policy may not be rigorously applied - Japan has already indicated that aid to China, a big arms exporter with a big army, will not be affected. But Japanese intent to secure greater influence in aid policy is unmistakeable. In the case of Poland, the Finance Ministry official conceded that the prime minister had made a promise of new loans to Poland. But he said: 'The situation changed after the Paris Club. I can't say now when the loan will be made or if it will be made at all.' Japanese pressure resulted in the inclusion of an option which allowed creditors to reduce significantly Poland's loan payments, without formally writing down the principal owed.</p>

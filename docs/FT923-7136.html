			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nordbanken to axe 1,400 staff in shake-up NORDBANKEN, Sweden's ailing state-owned bank, yesterday announced a group re-organisation plan which included a cut in staff by 1,400 people over the next 18 months. Further details of the bank's rationalisation plans will be revealed within a week. The bank's short-term aim was to cut its costs drastically, introduce substantial savings and improve its customer services with the eventual objective of being privatised, according to Mr Hans Dalborg, the bank's chief executive. In May, the Swedish government was forced to rescue Nordbanken with a SKr20bn (Dollars 3.76bn) financial package of guarantees and loans and it will become the sole owner of the bank at the end of this month. In the first four months of the year the bank suffered a SKr1.97bn operating loss due to bad debts and non-performing loan provisions, its financial position remains precarious. Nordbanken said it planned to widen share ownership in Carnegie, the group's investment and stockbroking arm as part of an aim to focus the bank more on its activities inside Sweden.</p>

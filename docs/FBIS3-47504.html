			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the  General Federation of National Peasants Associations of South  Korea (Chonnong) at a recent press conference denounced traitor  Kim Yong- sam's policy of killing farmers, according to a report  of a South Korean newspaper.    He said Kim Yong-sam's promise in his election "commitments"  to adopt a policy for the farmers was a lie to fool them.    Noting that Kim Yong-sam, disclosing his true color, has  taken today the road of totally sacrificing agriculture and  farmers with the measure of rice market opening, he declared  that Chonnong would resolutely turn out in the struggle to  defend "our rice, our agriculture".</p>

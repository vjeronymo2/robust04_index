			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Tax changes 'hit middle incomes' Labour found new ammunition yesterday in its battle against the government's taxation policy after an independent think-tank claimed that the tax rises introduced in the last two Budgets would be mainly at the expense of people on middle incomes. In a report published yesterday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the tax rises announced last year by Mr Kenneth Clarke and his predecessor as chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, would largely reverse the overall reduction of taxation in the late 1980s. Direct taxes on incomes were reduced in the 1980s while indirect taxes, levied on consumption, will now account for much of the revenue rise. Those who gained from the cuts in the 1980s will not be those who lose from the increases. The IFS said people on middling incomes would be particularly hit by the last two Budgets because of changes to mortgage interest relief, married couples' allowances and value added tax on fuel. It claimed that the poorest 10 per cent of the population would have lost an average of Pounds 3 per week from tax changes in the decade to 1995, while the richest 10 per cent would have gained more than Pounds 30 a week. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, claimed the figures showed how the Conservatives had turned the tax system into 'the most powerful weapon for reinforcing inequality and creating record unfairness in British society' and that the government had created 'the most unfair tax system since the 1930s'. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, countered that Tory taxation policy had boosted wealth creation, improving living standards and increasing the amount of tax paid by high earners. 'The figures show that a man on average earnings with two children has seen his real take-home pay grow by over Pounds 80 a week since 1979,' Mr Dorrell told BBC radio. The report showed that households' disposable incomes will have risen by an average of Pounds 4 per week since 1985, but that these gains are distributed unevenly.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential Council Chairman brother Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih received at his office yesterday  evening brothers Safwat al-Sharif, Egyptian minister of  information and envoy of President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, and  Rashid 'Abdallah al-Nu'aymi, minister of foreign affairs in the  United Arab Emirates [UAE] and envoy of His Highness Shaykh  Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan.    The two envoys relayed to the brother president messages  from  his brothers His Excellency President Muhammad Husni Mubarak and  His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan on the two  countries' joint efforts and endeavors to contain the crisis.    The messages affirmed that both Egypt and the UAE are  committed to promoting and safeguarding Yemeni unity, given that  it is a pan- Arab gain that must be protected in the interest of  pan-Arab objectives and enhanced regional security and  stability. The messages also underscored the need to resort to  dialogue to resolve all differences in order to safeguard Yemeni  unity and protect Yemen from mischief, God forbid.    The two messages also reiterated that Egypt and the UAE are  eager to make every possible effort to approximate views, close  Yemeni ranks, and pool resources to safeguard unity through the  implementation of the accord document. They also indicated that  all Arabs support Yemeni unity, and that they will not accept  anything that could undermine this unity. They added that any  party that believes otherwise is mistaken.    The two messages underlined the importance of halting media  campaigns, and any step that could lead to infighting or  violence. They also stressed the need to promote trust in order  to create the propitious climate for dialogue in order to foster  unity and safeguard stability in Yemen.    For his part, the brother Presidential Council chairman  highly appreciated the good offices made by the Egyptian and UAE  brothers, headed by brothers President Muhammad Husni Mubarak  and His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan. He  commended the noble pan-Arab positions they have taken to  support their Yemeni brothers and foster Yemeni unity, which is  not a gain for only Yemen, but for the entire Arab nation. He  affirmed that Yemeni unity is the destiny and fate of the Yemeni  people. He added: We will never abandon this unity, regardless  of the costs. Any path other than unity will cause a  catastrophe in Yemen. Such a catastrophe is bound to affect the  region and the Arab nation. He affirmed his renunciation of  war, and his adherence to dialogue as the best means of  addressing the situation and meeting the challenges posed by the  political crisis and its regrettable repercussions.    The brother Presidential Council chairman asked the two  envoys to relay his greetings to his brothers President Muhammad  Husni Mubarak and His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al  Nuhayyan, and to also communicate to them his wishes of  continued progress and prosperity for the Egyptian and UAE  peoples.</p>

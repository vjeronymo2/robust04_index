			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / EU aims to slam its open doors THE European Union's much-vaunted policy of greater openness in its decision-making, proclaimed by the last four heads of government meetings, is in danger of taking a big step backwards before the next summit in Brussels on December 10. The Union's stated policy is to give the public right of access to all EU information, except where national security, monetary stability, commercial confidentiality, privacy, or relations with non-member countries could be endangered. The policy was strengthened in the wake of Danish voters' initial rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June 1992. However, ambassadors of the Twelve, in their latest attempt to draw up a code of conduct, have now inserted additional grounds for exemption, entitling all EU institutions to 'refuse access in order to protect the interests of the institution and safeguard the secrecy of their deliberations'. This discretionary catch-all is contained in a confidential compromise proposal - or so-called 'non-paper' - from the current Belgian presidency of the EU. It is intended to close the gap between member states like the Netherlands and Denmark, which want freedom of information norms similar to their own or US or Scandinavian rules, and more secretive countries like Britain, Portugal and Belgium itself. 'That is a step back, closing off things that are now relatively open,' said a diplomat from the Union's dwindling open government camp. He predicted that the code of conduct would lead to a small number of exemplary sackings of officials, to tighten up on the frequent leaks which are how a good portion of EU policy-making comes into the public domain. Foreign ministers of the Twelve are expected to decide on the issue early next month, before the Brussels summit. Although television cameras have this year been allowed in to record some set-piece EU ministerial proceedings, the openness question, identified repeatedly by the Twelve as one of the prime causes of public disenchantment with Europe, will almost certainly be settled behind closed doors.</p>

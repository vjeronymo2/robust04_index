			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third relevant statutory provision is section 211(k)(2)(B). There Congress tied the testing tolerance requirement to the level of the standard itself. This provision establishes a minimum oxygen content requirement for the reformulated gasoline of ``2.0 percent by weight (subject to a testing tolerance established by the Administrator)''. Unlike section 211(k)(4)(C), which addresses technical issues regarding measurement of air pollutants, this provision addresses the level of the standard itself and compliance with the oxygen content requirement. EPA interprets this as requiring establishment of a reasonable testing tolerance for the oxygen content requirement. As in the winter time oxygenated gasoline program, EPA is establishing this tolerance as 0.30 wt.% oxygen. Unlike section 211(k)(4)(C), there is no explicit requirement that this tolerance be incorporated into the regulations, and given the nature of an enforcement testing tolerance EPA is not adopting it as a rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The discretionary nature of enforcement test tolerances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, enforcement test tolerances are not required by the Act except for oxygenate testing pursuant to section 211(k)(2)(B), and even there, Congress left to EPA's discretion at what level such tolerance should be set as well as any criteria EPA would use. EPA has carefully considered the many comments regarding test tolerances. Any test tolerance would involve establishing a policy that the Agency would forego an enforcement action unless, in testing an enforcement sample, EPA found that a standard was exceeded by a set amount. Other appropriate conditions could also be required, such as evidence that the regulated party conducted appropriate sampling and testing. Establishing an enforcement tolerance based on testing or any other factor is a matter solely within the Agency's enforcement discretion, and is not addressed by section 211(k), except for purposes of the oxygen content requirements of section 211(k)(2)(B). As described below, EPA has decided to announce its current position on enforcement test tolerances with respect to several of the emission and content standards specified for reformulated gasoline subject to the simple model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is aware that as a result of the gasoline volatility regulations at 40 CFR 80.27&hyph;28, many pipelines only accept gasoline which tests below the RVP standard minus a margin of safety set by the pipelines. In some cases, the margin of safety set by the pipelines is equal to the reproducibility of the RVP test method. Many commenters expressed concern that a similar pipeline policy also would apply to the reformulated gasoline maximum/minimum parameters. Likewise, EPA is concerned about downstream parties who have limited control over the quality of the product received. For example, gasoline in the custody of a pipeline or terminal may be the product of several commingled refinery shipments. In light of these concerns, EPA intends to withhold prosecution of downstream parties such as pipelines and terminals, where proper sampling and testing by the downstream party shows that the product exceeds standard but tests within the tolerance set by EPA, and where there is no reason to believe that the party caused the gasoline to exceed the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Enforcement Test Tolerance Values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Almost every commenter suggested that EPA use reproducibility for enforcement tolerances. Commenters suggested that because the comparison of test results from different laboratories is inevitable, it is necessary to incorporate an appropriate measure of the variability between laboratories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has decided in its discretion to adopt enforcement test tolerances for certain requirements in addition to oxygen content. As discussed above, the Clean Air Act does not require enforcement testing tolerances for the six reformulated gasoline parameters other than oxygen (i.e., RVP, distillations, benzene, aromatics, sulfur, and olefins). In addition, only three fuel parameters (RVP, oxygen, and benzene) have maximum and/or minimum standards under the simple model. Therefore, these simple model parameters are the only ones likely to involve EPA testing for enforcement purposes. Although not required to do so, EPA has decided to set forth in the preamble of this Rule testing tolerances for these parameters, in order to provide regulated entities with information of interest to them regarding EPA's enforcement program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

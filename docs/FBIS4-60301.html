			<p>BFN     [Text] The Higher Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping  has issued the following statement.    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Praise  be to God who says: There is the type of man whose speech about  this world's life may dazzle thee, and he calls God to witness  about what is in his heart, yet is he the most contentious of  enemies. When he turns his back, his aim everywhere is to  spread mischief through the earth and destroy crops and cattle.  But God loveth not mischief. When it is said to him, 'Fear  God,' he is led by arrogance to more crime. Enough for him is  Hell, an evil bed indeed to lie on. [Koranic verse]    God's peace and blessing be upon the seal of prophets and  messengers, our Lord Muhammad, and on his family and companions.    Esteemed Yemeni people all over unified Yemen: The sons of  Yemen are now celebrating the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth  anniversary of the establishment of the unity state and the  proclamation of the Yemeni Republic on 22 May 1990. On that  day, the Yemenis realized their dream and great objective for  which they had offered huge sacrifices until God ordained its  realization by the merger of the two parts of Yemen and  reuniting the one Yemeni family to start building a unified  homeland, having removed all forms of oppression, despotism,  chaos, and displacement and freed the homeland from the  captivity of the atheist, destructive communist ideas. Those  ideas had been imposed by evil elements on a precious and dear  part of our beloved Yemeni land for quarter of a century, during  which our people suffered humiliation and disgrace.    Then the dawn of unity broke, heralding an end to a dark  night. Thus, the Yemenis enjoyed the dividends of unity under a  political regime that is based on the principles of shura,  democracy, and political pluralism.    While the Yemeni people were celebrating the blessed 'Id  al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of the unity, the elements of  apostasy and secession insisted on invoking the hateful past and  setting the clock back to the time of division and fragmentation  of the homeland through al-Bid's secessionist announcement.    This announcement has clearly revealed the truth about 'Ali  Salim al-Bid and his clique and exposed their secessionist bent  and their outright hostility to the people's unity, stability,  and progress.    The al-Bid's secessionist announcement has proven beyond any  shadow of a doubt the truthfulness of the pronouncements of the  state's legitimate institutions and bodies to everybody at home  and abroad that the crisis has been, all along, a confrontation  between constitutional, popular, and unionist legitimacy and a  rebellious, secessionist clique. Consequently, this places all  the segments of society--parties, organizations, and masses,  including the unionists in the Socialist Party--before their  true responsibilities toward this heretic announcement and to  stand firmly behind the national, unionist ranks, without any  hesitation, leniency, procrastination, or excuses.    Having examined this traitorous announcement with a high  sense of national responsibility; and out of its concern about  the higher interests of the sons of unified Yemen, the Higher  Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping condemns and rejects this  traitorous announcement that has no legitimacy whatsoever and no  constitutional or legal foundation. This announcement is  totally null and is deemed high treason and a violation of the  Constitution and an infringement on the country's sovereignty,  stability, unity, and the higher interest of the Yemeni people.  In addition, the announcement was made by someone who does not  have the right to issue such an announcement and who has no  legitimacy. He is also on the run and his whereabouts is  unknown because he is being pursued by the legitimate  authorities.    Based on this, confronting this announcement is a legitimate  national duty and a religious duty to all the sons of the people  and the legitimate institutions. These institutions are  responsible for discharging their duties. They bear  responsibility for protecting the territory of the Yemeni  Republic and safeguarding its unity. These institutions are  carrying out these important duties, along with the sons of the  people. It is the cause of the entire homeland and all the  people.    The Higher Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping extends its  thanks and appreciation for all the brotherly and friendly  countries that support Yemeni unity, since this unity is a major  factor of stability in this vital region in which most countries  have major interests, such as resources and waterways.    We are certain that these countries will not pay attention  to  the secessionist announcement of al-Bid and his gang, since  these countries must realize that this act is hostile to the  Yemeni people and that it is a serious precedent that will  extend to most fraternal and other countries.    We wonder: What hope will remain for our Arab nation to  achieve unity when it sees a unified people being fragmented?    We also denounce some media characterization of what is  happening in Yemen as something between north and south, when it  is, in reality, between the authority of a state that is member  of all Arab and world organizations and an abominable clique  that thinks its selfish interests require secession.    We think the defense of Yemeni unity is an Arab and Islamic  responsibility first and then a Yemeni responsibility. We are  confident, therefore, that all fraternal and friendly nations  will side with the one, unified Yemeni people and their will and  stability and elected constitutional institutions.    We appeal to our unyielding people to side with the  legitimate authority and its Armed Forces and to be one rank in  this situation and remain vigilant until victory is complete,  God willing, by destroying the secessionist clique. On that  day, shall the believers rejoice, with the help of God. He  gives victory to whom He will, and He is exalted in might, most  merciful. It is the promise of God. Never does God fail from  His promise, but most men know not. [Koranic verse]    Issued by the Higher Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping  on  12 Dhu al-Hijjah, 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 23 May 1994</p>

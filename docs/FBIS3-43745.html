			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 14 SAPA -- The African National  Congress' Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]  released Friday calls for widespread reform of the financial  sector including prescriptive legislation on lending and  investment. In addition, the document urges the creation of  innovative financial instruments and mechanisms, like a  reconstruction levy, to fund the still to be determined cost of  the RDP.    "If excessive risk aversion in the major financial  institutions prevents them from taking up socially desireable  investments, the democratic government should consider some form  of legislative compulsion such as prescribed assets," the  document says. It notes the government cannot fund the RDP  without support from the private sector and states therefore  that regulations should be modified to compel financial  institutions to fund basic needs such as housing, education, and  health-care.    Legislation would be introduced to transform the boards of  mutual fund companies "to make them more socially responsible".    A new government must impose non-discriminatory lending  criteria, especially related to collateral, and require the  banks to lend a rising share of their assets to small,  black-owned enterprises.    With regard to specific measures to fund the RDP, a new  government would set up a reconstruction fund and include some  form of a dedicated reconstruction bond. "In addition, it  should draw on specific reconstruction levies. The design of  reconstruction levies will depend on the aims of the RDP as a  whole, especially in terms of promoting development and growth,  but could also include levies on capital transfers, land and  luxury goods."    A housing bank is mooted by the document as well as a  government-backed guarantee fund to protect private sector  investors.    Many of the proposals are expected to be financed through  the  capital markets and would not necessitate a massive increase in  government revenue. The RDP envisages restructuring and  rationalising current government expenditure to meet the most of  the costs of the RDP so as to avoid undue inflation and balance  of payments difficulties.    "Given the fiscal malaise left by apartheid, careful  programmes must be developed around financing increased capital  expenditure, increasing the efficiency of consumption  expenditure and improving the revenue recovery capacities of the  government."    The RDP documents states the current budget deficit of six  per cent of gross domestic product would not be exceeded and  neither should the overall tax burden be increased.    Foreign funding in support of the RDP would only be used for  those elements of the programme which would increase the  country's capacity for earning foreign exchange.</p>

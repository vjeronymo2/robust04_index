			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Fears over sterling continue to trouble gilts UK GOVERNMENT bonds ended up to a half point lower on continuing worries about sterling and a poor response to an auction of long-dated gilts. Prices fell sharply in the morning when the auction results were announced, and dropped again when Bank of England intervention in the currency markets failed to give a sustained lift to sterling. There was a slight rally in afternoon trading in line with firmer European markets, but longer-term issues closed well below their opening levels. The Pounds 2.5bn auction of 8 3/4 per cent gilts due 2017 was covered 1.24 times with an average price of 96 7/8 , to give a yield of 9.07 per cent. The cover compared with 1.82 times when the stock was first auctioned in April. Dealers said the disappointing response was not surprising given market conditions. Only domestic investors would hold the stock because of its long maturity, they said. Futures market volumes were active with more than 90,000 contracts traded. The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 95.24 to 95.01 in late trading. In the cash market, the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 fell 1/2 to 97 13/16 to yield 9.26 per cent while the shorter dated 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 1997 lost  1/8 to 95 31/32 . Speculation of another French opinion poll predicting a rising 'No' vote for Maastricht also undermined the market. 'It will remain volatile until the September 20 (French) referendum but we may have found some support at these levels,' said Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg. IN SPITE of further signs of growing anti-Maastricht sentiment, French government bond prices rose 40 basis points. News of an unexpectedly high trade surplus in July prompted an early rally in bond prices, and some covering of short positions. Dealers said that the market had been oversold on Tuesday, as fears of a 'No' vote mounted. The French bond market outperformed German bunds yesterday, causing the bund/OAT yield spread to tighten from 134 basis points to 125 basis points. Conflicting comments on the Bundesbank's attitude to realignment of the exchange rate mechanism also unsettled the market. SWEDISH government bond prices fell early yesterday after the Riksbank raised its marginal rate by three percentage points to 16 per cent, but recovered later in the day as dealers covered short positions. The rise in interest rates, the second in a week, is aimed at stemming recent large capital outflows. Dealers said they had expected a further rate rise, but were taken aback by the size of yesterday's increase. The yield on the 10 1/4 per cent bond due 2003 rose to 11.40 per cent early in the day, up from 11.29 at the previous close, but recovered to end at 11.11 per cent. The Swedish central bank's move prompted Finland to lift its tender rate by 1.5 percentage points to 17 per cent. US Treasury prices rose across the board yesterday on a stable dollar, further evidence of economic weakness and a successful five-year note auction. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  17/32 at 97 27/32 , to yield 7.425 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 99 31/32 , yielding 4.250 per cent. For the second consecutive day the dollar was able to hold its ground at DM1.40, which helped boost bond market sentiment. The market received the most support, however, from the July durable goods report, which registered a 3.4 per cent decline. Analysts had predicted a flat reading in durable goods, and although the bulk of the decline was accounted for by transportation orders, the figures prompted a round of buying. Prices made up the most ground in the afternoon, following the sale of Dollars 10.5bn of five-year notes, which attracted strong demand. JAPANESE government bonds ended slightly lower in quiet trading on profit taking, following gains earlier in the week. After a strong opening, hedging against a new 10-year, Y1,000bn auction depressed prices in the afternoon. But dealers said underlying sentiment remained positive. A coupon of 5 per cent, in line with expectations, was set for the new issue, No 151. Dealers said average prices were good. The No 145 bond, which is expected to become the benchmark today, opened with a yield of 4.82 per cent and closed at 4.84 per cent.</p>

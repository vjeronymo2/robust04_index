			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Observer: Aide memoire 'Persistence pays off' might be the new school motto for St Aidan's high school in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire. Increasingly strapped for cash, the school scouted round for sponsors. Alan Leeson, the headmaster, approached Canatxx Energy Ventures, a Houston-based company that is building a gas-fired power station in nearby Fleetwood. It took 21 transatlantic phone calls before the enterprising head, who is also an Anglican priest, got through to Dennis Volter, the company's president. 'He came after me and didn't give up. That impressed me,' says Volter, who eventually stumped up Pounds 50,000, matching a similar amount from British Aerospace. Though maybe Volter was also swayed by family history - he was born in Liverpool and still has relatives in Lancashire.</p>

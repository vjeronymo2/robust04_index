			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Vocational standards will be tightened THE DEPARTMENT for Education is to tighten standards for new vocational qualifications after a school inspectors' report found standards in the pilot examinations for 16-year-olds unsatisfactory in some cases. The Office for Standards in Education found in its report on the pilot examinations last year that intermediate level General National Vocational Qualifications, each intended to be equivalent to four old O-level passes, were 'variable and in some instances unsatisfactory'. Advanced GNVQs for 18-year-olds, 'vocational A-levels', were 'satisfactory and sometimes good'. The inspectors listed shortcomings including documents loaded with too much technical language and imprecise assessment and grading criteria that were difficult to interpret. Course requirements arrived late, so some schools did not allocate enough time. External verifiers appointed by the awarding bodies had to check standards of work in vocational areas in which they had no specific expertise. GNVQs in Schools. HMSO Publications Centre, PO Box 276, London SW8 5DT. Pounds 3.50.</p>

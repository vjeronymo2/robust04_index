			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Business Law: Cadbury Committee draft offers mixed news for stakeholders The publication of the Cadbury Committee's draft report on corporate governance last week will have been met with sighs of relief in company boardrooms and accountancy firms. Shareholders, investors, lenders and lawyers may take a more cynical view of the Committee's proposed voluntary code of practice. The Committee tacitly accepts that the code will probably not work, and warns of legislation if there has been widespread abuse and non-compliance when it comes to review the situation in two years time. The news media had predicted that the Committee, made up of the great and the good, would inevitably produce ineffectual recommendations for fear of radical change. The Committee concedes that if the code fails to command support (adherence) then pressure will bring 'legislation and external regulation which will be less effective than the approach we recommend'. Regrettably, it fails to explain why legislation will be less effective, resorting only to an expressed desire not to inhibit flexibility or stifle 'entrepreneurial drive'. The reality is that proper corporate governance requires both the spirit of compliance which the Committee hopes for and the teeth of accountability within a legal framework. The inadequacies and failures of self-regulation and voluntary codes of practice witnessed in the host of frauds, scandals and failures in the UK over the last 10 years, leaves the observer questioning whether there might be something quintessentially British about the Committee's navete. Contrast the British position with that of the pragmatic Australians, who are debating their Corporate Law Reform Bill 1992. The Australians propose to reject voluntary codes of practice in favour of laws imposing greater duties on company directors and officers. Should that bill become law, among other things, directors in Australia would be obliged to: seek adequate information and make proper enquiries about their company's affairs; exercise independent judgment; vet professional advisers; scrutinise conflicts of interest of directors and management; and ensure the adequacy of, and compliance with, reporting and internal control procedures. Disqualification and heavy fines are proposed to encourage compliance. Not that direct British legislative intervention in this area is without precedent. The 1986 Insolvency Act and the Company Directors Disqualification Act introduced a revolutionary new framework governing directors' responsibilities and liabilities arising out of the insolvency of their companies. So why should proper corporate governance not be the subject of a new Companies Bill? Perhaps it will be, in any event, as a result of the proposed European Community Fifth Company Law Directive. The British government might have been better employed in trying to secure a level playing field through negotiation, than by strongly resisting all change through this directive. The principal outcome of the Committee's draft report is the fundamental change in the role and significance of the non-executive director. A company's audit committee and (mainly) remuneration committee should now be made up of non-executive directors. Most of them should be independent and their remuneration should reflect the time committed to the company's affairs. Their calibre and number should ensure that their views carry significant weight in all decisions and they should be selected formally by the board. Admirable sentiments, no doubt, but, in the absence of strict regulations, mere wishful thinking. Who, for example, is to decide on 'calibre'? Answer: the board, where the executive directors command a majority. The Committee's recommendations are steps in the right direction. But, if the government is to attempt to address the problems which led to the Maxwell, Polly Peck, BCCI and other recent scandals, then new rules in a legal framework are required. It is not sufficient, for example, to recommend a division of responsibility and a balance of power at the head of the company so that no individual has unvetted powers, without prohibiting the chairman from also being chief executive. The duty to disclose salary and performance-related elements of pay should not be limited to the chairman and the highest-paid director. It should encompass all directors and those operating through service companies and consultancies (as does the Australian draft bill). Disclosure of audit and non-audit work recommended by the Committee highlights but fails to address the inherent conflict facing auditors. The Committee describes the annual audit as 'one of the cornerstones of corporate governance' but the problem of the widespread discounting of audit fees aimed at providing accountancy firms with a platform from which to provide their numerous other, more lucrative services, will not be solved merely by this greater disclosure and the rotation of audit partners. The draft report relies on a voluntary code, influential, experienced and diligent non-executive directors and an accountancy profession where the duties to inform and protect the investor (and consequently the creditor/lender) outweigh the need to maintain client goodwill and satisfaction necessary to sell services more profitably than auditing. A recommendation that the maximum length of service agreements which do not require shareholders' consent should be reduced from five to three years is welcome. The Committee accepts this will require legislative amendment but prefers the voluntary code elsewhere to retain 'the essential spirit of enterprise'. Similarly, the proposal that directors state in their report in the annual accounts that the business is a going concern (with supporting assumptions and qualifications) is a good one, but it too will require legislative amendment and should apply to all companies, and not just listed ones. Clear statements of the functions and duties of the directors and the auditors in company accounts will not necessarily close 'the expectation gap' between what the law dictates as the reliance entitled to be placed on filed accounts and the use made of them in commercial life. By not recommending the reversal of the House of Lords decision on auditors' liability in the Caparo case (which limited reliance to the company itself through its board and the shareholders as a whole), the Committee adhered to the policy of keeping the floodgates of litigation firmly shut. Indemnity insurers, both for auditors' errors omissions insurance and directors' and officers' liability insurance, will have been comforted by the absence of radical recommendations and the voluntary nature of the proposed code. Shareholders, investors and creditors will have been disappointed that just when the spectacular corporate failures of recent years cried out for bold and imaginative legal reform, the body from which so much had been expected came up with a little tinkering and a voluntary code.

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Gillette posts strong growth at Dollars 409m GILLETTE, the US shaving products company, yesterday unveiled a strong profits growth for 1991, with the after-tax figure increasing to Dollars 409.4m from Dollars 310.6m and earnings per share rising to Dollars 1.94 from Dollars 1.60. In the fourth quarter, profits after tax were up at Dollars 113.1m from Dollars 92.2m. Sales in the period were Dollars 1.34bn against Dollars 1.24bn, and for the full year, Dollars 4.68bn against Dollars 4.34bn. Gillette said progress was broadly based, both in terms of product and regional area. However, while sales and operating profits from the international businesses were described as increasing 'substantially,' the North Atlantic interests saw moderate sales growth with 'good progress' in operating profits. The company's shares eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 48 1/2 on the news.</p>

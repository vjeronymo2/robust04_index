			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Sanchez Belisle] </F>   [Text] If Panama does not take a tough stand against drug  traffickers operating along the Colombian border, in the future  they will not only grow coca, but also poppy, Government  Minister Jacobo Salas told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA.    "Panama is not only a place where drug trafficking occurs,  but also a place where coca plants are grown, and, in the  future, if not given the proper attention, poppy fields will  also be planted," Minister Salas said after reporting that, in  the Darien region, 200 hectares of coca plants were destroyed  with herbicides in the latest police operation in March. The  official added that every citizen must become aware of the  necessity of taking financial steps to equip police with new  helicopters to patrol Darien to detect coca plantations.    "The number of police units in Darien must be increased. At  the same time, they must be adequately equipped to combat the  drug traffickers who use the Darien jungle to grow and process  the drug," Salas added.    The government and justice minister believes the  Colombian-Panamanian Treaty that is being advanced by both  countries not only will define the borders and outline special  services for immigration, customs, and drug trafficking, but  that it also will help keep Colombian rebels from using Darien  as a base.    "I think the danger is alarming, and I hope that with the  conclusion of this treaty, which should reach the Legislative  Assembly soon, agreements will be formalized that will allow the  two countries to join forces to prevent these crimes," Salas  added.    He also asked the deputies of the National Assembly's Drug  Commission to approve the anti-drug bill as soon as possible.  "This bill should be approved because there is not one family in  Panama that is exempt from the possibility that one of its  members, especially a son or daughter, could have a drug  problem," Salas said.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Waterford Wedgwood turns in IPounds 5.8m loss WATERFORD Wedgwood reported pre-tax losses increased from IPounds 2.04m to IPounds 5.77m (Pounds 5.47m) in the opening half of 1992 and warned that the full-year results would include further rationalisation costs. Turnover at the luxury ceramics and crystal manufacturer remained stable at IPounds 130m, a 5 per cent drop on the ceramics side to IPounds 87.9m being offset by a 16 per cent lift in crystal sales to IPounds 31.3m. Profit before interest and tax at Wedgwood fell to IPounds 1.47m (IPounds 3.2m), while Waterford's losses increased to IPounds 3.23m (IPounds 2.1m). 'Unabsorbed overheads' related to further short-time working at the Waterford plant were blamed for the higher losses there. Mr Richard Barnes, chief financial officer, said recessionary conditions in the UK and Japanese markets were largely responsible for the decline in ceramics sales. Improved conditions in the Irish market and the introduction of the machine-cut Marquis range of crystal improved the division's sales. Effective hedging minimised the impact of a decline in the dollar, and the group was 'well covered' into 1993. Last month Mr Paddy Galvin, chairman and chief executive of Waterford Crystal, announced plans for 500 redundancies out of the division's workforce of 1,900. He said yesterday: 'I cannot say that it is the end of the road for redundancies. We have a deeply held belief that we should continue manufacturing at Waterford, provided we can do so economically. If it is not competitive then we cannot'. He said the Marquis range 'has met all our expectations and is making profits' but he declined to reveal what proportion of sales now came from the imported ware. Mr Donald Brennan, group chairman, anticipated difficult trading conditions throughout 1992 which would necessitate 'continued short-time working and restructuring in both the Wedgwood and Waterford Crystal businesses during the second half of the year.' Losses per share were 0.91p (0.45p). Again there is no dividend.</p>

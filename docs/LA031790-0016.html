			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON  </P> <P> An El Cajon man was ordered Friday to stand trial for the attempted murder of a  prostitute.  </P> <P> James Morris Jackson, 23, was also charged with assaulting the woman, holding  her against her will, robbery and forcible oral copulation.  </P> <P> Jackson was arrested March 1 by the Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, which is  investigating 42 unsolved killings of women -- mostly prostitutes -- whose  bodies have been found in East and North county since 1985.  </P> <P> Jackson is charged with crimes involving only the Feb. 26 incident with the  prostitute.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Bonnie Dumanis said she cannot comment on whether Jackson is  a suspect in other cases.  </P> <P> The prostitute, 30, identified Jackson in San Diego Municipal Court as the man  who picked her up near 21st and Market streets downtown.  </P> <P> She said he drove to an isolated area and asked her to get into the camper  shell of his truck.  </P> <P> "I told him I had to get paid first," the woman said.  </P> <P> She said Jackson gave her $4, and she told him it wasn't enough.  </P> <P> She said her assailant suddenly tried to choke her with both hands.  </P> <P> After the attack, she said, Jackson apologized and told her he needed to see a  doctor because he didn't know why he "treated girls this way."  </P> <P> The woman said the man then dropped her off on 25th Street in San Diego, where  she flagged down a car for help and wrote down the assailant's license number  as he drove away.  </P> <P> Following her testimony as the sole witness in the preliminary hearing, Judge  Rafael Arreola bound Jackson over to Superior Court for trial.  </P> <P> He ordered Jackson to appear March 30 for arraignment. Bail of $55,000 was not  changed, and Jackson remains in County Jail.  </P></p>

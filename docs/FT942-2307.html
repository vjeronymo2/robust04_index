			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Swiss banking licence for Hinduja group The British-based Hinduja international trading group has been granted a banking licence by Swiss authorities for Amas, its Geneva-based finance and asset management company. The new bank, Amas Bank (Switzerland), is expected to focus on niche markets, providing private banking and portfolio management services to wealthy individuals, and capitalising on the group's Indian links to advise on investment opportunities in India. Amas' application for a banking licence was overshadowed by allegations of drug-money laundering, but these were dismissed as nonsense by the Hinduja family, as Amas was not a deposit-taking business. The fact that it has now been granted a banking licence could be seen as confirmation by Swiss authorities that the allegations were unfounded. The private Hinduja group is run by four brothers of the billionaire Hinduja family, with interests apart from finance, including trading, manufacturing, and infrastructure.</p>

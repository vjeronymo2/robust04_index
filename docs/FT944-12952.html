			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Standard's rise Customers who cash in long-term life insurance and pension policies after just a few years are to be given higher surrender values by Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, from next year. The company believes that knowing they will get a better deal if they have to surrender will compensate customers for possibly having to accept a small reduction in what they get when a policy reaches its full term. Standard can offer these improved surrender values because it plans to change how it pays commission to the agent or adviser selling the policy. The company will finance the initial cost of paying commission - so the adviser still gets his money - and take the total out of premiums over the life of the policy instead of taking it all from the early premiums. It is also cutting its margins so, in some cases, the maturity value will not fall at all. Surrender values across the life industry have come under heavy attack because many people have been giving up policies early. Standard's changes will coincide with the imminent new regulatory regime requiring life companies and advisers to set out the surrender values in the first five years of a policy, and to tell customers the commission paid to the sales agent. For a 25-year personal pension policy, where the investor pays Pounds 100 a month and a 9 per cent annual rate of return is assumed, Standard's surrender value after four years - when an investor would have paid Pounds 4,800 in premiums - will rise to Pounds 4,918 from Pounds 4,290. The maturity value falls by Pounds 622 to Pounds 79,879. In the case of an endowment, the improvements are even more marked. At present, if a man of 29 took out a Standard Life unitised house purchase endowment for a Pounds 50,000 loan over 25 years, and cashed it in after four years, he would - assuming a 7.5 per cent annual rate of return - get back just Pounds 3,062. This is less than the Pounds 3,953.28 he would have paid in premiums. Under the new system, though, he would get Pounds 3,967. And if he maintained the policy for its full term, he would get Pounds 53,882 - slightly more than at present. Standard says only about 4 to 5 per cent of customers give up life policies in the first few years - and it hopes better surrender values will not cause this to rise.</p>

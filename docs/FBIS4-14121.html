			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Faysal al-Husayni, head of  the advisory committee of the Palestinian delegation at the  Washington peace talks, has emphasized that Israel's failure to  grant the Palestinians full authority in Gaza and Jericho will  result in ineffective control over the security situation.    In a statement today, he said: We must have a complete  authority so that security will be achieved for everyone.    He expressed his hope that Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher will result in resolving the problems blocking the  peace process. He also hoped that the U.S. side, as a cosponsor  of the peace conference, will persuade the Israelis to change  some of their policies on the negotiations.    Al-Husayni affirmed that his visit to Egypt is private and  has nothing to do with the negotiations or with Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Cairo.    He announced that a meeting is expected to be held between  representatives of the Palestinians inside the occupied  territories and the PLO leadership in Tunis next week as part of  continuous coordination in preparation for the next stage once  an agreement to implement the Gaza-Jericho Accord is signed.</p>

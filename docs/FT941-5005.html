			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Ruhe rejects more cuts in defence Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, yesterday warned against further cuts in defence spending following a report by the parliamentary ombudsman saying soldiers were demoralised and bewildered by equipment shortages and confusion about the role of the German army. Mr Alfred Biehle, the ombudsman who visited troops throughout Germany, said there was a 'discrepancy' between objectives set out for the armed forces and means available to meet them. Soldiers on exercise were now shouting 'bang, bang' to simulate the sound of rifle fire because bullets were too costly, the report said. Far-reaching cuts in defence spending have aggravated problems arising from the fusion of the West German Bundeswehr and the former East German Volksarmee. 'The fact that budget commitments and structural decisions have been cancelled or changed in quick succession has shattered the credibility and leadership ability of the political and military commanders,' Mr Biehle wrote in his annual report. 'Soldiers expect, with right, that politicians clearly tell the German population why it needs a Bundeswehr in the future and what sort of an extended objective it will have.' Falling morale in the armed forces has meant more people were refusing national service and the number of conscientious objectors in 1993 shot up to 111,190, up from 60,269 three years earlier. The Bundeswehr Association, to which more than 250,000 soldiers belong, welcomed Mr Biehle's report, saying it highlighted longstanding 'anxieties and problems in the armed forces'. The growing number of professional soldiers who had been retired to meet savings targets meant the Bundeswehr had almost reached its reduced target of 370,000 men.</p>

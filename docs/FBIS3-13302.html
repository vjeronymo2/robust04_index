The celebration was held under the slogan  "Arabs and Kurds: One Hand in Defense of Great Iraq."    Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan, member of the Revolution  Command Council and representative of the president of the  republic, delivered a speech at the celebration. At the outset,  he conveyed greetings from leader President Saddam Husayn, may  God watch over him, to the attendees, wishing them continued  success.    Taha Yasin Ramadan added: On this day, 24 years ago, the  glorious 17-30 July revolution made an important national  achievement by issuing the historic 11 March Statement to  resolve the Kurdish question peacefully and democratically.  This solution was meant to serve as a strong and broad basis  for Iraqi national unity between Arabs and Kurds. The solution  was also an embodiment of the true principles of the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party and the policy of the glorious 17-30 July  revolution, as well as its true, sincere belief in the  legitimate rights of other ethnic groups under the greater  umbrella of Iraq and the unity of its land and people.    Taha Yasin Ramadan added: The Iraqis -- Arabs and Kurds --  warmly welcomed the historic 11 March statement. They were  aware of the great objectives and noble meanings behind this  statement of national unity. The leader president put an end to  the fighting among brothers, the sons of one nation. On the  achievement of the great objectives of the 11 March Statement,  people all over Iraq held big celebrations, from the farthest  village in southern Iraq to the farthest village in northern  Iraq. Men and women, youth and children, all took part in these  celebrations to express their true joy over this great victory  by leader President Saddam Husayn, may God watch over him.    He went on: In the glorious Saddam's al-Qadisiyah [war with  Iran], our Kurdish people were the faithful guards and brave  defenders of their great Iraq in the north, center, and south,  whether with the Armed Forces or the sectors of the People's  Army. During the war, the Kurdish people acted as an impregnable  bulwark in the face of the Iranian aggressors and the agents who  tried more than once to mislead them, divest them of their true  Iraqi character, and urge them to change their strong allegiance  to the unified, independent Iraq of Arabs and Kurds. Also,  during the immortal Mother of Battles, the sons of our Kurdish  people demonstrated an honorable stand, just like the free  Iraqis, by holding fast in the face of a fierce 30-state  aggression. They also resisted tonnes of bombs and missiles  dropped and fired by the aggressors against their installations,  schools, homes, and mosques. The 30-state coalition and its  agents were alarmed by this great Iraqi cohesion. Thus, they  initiated a second episode of treason and treachery, assigning  it to small agents, who inherited treason and agentry from their  fathers, the large agents. They tried to mislead the sons of  our Kurdish people by using slogans whose falsity became clearer  day after day. The agents sought, with U.S., French, and  British spears, to divide Iraq and separate its north from its  center and south. Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani, the two  traitors, and their gangs donated the land of our beloved north  to serve as a den for Zionists, Americans, and their allies,  paying no heed to their oppression of our Kurdish people, who  adhere to their revolutionary leadership and who live under the  shade of Iraq's big umbrella and the 17-30 July revolution. The  Kurdish people have known the sweet taste of the revolution and  reaped its fruits and gains; primarily peace, security, and  prosperity.    Taha Yasin Ramadan added: After many meetings, with  flexibility and goodwill to resolve problems through  constructive dialogue based on full national unity, the  leadership is now convinced that the leaders of those cliques  are agents of the foreigner and care only about their personal  interests and those of their masters. Those agents are using  the Kurdish question to achieve gains. They cannot live in  peace, security, and national unity because they have grown  accustomed to living on the crumbs and leftovers of foreigners.  They have also grown accustomed to a life of humiliation,  subservience, and slavery to satisfy the colonialist policy of  their masters and their rotten personal whims that reject  dignity, freedom, and national unity.    Taha Yasin Ramadan asserted: Our great Kurdish people, who  have, since time immemorial, adhered to Iraq -- in terms of its  land, people, history, civilization, and brotherhood with the  Arabs of Iraq -- will rise and rebel against this agent clique.  The 36th parallel will be shattered by the Kurds of Iraq, just  as the Arabs of Iraq shattered the 32d parallel. All attempts  at temptation and deception will not fool the sons of our  Kurdish people, who are suffering under foreign occupation, the  domination of agent cliques, poverty, hunger, and lack of  security.    Taha Yasin Ramadan concluded: All methods of deception,  falsification, and allegations are short lived, no matter how  long they persist. All these methods will be exposed as the  days go by. Our beloved north will return shortly to the mother  homeland and the greater umbrella. National unity will be  restored to great Iraq, in terms of the land and people, from  its north to its south. The policies of agentry, treason, and  subservience will be defeated so Iraqis will continue to live  under the aegis of the wise, prudent leadership of the symbol  leader, Saddam Husayn, may God watch over him. Tomorrow is not  far off for those awaiting it. Glad tidings for those who  patiently persevere. [Koranic verse]    Afterward, Baha'-al-Din Ahmad, speaker of the Legislative  Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, made a speech in  which he asserted that the Kurdish people will intensify their  struggle to return to the state of law and order, which is  lacking under the agent, sabotage cliques sitting in the lap of  their foreign masters. Those cliques have turned the Kurdistan  paradise into a hell of death and destruction.    Ahmad Muhammad Sa'id al-Atrushi, secretary of the Kurdistan  Democratic Party, also made a speech. He underlined the current  looting of resources and the unjust control of the Kurdish  people's means of livelihood in the Kurdistan region. This is  happening under false slogans that do not deceive our Kurdish  people and honorable figures worldwide. He said the actions of  the agent, traitorous cliques have exposed their intentions and  shown their true colors and their miserable situation.    Afterward, Majid Rashid al-Zibari, secretary of the  Kurdistan  Revolutionary Party, made a speech. He said the autonomy of the  Kurdistan region and the national rights achieved for the  Kurdish people are among the major reasons for the plots of  hostile, evil forces, which persistently seek to undermine  Iraq's sovereignty and the unity of its people and pure land.    The celebration was attended by comrade 'Abd-al-Rahman Ahmad  'Abd-al-Rahman, member of the Iraq Command and official in  charge of the Ninawa and Dahuk organizations of the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party; Ja'far 'Abd-al-Karim al-Barzanji,  chairman of the Executive Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous  Region; as well as the council's secretaries general; several  members of the Legislative Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous  Region; and a large audience.</p>

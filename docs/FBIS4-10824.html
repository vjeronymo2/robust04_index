			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Manuel Robles Sosa] </F>   [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (PL) -- Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina held an open and frank discussion today with  approximately 100 Peruvian businessmen on the needs,  perspectives, and difficulties with foreign investments in Cuba.    During his first day of official activities in this South  American country, Robaina, who arrived yesterday in Lima,  outlined his country's situation, problems, and current interest  in foreign investments.    He said investments must fulfill the needs of capital,  technology, and markets within a plan in which Cuba provides raw  materials, qualified labor, and infrastructure.    Robaina added his country is perfectly aware of the need to  create conditions of trust and safety for investors, for which  it has already established the prerequisite legal framework.    The head of Cuban diplomacy stated his remarks to  approximately 100 businessmen who have invested in Cuba despite  various obstacles, including the ones concerning the fact the  island is learning and adapting to new circumstances.    Robaina also reviewed the U.S. blockade, saying Washington  is  determined to exert pressure on investors so they will desist  from investing in Cuba. The visitor said: Eight of every 10  businessmen who want to do business with Cuba become discouraged  for this reason.    He said his country does not discriminate against the source  of foreign investments, but it certainly gives priority to the  ones coming from Latin America, because this region is part of  its history and geography.    The Cuban foreign minister also referred to his country's  daily problems and the efforts to forge ahead amid great  problems.    We do not care whose model it is; we only want it to be  Cuban  and feasible, said Robaina, who ruled out a possible automatic  transfer of experience from other states to the island, although  he said his nation takes the good things from others.    The Cuban minister's statement led to questions from the  Peruvian businessmen. The questions indicated their interest in  possible investments in Cuba and their doubts about  transportation, investments, financial operations, and other  issues.    Robaina is visiting Peru during a Latin American tour which  includes Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay. His agenda here,  until tomorrow, includes meetings with Efrain Goldenberg,  foreign minister, and Jaime Yoshiyama, president of the  Democratic Constituent Congress.</p>

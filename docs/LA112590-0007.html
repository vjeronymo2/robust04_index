			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETTERS ON LETTERS  </P> <P> In reading the Oct. 21 Letters column in response to the story about Gabriel  Garcia Marquez "Gabo Speaks," by Anthony Day and Marjorie Miller (Sept. 2), I  am struck with the diversity of comment. There were intellectual comments and  reasonings and emotional rationalizations.  </P> <P> There were words of praise and of abuse. It is as if the article and Marquez's  writings provoke just the opposite of what is intended. To me those books are  like music, and like music, which is merely notes, one mustn't be deterred from  the notes themselves, in Marquez's case, the words themselves.  </P> <P> We must not be thrown off the track of the notes or the words. We would be  wise, and enriched, if we just enjoy them for that.  </P> <P> WILL CONNELL  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Ciba With around one-third of its shares now held outside Switzerland, Ciba's policy of openness has paid off. The 40 per cent rise in the shares last year - keeping pace with the soaring Swiss market - might also owe something to improved disclosure and the adoption of international accounting standards. But while Ciba's plan to do away with non-voting shares is another welcome step, glasnost can only propel the shares so far. Further progress turns on the earnings outlook, which is far from clear. Looming US generic competition for two of Ciba's biggest drugs is a reason for caution about the immediate prospects - although the combined sales affected of Dollars 500m are modest in the context of the wider group. By reducing the headcount in pharmaceuticals by more than 1,000 last year, Ciba has also shown willingness to adapt. Such measures should limit the damage. To push its rating higher, Ciba will have to prove that its research pipeline is capable of producing blockbusting new products. Meanwhile, cost-cutting in agrochemicals and the first glimmers of industrial recovery in Europe look the best hopes for growth. That is more than many pure drugs companies have to offer.</p>

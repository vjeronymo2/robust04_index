			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / West struggles to resist pull of Bosnian vortex: The big powers' dilemma but the decisions taken in the margin of the 51-nation security conference summit in Helsinki give exactly the opposite impression. How, it will be asked, can governments claim that they oppose military intervention while, in the next breath they decide to send warships and helicopters to patrol the Adriatic coast. How can you oppose intervention while promising 'air cover' for land relief convoys to Sarajevo, if those are found to be necessary and feasible, as Mr John Major, the British prime minister did yesterday? And what, if not the use of military means, was President George Bush talking about when he said he strongly supported action to ensure that United Nations sanctions against Serbia were respected and relief supplies reached Sarajevo, 'no matter what it takes?' The answer is that diplomats and political leaders talk a different language from the man-in-the-street. The former distinguish between 'military intervention' in a conflict with the aim of imposing a specific political solution, and non-belligerent action, be it by military personnel and with the use of military equipment, in support of an internationally-sanctioned embargo or humanitarian relief operation. So far, all the operations, including those decided yesterday by the Western European Union to help enforce UN sanctions against Serbia, are taking place under the umbrella of existing UN Security Council resolutions. Moreover, all the nations involved or likely to become involved in the Bosnian crisis, have made it clear that a new UN resolution would be required if it were decided that land convoys, with air or troop cover, were needed to ensure the transport of aid to Sarajevo and other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'Any operation concerning the establishment of humanitarian corridors would have to be subject to further decisions by the Security Council and be co-ordinated with the UN, in particular, for the aspects concerning protection,' the WEU ministers stipulated. Ground forces are almost certainly needed to provide adequate protection. Yet among all the confusing statements on the subject of military intervention, one thing has been made perfectly clear: most of the major powers are reluctant to provide ground forces for an operation which would risk dragging them progressively into a prolonged conflict, with unforeseen political consequences. Both Mr Bush and Mr Major have repeatedly ruled out sending ground troops even to protect land convoys, while even President Francois Mitterrand of France, who was generally considered to be more open to sending ground troops to Bosnia and has already agreed to contribute 700 military personnel to the UN contingent in Sarajevo, also expressed serious reservations yesterday. 'France carries out the decisions of the UN,' Mr Mitterrand said. 'But if someone were to ask us (to provide combat troops), we would say that we would prefer other solutions.' The big unanswered question is whether events on the ground will lead to an uncontrolled escalation of military action, regardless of the firm political positions adopted by the participants in humanitarian aid and embargo enforcement operations. There have already been reports of troops of the Canadian UN force returning the fire of snipers. The more military forces there are in Bosnia, be it under the umbrella of the UN, the greater the risk of a recurrence of such incidents, possibly leading to much more serious clashes between local and foreign troops. That is why the latest measures will have to go hand-in-hand with greatly increased efforts to find a negotiated solution to the ethnic and other problems provoked by the break-up of the Yugoslav federation - whether in the framework of the European Community's peace conference chaired by Lord Carrington or a wider UN-sponsored international conference. As successive declarations on the Yugoslav crisis issued by various international forums have underlined, military measures taken by outsiders cannot solve the political problems which are at the heart of the conflict. Only a will for peace on the part of the warring factions and a genuine desire to replace shooting with talking can do that. It is for that reason that the world's leaders have been so hesitant to take more extensive military steps and will remain extremely reluctant to do so in the future, in spite of their outrage at the bloodshed in Bosnia and the suffering of its people.</p>

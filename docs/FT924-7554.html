			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Letter: DTI advice plan vulnerable to weakness of British chambers Sir, Your leader was justifiably critical of the Department of Trade and Industry's proposal to establish a nationwide network of 200 'one-stop-shop' advice centres for providing much-needed business support ('One stop advice', November 2). What the DTI proposal singularly fails to appreciate is that the strength of many of the continental European chambers of commerce comes from the mandatory obligation on almost all local businesses to register or become members. Having recently returned from a visit to Germany I was much impressed by the very extensive services provided and the support offered to its members by the German regional chambers of commerce, be this through training, advice or other public tasks. Much of this is only possible because of compulsory membership and the income this generates, as membership fees are composed of a basic fee of some DM250 and a percentage of the members' turnover. Compulsory membership allows the chambers to be representative of a cross-section of industry, to act in the best interest of all its members and at the same time protects them from becoming dependent on particular financially strong interest groupings. In contrast, the usefulness of the DTI's proposal must be very doubtful. The UK chambers are already faced with the problem of non-compulsory membership, which makes them vulnerable to pressures from interest groups, financially strong members and the threat of falling membership. Divergence into numerous interest groupings outside the chambers of commerce, and chamber members representing only a small proportion of all business in a region, can only weaken the benefits that might otherwise be available to local businesses and British business as a whole. Your leader says that a superficial and poorly funded exercise, strong on publicity, weak on organisation, would do a great deal of harm. It is difficult to see how the DTI's proposal can result in anything else. Officials would be well advised to look more closely at the approach taken elsewhere in Europe.

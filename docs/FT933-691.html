			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / People: Brian Garraway Brian Garraway, formerly deputy chairman of BAT Industries, and recently chairman of printing company BPCC and a non-executive director of the Burton retailing group, died yesterday from a heart attack. He was 61. Described by a friend as 'extremely bright, with a really sharp financial brain', Garraway was born in Birmingham in 1931 and educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham. He qualified as an accountant and joined BAT in 1955 as a travelling auditor. His job took him all over the world, and furnished him with a fund of anecdotes which he would tell later 'with a twinkling eye and a great sense of humour'. Sir John Hoskyns, Burton's chairman, said yesterday that Garraway was a 'remarkable man. He was a very powerful personality with a very good mind; absolutely fearless in all senses - both physically and mentally; and the most tremendous asset to any board.' During his time at BAT he did much to raise the group's profile in the City, where he was a popular and respected figure, and was closely involved with the group's move into financial services through the acquisition of Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar. He was a member of the main board at BAT from June 1979, and served as a director of BATUS, the US retailing business, of BAT stores, of Eagle Star and of Allied Dunbar. He joined the board of Farmers in 1989. On his retirement from BAT in October 1992 Garraway was deputy chairman of BAT Industries, chairman of Allied Dunbar, a director of Farmers, chairman of BAT financial services, and executive chairman of Eagle Star Holdings. He became a non-executive director of Burton in October 1991, and was appointed first chairman of a new regulatory board at Lloyd's of London a year later. As chairman of BPCC he was the inspiration behind the company's proposed flotation. He leaves a widow, Jean, three daughters and a son.</p>

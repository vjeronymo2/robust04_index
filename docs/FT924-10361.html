			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Manganese dividend held despite Pounds 2.45m losses MANGANESE Bronze Holdings, maker of black taxi cabs, suffered a full year loss of Pounds 2.45m after the closure of the Darlington foundry in March. This compared with a Pounds 949,000 deficit previously. A loss, however, of Pounds 531,000 on continuing businesses in 1991 was turned into a profit of Pounds 498,000. The pre-tax loss was struck on sales up 2 per cent at Pounds 71.17m. The group incurred a loss of Pounds 2.62m on discontinued operations. As a result, the loss per share increased from 3.78p to 12.27p but the company will maintain a dividend of 1p. Mr Jamie Borwick, chief executive, said despite the recession the company made substantial progress, adding what it needs most is more demand for taxis. 'There are a lot of yellow lights on every street corner,' he said. 'Taxi drivers are having to work much harder for the same money.' Manganese Bronze makes 32 taxis a week, down from 45 this time last year and 60 in 1990. Operating losses in the vehicles division were reduced from Pounds 1.33m to Pounds 310,000 on sales of Pounds 40.71m; powder metals nearly doubled profits to Pounds 1.14m on sales 26 per cent higher through organic growth at Pounds 16.58m. The profits from two profitable foundries were offset by losses at a bus and railway door business. The division moved from profits of Pounds 177,000 into losses of Pounds 336,000. Gearing was held to 19 per cent, up from 12 per cent, despite capital expenditure of Pounds 2.7m, more than 1.4 times the depreciation charge.</p>

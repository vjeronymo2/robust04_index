			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Call for tougher sanctions on Serbs INTERNATIONAL mediator Lord Owen said yesterday the world had to show Bosnia's Serbs that it was determined to ensure a peace plan was implemented in Bosnia. He was speaking as UN relief workers used the second day of the ceasefire in Bosnia to evacuate about 2,140 sick and wounded women, children and elderly people from Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in the eastern part of the republic. Several died on the journey. The evacuees, jammed into 19 lorries for the eight-hour triop, crossed Serb lines into Tuzla. At least 45 people in the convoy were critically ill. In Geneva, yesterday Lord Owen said he hoped the United Nations Security Council would couple support for the peace plan with proposals for tougher sanctions against the rump of Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro. 'There is no doubt that if Yugoslavia were to turn off the tap of strategic supplies. . . the Bosnian Serbs would not be able to sustain the war for too long,' he said. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the US would intensify diplomatic pressure on Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan and revive its effort to enforce a Bosnia no-fly zone. In New York, a deadline of midnight tomorrow for renewing the mandate of the 13,000-strong UN force in the former Yugoslavia added urgency to a new round of Security Council deliberations. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, recommending an extension, said withdrawing the troops now would probably result in renewed hostilities. Nato is planning to send at least 50,000 troops to Bosnia to enforce the peace plan, but only when all parties have signed. Mr Johan Joergen Holst, the Norwegian defence minister, said yesterday the figure would probably be more like 75,000, but that no country had so far committed forces. Mr William Perry, US deputy defence secretary, told a meeting of defence ministers from Nato, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in Brussels that Washington might commit ground forces to help make up the total. Russia, however, indicated it would not be sending significant forces since it was 'over-extended' with peacekeeping operations in the former Soviet Union. Nato officials, expressing surprise, said Mr Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, had indicated his country would contribute up to 13,000 men. Meanwhile, a second convoy, carrying food, plastic sheeting and tents, was waiting to set out for Srebrenica yesterday, but was delayed. Srebrenica has been under Serb siege for the past 11 months. Its population of 9,000 has swelled to nearly 60,000 with refugees from the fighting. Many have died from starvation or shellfire. Suffering chronic shortages of food and medicine, aid workers in Srebrenica said the population was desperate to escape. Diplomats, who believe Srebrenica is the most vulnerable of the few remaining enclaves in eastern Bosnia, say that despite US air drops the situation there is still 'very grave'. Even so, the Bosnian Serb government yesterday protested for 'deep-rooted historical reasons' to the UNHCR about the use of German military aircraft to drop relief supplies over eastern Bosnia. Germany sent its first cargo aircraft to join the US-led mission on Sunday night. In Zagreb, the Croatian government resigned, against a background of increasing economic deprivation. Mr Nikica Valentic, head of Ina, Croatia's state-owned oil company, was named as prime minister.</p>

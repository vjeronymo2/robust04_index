			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRS DISPUTE WITH S&amp;LS TO BE HEARD;  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT: THE JUSTICES WILL DECIDE ON TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR 'RECIPROCAL  SALES' OF MORTGAGE LOANS.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today agreed to decide whether savings and loan associations  and other financial institutions may claim tax deductions for "reciprocal  sales" of mortgage loans.  </P> <P> With a reported $419-million-plus interest at stake, the court said it will  hear Internal Revenue Service arguments against allowing such deductions.  </P> <P> Two federal appeals courts have ruled against the IRS and one has ruled for the  tax agency. The justices' decision, expected by July, will resolve the  conflicting rulings.  </P> <P> An IRS victory would mean more bad news for some struggling S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> In the lead case granted review today, Centennial Savings Bank of Greenville,  Tex., a savings and loan, challenged an IRS refusal to treat the sale of its  old mortgage loans to another S&amp;L as a transaction that generated a loss  for tax purposes.  </P> <P> After the IRS ruled that Centennial could not claim a tax deduction for the  transaction, the savings and loan paid its assessed taxes and sued for a  refund. A federal judge ruled for the government, but the New Orleans-based  U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals last November reversed the judge's ruling.  </P> <P> In other action today, the court:  </P> <P> * Left intact a ruling that USX Corp. illegally discriminated against blacks at  a Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill.  </P> <P> The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that a federal appeals court  "flagrantly disregarded" a 1989 Supreme Court decision in ruling against the  giant manufacturer.  </P> <P> The Philadelphia-based U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that USX,  formerly known as U.S. Steel Corp., discriminated against blacks who applied  for non-skilled production and maintenance jobs at the steel mill.  </P> <P> * Agreed to resolve a dispute from Arkansas over the power of states to tax  cable television companies and subscribers.  </P> <P> The court said it will review a ruling that Arkansas may tax cable TV as long  as it also imposes the levy on similar communication services, such as the  unscrambling of satellite signals.  </P> <P> With millions of dollars in tax revenue at stake, the ruling was challenged in  separate appeals by both the state and cable operators and subscribers.  </P> <P> * Said it will decide whether Oklahoma may collect a sales tax on cigarettes  and other items sold at a Shawnee convenience store owned and run by an Indian  tribe.  </P> <P> The justices said they will review a ruling that would bar the imposition of  such a tax.  </P> <P> Asked for its views, the Bush Administration advised the justices to send the  case back to a federal appeals court for further study. The justices ignored  that advice.  </P> <P> * Agreed to use a dispute over the settlement of a strike by Continental  Airlines pilots to set new guidelines on the duties of unions to represent  their members.  </P> <P> The court said it will consider killing a lawsuit against the Air Line Pilots  Assn. by striking pilots who said the union denied them fair representation.  </P></p>

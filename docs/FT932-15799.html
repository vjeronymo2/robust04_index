			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Inflation slowdown helps US revival plan THE US economy received a boost yesterday from official figures showing a sharp slowing of inflation last month. The Commerce Department said the underlying or 'core' consumer price index rose only 0.1 per cent compared with increases of 0.5 per cent in both January and February. This followed news on Thursday of a parallel easing of wholesale price inflation last month. The previous apparent increase in inflationary pressures had stalled a decline in US bond market interest rates after sharp price rises earlier this year. The figures came the day after release of the administration's budget for fiscal 1994, an elaboration of the economic plan unveiled in February. Mr Clinton plans to finance deficit reduction and higher federal investment in areas such as infrastructure and training with sharp cuts in defence spending, higher income taxes on the wealthiest 1 per cent and a new broad-based energy levy. The budget projects a decline in the deficit from Dollars 322bn (Pounds 211.8bn) this fiscal year to Dollars 264.1bn in fiscal 1994, which begins on October 1, and Dollars 214bn in fiscal 1997.

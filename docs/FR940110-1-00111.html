Subpart C of part 422 describes the procedures of the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). Section 422.205 describes the organization and functions of the Appeals Council, a part of OHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By direct delegation of authority from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), the Appeals Council is authorized to review hearing decisions and orders of dismissal issued by SSA's ALJs. Through the exercise of this authority, the Appeals Council is responsible for ensuring that the final decisions of the Secretary involving benefits under titles II, XI, XVI and XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) and part B of title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended, are proper and in accordance with the law, regulations, and binding agency policy established in Social Security Rulings and Acquiescence Rulings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, 20 Appeals Council members, hereinafter referred to as either ``Administrative Appeals Judges (AAJs)'' or ``members,'' comprise the membership of the Appeals Council. The Associate Commissioner for OHA is the Chair of the Appeals Council and is the administrative officer directly responsible to the Commissioner of Social Security for carrying out OHA's mission of holding ALJ hearings and deciding appeals. Each AAJ, other than the Chair, is assisted by an Appeals Officer who serves as a legal clerk. Organizationally, Appeals Officers are a part of the Appeals Council.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Appeals Council considers appeals under titles II, XI, XVI, and XVIII of the Act, and under part B of title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended. The regulations setting forth the responsibilities of the Appeals Council appear in 20 CFR part 404 (subpart J, &sect;&sect;404.967  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), part 410 (subpart F, &sect;&sect;410.657  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), part 416 (subpart N, &sect;&sect;416.1467  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and 42 CFR part 405 (subpart G, &sect;&sect;405.701(c) and 405.724), part 417 (subpart Q, &sect;417.634 and part 473 (subpart B, &sect;&sect;473.46 and 473.48(b)). These regulations provide that after an ALJ has issued a decision or dismissed a request for a hearing, the Appeals Council may review a case on its own motion or at the request of a party to the hearing decision or dismissal. The Council may deny or dismiss a party's request for review, or it may grant the request and either issue a decision or remand the case to an ALJ. If the Appeals Council denies a request for review of a decision by an ALJ, the ALJ's decision becomes the final decision of the Secretary subject to judicial review under the provisions of section 205(g) of the Act. If the Appeals Council grants a request for review and issues a decision, that decision becomes the final decision of the Secretary subject to judicial review pursuant to section 205(g) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 404.970 and 416.1470 describe cases involving Social Security and supplemental security income benefits payable under title II and title XVI of the Act that the Appeals Council will review. Those sections provide that the Appeals Council will review a case if the action, findings or conclusions of the ALJ are not supported by substantial evidence; there is an error of law; or there appears to be an abuse of discretion by the ALJ. Those sections also provide that the Appeals Council will review a case that presents a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the general public interest. The same standards apply to determine if the Appeals Council will review a case under title XVIII of the Act or under part B of title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the years, there have been questions about the functions and operations of the Appeals Council. Some commenters have questioned the usefulness of review by the Appeals Council. Several studies have addressed the role of the Appeals Council, resulting in many recommendations for improving the Council's structure and operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

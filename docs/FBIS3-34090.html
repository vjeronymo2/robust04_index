[passage omitted]    Mr. Chairman, your committee's session is being held at a  very important and critical period in view of the international  changes and their impact on human rights in various parts of the  world.    The international changes which put an end to the Cold War  period were accompanied by many regional and internal wars in  Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. As regards the Middle  East, the situation is still the same and the volcano of its  wars has not settled yet. You know, ladies and gentlemen, the  numerous human rights violations generated by these wars. Human  rights violations perpetrated during wars or foreign occupation  resulting from war may be the worst and the most serious ones,  and in any case of war, people are the victims, be this war real  or cold, international or regional or internal.    The result is always victims among people. No one can  predict putting an end to one kind of war and ignore other kinds  of wars which are themselves resulting from other wars. The  Cold War has come to an end but other wars have been ignited and  they are ceaselessly threatening to expand.    Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to inform you from this  solemn rostrum that out of our commitment to human rights,  democratic freedoms, international laws, and the UN Charter, and  out of our concern for building a healthy, dynamic, open, and  active society, our first decision dated 30 September 1993  following the decision to establish a Palestinian National  Authority, was to approve the creation of the higher Palestinian  national human rights commission as an independent body.    The decision stipulates that the task of this commission is  to follow up and secure the provision of the requirements for  the protection of human rights in all Palestinian laws,  legislation, and systems, as well as in the work of the various  services, bodies, and institutions belonging to the Palestinian  national authority.    We confirmed a few weeks ago the official recognition of  this  body which will include a number of moral and legal  personalities and it will be chaired by sister Dr. Hanan  'Ashrawi.    Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the  world's  geopolitical map from the perspective of the principles of human  rights and international humanitarian law, we would not be able  to move from one place to another without putting our fingers on  grave and systematic violations of human rights, whether by  torture or other forms of inhumane treatment, premeditated  killing, arbitrary execution, detention and arrest without  trial, racism, racial discrimination and segregation, foreign  occupation and domination, hatred of immigrants and the  emergence of neo Nazism, poverty and deliberate impoverishment,  all forms of denial of national, economic, social and cultural  rights, right of self-determination of peoples under foreign  occupation and domination, religious extremism, terrorism, state  terrorism, discrimination against women, and the absence of the  sovereignty of law. This is why I have the pleasure of praising  the Vienna Human Rights Declaration which emanated from the  international conference on human rights held in Vienna in the  middle of last year. I would also like to praise the United  Nations General Assembly's decision to adopt this important  declaration.    Ladies and gentlemen, at two previous sessions I addressed  you on the state of human rights everywhere in the world and,  specifically, in Palestine. I addressed you on human rights and  the occasional [ahyanan] violations, exploitation, and  mistreatment to which these rights are exposed. [passage  omitted]    I have also spoken to you about the extent of the suffering  of our Palestinian people under Israeli occupation as a result  of violations of human rights and basic liberties, which the  violations have extended to include all rights without  exception, starting with violation of the right to live and  ending with violation of the right of expression. This was  achieved by subjecting our people to deliberate killing,  torture, arbitrary arrest, deportation, seizure of land and  building settlements on them, collective punishment, disruption  of educational programs, closure of schools and universities,  attacks on places of worship and holy places, closure of trade  unions, destruction of the Palestinian national economy and our  people's right to exercise self-determination in their  territory. Furthermore, the occupation in itself constitutes a  grave violation of our people's human rights in our occupied  land.    Your respected committee has dealt with this painful reality  for more than 26 years, and has rejected and condemed it, and  called for its end. It has also called for Israel's withdrawal  from the Palestinian territories, including Holy Jerusalem and  the other Arab territories it occupied by force in 1967, as a  radical solution for the deterioration of human rights and the  return of the Palestinian people's right to their homeland and  self-determination without external interference. This action  has been taken through its numerous resolutions which have  continued with its latest, 49th, session in which it appointed  Mr. Rene Felber as special envoy for investigation into Israel's  violations of the principles of international law, international  human law, and the provisions of the fourth Geneva agreement in  our occupied land. [passage omitted]    Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, our Palestinian people,  who have made huge sacrifices for decades in order to recover  their homeland and rights, are the people most in need of a just  and comprehensive peace because of foreign occupation and the  injustice and tragedies of expulsion as a result of that, as  well as denial of their national rights. These rights were  affirmed by your respected commission, the UN General Assembly,  the UN Security Council, and the other international meetings  and were strengthened by the principles of international  legality and international law.    Our people's struggle for peace has become linked to our  deep  conviction in peace based on justice, and there is no peace with  occupation or aggression and denial of rights. On this basis,  we have continuously responded to all the international peace  initiatives which led in the end to the Madrid Conference and  the resulting negotiations in Washington and Oslo, which also  produced the agreement on the Declaration of Principles which  was signed in Washington on 13 September last between the PLO  and Israel's Government, as well as the declaration of mutual  recognition between the PLO and Israel.    The signing of the above mentioned agreement came as a first  step expressing good intentions and goodwill to achieve the  peace of the brave, which is based on justice and respect for  human rights, a peace which turns the page of history containing  the occupation, tragedies, wars, and hostilities. It is also a  peace which opens wide prospects before a new stage of  relations, of fruitful cooperation between the Palestinian and  the Israeli peoples which will be based on good neighborliness,  mutual respect, and solving conflicts with peaceful means,  dialogue, and arbitration.    The signing of this agreement under the auspices of  President  Clinton, the evidence of the U.S. and Russian co-sponsors of the  conference, and the blessing of the whole world formed the first  necessary step to move forward on the road of finding a  comprehensive and just settlement to the conflict in the Middle  East on the basis of implementing Security Council's resolutions  242 and 338. [passage omitted]    We entered these talks with good intentions to achieve a  comprehensive and just peace, and we are still pursuing them  with good intention. We hope that the Israeli Government has  the same good intention and gives it a concrete form toward the  agreement by adhering completely to it in letter and and in  spirit. [passage omitted]    All this took place after the signing of the agreement in  Washington. It stirred up negative reactions among our  Palestinian people, the Arab masses, and the peoples of the  region and generated convictions that the Israeli Government is  not serious in implementing this agreement. The seriousness of  this is doubled by Israel which places obstacles to the  implementation of the agreement and attempts to change its aims  according to its whims, for example, the redeployment of Israeli  forces in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region instead of  withdrawing from them in accordance with the Declaration of  Principles, in addition to other problems. These attempts still  form the major characteristic of the Israeli negotiators, and  this motivated us to look for the good intentions and the  measures to make the required confidence available in order to  move forward toward the hoped for goals in a comprehensive and  just peace, which we have not managed to feel so far.    Mr. Chairman, we would like to affirm to you our unyielding  faith in the peace process, and on the basis of that we will  continue to give impetus to the whole of the peace process,  including negotiations. We will not be swayed by any maneuvers,  retractions, or frustrations. We hope that the Israeli side  will understand that this agreement has a clear perspective in  so far as it concerns Palestinian human rights. We interpret  past violations as a result of the occupation. We have to  equate them now with a new action created by the spirit and  prospect of peace. Therefore, we hope, and undoubtedly you  share our hope, that we will see Israel setting out to implement  the rules of the fourth Geneva Accord and the principles of  international law, and abandon their old methods, fanaticism,  and prevarication so that we will be able to work together in  order to reach the peace and security which we all aspire to.    In light of these developments, the need for the  international community to persistently bear its  responsibilities regarding the issue of Palestine is firmly  established. Any attempt to marginalize the role of the  international community, represented in the United Nations, in  this issue is an attempt to vilify international legitimacy and  to undermine its principles on the basis of which the peace  process was built, starting with drawing on the UN Charter and  the UN Security Council resolutions and ending with guaranteeing  the Palestinian people's right to exercise their national rights  as a basis for reaching a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace  in the Middle East region.    We would like to stress that the results of the peace  process and the ongoing negotiations must be based on the  rulings of international legitimacy and the principles of  international law as a means of safeguarding the noble  principles of the international community which the world has  accepted as an instrument to establish the bases of justice,  friendship, and the resolution of disputes among states by  peaceful means. For our part, we will push with all our  strength to ensure the success of the peace process so that our  future generations and our children and their children will be  able to live in peace, security, stability, harmony, and freedom  far away from threats, repression, violence, and wars. To that  end, I turn to you, for your honorable commission to continue  its mission of defending our people and their right to their  homeland, and putting an end to human rights violations and  protecting human rights in our occupied land for as long as the  occupation continues, particularly in the transitional phase  during which the occupation forces will remain in parts of our  land.

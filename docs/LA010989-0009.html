			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELMETS  </P> <P> If ever there was a case for passage of a law requiring helmets on bike riders,  I saw it recently. As I approached an intersection in West Los Angeles, I saw a  man wearing a helmet fly through the air and bounce on his head. A car had just  hit his motorcycle.  </P> <P> He sat up stunned and in a few seconds began patting his helmet as if giving  thanks that it had done its job to protect him. He was able to stand up and  walk from the intersection to the curb. I am sure he feels that his helmet  saved him from serious injury or death.  </P> <P> MARGE BERNSTEIN  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: McKechnie looks to allay US loss fears - Other Companies McKechnie: The metals and plastics components group, is expected to announce 1993-1994 pre-tax profits of around Pounds 31m tomorrow, up from Pounds 24.51m the previous year. This would produce earnings per share of 23.8p and should mean at least a maintained dividend of 14.75p. When it made a paper takeover of Linread last June, McKechnie said earnings would not be diluted. The City will be looking for assurance that it has eliminated plastics losses in the US.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: A city without vultures or doves - War and Peace (Travelling in Troublespots) It takes a while before you realise what is missing in Beirut - apart, that is, from electricity, interesting night-life and traffic lights. Then it strikes. No birds. Not a sparrow, not a pigeon in sight. Who can blame them for clearing off? Wracked, wrecked and wretched after a particularly nasty civil war lasting almost two decades, Beirut is only now returning to a semblance of normality. When the birds return, you will know that Beirut is once again on the regular tourist list. Until then, it beats other off-beat destinations - Tirana springs to mind - into a cocked hat. For although Beirut easily wins 1994's Most Densely Packed Urban Bomb Crater gold medal - and narrowly nudges Manhattan into second place for the year's international Street Trash award - its inhabitants could charm the birds from the trees. If there were any birds, that is. How can a city where collective madness blasted bullets and mortars from every corner, suddenly be populated by such a relaxed, informal and welcoming citizenry? There is probably no simple answer. When I was there, the most plausible tended gently to ooze away, usually over dozens of mezze dishes and some succulent red wines. Beirut may have been blitzed into rubble, but it is still a gourmet's delight, as we found in the splendid Hotel Arabi, high above the town of Zahle, on the edge of the Bekaa valley. Zahle makes an excellent oasis en route from Beirut from Baalbek, 86km north-east of Lebanon's capital. From 1975, when a Moslem leftist coalition began slugging it out with Christian right-wing militias, the (originally Phoenician, now Roman) site of Baalbek was inaccessible to all but the most determined traveller. Even today, more than two years after the first parliamentary elections in 20 years signalled the petering-out of the war, obvious strangers strolling through Baalbek's bustling market are curiosities, to be gracefully acknowledged by older people, or giggled at by youngsters. It matters not that you have no Arabic; try French - even though the French mandate expired in the second world war, many Lebanese have enough French for basic communication. Baalbek's beauty is two-fold. As one of the world's biggest ancient sites, the temples to Jupiter, Bacchus and Venus are well-preserved and beautiful. That dedicated to Jupiter still has six of its huge, 22-metre high, columns; the temple itself is enormous, measuring 440ft by 370ft. To give some idea of that scale, the Parthenon is 228ft by 100ft. The nearby smaller temple of Bacchus - on the same scale as the Parthenon - is astonishingly complete, lacking a roof but with much of its internal detail remaining. And if the war kept away the tourists, it also frightened off the tourist parasites. Apart from the Syrian and Lebanese flags, flying high on the ramparts of Jupiter's temple, the site is pristine. No ice-cream stalls, no fast-food joints, not a plastic souvenir in view. If hungry, dozens of stalls selling tempting cooked sweets and savouries are just five minutes walk away in the town. Just a handful of postcard sellers stand eagerly at the gate, one of whom does a nice line in touting coins, allegedly filched from the ruins. He also spoke excellent English: 'I am going back to my studies next week, please buy. Look, I will sell you two silver ones for Pounds 30. Take them, take them] Have this bronze one too, for Pounds 25] Please.' Were they genuine? Who knows. If you tire of Baalbek, then the 19th century palace of Beit Eddine, or the port city of Byblos - one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world - are within easy reach. Inevitably, travellers will be jittery about security. But I found it much safer to walk round Beirut late at night - the streets were empty, the rare passing Beiruti amiable - than many cities of much safer reputation. Parts of south Lebanon are still out of bounds for travellers, as the sporadic war between Hizbollah's fighters and Israeli forces drags on. Today, the Bekaa Valley is quiet, with only the occasional tiny Syrian anti-aircraft gun emplacement dotted along the route connecting Baalbek with Beirut. They look ill-prepared to fire shots in anger. Has Beirut found peace through exhaustion? Hardly. The only cause of exhaustion today is the city's frenetic activity: rebuilding whole blocks; street-level trading of everything from three-piece suites to designer clothes; 1m cars clogging streets bereft of traffic lights and road markings. It used to be said that whatever you wanted could be bought in Beirut; it is probably true once more. Luxury apartments have sprung up again on the Corniche, the famous promenade overlooking the Mediterranean. Most are empty - understandable, at prices from Dollars 1m for three bedrooms. Why don't their owners ask less? 'They don't have to. They are waiting for the good times to return, and then there will be plenty of buyers,' said a Beiruti. The good times cannot be far off, if the current uneasy peace persists. The thousands of homeless Beirutis who have stuck up plastic sheeting as protection against the elements in bombed-out apartment blocks, cannot wish for any more fighting. The advance guard of development - bankers, venture dealers and financiers - have already begun to trickle back, sniffing out embryonic deals in the urgently-needed reconstruction of everything from telecommunications to waste disposal. Go to Beirut. It will not be easy, but it will be worth it. See for yourself what mass insanity can do; and see too, how the human spirit can survive even that. And get there before the universal merchants of plastic tat discover the country's delights; once they arrive, even the sparrows might think twice about returning. Gary Mead travelled to Beirut courtesy of British Mediterranean Airways, which flies directly between Heathrow and Beirut five times weekly. Middle East Airlines flies the same route. Best hotels in Beirut are the Summerland and Coral Beach hotels.</p>

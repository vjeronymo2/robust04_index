The caller said other sites had been targeted in various  Italian cities, including the La Brera railway car plant in  Pozzuoli, some ten kilometers outside Naples.    Police were investigating the credibility of the claim that  the NCC was responsible, a group which has boasted of other  attacks in the past.</p>

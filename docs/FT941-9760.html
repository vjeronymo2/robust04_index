			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Markets: Nerves afflict the rampant running bulls - Wall Street Sometimes, stock market investors can be difficult to please. Take the cases of General Motors and Ford. These two US car makers both reported big improvements in quarterly and annual earnings this week. According to their latest results, Ford earned Dollars 719m (Pounds 492.40m) in the fourth quarter and Dollars 2.5bn in the full-year 1993. In the same reporting periods of 1992, Ford incurred huge losses. General Motors, meanwhile, made a profit of Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 2.5bn in the latest quarter and full-year, respectively. Like Ford, GM bounced back from big losses in 1992. In spite of these impressive recoveries, investors responded to the announcements this week by selling Ford and GM shares. On Wednesday Ford shares fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 1/2 , while a day later GM's stock dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 1/2 . In both cases, analysts said investors reacted negatively to the earnings reports because the figures were in line with, but no better than, market forecasts. Investors wanted to be pleasantly surprised by the numbers, and they were not, so they sold. This behaviour is just one sign that the stock market is getting, as traders might say, 'a bit toppy'. Equities are expensive by historical standards, and so long as they remain so, investors will require something out of the ordinary to keep buying stocks, especially those, such as Ford and GM, that have had a good run. The selling of Ford and GM suggested something else: that investors' nerves are fraying as the greatest bull market in modern history staggers into its third year. The market may have recovered from last Friday's 96-point plunge, but the Fed's decision to raise interest rates for the first time in five years has clearly disturbed investor sentiment, to such an extent that the market looks increasingly vulnerable to sudden sell-offs. Thursday was a good example of this. First, shares fell after Elaine Garzarelli, the high-profile market analyst at Lehman Brothers, said on an afternoon business television programme that she expected stocks to fall by between 4 per cent and 7 per cent following a Fed policy tightening. Garzarelli was saying nothing particularly astonishing or new. She was simply reiterating her long-held view - one shared by many analysts - that it would be natural for share prices to undergo a mild correction in the wake of a rise in interest rates. Later on Thursday, prices fell further amid a rumour that Goldman Sachs, the large privately-held Wall Street securities house, had suffered severe trading losses. While Goldman quickly denounced the rumour as a 'flagrant falsity', it was enough - coupled with the comments from Garzarelli - to leave the Dow nursing a 36-point loss at the end of the day. The market's erratic behaviour this week (before Thursday's big decline the Dow had been up 35 points on Monday and up another 26 points on Wednesday) will probably be repeated in the coming weeks, or months. With the threat of further interest rate increases hanging over equities, share prices are likely to trade in a range between 3,850 and 4,000, one that is wide enough to allow the kind of big one-day movements seen this week. For the Dow to break decisively through 4,000, either some unexpectedly good corporate news, or further improvements in economic conditions, would be required. Neither is particularly likely. The next quarterly reporting season is three months away, and the experiences of Ford and GM show how hard it is to impress investors these days. As for the economy, it grew by almost 6 per cent in the last quarter of 1993, an unsustainable rate of expansion in the best of times, but one that will be particularly hard to improve upon in the first quarter of this year because the negative impact of President Clinton's tax increases is likely to start showing up soon in the economic data. Investors will also have to start worrying about how the tightening of monetary policy will affect the business climate and the economy. At the moment, little impact is seen from the quarter-point rise in short-term interest rates the Fed engineered eight days ago. Yet, few expect the Fed to leave it at that. Yesterday, the government announced a 0.4 per cent rise in January producer prices (excluding the volatile food and energy components). The increase was larger than expected, and immediately lowered the odds of another interest rate rise within the next month. The next tightening might come as early as next week, when the January consumer price figures are released. Another rate rise, so soon after the first, is not a pleasant prospect for an increasingly highly-strung stock market.  --------------------------------------------- Monday        3906.32    +      34.9 Tuesday       3906.03    -       0.29 Wednesday     3931.92    +      25.89 Thursday      3895.34    -      36.58 Friday        3894.78    -       0.56  ---------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Gardening: Dealing with a floating front lawn - Tackling the ravages of wet weather THERE HAS never been such a prelude to deep winter: rain, rain and more rain, until even the authorities in Kent have had to lift their ban on hosepipes. Before you paddle off Christmas shopping, there are urgent problems in your floating garden: some of them are stored for the future, others are oversights which we like to pretend do not exist. Looking forward, I see problems from footprints and serious danger for flower pots. We cannot give up weeding, cutting down and replanting just because it is a wet year, but these jobs oblige us to walk on flower beds. Wellingtons squash the ground between border plants and flatten it into wet cake. Whenever you are walking on the soil, be sure to lay down short planks of wood and use them as your pedestals and tractor-treads. By spreading your weight they stop you packing the soil so that it becomes unworkable next spring. Fork over the ground beneath the planks as you remove them and beat your retreat. Flower pots need more urgent attention. The soil inside them is sopping wet and gallons of rainwater have now drained through ornamental terracotta urns. The first heavy frost will ice the pots on to any hard surface on which they are standing: iced bottoms are a major reason why expensive pots from Spain or the Far East disintegrate outdoors. Instead, stand them on two upturned bricks or stones so that their drainage holes are raised above the ground. The water will then run through without freezing the pot on to its supporting surface. This protection needs action now, before nature compounds her hostility and freezes up before Christmas. Inside urns and large pots, remember that flower bulbs are having a prolonged baptism. Usually, I leave them uncovered and merely hope that winter will not freeze them and turn them to a soft mush. This year, I am considering the example of some of our biggest public gardens where pots are surfaced with thick plastic, lashed into place until late winter. These defences cannot remain in place much later than the end of January because hyacinths, daffodils and so forth will then be nosing their way through the ground. This year, however, the soil begins from such a wet point that a fall of snow on top of it will multiply the muddiness and the mess from thawing frost. It may be wise to cover up potted bulbs for safety, at least for the next six weeks or so. As for the oversights, they concern tulips, spring bedding and the other Dutch bulbs which you bought forwards in August, fearing chaos in the currency markets. The fall in the pound has already pushed their prices up by 15 per cent and nobody wants to be losing stock for next year. After a call auction on tulips, I am still struggling to plant the delivered bulbs in all the drizzle. What can you do if you still have tulips, wallflowers, forget-me-nots and even some crocuses with young shoots like yellow tusks sitting unplanted in brown paper bags? Despite the books' advice, all is not lost. Tulips, certainly, will not fail to flower if you plant them as deep as you can during the next fortnight. In wet ground, accurate planting is more difficult, but you must be sure that the bulb is sitting firmly on earth underneath it, not sideways on a pocket of air. Indoors, some of the bulbs may have lost their outer brown tunics, but even if you plant them looking white and naked, most of them will still survive. They are merely more prone to diseases, especially to mould in wet soil. If any of them are already showing tell-tale spots of greenish-blue,throw them out before planting. Unplanted crocuses are all shoots, no roots, but they will settle, flower and survive even if you plant them as late as the next 10 days. Th effects may show in 1994 when fewer corms will have grown on and made up for lost progress. However, I still have some satisfactory plants which were planted as late as December 18: human delay is not as dangerous to them as the deadly attention of mice. Forget-me-nots and wallflowers are much more obliging. Plants can still be moved around whenever the ground is workable: those which I planted in early October have made little more progress and those still waiting on the sidelines. This year, the main difficulty is that wallflowers have made such wretchedly small plants. Do not blame your carelessness: professional growers have fared no better and tell me that they blame a dry start, a cold spell in summer and the rain from July onwards which flattened the soil and prevented plants from forming proper roots. Throughout the autumn, I have been grappling with wallflowers in my two chosen colours, Primrose Bedder and Scarlet Bedder, thinking vague thoughts about which I would choose if they were females, not wallflowers. As plants, nobody could have picked them for choice, because they are under-developed. Meanwhile, I am making the best of my trump card for spring gardening: it involves the scattering of bedding plants in the gaps down herbaceous borders. Six years ago, we started to revive this old unorthodoxy in the long borders in my Oxford college. Wallflowers are much the best bet, because their roots do not run hungrily and drain too much goodness from the soil. The art is to pack in separate clumps of wallflowers in civilised colours wherever border plants have retreated ot their main root stocks and left gaps in the soil. Wallflowers fill in and can be ripped out and thrown away when the border begins to fill out in late May. Even now, it is not too late for this easy task. If you have a choice, avoid the mixed colours which are most widely available because they include a high proportion of the vigorous orange varieties. Their colour is rather beastly, a poor mix for the deeper reds and pale yellows. The job is so rewarding because it doubles a border's season in the simplest way. These spring bedding plants do not require their own special bed, let alone a personal space on a roundabout by courtesy of your local council. They are plants like any others: walk the plank on wet soil between your borders and even at this late date, you can strike a blow for a brighter spring.</p>

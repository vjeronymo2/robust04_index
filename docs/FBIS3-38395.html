			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Bundeswehr will not be able to participate in  any further missions abroad for the time being. This is  intended to save some 100 million German marks [DM]. In  addition, the Bundeswehr intends not to fill 1,500 positions  that will fall vacant in the civilian sphere, to reduce the  number of noncareer soldiers, and to extend the transfer of  units to eastern Germany over a longer period of time. These  are parts of the list of cuts intended to reduce the defense  budget by DM1.25 billion.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: Southam plans links with Black SOUTHAM, the Canadian newspaper group in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger recently became the largest shareholder, plans to forge closer links with Mr Black's other international publishing investments, The Daily Telegraph in the UK and Australia's Fairfax Holdings. Mr William Ardell, Southam's chief executive, said yesterday that one alluring aspect of Mr Black's business strategy was that 'he sees papers in a global context'. No discussions have taken place on areas of co-operation between the three groups, but Mr Ardell said that he foresaw opportunities to create products, including improvements to existing papers. Southam is expected to tap The Telegraph's industrial relations experience in the UK to deal with long-standing labour problems at its loss-making Vancouver subsidiary which runs the city's two leading newspapers. Such co-operation would mirror the pattern set in Mr Black's other international interests. The 200-plus small US newspapers owned by Hollinger relied heavily on The Daily Telegraph for coverage of the Gulf war in 1991. The North American edition of the Jerusalem Post, which is also controlled by Mr Black, is printed by a Hollinger subsidiary in New Jersey. Hollinger recently completed a deal to buy 22.6 per cent of Southam, which publishes 18 daily papers and has interests in business information services and trade publications. In an understanding partially modelled on last year's Hollinger-Telegraph agreement, Mr Black has agreed to several safeguards to prevent a creeping takeover or a proxy fight for control of Southam. Hollinger will name three representatives to the Southam board, but a majority of board members will be independent of both Southam management and Hollinger. The outside directors must approve any substantial transaction between the two companies. Any deal worth more than CDollars 100m (USDollars 78.1m) or 10 per cent of Southam's market capitalisation must have the assent of holders of a majority of Southam shares, excluding Hollinger.</p>

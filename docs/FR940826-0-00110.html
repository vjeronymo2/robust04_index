The housing must be permanent or transitional housing, and includes permanent housing for disabled homeless persons, and single-room occupancy housing. The specific eligible costs for these activities are set forth in &sect;&sect;92.206 through 92.209. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 12.

Selection policies and criteria meet the ``reasonably related'' requirement if at least 50% of the families assisted qualify, or would qualify in the near future without tenant-based rental assistance, for one of the three Federal preferences under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. These are families that occupy substandard housing (including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless families); families that are paying more than 50 percent of (gross) family income for rent; or families that are involuntarily displaced. The participating jurisdiction may select low-income families currently residing in units that are designated for rehabilitation or acquisition under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program without requiring that the family meet the written tenant selection policies and criteria. Families so selected may use the tenant-based assistance in the rehabilitation or acquired unit or in other qualified housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14.

However, additional HOME funds may be committed to a project up to one year after project completion (see &sect;92.502), but the amount of HOME funds in the project may not exceed the maximum per-unit subsidy amount established under &sect;92.250. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 15.

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER-CITY DEAL MAY REMAIN SECRET  </P> <P> A Ventura County Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that the city of Thousand  Oaks will not be forced to disclose the details of its dealings with a  developer -- who wants to build a hotel and office complex at the proposed  civic center -- if a formal negotiating agreement is signed by July 20.  </P> <P> Judge Bruce A. Thompson said that as long as the city and Lowe Development  Corp. sign the agreement stating that they are continuing their talks, he would  not grant a petition of former Planning Commissioner Heinrich (Corky) Charles  to force the city to make public its records on the matter.  </P> <P> Thompson said he did not want to ruin the deal between the city and the  developer, which he said would occur if the negotiations are disclosed.  </P> <P> Charles said he wanted the details of the negotiations because he doubts that  Lowe is serious about building an office complex and hotel at the Jungleland  site on Thousand Oaks Boulevard at Conejo School Road, possibly placing the  city's civic center development in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "There is no deal," said Charles, who opposes the city's Jungleland project.  "We wanted to smoke them out."  </P> <P> But development company officials said they are committed to building the hotel  and office complex. A Japanese businessman is considering financing the  project, company officials said.  </P> <P> City Atty. Mark G. Sellers said after the hearing Tuesday that he already has  an agreement prepared for officials to sign. TINA DAUNT  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CAMPUS GARDEN THAT JUST WENT TO POT  </P> <P> Something has been growing in the Organic Gardens on the campus of Cal State  Long Beach that isn't the normal squash, green beans and sunflowers.  </P> <P> Someone has been growing marijuana plants, according to the university police.  </P> <P> Campus police arrested a man identified as Ramon Sala, 50, on suspicion of  cultivating marijuana. Sala, who was booked at the Sheriff's Department  Lakewood substation, is free on $1,000 bail.  </P> <P> Cultivation of marijuana is a felony and carries a maximum sentence of three  years in state prison.  </P> <P> Police conducted an investigation after an anonymous caller tipped the office  of university President Curtis McCray that marijuana was growing in the  gardens.  </P> <P> Public Safety Sgt. Jerry Prieto arrested Sala, who was seen leaving the gardens  carrying "a leafy plant about two feet high," said Toni Beron, university  public affairs director.  </P> <P> Sala threw the plant under a nearby vehicle and asked, "What marijuana?" before  Prieto could say anything, Beron said.  </P> <P> A search of the gardens failed to turn up more marijuana, but it appeared that  five to six plants may have been removed from the area, Beron said.  </P> <P> The gardens at Bellflower Boulevard and State University Drive are rented to  the public to grow vegetables and fruit.  </P> <P> Beron said there has been no previous problem with marijuana in the gardens.

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Aim contract Aim Group, the maker of aircraft interior fittings, has won a North American contract with a potential value of more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 30.4m). At the same time, however, it warned that low production levels would hit current year profits. Mr Jeff Smith, chairman, said that 'while this contract award further strengthens the already excellent outlook for 1995-96, the current year remains difficult with low levels of production, particularly in the first half, and full year profits may be lower than last year.' He said, however, that the group was well placed to cope with significantly increased production rates resulting from the new contract and the Saab 2000 contract. Aim Aviation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is to supply Northwest Airlines, the Minneapolis-based carrier, with integrated interiors for its fleet of Douglas DC9-30 aircraft. The initial order for 40 aircraft sets is valued at more than Dollars 22m (Pounds 13.4m) with deliveries to commence in May 1995. Northwest has also an option on a further 66 aircraft sets.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Insurers attacked over house premium rises INSURERS HAVE come under attack from the Consumers' Association for increasing house contents insurance premiums by 'staggeringly high amounts'. The latest edition of Which?, the association's magazine, says the cost of house contents insurance premiums has more than doubled since 1987, while house buildings premiums have risen by more than half. Insurance companies have 'bumped up the price of home insurance over the past few years with swingeing increases that more than outstrip inflation - partly to pay for their past blunders', says Which? Mr Simon Hinde, a senior editor, says the increases are 'simply unacceptable. 'Insurers have blundered badly over a long period and are making customers pay for their mistakes. Instead of cutting costs and doing more to fight fraud they're taking the easy way out - clobbering the consumer.' Which? says insurers are 'worryingly reluctant' to cover homes which have suffered from subsidence. Asked if they would insure a house underpinned one year ago, more than three quarters of insurance companies contacted by association researchers refused a quote or said they needed more information. Which? advises consumers to shop around by contacting at least one intermediary. It also says buyers should take care to ensure they are buying the right amount of insurance and not to pay extra for cover they may not need. The association urges consumers not to assume that an insurance policy offered by their building society is necessarily a good deal for them. Companies offering what Which? describes as 'best buys' include Direct Line, for both claims and service on both buildings and contents, Frizzell, best on service for contents policies, and Prudential for claims and service for both buildings and contents. Which? September 1993. Consumers Association, Subscriptions department, PO Box 44, Hertford X SG14 1SH</p>

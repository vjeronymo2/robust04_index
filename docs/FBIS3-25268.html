			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kirundi </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] His Excellency Cyprien Ntaryamira, our  country's president, today made his first trip abroad with a  visit to Tanzania for talks with his Tanzanian counterpart, Ali  Hassan Mwinyi, on the problem of Burundian refugees in Tanzania.  President Ntaryamira left by air this morning and returned this  afternoon. [passage omitted]    The visit of our head of state, His Excellency Cyprien  Ntaryamira, is taking place just after the newly formed  government was reshuffled. Opposition parties rejected the  composition of the first government as inconsistent with  previous agreements. We asked Joseph Nzeyimana of the Rally for  Democracy and Economic and Social Development party, who is now  minister of commerce and industry in the newly formed  government, for his comments:    [Begin recording] [Nzeyimana] I would like to tell those  listening to me that what the child of a king cries for is  always granted by God. That is what happened yesterday. We  fought for peace and respect for agreements. That is what we  got. You know that the head of state promised that he would  form a government to bring Burundians together. We were not  after posts because we already had them. We were not after  wealth. We wanted to be in the government so that we could work  for peace, so that we could fight for those who cannot [passage  indistinct].    [Unidentified correspondent] I want to ask you about the men  and women members of the new government: Do you think you will  be able to understand each other in day-to-day activities?    [Nzeyimana] We will have to understand one another,  otherwise we would be heading for disaster. [passage indistinct]  [end recording]    Another person who commented on the government is the leader  of the Guarantor of the Freedom of Speech in Burundi, Dr.  Alphonse Rugambarara, who is now the minister of youth, culture,  and sports.    [Begin recording] [Rugambarara] The government that has just  been formed satisfies us to some extent because the head of  state and the prime minister noticed that we were not happy  about what [words indistinct]. They have just changed that. We  are happy about this, but there are still some minor problems.  However, if people are willing, the problem will be removed.  It concerns the communal administration. You know that  security matters are dealt with by the Interior Ministry. Many  people have died in this country; they have killed one another.  We must, therefore, be fully aware of who should deal with the  communal administration. Things are still not very clear, but  we think that they will be clarified for us so that we can work  effectively. [passage omitted]</p>

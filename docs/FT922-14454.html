			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Polish finance supremo tries to fill credibility gap: Andrzej Olechowski explains his task to Andrew Gowers FOR a man in the midst of a political baptism of fire, Mr Andrzej Olechowski exudes calm and reassurance. He will need both qualities in substantial measure over the next few weeks. As Poland's new finance minister, in the job for just six weeks, he faces two formidable and interlinked tasks: restoring the country's credibility with the international financial institutions; and persuading its fragmented parliament to accept a budget plan which curbs government spending. It is a twin challenge that ultimately defeated Mr Olechowski's two predecessors: Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland's shift towards a market economy who lost the job as a result of last autumn's elections, and Mr Karol Lutkowski, who resigned over policy disagreements in February. That Mr Olechowski, a 44-year-old former trade official who once worked for the World Bank in Washington, succeeds is vital at a time of increasing worries in the west about the country's ability to sustain the momentum of reform in the face of a deep recession. Mr Olechowski - who looks like the archetypal Polish cavalryman, tall, silver-haired with a bushy moustache - is in no doubt about the scale of the difficulties. 'We are not credible domestically or internationally, and we are aware of that,' he cheerily admits. 'Credibility can only be re-established by acts, not words.' He has already made a start. Six weeks ago the government was in open disarray over economic policy; today Mr Olechowski insists that other ministers are in complete accord with him, and the others - notably Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the planning minister who had been rumoured to be at odds with the previous finance minister - do not disagree. The result is a perceptible improvement both in the government's command over its own finances and in its relations with the outside world. Back in February, the budget deficit seemed to be out of control, the international financial institutions were hovering anxiously in the background, and the World Bank was warning in a report circulated to ministers that there was an 'imminent danger' of hyperinflation unless the government reasserted its grip. Since then, Mr Olechowski has re-established a dialogue with the International Monetary Fund, persuaded the government to accept a budget that will enable negotiations to proceed on a new IMF agreement, and drawn up plans for a rationalisation of state-owned industry and financial system. Now he has embarked on the hard part: an effort to cajole the Sejm, Poland's politically fragmented parliament, into agreeing to the budget - which provides for a deficit of 65 trillion (million million) zlotys (Pounds 2.8bn), equivalent to 5 per cent of gross domestic product - and to the complex legal changes necessary to implement it.  Parliamentary debate on the budget has just begun, and it is far from certain that the vote in a few weeks' time will be positive. Without approval, the government's credibility will be again in shreds, the worries about hyperinflation will resurface, and Poland's prospects of significant financial assistance from west will fade. Even with budget approval, Mr Olechowski knows he will be walking a tightrope. Poland is, he says, already experiencing capital flight to the tune of tens of millions of dollars a month, and he is worried that this figure will grow. If the government's hopes for zero growth in gross domestic product - after sharp falls in 1990 and 1991 - fail to materialise; if growth in wages is not restrained; if Poland fails to secure the external assistance he says it needs to finance the budget deficit - then the alarm bells will sound again. Mr Olechowski's sober approach shows how far the government of the prime minister, Mr Jan Olszewski, has had to change tack since it was first formed last December, promising to get the economy moving again. In effect, he is implementing exactly the same policies that made the last government so unpopular. This time, however, supporters of reform within and outside the country hope Mr Olechowski will succeed where the somewhat remote personality of Mr Balcerowicz failed in communicating the need for realism. Mr Olechowski plans to be less dogmatic than Mr Balcerowicz on the zloty exchange rate. He says that if another 'relatively small' devaluation of the zloty (the currency was devalued by 12 per cent last month) is necessary to maintain Poland's competitive edge, that is what he will undertake. Here too, however, he is constrained by the need to fight inflation, which was 70 per cent last year. Beyond the current difficulties with the budget, Mr Olechowski is anxious to keep the structural reforms initiated by his predecessors, such as changes to the tax system, on track: VAT is to come in at the beginning of next year.</p>

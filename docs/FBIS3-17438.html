			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Russian Economics Minister, </F> Aleksandr Shokhin, in Moscow, 17 Mar]    [Text] Russia's prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  submitted his budget to parliament yesterday, saying the  economic crisis was serious but under control. However, his  economics minister, Aleksandr Shokhin, later told THE GUARDIAN  that without "extraordinary measures" the government would be  unable to get the income needed to make it work.    The latest version of the budget envisages spending 183,000  billion roubles (70.4 billion pounds) and a deficit of 62,400  billion roubles (24.3 bilion pounds), or around 9 per cent of  gross domestic product [GDP]. This is a marginal revision of an  earlier draft, approved last month which talked of a deficit of  "about 10.2 per cent of GNP [Gross National Product]".    In giving these figures, Mr Chernomyrdin rejected the  demands  of the industrial lobby for public spending of 243,000 billion  roubles (93.9 billion pounds). "We cannot afford this," he told  the Council of the Federation the upper house of parliament in a  lacklustre speech.    Mr Chernomyrdin rejected the idea of declaring an economic  state of emergency which he said would eliminate the possibility  of pursuing economic reforms.    But in the corridors after the prime minister's speech, Mr  Shokhin said extraordinary legislative measures would have to be  introduced quickly if the government income foreseen in the  budget were to be realised.    Mr Shokhin said: "January and Febuary showed a decrease in  industrial production of more than 24 per cent and I have to  stress that this is the fifth successive year of decrease. We  have now come to a make or break point. Either the market  mechanism begins to work, or the process of industrial decline  in a very broad scale will produce massive unemployment and the  complete stop of industry, which would only help the most  radical circles in the opposition."    He said the central problem was to get money circulating  again in the Russian economy. Russian companies had stashed  13.4 billion pounds in foreign bank accounts to avoid taxes.    "We have to reassert control of all the money in  circulation," he said. "We need extraordinary measures this  month to get the normal market mechanisms going again. There is  a lot of money in the country's economy but it is not used  according to the rules of a market economy." He did not  elaborate on what amendments would be made to tax or foreign  exchange laws.    At a cabinet meeting yesterday, Mr Shokhin was nominated as  the government's representative on one of five "round table"  groups to represent the executive, the legislature and political  parties. The idea of the round tables was to hammer out a  common accord on the economy, the regions and republics, and  three other problem areas.    After his speech, Mr Chernomyrdin tried to avoid answering  questions from the representatives of the regions in the upper  house. He would only say: "Come and talk to me in the White  House."    When Nikolay Gonshar chairman of the chamber's economy  committee, started speaking of Japan's economic regeneration  after the war, Mr Chernomyrdin broke in: "Don't compare us with  Japan. The Japanese after the last war worked for 17 years  without taking one day off on holiday, whereas our workers  cannot keep sober from one Sunday to another."</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Boeing redesigns 747 part BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer, is close to completing the redesign of a vital component for 747 jumbo jets. A new type of fuse pin used to secure an aircraft's engine to the wing is likely to be available by late summer. The redesign follows two airliner crashes in which Boeing 747s are believed to have lost engines - in October 1992 when an El Al aircraft came down on Amsterdam and the 1991 crash of a China Airlines 747 in Taiwan. According to Boeing, investigations into the cause of the first crash showed that fuse pins may have broken. Inspections have revealed that water droplets, trapped in the tube-shaped fuse pins, could lead to microscopic corrosion, which might develop into cracks. The new fuse pin designed by Boeing is made of stainless steel, which is not susceptible to corrosion. However, the company said that before the pins could be installed in aircraft they had to undergo extensive testing and be certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration. National regulatory agencies will determine whether a retrofit is mandatory or voluntary. There are more than 900 Boeing 747s in operation.</p>

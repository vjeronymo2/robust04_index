			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Clinton talks raise concern on rates: Bond prices fall sharply after Fed chief attends White House meeting on economy Speculation mounted in financial markets yesterday that US interest rates were set for a further rise as President Bill Clinton summoned Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to the White House for talks on US economic policy. Government bond prices in both the US and Europe fell sharply following news of the meeting, despite a White House denial that interest rates had been discussed. The meeting was called at short notice - Mr Greenspan had to cancel a planned speech at a Dallas conference - and came just ahead of Tuesday's meeting of the Fed's open market committee, which sets interest rates. The Fed is thought to believe that further rate rises are needed to cool economic growth, but the White House sees little risk of higher inflation. It insisted that yesterday's meeting was 'routine' and Mr Gene Sperling, a senior White House aide, said Mr Clinton had sought Mr Greenspan's 'analysis of the economic fundamentals'. He said no messages on interest rates had been given or received. Many Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to raise rates either immediately after next week's meeting or in the next few weeks. The Fed may raise the federal funds rate - the cost of overnight money to banks - by a quarter of a point to 3.5 per cent. Some economists believe Mr Greenspan will opt to send a stronger signal by also raising the discount rate, at present 3 per cent, by half a point. The Fed raised the fed funds rate by a quarter point to 3.25 per cent on February 4 - the first increase in short rates for five years. US long bond yields have risen steeply in recent weeks to nearly 7 per cent on the assumption that the February 4 move was the first in a series of tightenings. Although the White House supported the Fed's move in February, it sees little immediate reason for further action. US markets at first reacted fairly calmly to yesterday's meeting, appearing to accept that Mr Clinton had not used it to browbeat Mr Greenspan over rates. However, by the close of trading the 30-year Treasury Bond was more than a full point down, pushing the yield to 6.92 per cent. Broad-based share indices were subdued, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 30.51 at 3,895.65 in a late burst influenced by technical factors. European bond markets had earlier fallen sharply as reports of the meeting intensified fears that US short-term rates were set to rise again. The UK government bond market was hit, but picked up on the news of a floating-rate gilt auction. German and Italian bonds also fared badly. In equities, London's FT-SE 100 rallied in the late afternoon to close 37.6 down at 3,218.1. Falls on continental European bourses averaged just over 1 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index had earlier dropped 4.1 per cent. Any further tightening of monetary policy would be condemned on Capitol Hill. Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House of Representatives banking committee, said the Fed's monetary policy was 'a true abomination'. The Fed was fighting a non-existent inflationary threat and might throw millions of Americans out of work, he said.

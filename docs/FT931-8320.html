			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Records continue to tumble on Wall Street - Why this week's losses on equities were only a natural correction SO FAR, 1993 has been good to the US securities industry, which is quietly confident that this year will prove as profitable as 1992, when every record in the book fell before the Wall Street earnings juggernaut. Since the New Year, two of the main engines of profits growth for securities firms - brokerage commissions and underwriting revenues - have been firing strongly. Trading volumes on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq electronic market have been running at extremely high levels, averaging 267m shares and 259m shares a day respectively. That is 32 per cent and 36 per cent more than in 1992, which was itself a record year for volume. When trading is busy, brokerage commissions blossom. On the investment banking side, Wall Street houses continue to prosper. According to Securities Data in New York, during the first six weeks of this year new issues of straight corporate debt and equity (including initial public offerings of stock) totalled Dollars 66.6bn, compared with Dollars 59.8bn in the same period of 1992. With underwriting business currently running ahead of 1992 - a year when all previous records for securities issuance were shattered - Wall Street's investment bankers are working in top gear, and earning fees to match. The third engine of earnings growth is trading profits, and here the picture is less bright in the wake of recent setbacks in the equity markets, triggered by President Clinton's planned tax increases. The profits firms earn from trading their own positions are driven by the direction of markets. And, while bond prices have remained strong - thanks to low inflation, cuts in the size of government bond issues and confidence in President Clinton's ability to reduce the huge Federal deficit - the main equity indices have stumbled, barely a week after soaring to record highs. The heavy selling of the past few days could prove a problem for securities firms if it presages a significant correction in equity prices. As Mr John Keefe, of Keefe Worldwide Information Services, explains: 'When the market is down, it hurts trading profits because brokers cannot escape their long positions. And, if prices keep going down, people will leave the market.' The latter is the scenario that Wall Street fears most. A feature of the industry's boom has been the return of the individual investor to the stock market, which has had a positive knock-on effect on almost every line of business. It has boosted brokerage commissions; lifted trading profits by keeping prices buoyant; fuelled strong growth in firms' revenues from asset management, because individuals have been entrusting more of their money to professional managers; and provided a huge pool of capital to invest in new corporate stock, thus keeping the underwriters busy. Few Wall Street economists, however, are predicting the stock market will nosedive this year. The run-up in prices two weeks ago was based on confidence in the economic and business outlook. The subsequent downturn was disappointment at the President's plans for tax increases, which investors fear could retard growth. Hence, this week's losses were viewed as a natural correction that is unlikely to turn into a rout. Most forecasters expect the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 to end 1993 with solid gains for the year. Wall Street is also confident that the flows of investor capital into equities will not dry up. Interest rates remain at 30-year lows, which means investors will move their money out of poor-yielding short-term assets, like cash and money-market funds, and into more speculative but higher-yielding assets, like stocks. Unless interest rates rise sharply this year, funds are likely to continue to pour into the equity markets. This will keep commissions buoyant and help sustain growth in the fee-based revenues securities firms earn from managing customers' assets - a relatively new area of business that Wall Street firms have been building up in recent years as a protection against more volatile trading-related revenues. Low interest rates are also good for securities firms in other ways. First, they keep the underwriters busy. In the past two years, US companies, eager to take advantage of low borrowing rates, have been issuing new debt in record amounts. They have also been issuing record amounts of new equity because of strong stock markets and heavy demand from investors. Second, low rates keep down the cost of the industry's raw material - capital. The big firms are particularly good at leveraging that capital and using it to make big profits from proprietary trading. Moreover, if the spread between short and long-term rates remains wide this year, as it has for the past 18 months, then Wall Street will continue to reap profits from borrowing short and lending long. Much, therefore, depends on the interest rate environment remaining favourable. Although rates will probably rise this year as economic growth improves, President Clinton's planned tax increases, coupled with his relatively tough stance on cutting the deficit, plus low inflation, should keep interest rates at levels that are still low by recent historical standards. While the overall outlook for the securities industry is bright, at least one leading firm faces a rocky road. In the recent batch of fourth-quarter 1992 results, Shearson Lehman Brothers stood out with a large loss, incurred in the wake of write-downs for litigation and soured property investments. The problems at Shearson, however, go deeper than possible legal action and ill-judged past investments. The firm's costs, especially its employee compensation payments, have been growing faster than revenues.  -----------------------------------------------   US DOMESTIC CAPITAL-RAISING ISSUES IN 1992  ----------------------------------------------- Manager                            Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------- Merrill Lynch                         91.0 Goldman Sachs                         64.8 Lehman Brothers                       52.5 Morgan Stanley                        43.0 First Boston                          38.8 Salomon Brothers                      27.5 JP Morgan                              9.2 Kidder, Peabody                        8.3 Bear, Stearns                          7.8 Donaldson, Lufkin                      7.4  ----------------------------------------------- Source: IDD Information Services  -----------------------------------------------</p>

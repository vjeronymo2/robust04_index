			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): EC may act over work noise THE GOVERNMENT may face action in the European Court of Justice over the way in which it has implemented European Community laws on the control of noise at work. A directive provides for workers in specific industries to be given periodic hearing tests. However, the European Commission fears there may be delays and difficulties in providing the tests under the National Health Service. The Commission has written to the government saying that UK legislation does not adequately reflect the intention of the directive. The government is considering its response but it is likely that the commission will press ahead with formal proceedings, which could culminate at the European Court in Luxembourg. The conflict has implications for other EC health and safety directives that will have to be incorporated into UK legislation over the next year or two. Regulations relating to the use of visual display units, for example, might prompt similar difficulties. Employers might become responsible for providing eye and hearing tests for some workers. The noise regulations came into force at the beginning of last year and are designed to protect workers from damage to hearing. The number of occupational deafness claims by workers has soared in recent years and companies such as Ford have had to pay millions of pounds in compensation. The Health and Safety Commission, the body that drew up the UK regulations, said it was satisfied that it had done what was necessary to implement the directive. It said: 'Workers, like anyone else, can approach their general practitioners if they're worried about health problems.' A number of trade unions, led by the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers' Union, have alleged since the UK regulations were introduced that inadequate provision had been made for hearing tests.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: The chips are down - A look at the growing controversy surrounding Chile's booming forestry industry When the rain is not lashing down, the noise can be heard quite clearly  - a faint rumbling punctuated by thuds. It is the sound of the Forestal del Sur woodchip plant in the rough-and-tumble town of Puerto Montt, southern Chile, grinding up thousands of logs into chips for export to Japan. It is also the sound of controversy. For of all the sectors of Chile's booming forestry industry - which includes pulp and paper, logs, planks and furniture - it is the woodchip manufacturers that have provoked most ire among environmentalists. Chippers are accused of creating an unsustainable demand for native forests which, say critics, are shrinking daily. Last year, of the Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 800m) earned by forestry exports, woodchips represented Dollars 137m. Most chips, later turned into products such as writing paper, come from native forests. Chile's forestry sector has grown rapidly since the mid-1970s when the government began to subsidise man-made forests. An almost insignificant industry 15 years ago, forestry now counts for 13 per cent of exports, second only to copper. But it was not until the late 1980s that chip exports took off. Jose Augustin Ramirez, law faculty professor at Valdivia University, says the impact has only been felt in the last few years and believes the government must act now to save Chile's woodlands. He says Chileans over-estimate the abundance of forests, which have not yet been properly catalogued. A World Bank-funded study of reserves is not expected to be ready for three years. Ramirez says that 11 per cent of Chilean territory is forested, compared with 21 per cent in the US and 63 per cent in Japan. He favours restricting the industry to man-made forests and banning the exploitation of native trees. Claudio Donoso, professor of forestry at the same university, says a moratorium is 'extremist', calling instead for the strict management of resources using pruning and rotation techniques. Donoso claims that Conaf, the Chilean forestry corporation, lacks the regulatory teeth to control the industry properly. Furthermore, Conaf is responsible not only for the protection of woodlands, but also for their industrial development, a dual function which many critics find perverse. In theory, landowners cannot cut down trees without Conaf permission in the form of a 'plan of operation'. But Donoso is scathing about such plans, describing them as 'absolutely useless - just a licence to cut down trees'. At Conaf in Puerto Montt, Carlos Alberto Ritter, technical department chief, admits that 'plans of operation' are a blunt tool. Conaf technicians agree the plans with landowners using criteria designed to prevent soil erosion, but not on the basis of the rarity or beauty of the woodlands. 'We have no legal authority to say: 'Don't cut it.' In this respect the law is inadequate,' he says. Neither can the small Conaf office in Puerto Montt adequately monitor the vast 10th Region. Given the poor quality of roads, often impassable in winter, Ritter admits that Conaf's 16 staff and fleet of road-weary vehicles are little match for the task. Last year alone, Ritter's office handed out Dollars 1m in fines to 300 landowners caught felling trees illegally. Only 5 per cent has been collected, he says. However, Ritter says that chippers are only a small part of what is an old problem, consuming around 10 per cent of cut wood each year. Sixty per cent is destined for firewood. Mauricio Fierro, an environmental activist, counters that the Chilean chip industry is relatively young. If left unchecked, its damaging effects are likely to spread uncontrollably, he says. Javier Ovalle, manager of the Puerto Montt division of Forestal del Sur, defends his industry's environmental record, saying it is 'entirely feasible to exploit native forest in a sustainable manner'. He argues that responsible exploitation actually improves tree quality by pruning away bad wood, a view shared by some Conaf officials. Forestal del Sur, in common with most chip manufacturers, does not own native forest but supplies its needs by buying wood from local landowners. Critics say this is a convenient way of avoiding blame for any destruction. The company, which takes delivery of wood 24 hours a day, exports 650,000 tonnes of chips a year, earning around Dollars 35m. Ovalle believes most private landowners are managing their forests responsibly, mainly thanks to Conaf's educational drive. 'All of our suppliers have a plan of operation approved by Conaf.' He says that controversy surrounding the use of woodlands, among Chilean and Japanese consumers, means the industry will have to shift towards using wood from plantations. 'This is a shame because you have lost the chance to manage the native forest,' he says. The forestry industry argues that if laws or consumer pressure render forested land uneconomic, owners will simply cut down all their trees and convert land to a profitable activity such as cattle rearing. The controversy over woodchip producers is just part of a broader battle being waged between environmentalists and the forestry industry. Even the owners of Chile's 1.6m hectares of man-made forests - who argue that they have improved the environment by planting pine and eucalyptus - have not been immune from attack. Critics say native forests are often cleared to make way for plantations and that monocultures bring the danger of disease. Much of the debate has been transferred to parliament where legislation to protect native forests has spent years crawling through committees. The eventual bill will probably opt for the controlled use of woodland, allowing a certain percentage of trees to be cut each year. Industrial lobbyists argue that the imposition of onerous restrictions could render their businesses unprofitable, costing thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in exports. Juan Moya, Conaf director, says Chile cannot act as if it were a rich country. It must make use of its resources, he says. On the other side of the debate, Ramirez believes that defenders of woodlands should have spoken earlier and louder. 'The problem with native forests is that if you wait too long, there's nothing left to protect,' he says.</p>

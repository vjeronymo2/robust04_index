			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (3): Roses around the door and a fax on the Welsh dresser - Analysis / 'Teleworking' and the 'telecottage' sound appealing and can be productive.  Claire Gooding examines the issues facing employers and teleworkers who want to benefit from this new way of working DISTANCE is no object for productive teleworkers, be they in a high-technology telecottage, or cosy at home. It's a pleasure to get up in the morning without having to think about what to wear for the office. To spend less time waiting for trains or grinding gears and teeth in a traffic jam makes sense on a personal level but also has wider environmental benefits. It is nearly 20 years since computer companies started talking about the benefits of teleworking. IT companies were particularly well-suited to exploiting the technology of the time. The FI Group, founded as F International, built up its network of programmers initially from women programmers working from home. As the technology developed, computer companies such as Digital Equipment and IBM invested in offices adapted to 'hot desking', a term used to describe the sharing of one desk space by two or more people who work largely from home and go into the office occasionally. Terrorist attacks on city centres provide another powerful incentive for 'outworking.' Digital was up and working within days after its headquarters was gutted by fire in 1990 - a rapid recovery which it attributes to its flexible working patterns, including teleworking. In the past 10 years PCs have become more affordable and the software running on them easier to use. Where a local support team was once a necessity, people can now work with 'sitalone' software: software so self-explanatory that it needs no support or explanation such as on a Macintosh or under PC Windows. On the telecommunications front, there is ISDN - Integrated Services Digital Network - which can support such applications as videophones, split signals (serving fax, voice, modem and so on, on one line) and high-speed data transmission. ISDN telephone lines are beginning to come into service and in parts of Scotland are already part of the telework culture. Companies such as Jaguar Communications of St Albans specialise in providing modems and plug-in ISDN cards for connecting PCs. Telemessaging and electronic mail (e-mail) systems such as British Telecom's Mailbox and the Compulink's Cix remove the constraints of time-barriers. Workers using such mail systems can choose their own working times. Chris Moller of the Home Office Partnership points out that there are several ways of working at home with PCs, modems and fax. 'There are three categories: in the first are employees with formal support for working at home; self-motivated, educated people for whom the job itself is the reward. In the second category are people involved with repetitive, humdrum tasks, such as telesales. Teleworking is less practical for them, partly because it is only the social contact that makes the job bearable. 'The third category is of specialists, largely freelance, doing such jobs as translating. In effect they are free-standing: the work finds them.' Working at home demands the skillswith which any freelance is familiar, and computer skills come low on the list. The first is self-discipline and the second comes under 'marketing.' The National Teleworking Advisory Council (NTAC) is a forum set up to help individuals and organisations exploring teleworking, founded by the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists. 'We're evolving a code of practice, a guide for employees and employers alike,' says chairman Peter Monson. Most non-technical teleworkers, he points out, need help with the basics of equipping themselves, such as printer interfaces, maintenance agreements, telemessage systems, even voltage supply. Sue Blacker, of the Devon and Cornwall Development Co in Lostwithiel, Cornwall, is another NTAC member with a City of London background whose concerns range from the technical (such as scanners versus modems), to the management issues of contracts, pay, and promotion. She agrees that marketing is a difficulty. 'If you give your address as Rose Cottage, it sounds as though you're not up to the job. Why should an employer take the risk if there's a building full of people on the spot who can do it? There are a lot of psychological problems to overcome.' Qualifications are one way for the isolated teleworker to convince agency or employer that work carried out at arm's length can be relied on. Although work on National Vocational Qualifications is under way, it does not remove all the problems, one of which, according to Barney Gibbens, head of the Information Technology Training Organisation (ITITO), is the difficulty of assessing remote trainees. 'We hope there will be assessment centres all over the country, not just set up by colleges, but by large employers, so trainees can visit local centres,' he says. Organisation and Technology Research's much-quoted report in 1991 took the view that teleworking offered benefits to employees, but not necessarily financial. The telecottage movement stresses that it is promoting rural work at urban rates - not second-class workers, paid at a lower rate. There is evidence of a significant change of attitude in recent years. Selling is one well-paid activity that seems to work well at long distance. Unipart is not alone in devolving its sales to home-based workers. Sun Alliance's Adam project, involving 27 home workers, and Marion Merrell Dow, with 88 home-based sales and regional managers, both use the Oxygen system for remote selling. Many companies interviewed for this survey reported a sympathetic, rather than a sceptical attitude to their home base. 'Not so long ago,' said one, 'people on the phone would think worse of you if they could hear the dog barking or the children yelling in the background. Now they say, lucky you, to be able to work at home.' Francis Kinsman, futurist and writer of The Telecommuters, is a great source of entertaining statistics on teleworking, which he sees as part of a wider movement towards flexible work patterns. In his address to the recent European Conference on Distance Working, he quoted the Henley Centre for Forecasting's estimate that 15 per cent of work in the UK will be performed remotely by 1995. In Kinsman's opinion, the UK is well-placed to take advantage of this radical change in work patterns. 'The Highlands and Islands and the Grampian regions, because of ISDN, are aggressively looking to steal Pounds 100,000 worth of financially-based jobs from the south-east over the next decade.' The real emphasis, he said, should be on flexible working and the networked organisation, a model being explored by Tesco, Berkshire County Council, Mercury, and Digital Equipment. According to Kinsman, the 21st century might well become the era of the telescab, with sophisticated information skills coming cheaply from an international marketplace that includes the Philippines, Malaysia, and China. 'The danger is that if we can do it, others can. London Underground tried nine different UK software houses for its new timing system and settled for a developer in Bombay at 40 per cent of the cost. There's a lesson there.'</p>

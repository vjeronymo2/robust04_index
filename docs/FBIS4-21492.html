			<p>BFN     [Text] The government, which will begin providing the  fourth yen-based loan to China in 1996, has decided to give  priority to measures for tackling environmental problems, the  development of inland regions, and projects for upgrading  infrastructures which could serve the people's livelihood. The  government will send a fact-finding team composed of  working-level officials to China on 7 March to survey the  possibility of implementing the projects by area. Based on the  results of the survey, Prime Minister Hosokawa will notify the  Chinese side of Japan's basic plan for the fourth yen-based loan  when he visits China on 19 March. As for the size of the fourth  yen-based loan which has become a focal point, the prime  minister will not present the Chinese side with the size because  of a delay in China's formal request for the loan. The two  countries are expected to continue coordination of their views  on the size for an accord within this year.    The fact-finding team, which will leave Japan on 7 March, is  made up of officials from the Foreign Ministry, the Finance  Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the  Economic Planning Agency, and other officials from the Overseas  Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF). It will examine the  feasibility of about 70 projects presented unofficially by China  from the standpoint of providing the fourth yen-based loan to  China as a "symbolic loan" to finance the projects for  Japan-China cooperation," (according to Foreign Minister Hata).    For the project for tackling environmental problems, a  centerpiece of the fourth yen-based loan, the government is  likely to incorporate aid for measures to tackle acid rain that  would "eventually benefit" Japan. Taking seriously a conspicuous  delay in China's measures to deal with pollution resulting from  that country's rapid industrialization, the government plans to  provide China with Japan's advanced desulfurization facilities  in the fourth yen-based loan that serve to prevent air and water  pollution.    Japan and China are presently studying the possibility of  reviewing China's reform and open up policy that places its  priority on production-related facilities and the development of  coastal regions and of providing preferentially funds for  industrial development in inland regions.    China has asked for Japan's cooperation for construction of  a  Beijing-Shanghai bullet train line and the fact-finding team  will examine the demand for inter-city traffic. The government  plans to continue Japan's aid in the fourth yen-based loan for  priority projects for construction of water supply facilities  and sewages which were implemented under the first, second, and  third yen-based loans to China to help it improve people's  livelihood.    The Japanese Government explains that Prime Minister  Hosokawa  will present the Chinese side with Japan's basic plan for the  fourth yen-based loan, but will not present it with the size of  the loan because China has yet to make a formal request for the  loan following a delay in its domestic procedures and the  failure of working-level Japanese and Chinese officials to  finalize details of the loan.    Japan started providing China with 330.9 billion yen in the  first yen-based loan for 1979-1984 and expanded to 800 billion  yen in the third yen-based loan for 1990-1995. It has been  decided that duration of the fourth yen-based loan will be  shortened to three years out of concern over expansion of  China's military buildup.</p>

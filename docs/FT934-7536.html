			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (1): Owning 'is not really necessary' - Against a background of continuing slow growth, the regulators are posing new pressures on the leasing industry. Also, the government's efforts to lure private finance into public sector projects have not so far borne much fruit THESE ARE turbulent times for the UK leasing industry, one of the less well understood mechanisms for raising finance. Not only are the effects of the recession lingering, but government and regulators are posing new pressures on the sector Leasing's role as a source of financing for assets has long been underplayed. Its origins may be ancient, but it is over the last 30 years that it has developed in the UK on the back of tax allowances for capital investment and the influence of the sector in the US. It provides an important source of financing for equipment and other assets to supplement the equity markets, as well as loans and internally-generated cash for companies, public sector bodies and the non-profit sector alike. Leasing contracts are financing everything from office equipment and cars to heavy public infrastructure projects and satellites. But, as Mr Michael Maberley, director for business finance at Lombard North Central, which provides National Westminster Bank's leasing services, puts it: 'We are a very low profile industry. We need to get up and talk about ourselves more.' According to figures from the Finance and Leasing Association, the leading trade body, last year leasing accounted for Pounds 11.8bn in financing - or some 27 per cent of all UK investment in equipment. By total value, it is most dominant in the acquisition of cars, plant and machinery, and computer and office equipment. It also plays a leading and high profile role in aircraft financing, as well as commercial vehicles and property. Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the FLA and a vice president of Hambros, says: 'Leasing has grown with the realisation that you don't need to own things on your balance sheet to make your business work, that you can separate economic use from economic ownership.' Mr Maberley says: 'If we are seen as direct competition with the banks, we have failed. Leasing provides a structured, term facility linked to the working and earning life of an asset. It is tax efficient, competitively-priced and shaped and structured around a variety of needs.' In spite of the attractions, leasing seems to have suffered disproportionately during the recession. 'We have seen demand pick up a little during the year,' says Mr John Callender, managing director of Barclays Mercantile, optimistically. His view that the worst may be over is shared by others in the sector. Nevertheless, the FLA's latest figures for the first nine months of 1993 show leasing down by 3 per cent to Pounds 5.5bn compared with the same period last year. For September alone, leasing activity amounted to Pounds 813m, against Pounds 874m in September 1992. Mr Maberley puts the decline down to the recession, which powerfully cut back on business investment. While companies may extend existing bank overdrafts during difficult economic times, new investment such as new lease contracts - which the FLA figures highlight - is minimal. He adds that many lessors were also heavily stung by bad debts, and have tightened up credit controls considerably at the expense of new business. Meanwhile, the industry is beginning to lose patience with the government's efforts to lure private finance into public sector projects - the so-called private finance initiative announced in the budget last year by Mr Norman Lamont. Provisional guidelines were issued in May, and there have been meetings with Whitehall officials. This week Mr Kenneth Clarke, his successor as chancellor, affirmed his support for the idea at the Confederation of British Industry's annual conference and announced a working group to tackle the subject. 'You've been hearing about the theory for a year now,' he conceded. So far, little has happened. 'It seems to be difficult to get projects up and live,' says Mr Mallin. 'It is not moving at the rate which was expected. There seems to be a very purist approach by the Treasury.' He highlights the potential in transport and the health care sector, where he believes leasing would be ideal for hospitals seeking to use high-technology diagnostic equipment. There would also be scope among local authorities in waste management and environmental protection. But objections seem to include the way in which the leases can be accounted for, and a traditional resistance to the erosion of public sector expenditure control and accountability. More generally, the leasing companies concede that their industry still has something of an image problem, triggered by the high-profile collapses of a number of their peers such as Atlantic Computers, Blackspur and Court Line; as well as more recently publicity over the financial difficulties at GPA and Tiphook. Lessors have also suffered particularly bad publicity in the last two years as a result of misrepresentations in the photocopier leasing industry - a subject now under scrutiny by the Office of Fair Trading, which is expected to report back shortly. 'A lot of people still have to overcome a desire to own assets. It is amazing how many feel that owning is really necessary,' says Mr Callender. 'The word 'leasing' conjures up unsavoury memories, all tarred with the same brush. Sometimes our reputation is our biggest enemy. We have a responsibility to improve the name and brand image.' Mr Callender adds that the industry is still relatively cumbersome and unresponsive. 'We have to get our act together and move towards understanding the customers' needs and being focused less on the technical side.' The FLA has attempted to tackle the criticisms with its own guidelines: notably some issued last year which called for far greater clarity in lease contracts, with the principal conditions prominently displayed to reduce misunderstandings. It has also held discussions with some of its members to urge them to be responsive to complaints, though it says many calls it receives relate to non-members. Attention in the industry is currently focused on the outcome of an inquiry by the Office of Fair Trading into extending the requirements of the Consumer Credit Act to small businesses and to financing transactions of up to Pounds 30,000. 'We're very keen that the OFT doesn't push government to put any further barriers on business in the small company sector,' says Mr Mallin. He argues that changes in the existing regulations are not favoured by these companies and would be 'totally misconceived'. The leasing industry's hope is that any such recommendations will be overtaken by another of the government's efforts, the deregulation initiative. Other concerns for lessors include the threat of new accounting standards that could jeopardise the advantages to companies of being able to keep off-balance sheet many of their leases. Both the statement of principles and Fred 4, two of the documents issued by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), threaten to bring back all leases onto the balance sheet, dissolving the distinction between finance and operating leases. The FLA, by contrast, argues that far more important is addressing the issue of aggressive income recognition in the accounts of lessor companies, which has been responsible for most of the collapses and financial difficulties. The call has been heard with some sympathy by standards-setters, but it could be many months before the ASB squeezes the topics onto its agenda.</p>

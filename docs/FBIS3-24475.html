			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.A. Dorogochinskaya, L.R. Kochuleva, E.D. </F> Shulzhenko, and A.K. Gumarova, Grozno Petroleum Scientific  Research Institute; UDC 661.61(470.67)]    [Abstract] The following new oils have been discovered in  the territory of the Nogayskiy rayon in Dagestan: Kulinskaya,  Nakazukhskaya, and Rifovaya. From a tectonic standpoint, the new  deposits are all part of the Kum upheaval zone. Commercial oil  deposits have been discovered in the sediments of the Lower  Triassic Kum suite. The newly discovered oils were characterized  as light, high-viscosity, high-congealing, low-sulfur,  high-paraffin oils. The Nazakukhskaya oil was determined to be  resinous and to have a higher coking capacity than the  Kulinskaya or Rifovaya oils. Its yield of gasoline fractions up  to 200C is low (12.7 to 16.9 weight percent), and its yield  of light fractions at temperatures up to 350C ranges from  37.3 to 44.8 weight percent. The new oils' 120-230C  fractions fail to meet the requirements stipulated in State  Standard [GOST] 10227-86 for jet fuels for a number of reasons,  including density at 20C, viscosity at 20C (with the  exception of the Kulinskaya oil), temperature of onset of  crystallization, flash point, and acidity. Their sulfur and  aromatic contents are quite acceptable from a jet fuel  standpoint, however. The heavy kerosene fractions  (150-280C) of the Nazakukhskaya and Kulinskaya oils meet  the requirements set in branch standard OST 3801407-80 for type  KO-20 burning kerosene; the Rifovaya oil is too acidic but may  be used after being made more alkaline. The diesel fractions  (140-320C) of the Nazakukhskaya and Kulinskaya oils meet  the requirements set in GOST 305-82 for L-0.2-40 summer diesel  fuel in all respects expect for viscosity at 20C. Rifovaya  oil meets the said requirements in all ways except for viscosity  at 20C and flash point. The 180-350 and 200-320C  fractions of Nazakukhskaya oil are a good raw material for  producing L-0.2-40 low-sulfur, low-congealing diesel fuel. All  of the diesel fractions have a high cetane rating (58-69) thanks  to their elevated n-alkane content, and the 200-320C  fraction appears to be a good raw material for producing liquid  paraffins thanks to its high n-alkane content (27-47 weight  percent). As a raw material for catalytic cracking, the  350-450C fractions are characterized by a low sulfur  content (0.05-0.11 weight percent) and low coking capacity  (0.15-0.38 weight percent) and by a virtual absence of metals.  The new oils have also been deemed valuable raw materials for  obtaining base-stock oils and solid paraffins with high  indicators. In accordance with branch standard OST 38.011.97-80,  the three new oils have all been given the identical index  1.3.3.1.3. Figure 1, tables 4.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At 0300 on 24 April, routed troops fleeing toward  Treng quarreled and fired at one another, killing or wounding  hundreds. Those who fled toward Battambang did so chaotically to  save their lives.    On the battlefield east of Pailin: On 24 April we swept from  O Kchheay to Chisang and completely controlled the area. We  seized a T-54 tank and a tractor.    Special report: Preliminary results say that at 0020 on 23  April, we launched a special attack against the regimental  position of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed  government in Sdau on Route 10, killing 19 on the spot,  including a major. A number of soldiers were wounded and  dragged back by their colleagues. We seized 10 assorted  firearms. At 0300, their commanders ordered tanks to retake  this position. However, so far no tanks have dared to show up.</p>

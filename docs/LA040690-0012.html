			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAFAT BACKING PERES AS ISRAELI LEADER  </P> <P> PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said Thursday he has asked Arab deputies in the  Israeli Parliament to back Labor Party leader Shimon Peres in his battle to  form a government.  </P> <P> Italian officials said the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, visiting  Italy, told Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti: "I have asked Arab deputies  present in the Knesset (Parliament) to vote for Peres."  </P> <P> The officials said Andreotti urged Arafat to help Peres form a Cabinet for the  sake of peace talks.  </P> <P> Peres has said he is ready to form a government to replace the national unity  Cabinet, led by the Likud Party, which fell last month in a dispute over a U.S.  plan for Israeli-Palestinian talks. Peres backs the plan, while Likud leader  Yitzhak Shamir opposes it. Parliament is expected to vote on the new government  soon.  </P> <P> Arafat is basking in a red-carpet welcome from Italy's top leaders that has  provoked angry protests from Israel and Jewish groups. On Wednesday, those  groups also protested his meeting in Paris with former President Jimmy Carter.  </P></p>

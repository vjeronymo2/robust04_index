			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Toyota to buy Pounds 100m of British parts a year TOYOTA, JAPAN'S biggest car maker, which has a factory near Derby going on stream next week, said yesterday it plans to spend Pounds 100m a year with parts suppliers in the area. The company said it would spend that amount with suppliers within a 50-mile radius of the plant as soon as output reaches 100,000 cars a year. The extent of the planned boost to the local economy surrounding the Pounds 700m facility at Burnaston was disclosed as the identity of some of the key UK and continental European component suppliers to the venture became known. Engines from its Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside, north Wales, are already on stream. Toyota has been reluctant to name its principal suppliers, partly because of the long and complex process involved in setting up its intended long-term relationships with the key companies. Of a total of 160 UK and continental Europe-based suppliers, about half are in the UK. The most prominent among those, it is now known, are British Steel (raw steel supplies), PPG 123 and IDAC (paint), Lucas Industries (electrical components), GKN, Albion Pressed Metal and Camford Engineering (pressings and welded assemblies, and additionally GKN for drive train components), Birkbys Plastics and Plastic Omnium (plastic parts), Rockwell Golde (sunroofs), Tenneco Walker (exhausts), Triplex (glass) and Pirelli and Dunlop (tyres). The components are destined for the Carina E, the upper-medium saloon model that Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) will build at Burnaston and for which there is a target of 60 per cent 'local' - European - content by mid 1993. Toyota intends to lift local content to 80 per cent by mid 1995 as more parts currently under development by UK and continental suppliers are substituted for Japanese supplies. Mr Bryan Jackson, Toyota UK's director of corporate affairs and human resources, said no increase in the number of European suppliers would be involved in reaching the higher European content. Output is expected to reach 100,000 a year in 1994, rising to 200,000 in the late 1990s. Mr Jackson said Toyota was satisfied with its own experience of the UK and continental European components industry in spite of a recent study led by Cardiff Business School that indicated an alarming quality and productivity gap between Japanese and UK motor component suppliers. He said: 'The European supply base is, in fact, very strong and they've shown us that they're dedicated to getting the quality right. 'We're not hiding the fact that at the moment cost levels are higher than in Japan - but our production volumes at the start are sufficiently low that we had anticipated that and we're working with them to get their cost base down.'  ----------------------------------------------- PUTTING TOGETHER BRITAIN'S TOYOTA  ----------------------------------------------- UNITED KINGDOM Steel Paint Electrical components Pressings/welded assemblies Plastic parts Functional body components Interior soft trim Exhaust systems Glass Drive train component  ----------------------------------------------- IRELAND Electrical components Interior parts  ----------------------------------------------- FRANCE Steel Audio equipment Lighting Rubber components  ----------------------------------------------- SPAIN Suspension components Moving engine parts Engine components  ----------------------------------------------- NETHERLANDS Steel Insulation material Plastic  ----------------------------------------------- GERMANY Steel Paint Brake components Engine components Steering components Rolled section (door frames)  ----------------------------------------------- AUSTRIA Seat belts  ----------------------------------------------- MONACO Door handles  ----------------------------------------------- ITALY Castings Wheels Tyres  ----------------------------------------------- BELGIUM Catalytic converters Engine components Audio equipment  ----------------------------------------------- Source: Toyota  -----------------------------------------------</p>

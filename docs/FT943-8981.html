			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Books: Tales from Bollywood - Fiction SHOW BUSINESS by Shashi Tharoor Picador Pounds 15.99, 304 pages INSIDE THE HAVELI by Rama Mehta Women's Press Pounds 7.99, 208 pages These absorbing novels are proof of the imaginative vigour with which Indian novelists are exploring their infinitely varied country. Shashi Tharoor's Show Business is an exuberant expose of India's film industry depicted through the rise and fall of Ashok Banjara, superstar and hero of formulaic song and dance 'masala movies'. 'Bollywood', as the biggest film industry in the world is affectionately known, has always been ripe for parody. Although it has spawned hundreds of artistically thrilling films, these are overshadowed by the mass produced crowd-pleasers, featuring virginal heroines, (doe-eyed bosomy girls adept at the come-hither-but-don't-touch smouldering glance), karate kicking heroes (usually poor noble boys separated at birth from rich but obviously careless families), moustache twirling villains (whose only words of English are 'Bloody Fool]' and 'Bloody Bastard]'). The accompanying songs feature lyrics which would make a Song For Europe sound complex. All these stock characters appear in Showbusiness as planets orbiting around Ashok's sun. As we follow his rise from budding hopeful, whose father's political connections get him his first minor role, to fully fledged superstar with the obligatory leading actress-cum-mistress in tow, these supporting players continually interrupt Ashok's telling of his own fantastic story. Then something rather strange and wonderful begins to happen; the supporting players begin to outgrow their roles and challenge our hero's perceptions of himself, and of them. Tharoor cleverly interweaves first person narrative with hilarious reconstructions of the films and it soon becomes clear that not only are these people more complex than their apparent roles (for example, the leading film villain is the most decent man in the book), but that all of them harbour painful secrets which reveal Ashok to be a sham. Tharoor pulls focus constantly like a mischievous camera man, all the while drawing parallels between this unique film culture and India herself. Are these movies opiates for the masses, radical tracts which encourage the dreamer to act, or as Tool, the guru, declares, perfect examples of the Hindu notion of time, that is: 'endlessly repeated variations on a few basic themes . . . ?' Rama Mehta's Inside The Haveli is a reflective novel in which a newly-wed bride, Geeta, educated and outgoing, arrives at her husband's ancient family home, the haveli, and finds she is suddenly in purdah and forced to live within the traditional confines of a 500-year-old joint family system. Women must always be veiled and are not allowed to cross the courtyard into the men's separate quarters. Mehta's sensitive attention to detail pulls the reader in, reluctantly at first maybe, until you realise with a shock that you are undergoing the very process of adaptation which underlines the protagonist's journey. Geeta is an outsider, the first wife not to have come from another haveli, Bombay-educated, and therefore already marked by the other women as a possible rebel who could undermine a way of life they have upheld for generations. And the reader rebels with her at first, chafing at the apparent banality of the servants' chatter and the rigid formality of Geeta's interaction with her family, every liberal tendency yearning for her escape. But as Mehta gradually creates a world which invests the smallest detail with great emotional resonance, the nameless servants become rich and rounded characters, and Geeta's in-laws change from rigid icons into dignified, proud people whose traditions seem to offer protection and continuation rather than subjugation. By the time the two babies born at the beginning of the book have become young women Geeta, like us, is not so sure that she wants to escape. Mehta brings immense understanding to a way of life that we realise by the end of the book is rapidly vanishing and her deceptively simple prose is invested with such tenderness that the reader's initial knee-jerk reaction against the haveli is replaced with something approaching admiration. The novel is a poignant illustration of the complex struggle between progress and continuity and of its painful cost in human terms. Rama Mehta herself was the first woman to be appointed to India's foreign service, and was forced to resign upon marriage. Individually, these two novels trumpet talent; together, they are a startling reminder of how progressive chic and urban corruption exist side by side with unquestioned traditions, and how chasms separate the lives of those individuals who share the label Indian.

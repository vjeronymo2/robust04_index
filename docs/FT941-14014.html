			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Consumers more optimistic in poll British consumers are more optimistic about the economic outlook although on balance they still expect unemployment to rise this year, Gallup, the market research group, says. In its monthly survey for the European Commission, Gallup found that consumers were less worried about their own financial position in spite of the tax increases announced in the November Budget. Although a majority still expect their own financial situation to deteriorate over, the answers on household finance were the most positive for four months. The number of pessimists outweighed optimists by 12 percentage points compared with 18 points in December. Gallup polled 2,035 adults between January 6 and 18. As is often the case in January, when the sales are in full swing, there was a sharp increase to 44 per cent in the number of consumers declaring that the present was a good time to make a large purchase. On balance, the number of people favouring a large purchase exceeded those saying that it was the wrong time to buy by 19 percentage points - 15 points higher than in December. The survey found people equally divided over whether the economy would strengthen this year. The resulting zero balance was 9 points up on that of December and the most positive since September last year.</p>

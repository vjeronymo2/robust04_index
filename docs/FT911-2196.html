			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / CBI cautious about timing of economic recovery THE OUTLOOK for UK manufacturers is improving but it is too early to talk of a recovery, according to a survey published yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry. It paints a mixed picture of the prospects for the factory sector, indicating that business confidence is still declining although at a slower rate than during the early stages of the recession. Manufacturers continue to believe that low demand will lead them to reduce output over the next few months. But the number projecting a fall has fallen substantially since the previous large CBI survey in January. While order books, prospects for employment and the number of companies working below capacity all point to a weak economy, the CBI said that the results from the survey were compatible with the prospect of an economic upturn in the second half of the year. It could not be more precise about the timing. The CBI survey is repeated every three months and is among the most widely monitored indicators of future demand levels in the UK economy, Manufacturing accounts for less than a quarter of UK output but the health of many other sectors - including services - depends on it. Publication of the survey sparked skirmishes among the main political parties. It was seized on by ministers as support for their forecast that the economy would begin to emerge from the recession during the second half of the year. However, as the campaigning for tomorrow's local elections entered its final stages, Labour accused the Conservatives of wrecking manufacturing industry with a 'classless recession'. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, said unemployment was hitting all sectors of the economy, all parts of the country, and all types of workers. The Liberal Democrats said the light for manufacturing was 'at the end of a very long tunnel'. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said that business optimism was 'starting to change dramatically' and that the economy would follow this trend. In Washington for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings, Mr Lamont admitted that the survey did not signal the end of the recession. He said, however, that the outlook for exports and orders was 'improving markedly' and the outlook for manufacturers' prices and inflation was excellent. One good piece of news for the government from the survey concerns inflation. The poor demand in Britain means that fewer companies expect to increase the prices of their goods for domestic sale than at any time for the past 23 years. The survey repeated the bleak tone of recent soundings about investment. The CBI expects that capital spending in manufacturing industry will decline by 19 per cent between the third quarter of 1990 and the same period of this year.

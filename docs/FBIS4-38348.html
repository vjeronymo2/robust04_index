			<p>BFN     [Text] The second round of negotiations between government  delegations of Russia and Ukraine on the problems of the Black  Sea Fleet will begin in 10-15 days in the Ukrainian capital,  acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Yukhym Zvyahilskyy told  journalists upon his return from the meeting in Moscow.    Summing up the meeting, he said: "We did not win in Moscow,  but neither did we lose. The talks were very nervous and tense."    "We were trying," he said, "to find options of positive  solutions in fulfilling the tasks set by the president of  Ukraine. We made concessions, but not those which would make  Ukraine lose its wealth and independence."    Zvyahilskyy believes that a generally positive solution was  found to the problem of separate deployment of the Black Sea  Fleet and Ukraine's navy. Sevastopol will be the main Russian  naval base in the Black Sea, while Ukraine's navy will be based  in Balaklava and Donuzlav.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 10 May 1994 broadcasts the 10-minute  prerecorded series "Details," which is devoted to Russian-German  relations in the context of Yeltsin's 11 May visit to Germany.  Announcer Sergey Dorenko asks: "Why is Yeltsin going there?  What do the Germans want from him?" After reminding viewers  that the Germans have problems of their own to deal with,  without being too concerned about those of Russia, Dorenko  focuses attention on the fate of Chancellor Kohl. He says:  Most people think he will lose the October elections, so maybe  Yeltsin is going to talk to a lame duck. Perhaps the visit is a  waste of time.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who then appears on  screen, disagrees: "If we are talking about the figure of  Chancellor Kohl himself, I should not be in any hurry to say  that there is bound to be a change of leadership in October. We  are nowhere near the elections yet. Before the elections, there  is still the G-7 meeting. Before the elections, there is still  the troop withdrawal, which is to be not only a line drawn under  the past, but also the definite start of something in our future  relations. So there is plenty to work on before October."    In any case, as Dorenko points out, Yeltsin will be able to  meet Kohl's possible successor. He will be talking to members  of the opposition. This was, in effect, confirmed by Kozyrev,  who says: "We always meet representatives of all parties --  always."    The main bone of contention at the moment is the question of  how the Russian troops will take their leave of Germany.  Presidential adviser Dmitriy Ryurikov says: "The troop  withdrawal and the farewell to the troops is a very important  symbol, a symbol of the great period that is coming to an end  and a symbol of what we hope will be the still more significant  period that lies ahead. So, such symbols must be very carefully  thought out and fine-tuned, and they can be discussed.  President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl will have enough time for  discussion. Probably both for the Germans and for the  Europeans, a troop withdrawal and a farewell to the troops in  Berlin is the most understandable symbol."    Dorenko then reminds viewers that the Germans wanted the  farewell to the Russian troops to take place 350 km from Berlin  [in Weimar] and a week before saying goodbye to the Western  allies in Berlin.    General Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of  Forces, is not happy, Dorenko says, but is prepared to give way.  As Burlakov puts it: "We will take part in the function, but,  of course, if you like, maybe with a slight feeling of  bitterness in that we cannot carry it out properly."    Dorenko then suggests, over video of Russian troops loading  their equipment on to a train, that a compromise had been worked  out, but no one was saying anything so as not to steal the  leaders' thunder. "The compromise will be that the ceremony will  take place in Berlin, but still earlier than the other allies,  because the mechanics were worked out in Gorbachev's time, and  Yeltsin won't be able to do anything about that legacy from  Gorbachev."    In a further sequence from the pre-recorded interview with  Kozyrev, Dorenko asks the foreign minister: "Is that scenario  already being discussed, or are they preparing for you to arrive  angry and then, you know, they will suddenly step aside while  you charge on into empty space?"    Kozyrev replies: "No, I don't think they want us to arrive  angry. They want there to be very serious summit talks. It is  very important to sense what your partner is thinking. It is  very important to understand your partner's logic, not just your  own truth, but to see the other person's truth."    The final topic is that of the G-7 group. Was it on the way  to becoming the G-8, with Russian participation? Although  Russia's economic situation is far removed from that of the  Germans, maybe the neighboring Germans would be able, after the  summit, to explain to the distant Americans exactly what was  going on in Russia. "That is the real benefit that we can  derive from the visit," Dorenko comments.    Kozyrev reappears and says: "We have a sufficiently advanced  understanding on that subject with our partners, which has been  expressed in the fact that a Russian representative has been  invited to all stages of the preparatory process of the  discussion of these political issues. In other words, it is not  only the president who will work in an eight-leader format, but  also, already at the preparatory stage, a group of eight experts  on quite a high level are essentially at work, and they are  preparing all these issues for discussion. I think that this is  a very significant step toward turning the G-7 into the G-8."    Dorenko's final point is that no Russian officials have  spoken to the program about economic cooperation, although it is  of great concern to the Germans. When speaking to him earlier,  Dorenko says, a group of German businessmen poured scorn on  Russia's investment tax. "Imagine that you are a German," he  cited one as saying, "and you are investing $100 million in  Russia. For that piece of folly, you will also have to pay $32  million to the state. Meanwhile, President Yeltsin will almost  certainly, as he did two years ago, urge representatives of  business circles in Germany to come to our country with their  money," Dorenko concludes.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Severn River up 27% Severn River Crossing, which is building a privately financed bridge via a UK/French consortium with John Laing-GTM Entrepose as main contractor, yesterday announced pre-tax profits up 27 per cent from Pounds 6.14m to Pounds 7.78m in the six months to June 30. The cable-stayed bridge over the River Severn, one of the largest construction projects in the UK, was started in April 1992 and the company said recently that it was on schedule to be completed in spring 1996. In June this year the company sacked 700 construction workers after a 24-hour strike over pay. Work on the Pounds 300m bridge between England and Wales stopped for a week but the workers were later re-hired. The company, which took over the running of the existing Severn Bridge, has attracted criticism over the tolls being charged. Turnover for the period was Pounds 18.72m (Pounds 16.41m) and the net profit Pounds 6.81m (Pounds 4.71m) after a reduced tax charge.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 11 May (NA) -- Argentine Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo said here that Chile will meet the requirements  to join Mercosur [Common Market of the South] as of January 1995.    Cavallo voiced his desire that Chile join Mercosur, together  with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as of the first  day of next year, when the common foreign tariff will be  established by the member countries.    Cavallo believes Chile is "much closer to a trade agreement  than four years ago," when President Patricio Aylwin's  government was seriously against an integration process.    The Argentine minister made this statement yesterday during  the seminar "The Southern Cone Dialogue," held in this city and  attended by ministers and officials of countries of the region.    The Argentine official said Chile "can no longer doubt the  Argentine stabilization process," that turned out to be even  "more effective" than the one implemented in Chile, which is  currently governed by Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei.    Regarding Brazil, Cavallo mentioned a lack of "political  decision" to implement reforms like the Argentine convertibility  plan, because "growth can only be attained with stability."    Moreover, he said that Chile must recognize the progress  made  by Argentina in the field of the deregulation, infrastructure,  and free trade rules that were one of the obstacles for a trade  agreement.    "Chile should prefer Mercosur to NAFTA," said Cavallo,  referring to the Chilean Government's intention to join NAFTA.    Today Cavallo is scheduled to visit the Mining Fair where  more than 1,000 leading companies in the world in the mining  field will exhibit their goods.    He will visit the fair accompanied by Mining Secretary  Eduardo Maza and Jorge Escobar, the former San Juan governor and  current national deputy, who accompanied Cavallo to Chile.    The governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Peru,  Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela will exhibit at the  fair.    Cavallo will later meet with Chilean President Eduardo Frei,  with whom he will discuss joint economic projects.    Cavallo and Frei will thoroughly assess the possibility of  Chile joining Mercosur during the first meeting between the new  Chilean president and a top ranking Argentine Government  official.</p>

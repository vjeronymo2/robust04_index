			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LA JOLLA MAN ARRESTED AFTER WIFE FOUND BURIED  </P> <P> Police on Friday unearthed the skeletal remains of a woman buried behind a  Canoga Park home early Friday, and later arrested her husband, a La Jolla man,  for murder.  </P> <P> Acting on a tip, authorities uncovered the remains from a 3-foot deep pit in  the backyard of a single-family residence in the 20600 block of Sherman Way.  </P> <P> Swanston said authorities believe the remains are those of Deborah Lynn Hardy,  31, who lived at the residence with her husband and two daughters until her  death, estimated as either late 1985 or early 1986.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Hardy, 46, was taken into custody without incident late Friday at a La  Jolla apartment he shared with the couple's two children. He was booked without  bail on suspicion of murder and was transported back to Los Angeles to face  charges, detective Rick Swanston said.  </P> <P> Authorities said they believe Hardy beat his wife to death with a flashlight  during a domestic dispute.  </P> <P> Hardy never filed a missing person's report on his wife and instead told those  who inquired that his wife had abandoned the family.  </P> <P> Swanston said Hardy's 22-year-old daughter apparently learned of the slaying  sometime after the death. Charges were not being sought against her, although  she did not notify police of the killing, Swanston said.  </P> <P> Tests should be able to positively identify the remains within the next two  weeks, he said.  </P> <P> "The Coroner's Office will positively identify the skeleton, but it is our  belief they are most likely the remains of Deborah Lynn Hardy," the detective  said.  </P></p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / EU chides Norway on whaling Norway has yet to 'grasp an outstretched hand' extended by the European Commission which could bring a compromise over the country's highly controversial whaling policy, a major sticking point in European Union accession negotiations, a Commission official said in Oslo yesterday. Mr Laurens Brinkhorst, director of DG11, in charge of the Commission's environmental affairs, suggested a way around the issue - should Norway join the EU - would be to allow its whalers to continue culling of the minke whale for a two-year period, after which the policy would be reviewed. However, neither member states nor Norway seem prepared to accept the Commission's suggestion. Norway last May announced that it would allow killing of minke whales in defiance of an eight-year ban by the International Whaling Commission. 'The Commission is trying to stretch out a hand to Norway but it is not being grasped,' Mr Brinkhorst said.</p>

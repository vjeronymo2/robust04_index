			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Public is the beneficiary of local government review Sir, Your editorial demands a response. The review is about improving local government. It seeks to create councils that serve district communities, overcome the widespread confusion about which tier of local government does what, and ideally produce savings in the process. That unitary authorities will overcome confusion is irrefutable. The Local Government Commission itself calculates that significant savings will often be possible. And, in Buckinghamshire, like many other areas, there is overwhelming support for change. The review must, therefore, be completed.

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BAe acts to calm fears over Saudi project BRITISH AEROSPACE yesterday attempted to calm City fears that all was not well with negotiations for the second phase of the Al Yamamah defence project in Saudi Arabia on which the group's future heavily depends. This phase is estimated to be worth up to Pounds 2.5bn to BAe and the contract already provides substantial cash flow for the cash-hungry group. City concern was reflected in a 10 per cent drop in BAe's share price last week in the first two trading days of 1992 at a time when the market was rising sharply. BAe said of the Al Yamamah contract: 'Talks are going very well indeed and we expect it will not be long before we hear about some future business.' Fears were sparked because last October Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi ambassador to the US, said firm orders for the Pounds 10bn contract were on their way to British contractors and that the second phase of the Al Yamamah contract would be agreed by the end of the year. 'The City has been taking far too literally Prince Bandar's comments about signing by the end of 1991,' BAe said last night. 'Nobody is insisting on exact timing with a contract as complicated as this one.' The second phase follows the Al Yamamah contract signed between the Saudi and British governments in 1973. BAe's share price last week was also affected by comments reported in a private note circulated by Nomura, the Japanese securities house, made by Sir Peter Levene, former head of Britain's defence procurement and now in charge of the London office of Wasserstein Perella, the US buy-out specialists. According to Nomura, Sir Peter delivered a 'pretty bleak analysis' of BAe's prospects. Apart from discussing the Al Yamamah contract, Sir Peter also referred to reports that the Germans would pull out of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme. BAe last night pointed out that the Pounds 4.5bn EFA programme was totally funded up to and including the production phase and none of the partners could withdraw. BAe, which is investing Pounds 1.8bn for a one-third share of the work, pointed out that the Royal Air Force remained 'totally committed' to the EFA project.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sanofi Winthrop takes control SANOFI WINTHROP, a joint venture between Elf Sanofi of France and Sterling Winthrop of the US, has bought control of Chinoin, the Hungarian pharmaceuticals company. Sanofi Winthrop gained control through a purchase of 11 per cent of the shares of the Hungarian company. It had held 40 per cent of the shares since 1991. Chinoin is Hungary's second largest pharmaceuticals company. In 1992 it reported sales of about FFr611m (Dollars 104m) and post-tax profits of FFr311m. Sales in the first half of 1993 increased by about 30 per cent to FFr370m, compared with the same period last year. Sanofi Winthrop is an alliance between Elf Sanofi, the pharmaceuticals arm of the Elf oil group of France, and Sterling Winthrop, a division of Eastman Kodak of the US. Elf Sanofi said that the increased stake in Chinoin was in line with Sanofi Winthrop's policy of expanding its presence in eastern Europe. Rhone-Poulenc, the French pharmaceuticals company, plans to cut the workforce of its French fibres operation by about a quarter by the end of 1995. The company said that 522 jobs would be lost from a total workforce in France of about 2,000. All but 75 of those affected will take early retirement or be found jobs in other divisions of Rhone-Poulenc. A spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc Fibres blamed the job losses on the difficult conditions in the fibres market. He said that the company, which principally manufactures nylon and polyester, had suffered losses as a result of a sharp decline in prices and increased competition from eastern Europe and south-east Asia producers.</p>

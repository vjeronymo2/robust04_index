			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> SHOPTALK;  </P> <P> THE RETURN OF SUNDERLAND-HEALE  </P> <P> ONE-OF-A-KIND hand-painted china, hand-painted and woodblock-printed fabrics,  and woodcuts are manufactured by Lesley Sunderland and husband Jonathan Heale  in their home in Wales. It is literally a cottage industry: Sunderland "bakes"  paints on the luxurious cotton drapery fabrics in her AGA oven.  </P> <P> Their wares are now on display -- and for sale -- at Wilder Place on Melrose in  the first Sunderland-Heale show in four years. During that time, they worked  almost exclusively decorating a private residence in England.  </P> <P> Their china pieces, made from Wedgwood china but dishwasher-safe, include tea  sets, jugs, coffeepots and bowls. Prices run about $70 for a soup bowl, $200  for a coffee pot. The fabrics, sold by the yard for $375 to $400, are described  as Fortuny-like, neo-baroque or contemporary Renaissance. Some fabrics are  first "streaked" with paint, giving them an antique look, then block-printed  with abstract or floral designs and finally embellished with gold. Other  fabrics depict trees or animals. All of them would look right at home draping  majestic beds in castles -- or framing great Southern California views. "Their  stuff is very special," says Wilder Place owner Jo Wilder. "They don't follow  trends."  </P> <P>  Wilder Place, 7975 1/2 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 655-9072.  </P> <P> JUDITH SIMS  </P></p>

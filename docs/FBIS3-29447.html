			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 18 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Discussing what Japan should do in view of the  breakdown in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, a senior  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] official  said on 17 February: "We should review and augment the Five  Year Economic Plan for a Better Quality of Life and the 430  trillion yen plan for public investment by this fall, and  clarify our position from the next fiscal year." He indicated  that Japan should clearly manifest its efforts to reduce the  trade surplus through the expansion of domestic demand in order  to win the understanding of the United States.    The official also touched on the ratio of the current  accounts surplus to GNP (2.8 percent) in the government's  economic forecast for fiscal 1994, saying: "If we can come up  with a figure for the ratio of the surplus to GNP in the process  of reviewing the economic programs, we will be able to predict  the course of the Japanese economy from fiscal 1995." He, in  effect, suggested that Japan should draw up a voluntary plan for  reducing the current accounts surplus. This was the first time  a senior government official has referred to the need to set a  macroeconomic target. Such a remark seemed to represent an  effort to meet U.S. expectations by setting a "voluntary target"  at the macroeconomic level through the inclusion of a ratio for  current accounts surplus in Japanese economic plans.    However, the senior official stressed that this ratio "is  absolutely a voluntary figure to be shown to the people; it is  not a target to fulfill for the United States."    Last July, at the beginning of the framework talks, the  United States demanded the setting of macroeconomic numerical  targets, such as the ratio of current accounts surplus, but  Japan refused. This eventually led to an agreement to draw up  "objective criteria" in specific sectors, such as automobiles  and auto parts, and so forth.</p>

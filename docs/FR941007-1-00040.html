			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is proposing to require the use of a key to activate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cutoff device. This would make the device simple and easy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use, but still require conscious thought and deliberate action on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the part of the user. The agency is proposing use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ignition key to ensure that the driver of the vehicle is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person most likely to activate the cutoff device, and thereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize the likelihood of accidental activation. This approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is similar to that used in Standard No. 118,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Power Operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Window, Partition and Roof Panel Systems <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to ensure the safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of electrically operated devices. NHTSA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on mandating the use of the ignition key.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA requests comments on other means that would guard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against the inadvertent deactivation of the air bag, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoiding the possible complexity or inconvenience of the ignition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> key based approach. Examples of other means include a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> key from the ignition key, ``keyless'' entry technology responding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to personal identification numbers, the use of ``protected''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> switches that require removing or re-positioning a special safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cap in two or more steps, or other such devices. NHTSA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider all comments regarding the means to deactivate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger air bag, and will adopt the most practicable approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible which is consistent with the philosophy that the device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be as simple and easy to use as possible, consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal of preventing inadvertent deactivation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Air Bag Reactivation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is proposing to require that manual cutoff devices be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed so that, once the cutoff device has been used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deactivate the air bag, the air bag will remain deactivated until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is manually reactivated. Mandating manual reactivation would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that once an air bag has been deactivated for the safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an infant being transported in a rear-facing child restraint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the front seat, it would remain deactivated for subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trips with the child. NHTSA is concerned, for example, that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it instead allowed a manually deactivated air bag to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically reactivated, motorists making stop-and-go shopping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trips with infants might forget, after making one of their stops,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the air bag has been automatically reactivated and needs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be manually deactivated again. The infants would then be at risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the vehicles were involved in crashes that deployed the air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bags.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, the agency is concerned that the air bag  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be operational whenever it is needed by a non-infant occupant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an attempt to ensure that air bag protection would be ready  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when needed, NHTSA also proposes to require a yellow warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light which would be clearly visible to the driver and any adult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger (see Section D, Warning Light, below). It would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illuminate the words, ``AIR BAG OFF,'' whenever the air bag has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been manually deactivated. This warning light would serve as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reminder that the cutoff device should be reset whenever the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle is no longer carrying an infant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The UFSAR is defined as ``a revision of the original FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] containing those original pages that are still applicable plus new replacement pages.'' By letter dated October 14, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.71(e) that would eliminate the requirement to resubmit those original pages of the FSAR that are still applicable when submitting the UFSAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee has maintained the FSAR current since the original FSAR submittal in 1978 to the present by issuing amendments to the FSAR, which contain new replacement pages, approximately every three months. The licensee has committed to maintain the FSAR using this process until the issuance of the UFSAR. The final amendment to the FSAR, containing only replacement pages, would convert the FSAR to the UFSAR. The amendment to convert the FSAR to the UFSAR would be submitted by February 2, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 50.71(e) requires that licensee submit, within two years of receiving an operating license, a UFSAR that contains the original FSAR pages that are still applicable and new replacement pages. The purpose of this requirement is to assure that the Final Safety Analysis Report is updated to contain the latest material developed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station FSAR is approximately 7,500 to 8,000 pages of text and tables, and 1,500 to 2,000 sheets of figures. As the licensee has maintained the FSAR current by frequent amendments, the vast majority of this material does not require revision and the number of new replacement pages associated with the UFSAR submittal would be relatively small. Thus, the CPSES FSAR meets the intent of 10 CFR 50.71(e) for issuance of the UFSAR because it contains the latest material developed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, an exemption is warranted since the licensee has maintained the FSAR in a manner that is consistent with the underlying purpose of issuing the UFSAR in accordance with 10 CFR 50.71(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed exemption affects only the size of the UFSAR submittal and does not affect the risk of facility accidents. Thus, post-accident radiological releases will not differ from those determined previously, and the proposed exemption does not otherwise affect facility radiological effluents, or any significant occupational exposures. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption does not affect plant nonradiological effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no measurable radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption, any alternatives either will have no environmental impact or will have a greater environmental impact. The principal alternative to the exemption would be to require that the licensee submit the original FSAR pages that are still applicable with the UFSAR replacement pages. Such an action would not enhance the protection of the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of resources not considered previously in the Final Environmental Statement for Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, dated September 1981, and Supplement dated October 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Contacted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request. The staff consulted with the State of Texas regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. On the basis of the environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated October 14, 1993, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the University of Texas at Arlington Library, Government Publications/Maps, 701 South Cooper, P.O.

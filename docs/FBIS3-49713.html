Speaking at a press conference after top Visegrad Four (the  Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) representatives  met with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday in Prague,  Meciar said that Slovak arms production could not compete with  that of NATO's, given, among other things, the existence of two  military systems in the past.    Slovak heavy weaponry is of good mechanical quality, while  its electronic systems are improving, Meciar stated.    Slovakia's arms production dropped in 1993 to 8 to 9 percent  of its 1989 level. This is a huge decline, which cannot be  called conversion to peaceful purposes. The conversion should  represent a change of 5 percent a year, Meciar stressed.    The present situation in the Slovak arms industry is due to  bad decisions by the former Czechoslovak Federal Government,  which halted the final production of arms without regard to  continuing supplies, which mostly came from the Czech Republic.  This resulted in billion losses, Meciar said. He stressed that  the Czech Republic was now striving to revive the production of  military systems, which had been halted in Slovakia.    A joint-stock company with state participation, aimed at  exporting Slovak arms, has been founded in Slovakia. A  commission has also been set up to decide on each deal, Meciar  concluded.</p>

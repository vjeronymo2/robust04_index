			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Guess Owners Sue Jordache Agents: The Marciano brothers, owners of Guess Inc.,  filed suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles charging that representatives  of the Nakash brothers, who own rival Jordache Enterprises, conspired, among  other things, to plant false information about criminal activity by the  Marcianos with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The suit, which  seeks more than $90 million in damages, alleges that Octavio Pena, president of  a security firm called Lynch International, and Sally Godfrey, a Nebraska  lawyer who posed as a free-lance writer under another name, were promised a  $1-million bonus from Jordache if they succeeded in persuading the Marcianos to  settle. The suit also names Robert Spiegelman, a Jordache attorney. Pena said  in a telephone interview that the allegations were false; others named in the  suit could not be reached.  </P></p>

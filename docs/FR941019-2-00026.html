			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The draft guidelines had no comparable discussion. Some commenters maintained that a time limitation on reportable emissions reduction projects was necessary, particularly because under the guidelines reporters may separately report emissions and emissions reductions. These comments indicated that the statutory language of section 1605(b)(1)(A)(i) providing for 1987 through 1990 as baseline years for emissions reporting implied that emissions reductions reporting under section 1605(b)(1)(B) was limited to reductions occurring after 1990. Reductions occurring before 1991 would be reportable only for their effect on emissions reported for the baseline years, rather than separately as emissions reductions projects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the statutory language on reporting emissions reductions is not explicitly tied to any specific year or years, and the years 1987 through 1990 are referred to as the baseline period, DOE is persuaded that goals of the reporting program are best served by limiting reports of emission reduction projects to new emissions reductions after 1990. Many emission reduction projects have multi-year or multi-decade lives; without a time limitation, the database would include the emissions reductions results of older activities more appropriately reflected within emissions reporting rather than highlighted separately as emissions reduction projects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Direct and Indirect Emissions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reporting program covers activities which directly or indirectly result in greenhouse gas emissions or emissions reductions. DOE has revised the text of the General Guidelines to clarify the distinction between direct and indirect emissions in order to assist reporters in identifying the distinction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters supported limiting the program to submissions of data on direct emissions, and to activities that directly produce or reduce emissions, in order to provide clarity in the program's database. Other comments supported the draft's inclusion of activities that indirectly impact greenhouse gas emissions, based on the statutory listing in Section 1605(b)(1)(B) of activities which indirectly affect, or may indirectly affect, emissions or reductions. Additionally, many comments evidenced confusion over the draft's discussion of direct and indirect emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE agrees that the statutory listing of activities which indirectly affect emissions, as well as activities that directly affect emissions, supports the inclusion of both direct and indirect emissions in the reporting program. DOE also agrees that these concepts are potentially confusing. To assist reporters in identifying direct and indirect emissions, DOE has revised the text of the General Guidelines. It is apparent from many of the comments that this confusion was largely created by intertwining the concepts of primary and secondary effects of an activity with the concepts of resulting direct and indirect emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, DOE has eliminated the distinction between primary and secondary effects of a project, leaving a single concept of ``effects''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Primary and Secondary Effects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on comments expressing confusion over the concepts and the draft guidance for the inclusion of both primary and secondary effects in project analysis, the final guidelines have eliminated the distinction. While the concepts are still presented in Section GG&hyph;5.9, the reporter is urged to consider and report the known and quantifiable ``effects'' of a project without regard to whether they are primary or secondary. To provide additional clarity, the final guidelines also present examples of different types of effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

This laser diode and detector, which can be  provided with multimode and single-mode fiber optic connector  modules having international-standard interfaces, are ideal for  long-wavelength fiber optic trunk lines, LANs, fiber optic  microwave subcarrier-wave (SCM), fiber optic cable TV,  convergent-control radar signal fiber optic distributors, and  many other applications. For interested manufacturers,  investment costs to build a production line with an annual  output of 100,000 laser diodes and detectors is about 30 million  yuan, and annual output value is about 100 million yuan.</p>

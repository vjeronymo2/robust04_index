			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH CONCERNS IN DUMP DEBATE  </P> <P> Our solution to dealing with trash in the San Gabriel Valley is by rail hauling  of trash. We must dump our trash in rural areas instead of urban disposal  sites. By dumping in heavily populated areas, we are gambling with  comprehensive suicide. We must agree with the mayor of Azusa's statement, "The  dump site could always be removed, but our water supply cannot be moved."  </P> <P> Today, the water table under the San Gabriel Valley has been recently found to  be contaminated with 30% of 150 square miles of water being polluted. The Los  Angeles County Medical Assn. rendered the medical opinion that the Azusa dump,  with its 400% expansion directly over the water table, is a health hazard.  </P> <P> The City Council is divided on the issue of opposing its expansion. Mayor  (Eugene F.) Moses and Councilman (Stephen J.) Alexander have opposed the  expansion, while Councilmen (John R.) Dangleis, (Anthony) Naranjo and (Harry)  Stemrich are for the expansion of the dump, supporting Browning Ferris.  </P> <P> This giant waste-disposal firm has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in  campaign contributions to elected officials. Special-interest money hurts local  residents by encouraging decisions that are harmful to the public, and puts  money into the pockets of the greedy, the rich and the unconcerned. Special  interests are like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde sucking the blood out of our  citizens and feeding themselves while at the same time they are claiming they  are acting in the public interest.  </P> <P> If the truth be known, the special-interest landfill giants desire to let the  public be damned, while they reap large profits. Everything that pertains to  our health, does not concern them.  </P> <P> We should even be more concerned, considering that we are in the middle of a  water shortage. Mayor Moses and Councilman Alexander have been criticized and  insulted because of their stand against the expansion of the dump. They have  always had the support of the people of Azusa, along with many residents of  surrounding cities in the San Gabriel Valley. Keep up the fight to protect our  water supply, and a well-deserved pat on the back for your good work so far.  </P> <P> RONALD J. LEGAULT  </P> <P> Azusa  </P></p>

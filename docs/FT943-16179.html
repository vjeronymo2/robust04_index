			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Bulgaria beat Mexico in penalty shoot-out Bulgaria are through to the quarter-finals for the first time in their history after beating Mexico in a penalty shoot-out at Giants Stadium, New Jersey, yesterday. The game finished 1-1 after 30 goalless minutes of extra time. Bulgarian striker Stoichkov gave his side the lead with an unstoppable left-foot shot in the 7th minute only for Mexico to equalise within 11 minutes. Kremenliev was adjudged to have fouled Alves in the penalty area, allowing Alberto Garcia the chance to score from the penalty spot. The match was halted for over five minutes midway through the half when Mexican defender Bernal became tangled in his own net, damaging the support. In the second half, Kremenliev and Mexico's Luis Garcia were both sent off for second bookable offences as the game drifted towards extra time. The first three penalties were missed, but then Guentchev, Borimirov and Letchkov scored for Bulgaria and only Suarez hit the target for the Mexicans. Bulgaria now play Germany on Sunday.</p>

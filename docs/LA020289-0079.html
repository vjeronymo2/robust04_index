			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LATINO ADVOCACY GROUP CONDEMNS BORDER DITCH, FEES  </P> <P> A Latino advocacy group chose a highly symbolic spot -- the pedestrian entrance  to Mexico in San Ysidro -- to add its voice to the chorus of opposition to two  recent border proposals: the construction of a ditch along the border in San  Diego County and the imposition of a fee for visitors entering the United  States.  </P> <P> "This is outrageous," said Jose Castillo, South Bay representative for the  Mexican American Political Assn., a statewide group. "Next thing you know,  they'll want to put up a moat with alligators. . . . We don't need another  Berlin Wall."  </P> <P> Castillo and other group leaders spoke during a news conference at the San  Ysidro port of entry, just a few feet north of the metal revolving doors that  lead pedestrians from the United States to Mexico. It is also the spot where,  each day, U. S. immigration authorities return hundreds of Mexican citizens to  Tijuana after arresting them as illegal aliens in the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Latest Among Critics  </P> <P> The proposed 4 1/2-mile ditch, which would be built in the relatively flat Otay  Mesa area, is designed to cut off a specific portion of that undocumented flow  -- those who arrive aboard the up to 450 vehicles that U. S. authorities say  cross the border illegally each month. The ditch, which authorities say could  be in place by the end of the year, is also designed to cut down on drugs  smuggled by vehicle.  </P> <P> The Latino group is the latest in a series of critics to ridicule the ditch and  entrance-fee plans, which have generated controversy on both sides of the  border. Although the ditch idea has drawn the most criticism, a proposal to  impose fees on visitors from south of the border is being eyed warily in San  Ysidro, a community long dependent on shoppers from Mexico. Merchants fear that  such a tariff would drastically reduce expenditures.  </P> <P> "It would really hurt us," said Bertalicia Gonzalez, a San Ysidro businesswoman  who appeared at the news conference.  </P> <P> The proposals for entry fees -- $2 for cars -- have emerged in Washington. U.  S. Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) has said he plans to introduce legislation  proposing the creation of a somewhat smaller fee, which would be used in part  to enhance border security and reduce waiting time at ports of entry.  </P> <P> A private, Washington-based study group, the Federation for American  Immigration Reform, has also unveiled proposals for an entry fee. The group has  also proposed a series of more extensive barriers along the border.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denounced as Extremist  </P> <P> Many critics, including those who gathered in San Ysidro, have denounced the  FAIR group as extremist, far right-wing and anti-immigrant. Nonetheless, the  group, which denies charges of racism, is said to be close to policy-makers  within the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> The Latino leaders who spoke Wednesday suggested that it is shortsighted to  assume that a wide-ranging socioeconomic problem such as illegal immigration  can be solved with barriers and entry fees. Rather, they suggested that U. S.  officials put more emphasis on assisting Mexico's economy, a strategy they  contend would eventually eliminate the need for Mexicans to cross the border in  search of livelihoods.  </P> <P> "A ditch is not going to solve anything," said Tomas Sanchez, a student  representative for the Mexican American Political Assn.  </P> <P> As for drug smuggling, the Latino leaders, like officials of Mexico and other  Latin American nations, pointed their fingers north: The drug traffic would  lessen immediately, they said, if the U. S. demand for such products  diminished.  </P> <P> As the representatives spoke into the microphones and the news cameras rolled,  dozens of curious Mexican citizens passed by on their way to the revolving  doors that lead to Tijuana, often stopping to listen to the denunciations.  </P> <P> "A ditch is not going to stop people from crossing the border," said a  22-year-old Tijuana resident who gave his name as Jesus. "People looking for a  better future will always find a way to cross."  </P></p>

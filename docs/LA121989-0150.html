			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> GOVERNOR'S WIFE EXPECTING BABY  </P> <P> For the first time in almost a century, there will be the patter of little feet  in the Mississippi governor's mansion. Gov. Ray Mabus and his wife, Julie, are  expecting their first child in July.  </P> <P> "I'm so excited I've been about to pop," said grandmother-to-be Lucille Mabus  of Ackerman.  </P> <P> The announcement is making this a special season at the 145-year-old mansion.  </P> <P> "I've never seen them light up so much," said spokesman Lori Freeman. "The  staff is happy. We feel like this is the best Christmas present ever."  </P> <P> The 40-year-old governor said he doesn't have his heart set on a Ray III or a  Julie Jr. "I just want it to be a healthy child," Mabus said Monday.  </P> <P> Elbert R. Hilliard, executive director of the state Department of Archives and  History, said Monday that the only earlier reference to a baby being born to a  sitting governor and his wife goes back to the turn of the century.  </P> <P> The governor and Julie Hines, 37, were married on Jan. 3, 1987, in Jackson.  </P></p>

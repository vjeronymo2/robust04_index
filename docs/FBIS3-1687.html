			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Four Serb warplanes,  which were bombing a Muslim munitions factory, were shot down  today by NATO jet fighters enforcing a U.N. ban on military  flights over Bosnia, according to the REUTERS news agency.    The action marked the first Western military intervention in  the 22-month-old conflict in Bosnia, and NATO's first combat  action since it was founded in 1949.    NATO said two U.S. F-16 fighters first warned and then shot  down four Galeb light attack aircraft early this morning near  Banja Luka, the main Serb air base in northern Bosnia.    U.N. sources in Zagreb told REUTERS the Serb planes had  apparently attacked a Muslim-controlled ammunition factory in  central Bosnia shortly before they were downed.    NATO said the two U.S. F-16s had taken off from an Italian  air base on a patrol mission to enforce the U.N. no-fly zone  over Bosnia, which has been in effect since last April.    The U.N. ban was aimed at preventing the Bosnian warring  factions from using aircraft in the conflict. There have been  some violations, mostly by helicopters flying short trips, but  NATO had not taken action against them.    Hours after the downing of the planes, Bosnian Serb forces  began heavily shelling the center of the Muslim stronghold city  of Tuzla, where the U.N. wants to reopen the airport for aid  flights.    Meanwhile, the U.N. has suspended aid flights to Sarajevo  and  has cancelled convoys through Serb-held areas of Bosnia.    NATO did not carry out threatened air strikes against Serb  forces after the February 21 deadline passed as the Serbs  complied with NATO's demand that their heavy weapons be  withdrawn from around Sarajevo, or be placed under U.N. control.    However, a U.N. official said today that the Serbs had  driven  at least six tanks out of the exclusion zone in violation of the  NATO ultimatum and the U.N.-brokered ceasefire agreement with  the Muslims.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> Occidental Coach Bill Harvey is wary of crediting one athlete for the success  of this year's team, but it is difficult not to notice the Tigers' No. 1  runner.  </P> <P> Beltran, a junior transfer from Fullerton Junior College, led Occidental to a  seventh-place finish in the Fresno Invitational on Sept. 15 and helped the  Tigers to a convincing double-dual meet victory over Redlands and Pomona-Pitzer  last Saturday.  </P> <P> He finished ninth in Fresno against a field of predominantly Division I runners  and smashed the five-mile course record at Redlands with a time of 26 minutes  59.7 seconds.  </P> <P> "He's certainly a very good runner and very experienced," Harvey said of  Beltran, a native of Mexico and the national junior college record-holder in  the marathon (2:17:26). "But there's a lot more to his life than running. He's  a very fine student and a highly motivated one.  </P> <P> "School's going to come first with him no matter how he runs."  </P></p>

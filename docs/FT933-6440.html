			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / GRE rises to Pounds 65m at half-year on higher premiums GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the composite insurer, yesterday provided further evidence of the recovery in the general insurance sector. Rises in premium rates and a fall in claims on UK motor insurance and other policies helped it post pre-tax profits of Pounds 65m for the first six months of 1993, The figures compared with a loss of Pounds 39m at the same stage last year. After investment gains, which GRE included in its profit figures for the first time in line with prospective European reporting requirements, pre-tax profits were Pounds 307m, an improvement of Pounds 299m. The interim dividend was increased to 2.65p (from 2.5p). Mr Sid Hopkins, chief executive, said the figures 'demonstrated a strong recovery' and showed that the business had responded 'positively to a series of firm corrective measures introduced during the last two years'. Because of its efforts to reduce exposure in sectors where it believes pricing is inadequate, GRE has sacrificed share in some markets. It now insures about 700,000 UK motorists compared with 1.25m at the end of the 1980s, for example. Explaining the group's decision to change its accounting treatment of investment gains, Mr James Morley, finance director, said: 'Investment is such an integral part of wealth generation for an insurance company that it is entirely misleading to leave it out of pre-tax figures.' GRE's improvement has been based on a turnround in the UK with underwriting losses falling from Pounds 125m in 1992 to Pounds 40m in 1993. GRE reported a Pounds 7m underwriting profit on its householders and private motor business, compared with a Pounds 40m loss last year. Overall worldwide written non-life premiums increased to Pounds 1.36bn (from Pounds 1.14bn). Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 85m from a loss of Pounds 178m. Investment income amounted to Pounds 165m (from Pounds 154m) and realised and unrealised gains were Pounds 242m (from Pounds 47m). Interest expenses and investment expenses were Pounds 16m (against Pounds 18m), leaving total gains of Pounds 391m of which Pounds 253 was attributed to the group's non-life operations and Pounds 128m to corporate investment. Net assets rose to Pounds 1.4bn by June 30 from Pounds 878m. The group's solvency ratio (net assets as a percentage of non-life premiums) was 55 per cent at end-June. Lex, Page 14</p>

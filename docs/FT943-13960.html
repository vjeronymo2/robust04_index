			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exemption from tax I am a British citizen who has moved to Monaco for one full tax year. I have a few investments that I would like to realise while overseas. The main ones are offshore roll-up money market funds and zero coupon or deep discount bonds. It was my understanding when I bought these that my liability would be to income tax when I sold them (assuming that I was resident in the UK). Are these taxable, bearing in mind my non-resident status? Write to the Inland Revenue, Financial Intermediaries and Claims Office (International), St John's House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside L69 9BB, (or to your last UK tax office) and ask for a copy of the free booklet IR 20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the UK). You will see from the booklet that if you are outside the UK for the whole of the 1994-95, you will be exempt from income tax on income (including capital gains treated as income) from sources outside the UK for this year. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

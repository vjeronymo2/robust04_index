			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OLAJUWON GETS QUADRUPLE-DOUBLE IN WIN  </P> <P> Akeem Olajuwon, who had the third quadruple-double in NBA history with 29  points, 18 rebounds, 11 blocked shots and 10 assists, might have gotten an  assist from the official scorer Saturday night.  </P> <P> Olajuwon, who has been criticized for not passing enough, never before had more  than seven assists in an NBA game. He picked a perfect time to reach double  figures in assists.  </P> <P> "I might do it more often," Olajuwon said after leading the Houston Rockets to  a 129-109 victory over the Golden State Warriors.  </P> <P> The achievement of reaching double figures in four statistical categories was  somewhat tainted, however, when the original boxscore showed Olajuwon with nine  assists. The number was changed to 10.  </P> <P> Nate Thurmond of Chicago was the first to accomplish a quadruple-double with 22  points, 14 rebounds, 13 assists and 12 blocked shots on Oct. 18, 1974. Alvin  Robertson, then of San Antonio, had 20 points, 10 assists, 11 rebounds and 10  steals on Feb. 18, 1986 against Phoenix.  </P> <P> "Olajuwon had a very special game. It seemed like every time we had someone  going to the basket on a drive, he was there to block the shot," Warrior Coach  Don Nelson said.  </P> <P> Golden State, which has lost eight of its last nine games, was led by Chris  Mullin's 23 points.  </P> <P> Houston used a 25-6 run to take a 48-38 lead with 4:25 remaining in the first  half. The Rockets outscored the Warriors, 34-13, in the quarter.  </P> <P> "The second quarter was the story of the game," Nelson said. "It was  devastating. Some games are decided in the last two minutes. This one was  decided in the second quarter."  </P> <P> Olajuwon had eight points during that stretch as the Rockets extended their  lead to 60-45 at halftime.  </P> <P> New York 106, Milwaukee 105 -- Patrick Ewing scored 31 points and Charles  Oakley had 11 of his 23 in the fourth quarter for the Knicks in Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Maurice Cheeks scored on a pass from Ewing to give the Knicks the lead for good  at 102-101 with 39.3 seconds to play.  </P> <P> After the Bucks called a timeout, Oakley grabbed a rebound and was fouled by  Ricky Pierce. Oakley converted both free throws and Trent Tucker and Ewing  added one each, the last making it 106-102 after a free throw by Milwaukee's  Mike Dunleavy.  </P> <P> Jay Humphries finished the scoring with a three-point basket for Milwaukee.  </P> <P> New Jersey 114, Atlanta 109 -- Sam Bowie had 25 points and 12 rebounds and  Purvis Short scored 12 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter as the Nets ended  a four-game losing streak and halted Atlanta's five-game winning streak at East  Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> Short broke a 104-104 tie and gave the Nets the lead for good when he made two  free throws with 1:41 remaining.  </P> <P> Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins led all scorers with 36 points and has 80 in two  games.  </P> <P> Sacramento 104, Charlotte 103 -- Antoine Carr's two free throws with 23.5  seconds left capped a 6-0 run that gave the Kings a victory in Charlotte.  </P> <P> The Hornets led, 103-98, with 1:25 to play when Randolph Keys made one of two  free throws. But Sacramento's Wayman Tisdale made two turnaround jump shots to  pull the Kings within one before Carr converted the decisive free throws.  </P> <P> Washington 132, Orlando 128 -- Bernard King had 34 points and Washington scored  five points in the final 14 seconds of regulation, then went on to win in  Orlando in double overtime.  </P> <P> King and Ledell Eackles made critical three-point shots in the final 51 seconds  of regulation to help the Bullets overcome a six-point deficit in the final 55  seconds.  </P> <P> Utah 112, San Antonio 98 -- Karl Malone scored 36 points and John Stockton had  22 points and 20 assists to lead the Jazz in Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive game that Stockton had 20 or more assists and the  18th 20-plus game of his career.  </P> <P> Denver 106, Dallas 89 -- Michael Adams scored 13 points in a six-minute span of  the first half, lifting the Nuggets in Denver.  </P> <P> Adams finished with 15 points. Alex English scored 24 points for Denver. Sam  Perkins scored 16 to lead Dallas, which played without 7-footers James  Donaldson and Roy Tarpley because of injury and illness.  </P> <P> Portland 110, Seattle 98 -- Clyde Drexler scored 20 points to lead six Trail  Blazers in double figures at Portland.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers took the lead for good late in the first quarter, but Seattle  stayed close until Portland scored 11 consecutive points for an 84-67 lead with  10:52 left in the game. Seattle got no closer than eight after that.  </P></p>

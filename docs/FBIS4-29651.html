			<p>BFN     [Text] The federal government will not issue work permits  to British companies involving themselves in the Kelantan  government under the water supply privatization project in the  east coast state. Rural Development Minister Annuar Musa said  this was because the ban on British companies is still in force  and the state government's need to have dealings with British  companies contradicts the federal government's policy.    Speaking to newsmen in Kota Baru, he said the state  government's decision to have joint ventures with British  companies did not violate any law since such dealings were  within its jurisdiction. But the issuance of work permits came  under the purview of the federal government.    Encik [Mr.] Annuar said that Kelantan's (?new) deal on the  privatization project fatefully has raised doubts.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Police seek more powers to combat terrorism SENIOR police officers stepped up their calls for wider powers and greater resources to fight terrorism yesterday as a series of arrests were made in connection with Saturday's bomb, which devastated a wide area in the heart of the City of London. But the government refused to be pushed into a wholesale review of its anti-terrorist policy in spite of concern in Westminster and Whitehall. Downing Street said the government was determined to resist playing into the terrorists' hands with a 'knee-jerk' reaction. Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, said: 'It is the duty of us all to show that this kind of campaign will never succeed.' Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday that a warning of a 'heightened threat' was circulated to police the day before the City bomb. It refused to disclose any details though forces throughout the country were reportedly put on alert. Yesterday, up to 20,000 City workers were either unable to work or were relocated in temporary offices with only the barest facilities. Some of the banks and other businesses worst affected by the blast had to take up space in the offices of their competitors in order to get back to work. Nevertheless, the Corporation of London, the City's local authority, declared its efforts to get people to work were a success, with 'more than 90 per cent' of City workers able to carry on as normal. Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, said he wanted the government to change the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to give police greater flexibility to search vehicles on suspicion of terrorism. His comments were echoed by senior Metropolitan police officials. Police believe the act lays them open to civil action in cases where a road check does not lead to a conviction. 'We think there is a case for relooking at that legislation. It does reduce our effectiveness,' Mr Kelly said. Mr John Major, the prime minister, did not respond to the comments, but said London had given its response in opening financial markets: 'Today in the City it's business as usual.' Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, emphasised his determination to tackle terrorism but said there could be no guarantee against further bomb attacks on the UK mainland. Last night, police were trying to establish a connection between those arrested - described as fewer than 10 men and women - and the weekend bombs. The anti-terrorist squad said two men were seen hurrying from the tipper truck containing the bomb, but the witness failed to get a clear view of them. Police were also studying video film from police traffic cameras and an office security camera for clues. Although the images were not of sufficient quality to identify the bombers, they confirmed that the bombers' vehicle had been parked in Bishopsgate before 9am on Saturday. Lord Inchyra, director-general of the British Bankers' Association, said the effect of the latest bomb would be to 'increase insurance premiums, but hopefully not to the extent that people will say the City is uncompetitive'.

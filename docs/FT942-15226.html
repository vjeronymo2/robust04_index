			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Land Rover to create 600 jobs Land Rover, the division of the Rover group, is increasing production by 8 per cent and creating 600 jobs at its Solihull plant in the West Midlands. The company, the leading European manufacturer of four-wheel drive sports and utility vehicles, is increasing output of its Discovery range by 14 per cent. The Discovery is being launched in the US this month and is expected eventually to quadruple Land Rover's US sales. Output is being raised in response to the US launch as well as to meet rising demand in the UK and in several other smaller Land Rover markets worldwide. Rover, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, expects Land Rover production to reach a record 85,000 this year. The previous production peak of 68,621 was reached in 1990. Output rose last year by 19 per cent to 68,159 from 57,332 a year earlier. Land Rover increased its workforce by 600 last year and introduced a second shift at its Solihull plant in the autumn. The further 600 jobs, to be added this spring, will raise the Solihull workforce to more than 9,000. Output of the Discovery is to be raised from 1,050 to 1,200 a week from the beginning of May. Total output, including the Range Rover and Defender ranges, will be increased from 1,800 to 1,950 a week. Land Rover expects sales of the Discovery in the US to total more than 6,000 this year and more than 10,000 in a full year. US sales of the Range Rover and Defender ranges rose by 16 per cent to a record 4,907 last year out of total worldwide sales of 73,527. In the autumn the company is launching a new generation Range Rover, which will become the group's flagship luxury four-wheel drive vehicle.</p>

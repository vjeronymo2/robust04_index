			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / France closes the gap on Germany: The main talking point in European bond markets Only a few months ago, international currency speculators were gunning for the French franc, marking it out as another weak currency which could be forced either to devalue within the European exchange rate mechanism - as the peseta and escudo did - or to float free of the system, like the pound and the lira. However, the recent resilience of the franc has enabled the Bank of France to cut official interest rates nine times in two months, prompting a rally in the bond market which has narrowed the spread between French government bond yields and their German counterparts. Now the big talking point in European government bond markets is whether French long-term interest rates will slide below those in Germany. The 10-year yield spread over German bonds has fallen back almost daily to reach new historic lows. That the French government bond market has outperformed the German one recently reflects the relatively better state of the French economy. 'France is sliding into recession, but Germany is much worse off. France has a strong government whereas Germany's political situation only deteriorates. French inflation is 200 basis points below German inflation, and although French bond issuance will hit record levels this year, the fiscal mess is awesome in Germany,' says Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international economist at Midland Global Markets. There are still plenty of investors who expect to see the French bond market rally continue over the short-term. Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed income at Gartmore, says: 'We feel further headway is possible, and that 10-year French yields will be the same as, or even lower than, German yields in six months' time. Mr Tim Swadling, a portfolio manager at AMP Asset Management, believes 10-year French yields will 'probably push through to 10-15 basis points below German ones'. But the next big question is whether French yields will remain below German levels for any reasonable length of time. Mr Swadling does not believe so. 'We've been underweight in the core European markets - Germany, Belgium and Holland - and we've cut back from being overweight in France to neutral because the potential is not so great there now.' There is already some evidence that investors are reassessing their asset allocations. Some are taking profits in France and switching into German bonds in maturities of up to seven years in order to pick up the higher yield. 'This is a sign that investors expect French rates to remain below those in Germany,' points out Ms Owens Thomsen. However, she believes that a slight pick-up in French inflation will, in the longer term, prevent French 10-year bonds from durably trading through German bonds. Mr David Gibson, managing director of Schroder International Fixed Income, predicts that 10-year French yields will go through German yields and that this will be sustainable 'until it is perceived that Germany has resolved its (economic) problems'. Mr Kit Juckes, economist at SG Warburg Securities, points out that France has been able to cut interest rates aggressively because of confidence in the franc and the fact that 'the D-mark is so out of favour at the moment. 'The French economy urgently needs low short-term interest rates, but whether the French can indefinitely continue to cut to below German levels without stirring up a hornet's nest is doubtful.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "State Education Commission and </F> Shanghai Municipal Government To Cooperate In Building Three Key  Universities"]    [Text] According to a discussion meeting held in Shanghai  yesterday afternoon by the State Education Commission and the  Shanghai Municipal Government, after repeated consultations and  discussions, the State Education Commission and the Shanghai  Municipal Government signed a document yesterday according to  which both sides have decided to cooperate in developing Fudan  University, the Shanghai Communications University, and the  Shanghai Foreign Language University.    After the meeting, Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai  municipal party committee; Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju; and Chen  Zhili, deputy secretary of the Shanghai municipal party  committee, met with Zhu Kaixuan, minister of the State Education  Commission, who had come to inspect work in Shanghai. Both Zhu  Kaixuan and Shanghai Vice Mayor Xie Lijuan spoke at the meeting.    Of the nearly 50 universities and colleges in Shanghai, 28,  or more than half of them, are under the jurisdiction of central  departments or commissions. These universities and colleges have  made important contributions to Shanghai's economic and social  development. Of course, in the course of their development,  these central-department- and commission-run universities and  colleges have met with new problems. To explore new reform  paths, gradually remove the barriers between different  departments or regions, strengthen local governments' right to  make overall plans for universities and colleges, and give  stronger support to the development of universities and colleges  under central departments or commissions, the State Education  Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Government have decided,  as a result of investigations and coordination over the past  year, to make the three key national universities under the  commission -- Fudan University, the Shanghai Communications  University, and the Shanghai Foreign Language University --  pilot universities for conduction an experiment in "joint  development."    The major features of "joint development" are:    After "joint development," the three universities will still  be under the State Education Commission, but a dual leadership  will be introduced for them. The original investment channel  for the three universities will remain unchanged. The State  Education Commission will continue to provide funds for  administrative expenses and capital construction, including  special appropriations and subsidies, to the three universities,  and it will increase investment according to the ratio of  ownership of the three universities.    Beginning this year following the signing of the contract,  the Shanghai Municipal Finance Department will provide a sum of  "joint development" subsidies to the three universities every  year. In case the three universities want to hire highly  trained professionals from other countries or from other parts  of the country, relevant municipal government departments will  give them the same treatment that they give other local  universities and colleges in the following areas -- residence  quotas, reductions and exemptions of urban development funds,  and land requisition.    In accordance with the requirements for Shanghai's economic  and social development and for reforming and developing the  three universities, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the  State Education Commission will decide some "joint development"  projects for the three universities each year. For example, in  the near future the municipal government will continue to help  Fudan University to develop its department of postgraduate  studies and establish a biology and medicine base; help the  Shanghai Communications University to establish a  Chinese-foreign joint venture facility for training high-quality  managerial personnel; and help the Shanghai Foreign Language  University to improve its management and to accelerate the  training of foreign-language personnel.    The State Education Commission will support the three  universities to gradually enroll more students from Shanghai and  increase the proportion of graduates remaining in Shanghai to  work.    The State Education Commission will support the three  universities to take advantage of their trained personnel and  science research facilities and to take part in developing  Shanghai's new high-tech industries including automobile  engineering, modern telecommunications, computers, and  bioengineering. When drawing up or revising its economic and  social development plan, Shanghai will include the development  of the three universities in its general urban development  program.</p>

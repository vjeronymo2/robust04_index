			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEC SEEKS A ROLE IN PROCEEDINGS ON DREXEL BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> In an unprecedented move, the Securities and Exchange Commission attempted  Thursday to intervene in Drexel Burnham Lambert Group's bankruptcy proceedings,  claiming that the federal agency is Drexel's largest creditor.  </P> <P> The claim stems from Drexel's settlement of civil and criminal charges last  year, in which the firm agreed to establish a $350-million fund to be used to  pay judgments in civil suits filed by private parties as a result of Drexel's  admitted illegal activities. Drexel still owed the fund $150 million when it  filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Feb. 13. The SEC said Drexel also  owes an unspecified amount for taxes on interest that the fund earned from the  money already paid in.  </P> <P> In papers filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, the SEC demanded a  role on Drexel's creditors committee. Richard A. Kirby, an SEC lawyer, said  this is necessary to make sure the SEC's interests in receiving payment are  taken into account in whatever plan is eventually worked out to pay creditors.  </P> <P> Kirby said one SEC concern is to ensure that Drexel assets weren't improperly  dissipated in the months immediately before the bankruptcy filing. Members of  Drexel's creditors committee, formed Tuesday, have made it known that they also  are concerned about reports that Drexel paid out large bonuses and may have  made other payments to senior executives shortly before the filing.  </P> <P> "The SEC and any creditor has a concern if there has been money paid by the  debtor improperly," Kirby said. A. Robert Abboud, chairman and chief executive  of First City Texas Bancorporation, was elected chairman of the creditors  committee. First City has already filed papers demanding that an examiner be  appointed to look into payments to executives, among other issues.  </P> <P> The SEC had asked for full membership on the creditors committee. But after a  court hearing Thursday, Kirby said the agency may be willing to settle for  non-voting, ex officio status provided that it could attend all meetings and  participate fully. A court hearing on the subject is scheduled for Tuesday.  </P> <P> Kirby said the SEC had never before attempted to gain membership on a creditors  committee in a bankruptcy case. But he said the move was made necessary by the  amount of money still owed under Drexel's settlement.  </P> <P> The SEC's claim is the largest made public so far. But it is expected that  claims comparable in size may yet emerge, including one by former Drexel junk  bond chief Michael Milken, who is said to be owed at least $100 million by  Drexel and possibly up to twice that amount.  </P> <P> Drexel hasn't paid Milken for the Drexel stock he turned in, as required, when  he resigned after his indictment on racketeering charges last year. The firm  also didn't pay him his bonus for 1988 and his salary for 1988 and 1989.  </P> <P> Milken himself made no attempt to get on the creditors committee, according to  Neal Mann, the assistant U.S. trustee who selected the committee members.  However, sources close to former Drexel employees said one committee member,  Sylvan Schefler, a former Drexel managing director, is a close friend and  confidant of Milken and may unofficially represent his interests on the  committee and act as a conduit of information to Milken about steps the  committee is taking.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Schefler confirmed that he speaks frequently with  Milken. But he emphatically denied that he was representing Milken's interests  on the committee. Schefler said he was named to the committee because he is  owed more than $5 million by Drexel, from stock he turned in that was converted  into subordinated debt. He said he represents himself and a group of other  former Drexel executives in a similar position, but he said the group doesn't  include Milken.  </P> <P> A Milken spokesman refused to comment on what steps Milken will take in the  bankruptcy proceedings. But he also denied that Schefler will act on Milken's  behalf.  </P> <P> In Washington on Thursday, Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board  told a House Judiciary subcommittee that the Fed's decision not to step in to  prevent Drexel's bankruptcy appears to have been vindicated. The calm,  post-Chapter 11 reaction by the stock and bond markets "tends to validate the  judgment that the failure of Drexel, while a tragedy for the many involved, did  not present undue risks to the orderly functioning of the financial system or  the economy," Greenspan said.  </P> <P> In response to a question from Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), Greenspan said the  Fed became aware of Drexel's crisis only about a week before the bankruptcy  filing. He said the Fed and other federal agencies intervened only to the  extent of monitoring the situation to see that Drexel's problems didn't spill  over to involve other firms or the securities markets in general.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Oswald Johnston in Washington contributed to this story.  </P></p>

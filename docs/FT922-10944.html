			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Leif Hoegh improves to NKr135m in first quarter LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, has improved 1992 first quarter net profit by NKr40m to NKr135m and forecasts profits of NKr350m (Dollars 20.9m) for the year as a whole. The shipowner also announced that it is restructuring its tanker business by establishing an independent tanker management company, Bona Shipping. Bona, based in Oslo, is expected to be operational from the fourth quarter. Leif Hoegh said that it is seeking partners and investors for tanker activities. 'An independent international shipowning company, incorporating Bona Shipping, will be established as these activities expand,' it said. The company added it would eventually reduce its equity ownership stake in such a company to less than 50 per cent. Bona will take over the management of Leif Hoegh's existing fleet of 10 Panmax ships as well as two double-hulled Aframax tankers contracted for delivery in 1993 and 1994. The move would leave Leif Hoegh with a 25-strong fleet comprising liquefied natural gas (LNG) ships, car carriers, container/bulk ships and liner vessels. In the 1992 first quarter operating profit dipped to NKr90m from NKr100m. Freight income fell to NKr551m from NKr707m.</p>

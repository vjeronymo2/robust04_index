DPR&hyph;33, DPR&hyph;52, DPR&hyph;68, DPR&hyph;77, DPR&hyph;79 for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Units 1, 2 and 3 (BFN) and the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (SQN), respectively. For the Watts Bar nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (WBN), TVA is the holder of Construction Permits CPPR&hyph;91 and CPPR&hyph;92, respectively, since Operating Licenses have not been issued. The licenses provide, among other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission in effect now and hereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facilities consist of two pressurized water reactors at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2, located in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee; three boiling water reactors at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Units 1, 2 and 3, located in Limestone County, Alabama; and two pressurized water reactors under construction at Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, located at TVA's site on the west bank of the Tennessee River approximately 50 miles northeast of Chattanooga, Tennessee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), in part, states that ``The licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that ``The licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) requires that ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area .&blank;.&blank;.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TVA has proposed to implement an alternative unescorted access control system that would eliminate the need to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access to keep their badges with them when departing the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to allow contractors who have unescorted access to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. By letter dated October 24, 1994, TVA requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide alternative measures for protection against radiological sabotage provided the licensee demonstrates that the alternative measures have ``the same high assurance objective'' and meet ``the general performance requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, unescorted access into the protected areas at the operating TVA plants is controlled through the use of a photograph on a badge/keycard (hereafter, referred to as ``badge''). The security officers at each entrance station use the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both TVA employees and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access are issued upon entrance at each entrance/exit location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at each entrance/exit location. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractors are not allowed to take these badges offsits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed biometric system, each individual who is authorized unescorted entry into protected areas would have the physical characteristics of his/her hand (i.e., hand geometry) registered, along with his/her badge number, in the access control system. When a registered user enters his/her badge into the card reader and places his/her hand onto the measuring surface, the system detects that the hand is properly positioned, and records the image. The unique characteristics of the hand image is then compared with the previously stored template in the access control computer system corresponding to the badge to verify authorization for entry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individuals, including TVA employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badge with them when they depart the site and, thus, eliminate the need to issue, retrieve and store badges at the entrance stations to the plant. Badges do not carry any information other then a unique identification number. All other access processes, including search function capability, would remain the same. This system would not be used for persons requiring escorted access; i.e., visitors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a Sandia report entitled, ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometrics Identification Devices'' (SAND910276 UC_906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991), and on its experience with the current photo-identification system, TVA determined that the false-accept rate for the hand geometry system will be at least equal to the current photo-identification system in used at the TVA plants. The biometric system has been in use for a number of years at several sensitive Department of Energy facilities and, recently, at nuclear power plants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TVA will implement a process for testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent to that specified in the regulation. When the changes are implemented, the respective Physical Security Plans will be revised to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow TVA employees and contractors to take their badges offsite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

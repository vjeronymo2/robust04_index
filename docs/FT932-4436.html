			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Sale of stake ends battle for Skandia ownership A LONG ownership struggle in the Scandinavian insurance sector drew to a close yesterday as two controlling shareholders in Skandia, the Swedish insurance group, sold their stakes in a deal valued at SKr3.2bn (Pounds 289m). Uni Storebrand, Norway's largest insurance group, and Hafnia, the Danish insurance company, sold their combined 43 per cent stake in Skandia to a group of securities houses comprising BZW of the UK, Carnegie International of Sweden, and Sundall Collier and Fondsfinans, both of Norway. The shares were, in turn, placed with a broad range of European and US investors at SKr 105 per share, giving the deal a price tag of about SKr 3.2bn. 'With the completion of this transaction, Skandia is once more in an unaligned position,' said one investment banker involved in the share sale. The abortive attempt by Uni Storebrand and Hafnia to take over Skandia was the most important reason for the collapse of both Uni and Hafnia last year. The value of their holdings fell dramatically after Skandia refused to go along with their scheme of pan-Nordic insurance co-operation. Hafnia Holding last month filed for bankruptcy under the weight of DKr 6.5bn (Pounds 687m) debts and heavy losses. It had already sold its healthy insurance operations to fellow Danish insurer Codan in March, but the 15 per cent Skandia stake was not part of that. Skandia's share price has been overshadowed since it became clear that both Hafnia and Uni Storebrand desperately needed to sell their stakes. Yesterday's deal helps to tie up the loose ends caused by the abortive take-over attempt. It is well below the average price originally paid for the shares. Uni Storebrand paid an average of SKr 220 per share for its holding of 21.5m Skandia shares.</p>

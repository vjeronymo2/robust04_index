An official from the provincial foreign economic and trade  commission said the province approved some 7,229 foreign-funded  firms last year, involving a total contractual foreign  investment of about 7 billion U.S. dollars, exceeding the total  amount for the previous 14 years.    To date, business people from some 61 countries and regions  in the world have established about 13,073 joint ventures in  Shandong, with a total contractual foreign investment of some  12.45 billion U.S. dollars, the official said.    He added that about 72 percent of the foreign-funded firms  fall into the area of manufacturing and 28 percent are in such  fields as agriculture, aquatic production, the service trade,  energy, transportation and high technology.    The province has capitalized on its abundant natural  resources and superior geographic situation and made painstaking  efforts to improve its infrastructure over the past decade.    Shandong now has three international airports, more than  50,000 km in highways and seven seaports open to the outside  world with a total handling capacity of more than 90 million  tons annually.</p>

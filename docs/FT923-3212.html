			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sears appoints two board directors SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and financial services group which has been attacked by shareholders over a variety of corporate governance issues, has appointed two new board directors. They are Mr Michael Miles, chairman of Philip Morris, the large cigarette, beer and food manufacturer, and Mr William LaMothe, chairman emeritus of Kellogg, the cereal company. Mr LaMothe retired as chief executive of Kellogg at the end of last year. The two appointments expand the size of the Sears board from nine members to 11, and is the latest in a series of moves by the company which appear designed to answer some of the complaints levelled against it by investors. Sears has been under fire from dissident shareholders for several years. In large part, the unhappiness results from the lacklustre performance of the company's large retail operations, and the poor performance of Sears shares. However, at the last couple of annual meetings, this disquiet has focused on several corporate governance issues - with the dissidents requesting that the roles of chairman and chief executive be spilt, and directors be elected annually. At last May's AGM, the dissident motions gained larger-than-expected support, although none was successful. Sears has since made several moves to appease investors. In June, for example, it approved some additional powers for shareholders.</p>

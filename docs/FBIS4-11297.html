			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Tomas A. Granados: "Another Wall </F> Shows Its Cracks"]    [Text] Havana [dateline as received] -- After leaving Cuba  tired of economic difficulties or moving because of ideological  discrepancies, or even for the sheer adventure of it, thousands  of Cubans who migrated to the United States, Spain, and other  countries have agreed to a movement effort, to be carried out  this month, that will attempt to reach an agreement with  authorities in Havana.    Almost all of them have a common idea. "We are not people  who want Cuba's destruction," asserted Caridad More Zulueta, who  says she left for Miami in 1980 to ease her many problems  prompted by the domestic difficulties she had to confront every  day.    "I say that many of us who left Cuba in the past 30 years  did  so more for domestic than for political problems," according to  Caridad, usually called "Cachita," who is the president of the  Afro-Cuban Cultural Rescue Group (REWACO) [Grupo de Rescate  Cultural Afrocubano] in Miami.    Not only those who attribute their decision to emigrate to  economic reasons, however, have agreed to travel to Havana this  month and discuss the measures that could be adopted to  regularize their ties with the country, institutions, and  relatives with Cuban authorities.    On the list of approximately 200 guests to the conference on  the nation and emigration, scheduled to be held 22-24 April,  there are also veterans of the mercenary brigade that the United  States launched unsuccessfully against Cuba in 1961,  conspirators who tried to toppled Fidel Castro's government, and  individuals who maintain an aggressive hostility toward the  Cuban revolution in the past.    They are the visible cracks in another wall that is about to  fall. Many of those people, who show clear ideological  differences with the Cuban Government, have decided to distance  themselves from the extremist groups that favor the U.S. policy  of asphyxiating Cuba with an economic blockade and other  interventionist practices that could lead the island to a  holocaust.    "Even if we do not like it, Cuba has created a totally  different society. A sudden change in that society, as the  ignorant people in Miami dream, would be catastrophic," says  Luis Ortega, an old Cuban journalist who resides in the United  States and is known for his lack of affection for the government  in Havana.    According to some Cuban analysts, this conference could open  the door to some progress in normalizing relations with a wide  sector of the emigrants who did not renounce their links to the  country, or conditioned it to some type of personal political  aspirations or group interest.    The spectrum determining an invitation to the conference has  been well defined. The participants invited will consist only  of those groups interested in solving issues related to  emigration, the country's social situation, and opposed to the  U.S. economic blockade against Cuba. In addition, invitations  will also be determined by these groups' decision not to attach  any conditions which may decide their participation.    According to Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's explanation  to the media, those groups at either end of this spectrum are  excluded because they have imprinted a "service record linked  very closely to those who permanently question our existence as  a nation."    In reference to the subject of invitations to the meeting,  Robaina dismissed the participation of Miami extremist groups  which he described as "hysterical." Among these he mentioned the  Cuban-American Foundation, which has been classified as an  opposition group lacking any credibility since "deep down it is  not genuine, but orchestrated by the United States."    Nevertheless, according to an early April confirmation by a  Foreign Ministry official, invitations have been extended to  representatives of organizations who do not sympathize with the  Cuban Government, such as Cuban Change and the Cuban Committee  for Democracy.    Maybe it has been the time element, frustration brought on  by  unsuccessful efforts, or simple nostalgia of being far away from  "what belongs to one" which has prompted some of these groups to  overcome long-lasting hatred as well as hostilities and cross  over to the side of the moderate Cuban emigrants in the United  States. This has been done even at the risk of being branded as  "traitors" by their rivals in the more extremist groups.    At any rate, the emigrant representatives have responded  immediately to their attacks. "Traitors are not those who go to  Cuba to observe and to listen... traitors are those who spend  their time demanding Washington tighten the embargo to cause the  people of Cuba to rise up against Castro in desperation. "That  is a crime," says Ortega.    According to Foreign Relations Vice Minister Jorge Bolanos,  this conference, which is perceived as the second chapter of a  dialogue held for the first time in 1978 between Cuban officials  and representatives of the emigrants, will precipitate a process  headed toward normalizing relations between those Cubans living  overseas and the country's authorities.    The normalization process can be complex, however. The  conference responds to a consensus that intertwines approval  from a majority sector of the Cuban population, and doubts by  some people here who, as a result of old wounds, distrust, and a  lack of understanding, still perceive the emigrants as a symbol  of counterrevolution.    In Havana, an official spokesman recently commented that  there are some individuals still connected to radical sectors of  the Cuban emigrants in the United States who are equally opposed  to the dialogue and an understanding because "of their sick  aversion to the word normalized as it relates to Cuba and the  county's future."    According to some of the leaders of the groups invited to  the  conference, one of the issues that can attract attention to the  debate is the one related to regulations blocking an increase in  visits by the emigrants to their country of origin.    "The blockade should not extend within one's country,"  states  Gilberto Solis, president of the Cuban-American Professionals  and Entrepreneurs (PECA), one of the emigrant groups invited to  the conference.    Solis and other moderate leaders of the emigrant community  insist on the double nationality issue, yet Cuban officials have  explained that the issue is related to what's established in the  Constitution and that any modification must be proposed by the  National Assembly of the People's Government (Parliament) and  approved in a plebiscite.    At any rate, Vice Minister Bolanos recently disclosed that  the authorities will bring up their proposals and other issues  during the conference. "All issues will be open to discussions  during the conference sessions," he added.    To the Cuban authorities, the invitation to this conference  is an opportunity for Cuban residents overseas to present their  "legitimate concerns and aspirations" to the country in good  faith.    At the same time, the Cuban authorities point out that  "there  is no possibility for political manipulation or opportunities to  intervene in affairs which, due to their very nature, only  concern those who live, work and struggle in Cuba."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITIM report] </F>   [Text] A public forum for Jerusalem was established  yesterday in a meeting held in the office of Economy and  Planning Minister Prof. Shim'on Shetrit in Jerusalem. The forum  is composed of settlement leaders and Labor Knesset members  [MK's]. It has been learned that the group drafted a platform  for political action for Jerusalem and the Jerusalem precinct.    The forum was launched by the heads of the Jerusalem area  local councils of Efrat, 'Etzyon Bloc, Giv'at Ze'ev, and Ma'ale  Adumim. Besides Minister Shetrit, the forum includes Deputy  Minister Masha Lubelsky and Labor MK's 'Imanu'el Zismann, Rafi  Elul, Avigdor Qahalani, Gid'on Sagi, Ya'aqov Shefi, Yoram Lass,  Ra'anan Kohen, Yosi Vanunu, Shlomo Buhbut, and Salih Tarif.    Other participants were Reserve Major General 'Uzi Narqis,  Prof. Yehoshu'a Porat, Local Authority Center Chairman 'Adi  Eldar, Prof. Yitzhaq Parnas, and the mayors of several cities,  including Nazareth and Ashqelon.    The participants defined the forum's objective: building up  settlements in the Jerusalem environs and creating territorial  contiguity from Jerusalem to its surrounding towns and  settlements. This is in view of the recent Palestinian  pronouncements and attempts to make gains in Jerusalem during  the interim period.    The forum demanded that the implementation of the  construction plans in local councils around Jerusalem be  expedited and additional construction plans be carried out in a  bid to create a Jewish territorial contiguity in the Jerusalem  district.</p>

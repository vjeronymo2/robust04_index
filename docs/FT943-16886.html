			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Zealand to drop Woolmark The New Zealand Wool Board will shortly cease to use the Woolmark brand name for much of the country's wool production, it announced this week. This follows its decision to take over the interior wools division of the International Wool Secretariat. In future the wool, most of which will end up as carpet, curtaining, bedding or upholstery fabrics, will be sold under the name Wools of New Zealand, with a new registered trade mark of a stylised black and white fern. This will be marketed internationally by the 75 IWS staff, based in offices in London, Brussels, Beijing and elsewhere, who join the wool board when the take-over becomes effective today. The chairman, Mr Pat Morrison, said that the move was being made because New Zealand was the major producer of interior wools, and wanted a direct involvement in its production. New Zealand will remain a member of the IWS, as will the other original partners - Australia and South Africa - and continue to contribute towards the cost of promoting apparel products. However, these account for only 20 per cent of New Zealand's wool production. As part of the change the board will also change its operational name to Wools of New Zealand, although Mr Morrison emphasised that its role as a producer owned co-operative of farmers would remain. He said the change in name was to help ease misconceptions that the board was government-controlled. The new identity is part of sweeping changes which include the board requesting the government to legislate away a number of regulatory functions, such as the ability to purchase the entire wool clip in troubled times. Mr Morrison said that the board had never wanted to exercise these powers. In future it will concentrate on research, product development and promotion. Welcoming the change of name, Mr John Falloon, the minister of agriculture, said at a parliamentary function that for many years, through its levy to the IWS, the board had funded the promotion of wools produced by other countries. 'Now New Zealand farmers are directly funding the development of their own wool,' he said. 'That is the way it should be.' Mr Morrison said that at one time New Zealand carpet wools dominated the world trade, holding some 70 per cent of the market. But its share had dropped to 30 per cent.</p>

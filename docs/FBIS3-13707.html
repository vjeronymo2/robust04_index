			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rafiq Khalil Ma'luf, Raghidah Dirgham, and 'Ali </F> Nun: "Qaddumi Stresses No Return To Negotiations Before  Measures Are Taken To Protect Palestinian People"]    [Excerpts] Washington, New York, London -- President Bill  Clinton yesterday renewed his urgent call for a resumption of  the peace process in the Middle East on the Palestinian track  and the other Arab tracks. He said that he had discussed with  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin the means of returning the  PLO and Israel to the negotiating table, "because we must not  allow the enemies of peace to triumph."    PLO Political Department Head Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf)  has  said in a statement to AL-HAYAH that the PLO will not resume the  negotiations with Israel until the necessary measures are taken  to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied territories.  [passage omitted]    Qaddumi told AL-HAYAH over the telephone that the  Palestinian  leadership told Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the peace  process, when he came to Tunis that deteriorating conditions in  the occupied territories and the escalating tension "can only be  stopped by practical measures on the ground to provide complete  protection for Palestinian civilians, because the horrific and  inhuman Hebron massacre has implanted fear and damaged the  credibility of the peace process as a whole."    He stressed that the PLO insists on an international  presence  in Hebron as part of the required measures, "but the United  States continues to hesitate over giving decisive approval to  the draft Security Council resolution stipulating an  international presence in all the occupied territories,  including Hebron."    Commenting on Peres' remark that Israel will agree to some  measures once the PLO agrees to return to the negotiations,  Qaddumi pointed out that the Palestinian leadership "does not  trust the promises made by Israeli officials, as Peres has  already made numerous promises but none of them has been  fulfilled. And Israel violated the declaration of principles  agreement and delayed withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and  Jericho, saying that the dates were not sacred. So we do not  trust what they say until and unless it is implemented on the  ground. Because 42 families and four centers must be evacuated  and moved from Hebron elsewhere, and the presence of  international forces is a must, as we have said."    He also said that the PLO had raised with the U.S. envoy its  request to put a Palestinian police force into Hebron with the  international force and to remove the Nitserim [as  transliterated] settlement in the Gaza Strip, in addition to two  other settlements -- one near Jericho and the other near Hebron  itself.    Qaddumi revealed that the Palestinian leadership had  rejected  a U.S.-Israeli request to hold a tripartite meeting in Tunis  "between us, Ross, and an Israeli delegation that included Uri  Safir, director general of the Foreign Ministry, Jaques Neriya,  and General Uzi Dayan. We refused to do that, lest it be said  that negotiations were being conducted."    He also revealed that the Palestinian leadership had  rejected  an Israeli request to hold a meeting between Peres and 'Arafat  or PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) in  Washington. He said: "In return, we asked them to take  practical measures on the ground before negotiations and after  the Security Council has adopted a resolution on the Hebron  massacre. They told us that they were not authorized to give an  answer, although Peres is so authorized. We told them that  Peres -- as happened in Oslo, Cairo, and Davos (Switzerland) --  has always said that he is `not the boss' but has then gone on  to the Knesset to claim several victories. It means that the  Israelis are playing the game of allocating roles and have no  desire for peace. In fact they are doing their best to win  further concessions from the Palestinians."    Qaddumi said that the Palestinian side had told the Israeli  envoys that "the Army participated and colluded in the Hebron  massacre, but they denied it. Then we asked them why it had  committed a massacre uglier than the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  immediately after that took place, claiming the lives of 39  martyrs. They said that the Army had been tense. So we told  them that this was an excuse uglier than the crime."    He stressed that Ross openly told the Palestinian leadership  that Washington "cannot approve the Security Council resolution  until you announce your willingness to return to the  negotiations, and President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State  Warren Christopher are pledged to reject any resolution on  Jerusalem."    Qaddumi announced that "most regrettably, we fear that some  of the reports published by the Israeli press today (yesterday),  namely that Clinton wants to announce that Jerusalem is the  capital of Israel [sentence as published]. If that happens, we  say that the peace process is over. Because it will mean that  he has violated one of the peace process' foundations and has  undoubtedly ceased to be an impartial broker with whom we can  deal."    Asked whether his statement meant that the PLO would  withdraw  from the negotiations if Clinton announced that Jerusalem was  the capital of Israel, Qaddumi told AL-HAYAH: "Yes, we would  withdraw from the negotiations, because Washington would have  violated the foundations on which they were launched."    Qaddumi expects "things to drag on" before the negotiations  are resumed. "Because Israel is procrastinating and throwing  dust in people's eyes."    Responding to Rabin's announcement of his willingness to  evacuate the Hebron settlers, Qaddumi said that "if that is  true, it means fulfilling or trying to fulfill part of the  requirements for security and peace, which involve disarming the  settlers and accepting an international presence sponsored by  the two co-sponsors of the peace process, in order to provide  protection and safety for Palestinian citizens in the occupied  territories."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Konovalov: "Agriculture Reaps Money </F> Harvest in Parliament"]    [Text] The Russian State Duma deputies returned to the  discussion of the draft federal budget for this year on 11 May.  A significantly updated document was submitted for their  perusal following the work done on it by the government  commission in conjunction with representatives of Duma  committees. As a result the parameters of the proposed budget  underwent rather major alterations.    Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin told deputies that the  amendments amount to increases in the expenditure and revenue  parts of the budget. But the proportions have significantly  shifted in the direction of increased expenditure.    It is envisaged that budget revenue will now increase by  3,776.5 billion rubles [R] and will thus be R124,477 billion.  Where will it come from? Primarily from the 1 July change in  customs duties and corresponding change in value-added tax. The  tax collected specifically for the needs of the agro-industrial  complex and coal industry is to increase by a little over R1  trillion. Revenue will also be swelled as a result of duty  changes and increased revenue from privatization. As we can  see, all these sources are rather problematic, and the  implementation of them will depend on many factors.    As for expenditure, the situation is far more definite. This  part will certainly be implemented. The plan is for expenditure  to increase by R10,188.3 billion. That will make it R193,324  billion. As a result the budget deficit will rise from R62  trillion to R68.847 trillion, constituting 9.5 percent of gross  domestic product.    What is the increase in state expenditure? The lion's share  goes to the agro-industrial complex. As Sergey Dubinin  explained, a solution has been found which will not have serious  inflationary consequences, since the increased budget  appropriations will be accompanied by reduced Central Bank  credits for the countryside. The components of the Federation  will be allocated more than R5 trillion on a repayment basis to  give agricultural producers advances and to purchase products.  Moreover, the agro-industrial complex will be allocated more  than R2 trillion from the budget for other purposes.    There is yet another item on which more budget money will be  spent -- social and cultural needs. An extra R968.4 billion is  to be allocated for this purpose. Nearly half of it will go to  the media, mainly television and radio. An extra R345 billion  is to be allocated for the purchase of drugs.    According to the minister, the protracted examination of the  budget was a lesson for the government and for parliament, so  the intention is to submit the draft budget for next year to the  deputies by September.</p>

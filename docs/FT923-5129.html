			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y may seek US bankruptcy protection OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the troubled Canadian property developer, has concluded it may have to seek protection from creditors under US bankruptcy law unless it can satisfy demands from a loan syndicate led by JP Morgan. Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's chief strategist, and Mr Gerald Greenwald, president, were in New York yesterday for meetings aimed at avoiding a US bankruptcy filing. An O&amp;Y official said the company 'may be left with no option but to file under Chapter 11'. The official said: 'If we can't find an accommodation with Morgan then we will have to seek protection in the US.' The latest conflict between O&amp;Y and JP Morgan comes four months after a Morgan-led loan syndicate said it would foreclose on part of a Dollars 160m loan. This announcement was followed by postponements of the foreclosure auction and by the termination of Morgan's other role as a financial adviser to O&amp;Y. Three weeks ago the Morgan-led loan syndicate asked O&amp;Y to place the cash flow generated by six healthy US buildings into a bank account that would have Morgan as a trustee. Morgan's aim was to ensure O&amp;Y would have sufficient funds for interest payments on the Dollars 160m loan, as well as the cost of maintenance and tax payments on its US buildings. O&amp;Y countered by asking Morgan to withdraw its request for the trusteeship accounts, although the Canadian-based group did satisfy the Morgan syndicate that sufficient funds would be set aside. Morgan has now told O&amp;Y it would drop other requests if the developer agreed to set up separate bank accounts to contain US cash flow. Morgan set a deadline of September 3 for O&amp;Y to accept the compromise proposal, but one banker said the Morgan-led group would not necessarily act to seize assets if O&amp;Y did not comply with the deadline.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Unemployment in the UK: Sharing out the available work may top the political agenda IF THE past 20 years have proved anything, it is that there are no simple, cheap solutions to high unemployment. Yet there are some relatively low-cost options which could soon be on the agenda. One idea is to spread the available work more evenly across the whole population. Another is to overhaul the benefit system to make it more employment-friendly. A third involves limited subsidies to induce employers to take on the long-term jobless. The 'redistribution' school - which ranges from the women's lobby to those who believe automation wipes out jobs - argues that unemployment of more than 2.5m is here to stay, and that the only way of getting more people into work is to repackage existing working time to include them. They welcome many of the 1990s trends towards more flexible part-time work, and want to encourage more job-sharing while discouraging systematic overtime. More radically, some of them talk of a cultural revolution with 'more men accepting a role as half breadwinner and half house-husband', according to Ms Anna Coote, a prominent campaigner. The UK has a higher female participation rate than most other EC countries, with women taking most of the new, mainly part-time, jobs. Men, says Ms Coote, may have to be readier to accept 'female' jobs if male unemployment is to be substantially reduced. The 1990s could be the decade the redistributionists have been waiting for. The double-earner household is now the norm, so it is easier for men to work shorter hours and take a greater role in child-rearing, something they now seem readier to do. Job sharing and part-time or two-third jobs may also suit well-paid managerial and professional workers whose jobs are now threatened for the first time, and who can better afford the trade-off between work and leisure or family duties. There is mainstream political support for such ideas. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, says he wants a definition of full employment which 'recognises the rights of part-time workers and forges a new balance between the demands of family life and paid work for both men and women'. There are plenty of ways to encourage the jobs market to share out work even more and make sure the unemployed get some of it. The French government tops up the pay of older workers who give up half their job and covers administrative costs. Grants to employers for job-splitting and job-sharing, abandoned in the late 1980s, should also be restored. Making the benefit system more employment friendly could help. It is difficult for the Employment Service to help people to help themselves back into paid employment because of social security rules which assume that most of the jobless are work-shy. Income support, the most important benefit for the unemployed, has an 'actively seeking work' rule which precludes more than 16 hours paid work per week or 21 hours of formal education, and can prevent people working for nothing in the voluntary sector. The government seems ready to relax some of these rules. Just as important would be raising the threshold of what the unemployed can legitimately earn, and removing the 'mortgage trap'. For the first two years on income support people are allowed to earn only Pounds 5 before having every pound earned clawed back through reduced benefit. That is raised to Pounds 15 after two years. but is still not much of an inducement to small-scale self-help. If an unemployed person, or someone in their household, takes part-time work over the hours threshold it can lead to the withdrawal of mortgage interest payment, which takes 16 weeks to reinstate if you then lose the job. The main in-work benefit for the low-paid - family credit - pays rent but not mortgages. The best way to get a new job is to have one already, but Ms Ruth Wharton, a single parent from Cumbria, complains: 'You can't risk coming off income support in the hope that a part-time job might turn into a full-time one.' To make it easier for people such as Ruth reformers propose raising the working hours threshold to 20 hours and the weekly earnings threshold to about Pounds 40 (plus more flexibility for allowances to be 'rolled up' to promote seasonal work). Would that simply mean part-time workers on benefit taking jobs from part-time workers not on benefit? It might, but Dr Eithne McLaughlin of Queen's University, Belfast, is convinced from her work with the unemployed that many would go out and create new work, mainly in the household service sector. Subsidising the employment of the long-term jobless is the most traditional idea. Job subsidies have been rejected in the recent past because they are too indiscriminate - too many of the 7m who will take new jobs this year would attract unnecessary subsidy - or too expensive. But if employers could waive national insurance payments for new recruits who had been jobless for 18 months it would be easy to implement and cost-effective.</p>

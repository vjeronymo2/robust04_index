			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Beijing warns on Hong Kong MR Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong, has warned that failure to resolve differences with Britain over the colony's future would threaten its economy. Speaking in Beijing yesterday before receiving a delegation from Hong Kong's Liberal party, Mr Lu said: 'If the British side sticks to (Governor) Chris Patten's plan, it shows that Britain is not willing to co-operate with the Chinese side to realise the smooth transfer of power. 'Under these circumstances, it is difficult to assure that Hong Kong's economy will not be affected.' China, which takes over Hong Kong in 1997, has been enraged by proposals advanced by Mr Patten to broaden the franchise for elections due in 1994 and 1995. It claims these proposals fly in the face of understandings reached with Britain during negotiations over Hong Kong's future. Beijing has appeared in recent days to be seeking to raise the stakes in its dispute with London. China's chief negotiator in talks with Britain over Hong Kong warned this week that in the absence of an agreement Beijing would simply ignore the results of elections for local government and for Hong Kong's quasi parliament, the Legislative Council. Mr Jiang Enzhu, a vice foreign minister, was speaking before the 13th round of Sino-British talks, all of which have ended inconclusively. The two sides resume talking in Beijing next week. Reuter adds from Hong Kong: The leader of Britain's opposition Liberal Democratic party, Mr Paddy Ashdown, said yesterday he feared negotiations with China on Hong Kong democratic future would collapse. But he added: 'I am fairly confident that Hong Kong's prosperity and economy will remain vibrant and strong right through the instability that may now be coming.'</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUILTY PLEAS IN AEROSPACE FASTENER CASE  </P> <P> A Burbank company pleaded guilty Friday to five felony charges of selling  substandard nuts and bolts used in the space shuttle and other aircraft, and it  agreed to pay $625,000 in fines and restitution, authorities said.  </P> <P> Lawrence Engineering &amp; Supply Inc. entered its pleas in federal court in  San Jose, where in February a federal grand jury had indicted the company on 33  charges relating to fasteners -- mainly nuts and bolts -- that Lawrence sold  primarily to the U.S. government from late 1983 through 1987. The other 28  charges were dismissed Friday.  </P> <P> In general, Lawrence pleaded guilty to "falsely certifying that aerospace  fasteners it sold to the United States met all applicable government standards  when, in fact, they did not," Joseph P. Russoniello, U.S. attorney for the  Northern District of California, said in a statement.  </P> <P> Lawrence was one of several fastener producers that came under scrutiny in the  past two years as part of a widespread federal investigation into sales of  allegedly bogus aerospace parts.  </P> <P> The indictment of Lawrence alleged that the company routinely fabricated the  results of safety tests on counterfeit nuts and bolts, then sold the fasteners  to government agencies and private companies for use on the space shuttle, the  Army's Bradley fighting vehicle, Navy aircraft and United Airlines commercial  jets, among other projects.  </P> <P> Two Lawrence executives also were indicted: Gary R. Davidson of Saugus, who was  Lawrence's quality control manager from 1978 until his departure in 1985, and  Ramon Smith of Canyon Country, Lawrence's former vice president and general  manager.  </P> <P> Davidson pleaded guilty to two felony charges in February and was fined  $25,000, said Leo P. Cunningham, assistant U.S. attorney, in San Jose. Smith,  who pleaded innocent, is scheduled to go to trial on Jan. 16. Smith's lawyer  has said that Smith directed Lawrence's sales and relied on others for quality  control and proper certifications of the fasteners in question.  </P> <P> A federal investigation of Lawrence began in the summer of 1988 after the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration replaced more than 350 of  Lawrence's bolts installed in the space shuttle Discovery before its successful  launch in September, 1988.  </P> <P> NASA had been alerted earlier by one of its subcontractors that some Lawrence  bolts might not meet safety standards, and NASA then found that the bolts did  not meet strength requirements.  </P> <P> United Airlines also confirmed early this year that it had installed 1,000 of  Lawrence's allegedly bogus bolts in some of its planes but said that passengers  were not at risk because the systems using the bolts had backups in the event  of failure.  </P></p>

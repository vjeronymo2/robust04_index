While the populace grumbles about shortages,  officials of ERIAD [five food industry enterprises, the agency  that produces and imports the commodity, are peddling a very  different line.    Mr. Hanoun, ERIAD's marketing director for the central  region, claims that 90 percent of this year's distribution plan  has been implemented, noting too that between 1992 and 1993  there was a 17-percent augmentation of product availability and  several new outlets were opened in remote, rugged regions. In  fact, if demand had been normal--in other words equal to last  year's--the total quantity of imported and domestically produced  semolina would have been ample. "What has happened is that  rumors and the current situation in the country have combined to  allow insecurity to creep in."    Mr. Hanoun said there were three principal causes. First,  semolina of late has become a "blue-chip" commodity. Second, the  tripling of prices of other food products has made them  prohibitively expensive. Finally, private households have been  hoarding as much semolina as possible to prepare for any  eventual shortages.    So far this year, ERIAD's central branch has marketed close  to 3 million quintals of semolina, a volume that ordinarily  would have been sufficient for the region, meeting the 1993  target of 3,500,000 quintals set at the beginning of the year.  "We have a distribution plan that is still being implemented,"  Mr. Hanoun explains. "Production units are working round the  clock. ENIAL [expansion not given] is also working very hard to  implement the import program and more or less stabilize the  market."    The regional marketing director acknowledges that at present  the market is absorbing all the semolina being distributed and  admits the enterprise is not really in a position to go beyond  its current program at this time. But he remains optimistic  about next year.    In fact, two mills, one at Corso and the other at Baghlia,  will be going into operation. Also, the Algerian market will  doubtless be inundated once the cost of imported semolina  declines.    Skyrocketing prices have been a factor in their own right. A  100-kg bag of semolina sometimes costs as much as 1,300 Algerian  dinars, even though the official price is only 450. Our  interlocutor pointed out that ERIAD is only a retailer, not a  price control agency.    At Tizi Ouzou, shortages began to appear about mid-August.  Substantial quantities were programmed for the region but  somehow never found their way to consumers. Local officials  suggest the problem stemmed from household overstocking and  "organized diversion" by speculators of semolina set aside for  the region.    ERIAD maintains it met all its targets. During the first few  months of 1992, the wilaya received 484,966 quintals, whereas  corresponding deliveries for 1993 were up by 15 percent to  606,159 quintals.    In the west, the problem does not seem to be as acute as in  the central region, since people in the western region consume  more flour than semolina.    The enterprise's western region branch, which has not had a  single day of down time this year, produced 103 percent of its  quota. Whereas the target was 2,346,000 quintals, actual output  was 2,413,000. In other words, there was surplus production. In  Annaba, the shortage is due in part to the purchasing  preferences of some livestock producers who prefer to buy bags  of semolina at 450 dinars to feed their stock rather than pay  750 dinars. Livestock producers carried off 20 percent of the  production intended for households. This has been an especially  acute problem in pastoral regions such as Khenchela, Tebessa,  and Batna.    ERIAD's manager for the eastern region sings a quite  different tune. He maintains that the annual importation and  distribution program was fulfilled and that the only snag was  delays in merchandise arrival. An example: In October, 45,000  quintals went on the market at cooperatives and other  supermarkets. The wilaya of Annaba alone said it needed about  38,000 quintals, while the other wilayas of the eastern region  claimed they needed much more than that.    In November, 81,316 quintals were delivered to the port of  Annaba, compared to the target amount of 104,000. In 1992, for  that same period, the enterprise distributed altogether 416,235  quintals, while in 1993 the volume of semolina was 510,202  quintals.    The two semolina plants in the town of Guelma together  produce more than 1,000 quintals per day. The actual needs of  the populace are estimated at 37,000 quintals a year.    The shutdown of the two plants for maintenance caused some  minor shortages. Even though supply now slightly exceeds demand,  people are worried. Semolina sales in September amounted to  41,500 quintals. More than 43,512 quintals went on the market in  October, including 13,850 quintals of imported product.  Officials say several factors are behind the prevailing mood of  insecurity. Many growers marketed their crop themselves instead  of through CCLS [Special Cooperatives for Grains and Dry  Legumes], since a quintal of wheat costs 1,000 dinars. Also, the  semolina market has been victimized by "trabendo" [black-market]  operations. Traffickers in the commodity jack up the price to  several times the official rate.</p>

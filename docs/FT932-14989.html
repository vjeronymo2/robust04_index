			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Banco Central Hispano nears marketing accord with SocGen BANCO Central Hispano, one of Spain's leading banks, is close to reaching an agreement with France's Societe Generale which will allow the two banks to pool their marketing resources outside their domestic bases. The agreement will also enable the banks to use each other's branch networks. The pact, which is likely to be signed next week, is seen by the Spanish bank as an important part of an attempt to restart Europartners, a consortium that pooled BCH with Credit Lyonnais of France, Banco di Roma of Italy and Commerzbank of Germany. The German bank maintains its links with BCH through a 4.7 per cent stake that it owns in the Spanish bank's equity, but the Europartners initiative was abandoned after Credit Lyonnais started building up its own branch network in Spain at the beginning of the 1990s. Societe Generale, which is poised to replace Credit Lyonnais as BCH's partner in France, is in the meantime exploring possible joint initiatives with Commerzbank and with National Westminster of the UK. A spokeswoman for BCH said that Societe Generale's potential links in the UK and in Germany were separate from the French bank's forthcoming agreement in Spain. BCH is seeking a UK partner with which to forge a similar commercial pact, but this is unlikely to be National Westminster, Barclays or Lloyds, all of which already have branch networks in Spain. Last month, BCH exchanged 2 per cent of its equity for a 10 per cent stake in Banco Commercial Portugues, BCP, in the biggest share-swap agreement to date between Spanish and Portuguese banking institutions.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters discussed the importance of including all available data and the QA/QC criteria in the record. It was often stated that from the scientist's point of view, there is no reason not to put all data in the record as long as it is accompanied by sound study design, appropriate sampling and QA/QC protocols and a description of the level of review. Another commenter suggested that a standing peer review committee should review data before it is entered in the record. One participant asked whether or how the record could contain useful information or documents that do not meet pure chain of custody requirements. There was some concern raised about parties ``stuffing'' or ``dumping'' material in the record to force the other party to respond or overwhelm the other party. Another concern raised was that the proposed rule does not require the trustee to invite responsible party participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some participants stated that the proposed administrative record process would promote litigation rather than reduce transaction costs. There was a strong feeling on the part of some commenters that NOAA's position that the administrative record would receive judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act using the standard of ``arbitrary and capricious'' was fundamentally unfair to the responsible party and a violation of due process. Several commenters felt the trustees had too much flexibility and too much control over the contents of the record. Some commenters felt the responsible party was entitled to challenge the trustee's decisions on a ``preponderance of the evidence'' before a jury. Another commenter suggested NOAA set up an adjudicative process where an administrative law judge would preside and apply the ``substantial evidence'' standard to the trustee's record and allow extra-record evidence to be produced at an administrative trial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally it was suggested that federal trustees need not comply with NEPA because the DARP would qualify under the ``functional equivalency'' doctrine. Another commenter queried whether the responsible party would have to bear the costs of NEPA compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Should trustee decisionmaking on the record include all aspects of injury assessment and restoration/replacement activities including financial costs and economic valuation or should the trustee decisions on the record include only the injury assessment and restoration/replacement activities excluding a determination of costs and economic values as aspects of money damages suitable for de novo trial along with liability?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Is a ``bifurcated'' review process practical, i.e. will an administrative record review for injury assessment and restoration selection and a separate litigation-driven process for determination of liability and money damages prove workable or raise significant timing issues and evidentiary problems?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Is a trial appropriate for determination of liability and/or money damages under OPA? Is a trial appropriate for review or litigation of trustee's decisions during injury assessment and selection of restoration activities? If yes, should such a trial be to the court or to the jury?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Is the administrative record process for developing the trustee's assessment and/or restoration alternatives ``informal rulemaking'' or ``quasi-adjudicative'' under the APA? How would an administrative record prepared by a state trustee be reviewed by a state court?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Should there be a means for preventing any one party from ``stuffing'' the administrative record to achieve a preponderance of evidence or strain the ability of other parties to respond on the record? If so, what should it be? Should there be designated times for the submission of materials to the record? Should the rule define the types of data, analysis and other documents submitted to the record?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. How should the trustee comply with section 1006(c)(5) of OPA [restoration plans developed and implemented only after adequate public notice, opportunity for hearing and comment] in the context of settlement? Specifically, what type of process would satisfy the potential desire to settle an OPA claim with specific performance of a restoration activity as well as comply with section 1006(c)(5) and NEPA?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The rule as currently proposed requires public review only when the trustee releases the Draft Assessment and Restoration Plan. Should there be additional requirements for public review or participation? Should the requirements vary according to the type of assessment chosen by the trustee?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

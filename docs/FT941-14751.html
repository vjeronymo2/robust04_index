			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Aid for Malaysia 'was linked to arms sale' Written evidence suggesting Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government linked a big aid package to Malaysia with the sale of British arms has been unearthed in Whitehall in the wake of the political row over the Pergau dam project. Mr John Major yesterday vigorously defended his role in giving final approval in 1991 to the financing of the controversial project to build a Pounds 300m hydro-electricity station on the banks of Malaysia's Pergau river. Earlier this week Sir Timothy Lankester, permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, said he had opposed the decision as a waste of taxpayers' money. But he was overruled by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, following consultations between Mr Hurd and Mr Major. They were advised by government lawyers that the deal did not involve a breach in the law, which prevents overseas aid being used directly to purchase arms. In 1989 the Thatcher government agreed to finance the Pergau project a few months after signing a Pounds 1bn framework accord on military sales. The Foreign Office has consistently denied that the two deals were linked. Government policy prohibits any link between aid offers and weapons contracts. But it emerged yesterday that while the denials have been accurate in a strict sense, the government did in early 1988 tie the offer of a large aid package to the prospective arms deal. The Pergau scheme, though not mentioned specifically at the time, was eventually financed from this package. Documents detailing the link have been uncovered by officials in the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office. Other minutes detail direct contacts between Downing Street and the Malaysian government. The papers, potentially deeply embarrassing, pre-date a formal letter sent to the Malaysian government in July 1988 which said the offer of aid and the prospective arms deal were not tied together. It is understood that the letter, sent by Lord Younger, then defence secretary, reflected official concern that the earlier papers represented a breach of government policy. Civil servants had been particularly alarmed by the relaxed attitude about any link adopted to the issue by officials in Mrs Thatcher's Downing Street office. The letter was sent to provide a public defence against charges that the rules had been broken. Mounting criticism of the deal raised the possibility yesterday that the Commons foreign affairs committee may launch an investigation. The public accounts committee is already conducting its own inquiry but its powers and remit have so far prevented it from exploring in detail the links between aid and arms sales to Malaysia. Mr Major made clear in the Commons yesterday that he had felt it impossible to renege on an agreement signed by his predecessor. He also defended it as vital to Britain's industry and exports. Mr Peter Shore, a Labour member of the foreign affairs committee, said that the affair was 'bound to be raised at the next meeting of the foreign affairs committee'. He said that Mr David Howell, the committee's chairman, had reported to the committee that he would be unable to take part in any sessions on the Pergau dam project because he is an adviser to one of the companies involved.</p>

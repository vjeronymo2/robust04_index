			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Roskel slides to Pounds 528,000 at interim BOTH TURNOVER and pre-tax profits were lower at Roskel, the suspended ceiling systems group, for the first six months of 1993, and the directors warn that trading in the short term was unlikely to improve. The result was down from Pounds 652,000 to Pounds 528,000 from turnover of Pounds 21.72m (Pounds 22.82m). The directors said however, that in the medium term they looked forward to growth in the group's profitability 'as the construction industry recovers from recession'. The interim is maintained at 1.3p despite losses of Pounds 1.2m. The directors reported that Roskel Contracts had been notable for its consistent contribution to turnover and they said this company's strength in the market place had enabled it 'to secure a satisfactory level of new business, commercial as well as retail, but margins are under pressure'. Sales at CP Supplies were ahead very slightly but profits, still affected by bad debts, were lower than last time. Tenon Partition Systems incurred development costs, but was expanding satisfactorily, they said. Hire rates at Access Rental remained weak but utilisation improved a little and enabled the company to trade at break even for the first time since 1990. Pre-tax figure for the period was after interest payable of Pounds 179,000 (Pounds 218,000) and a Pounds 56,000 share of an associate's loss. Earnings per share were 2.23p compared with 2.91p.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWBORN'S BODY FOUND AT UCI MEDICAL CENTER  </P> <P> The body of a newborn girl was found Thursday by a custodian in a women's  restroom at UCI Medical Center's Emergency Room, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Immediately after the discovery, officials issued a plea for anybody with  information about the baby or the identity and health of the mother to contact  UCI Medical Center police.  </P> <P> "It is a shock to have this happen at any time to any hospital," said hospital  spokeswoman Fran Tardiff.  </P> <P> Reports of the dead baby deeply saddened hospital staffers who earlier in the  day had been celebrating Wednesday's birth of quadruplets at the hospital,  officials said.  </P> <P> Details of the discovery were sketchy, and investigators declined to release  much information.  </P> <P> "We are withholding some information so as not to jeopardize the  investigation," Tardiff said. "We're just hoping the news does get out so that  if someone saw something they will contact us. A lot of questions need to be  answered."  </P> <P> Officials said the full-term or near full-term baby had been found in the  restroom by a custodian about 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Emergency room doctors were immediately called to the restroom and pronounced  the baby dead.  </P> <P> Officials declined to say how long the infant may have been in the restroom  where the custodian had found her or if attempts were made to resuscitate her.  </P> <P> After the discovery, medical center police, Orange County coroner's  investigators, and county crime lab technicians were called in to investigate.  </P> <P> An autopsy is scheduled today to determine the cause of death.  </P> <P> Anybody with information about the incident can call UCI Medical Center police  at (714) 634-5493.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alexej Balek, of the Institute for Economic </F> Policy: "Agriculture in the 1990's: Trends, Dynamics, and the  Channeling of Its Development"]    [Text] Restructuring cannot get by without  involvement of the state, and reforestation cannot get by  without a global concept. Reduction of the weight of agriculture  in the economy calls for a directed process. The number of  workers in agriculture will be declining.    Existing problems will continue in agriculture throughout  the  1990's, and new problems will develop and expand, including  global, economic, social, ecological, and landscape-forming  problems. They will impact upon the lives of people in this  branch of the economy in adjacent sectors and areas and will  even impact on territorial questions. The weight of the  extraproduction, extraeconomic significance of agriculture will  increase.  <H5>  Stagnation </H5>   Agriculture will be primarily facing stagnation of food  consumption in this country and West Europe. The stagnation of  food consumption is the result of both economic and systems  causes (for example, a change in the structure of expenditures  by the population, temporarily lower real incomes for a  significant portion of the population), as well as demographic  ones (stability or decline in population numbers, deterioration  of the age structure of the population). Exceptions to this  stagnation will be the production of fruit, vegetables, and milk  in the vicinity of large towns and agglomerations, where good  sales opportunities will exist.    Czech agriculture will have to deal with foreign competition  to a greater extent--competition not only from the West but also  from the East (for example, Ukraine). Efforts will increase to  sell foodstuffs in our country that are unsalable in the West.  This problem will be connected with the competitiveness of Czech  exports of industrial commodities and services. The described  situation will bring about the necessity for restructuring  agricultural production, for limiting areas to be seeded, for  changes in the structure of livestock production, etc.  <H5>  Restructuring </H5>   Limiting cropland areas poses the question as to what is to  be done with them. There is the possibility of reforestation,  utilization for recreational purposes, agrotourism, energy  production, etc. These directions for utilizing and modifying  the landscape need not result in adequate economic effects (at  least from the medium-range viewpoint); on the contrary, they  will be resource-intensive.    In the short period of two to four years, land left to lie  fallow will be the source of a spread of weeds, will lead to  higher costs in plant production and to the necessity of  multiplying the use of herbicides and chemicals to care for the  land. This will have an influence on the quality of the  environment.    For many reasons, changes in the landscape that involve  complex questions with a number of tie-ins and interconnections  can very likely not be left to unrestrained development.  Reforestation cannot get by without a certain concept that would  coordinate various interests. This process will be impossible  without incursion on the part of the state. This is also  necessary because this will also involve organizational and  coordination tasks. Reforestation will require expenditures that  will not result in a return on investment for 60 to 80 years,  something that will not be lucrative for entrepreneurial  entities.    The establishment of water reservoirs, of small and  medium-size hydroelectric and wind-driven electric power plants,  can bring definite as well as economic results sooner than can  be obtained through reforestation, but will be capital-intensive  and, in a number of cases, not even hold a promise of average  profits. But these will be projects that are socially beneficial  and, in many cases, urgently needed. It will be necessary to  reach conclusions as to how their realization can be assured  (taxes, subsidies, grants, etc.).    In a broader and longer-term context, orientation toward  nonfood-industry production purposes (for example, the  cultivation of biomass for energy purposes) is one of the ways  in which agriculture can move. However, this is dependent upon a  number of factors (technical factors, technological factors,  organizational factors, research, legislative factors, capital  resources).  <H5>  Employment </H5>   In addition to questions having to do with land, it must be  anticipated that the number of people active in agriculture will  continue to decline. In 1970, the number of workers in  agriculture in the Czech Republic amounted to 720,000; in 1980,  there were 560,000; in 1990, 491,000; and in the year 2000, the  number of agricultural employees could decline significantly  below 300,000. (The departure of people from agriculture causes  problems involving their placement and requalification.) A  similar fate will befall the relatively significant number of  people active in the foodstuffs industry, engineering,  chemistry, and other branches that tie in with agriculture.    It can be rationally anticipated that the standard of living  of the population working in agriculture (cooperative farmers,  private farmers, or hired help) will, when compared to other  groups of the population, deteriorate relatively on the average.  The problems in agriculture will influence the entire social  situation.    Agriculture will be a branch that will be reducing the pace  of the national economy as a whole. Stagnation in the  consumption of food, the minimizing of consumption on the part  of the agricultural population, weakened demand for agricultural  machinery, chemical products for agriculture, etc. will all be  exerting their influence.  <H5>  There Are Not Only Economic Connections </H5>   In formulating agricultural policy, it will no longer be  possible to ignore the principles of food security and  self-sufficiency of the Czech state. In the 1990's,  international relations will also be conflicting in character.  It is also not possible to exclude the occurrence of natural  events or catastrophes, which could prevent the importation of  foodstuffs, etc.    In formulating the agricultural policy of the state, it is  suitable to take into account not only the efficiency of our own  agricultural production in comparison with the efficiency of  exports of industrial goods necessary to assure the importation  of foodstuffs, but also the extraproduction task of agriculture.  It is possible that the development of production forces in  Czech agriculture could result in greater economic and  extraeconomic effects than could be achieved as a result of the  above-mentioned export of industrial goods and services in  exchange for the importation of foodstuffs.    Orientation toward reducing the weight of agriculture in the  national economy is a process that should be directed. The  formulation of medium-term and long-term agricultural policy  must be based on all decisive interconnections and not just on  economic factors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren) will submit a report soon to the  government to urge that a budget for space exploration be  incorporated in a public works spending program currently being  worked out, Keidanren officials said Tuesday [21 June].    The top Japanese business lobby has prepared the report for  presentation to the Finance Ministry, the Science and Technology  Agency and other government departments, the officials said.    The government should increase its annual space budget  2.5-fold to 500 billion yen and appropriate part of the budget  from the public works investment program, the report says.    Specifically, the report calls for the development of  spacecraft for technical tests and a satellite-based earth  observation system under the budget.    It says science and technology for space exploration is  essential for development of a wide range of industrial  technology and useful as a bargaining chip in negotiating the  introduction of foreign technology.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rosy Bindi, Veneto regional secretary of the </F> Italian Popular Party, PPI, by Stefano De Martis; place and date  not given: "Moderates, Get Back to the Center"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [De Martis] Your party  companion Buttiglione thinks that an alliance with Forza Italia  is possible in the next elections. Do you agree?    [Bindi] First, I refuse to consider [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi as being at the center of the system. We cannot go  back to the Ptolemaic system that we overcame with the  first-past-the-post electoral law. Nor can we determine what  the political framework will be five years from now. In  addition, our centrist position focuses not only the majority  but also the left-wing opposition. Because if we were to  finally have a modern Left not under the PDS' [Democratic Party  of the Left] thumb, then it is likely that the right-wing  grouping would change too, thus creating the conditions for the  moderate electorate to return to the center. However, we cannot  do this with somebody who deceived the moderates.    [De Martis] Even if Berlusconi were to break with [National  Alliance leader] Fini?    [Bindi] The problem of this Right lies not only with  National  Alliance but with Berlusconi himself.    [De Martis] Why?    [Bindi] Because of the incompatibility of his role as head  of  government and his being the owner of three television channels.  Because Forza Italia in itself is the opposite of politics seen  as participation by the people. Because it is the expression of  the entrenched financial interests. Because it legitimated two  radical and populist right-wing parties.    [De Martis] You are aiming at an accord with the  progressives  then?    [Bindi] No, the difference between me and Buttiglione is  that  he wants to build a Center-Right group and therefore has already  chosen which field to play in. I want to build a Center without  allies, which, because of its specific political battles, will  be able to attract people from both the current Center-Right and  current Center-Left.    [De Martis] But such bipolarity....    [Bindi] Once the extreme Right and Left have been put on the  sideline, the alternative will be a reconstructed Center and a  moderate Left. However, even the Left cannot pretend that the  problem lies only with [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti.  The problem is the PDS, with its governing class, structure, and  desire to control. If it does not change, we cannot hope to  have a modern evolution in the Italian Left.    [De Martis] Where will the PPI [Italian Popular Party] fit  into this picture?    [Bindi] The PPI must also be an alternative to this renewed  Left. However, if the Right were to continue to become radical  instead of evolving, then it would be our duty to ally ourselves  with this new Left. If we were in France and had to choose  between the Socialist Delors and the Liberal Giscard we, as  Catholics, would have to ally ourselves with the second.  However, if Berlusconi, Fini, and [Northern League Secretary]  Bossi were to be still there instead of Giscard, then we could  do nothing else but ally ourselves with Delors.    [De Martis] Why do you want Romano Prodi [chairman of the  Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] as PPI secretary?    [Bindi] Because he is the one who best incarnates the policy  of a Center that is capable of drawing consensus from all  directions. He has demonstrated that he knows what the Center  means in relation to the Right and Left in connection with a  specific political battle, that of privatization.    [De Martis] Did the Buttiglione-De Mita meeting surprise  you?    [Bindi] It is part of the strategy preceding a congress.  Buttiglione is looking for an ally.    [De Martis] Will he find one in De Mita?    [Bindi] De Mita is an intelligent person. If I understand  his line of thinking, I think that he will not support  Buttiglione.    [De Martis] Will the congress really take place in July?    [Bindi] By postponing the deadline for membership to the end  of May, it has in fact become impossible to hold the congress  before the summer. There are two choices therefore: either the  congress is postponed until after the summer on the basis of new  membership and this regency is maintained; or a "radical"  congress will be organized before the summer just to elect the  secretary, leaving the membership issue until another  traditional congress is held.</p>

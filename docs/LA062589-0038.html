			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS SAY THEY'RE IN DARK ABOUT SUPERFUND PROCESS  </P> <P> Over the past six years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has paid  almost $280,000 to two contractors to provide community relations for its  Superfund program to clean up polluted San Gabriel Valley ground water.  </P> <P> But the community relations plan for the program is not finished, project  documents that are supposed to be available in local libraries are not in  place, and one environmentalist who tried to get some information on the  project from the EPA said he was told that he would have to file a request  under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.  </P> <P> Wil Baca, an engineer who has headed environmental committees of the Hacienda  Heights Improvement Assn. and is on the Board of Directors of the Santa  Monica-based Coalition for Clean Air, said the community relations effort has  been invisible to the public. Far from involving the community in the  ground-water project, Baca said, the EPA has made it difficult for residents to  find out what it is doing.  </P> <P> "The public has been shut out of the Superfund process," Baca said. "They want  to keep us dumb."  </P> <P> The EPA has a $402,250 contract with the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal  Water District for community relations and technical assistance.  </P> <P> In his quarterly reports to the EPA documenting his district's work on  community relations, Robert Berlien, the district's general manager, lists  attendance at community meetings, review of EPA documents, conferences with  politicians, meetings with EPA officials and interviews with the news media.  </P> <P> At the end of March of this year, the district had received and spent $246,973  under the cooperative agreement. Of that amount, about $63,000 went to an  engineering firm to provide EPA with technical assistance, and the remaining  $184,000 was spent on community relations.  </P> <P> "I think we've served a purpose in at least giving people a place to get their  questions (about the Superfund project) answered, in keeping some contact with  local government agencies about what's going on," Berlien said. "I think we've  served a good purpose in reviewing EPA plans."  </P> <P> In addition to its $402,250 contract with the district, EPA has budgeted  $207,000 for community relations work by CH2M Hill, its major consultant on the  San Gabriel Valley project.  </P> <P> The community relations plan is being prepared by CH2M Hill. The staff member  who wrote the latest version declined to comment on it, citing her company's  policy of referring all matters about work for EPA to that agency. An EPA  spokesman said the community relations plan is being reviewed and should be  ready for adoption in July.  </P> <P> David Jones, remedial branch chief of the EPA Western region, said CH2M Hill  has been paid $95,000 of the $207,000 budgeted for it to develop and implement  the plan. Jones stressed that community relations work, such as preparation and  distribution of fact sheets, has been done without waiting for the plan to be  completed.  </P> <P> The EPA and the state Department of Health Services hired CH2M Hill in 1983 to  write a plan dividing community relations tasks between the federal and state  agencies. That plan, completed in May, 1984, was outdated nine months later  when the state drastically reduced its role in the cleanup. But Neil Ziemba,  EPA manager of the San Gabriel Valley project, said the plan was still useful  because it outlined the tasks to be performed.  </P> <P> Amy Schwartz, EPA community relations coordinator, said work on revision of the  plan began in 1986 but was not completed until this year because other projects  had higher priority.  </P> <P> The federal government has spent more than $8.5 million on the San Gabriel  Valley ground water project, mostly for studies and engineering reports  characterizing the extent of the pollution and analyzing ways to treat  contaminated water.  </P> <P> Because the San Gabriel Valley project is run from the EPA Western regional  office in San Francisco, the only local access to EPA studies and reports is  through files maintained at libraries and water district offices.  </P> <P> The EPA sends information on the San Gabriel Valley project to eight libraries,  but ships complete files to only two -- in La Puente and Baldwin Park -- and to  a water resources center at UCLA and to the El Monte office of the Upper San  Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District.  </P> <P> Baca said that, on a recent visit to La Puente library, he found only a few  documents available. The Baldwin Park library's file also is incomplete. For  example, it is missing three of the six fact sheets that the EPA has issued.  </P> <P> The documents include maps of polluted areas, reports on contaminated wells and  proposals for water treatment projects.  </P> <P> Baca said that he called Ziemba to request that libraries be restocked with  documents, but was told that the agency is reluctant to do so because libraries  just throw the material away. Baca said that he then asked for documents to be  sent to him personally, but was told that he must file a request under the  Freedom of Information Act.  </P> <P> Ziemba said that, although there has been a problem with libraries discarding  the documents sent to them, EPA plans to restock library files by the end of  July. He said he had asked Baca to file a Freedom of Information request  because the EPA cannot supply its documents free to everyone in the San Gabriel  Valley who might want them, but he wanted to establish a basis for giving them  to Baca in his capacity as a representative of community groups.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Requests Rebuffed  </P> <P> Baca said he has tried to find out how the EPA is pursuing companies that are  responsible for leaking contaminants into ground water, but he has been  rebuffed on grounds that disclosure could harm the government's legal case. The  EPA's position, he said, makes it impossible for the public to judge the  agency's performance.  </P> <P> In addition, Baca said, the agency has never disclosed an overall plan for  cleaning up ground water in the San Gabriel Valley. It has invited public  comments only on scattered projects. The result, he said, has been to avoid  public scrutiny of the agency's strategy.  </P> <P> Ziemba said EPA is preparing a document that will outline proposed priorities  for cleanup projects and will seek public comments on the plan.  </P> <P> EPA spokesman Terry Wilson denied that the EPA is discouraging public  participation. In fact, he said, the agency offers $50,000 grants to help  community groups obtain technical assistance to study Superfund projects,  although no one has yet applied for a grant to study the San Gabriel Valley  ground water problem.  </P> <P> The EPA originally planned to organize a committee of residents, called a  community work group, to monitor the ground water cleanup effort. But the  revised community relations plan says that formation of such a group is being  abandoned for lack of interest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Citizens Group  </P> <P> However, without any funding from EPA, the League of Women Voters recently  organized a committee, called the Superfund Working/Information Group, to  monitor the cleanup project.  </P> <P> Mary Johnson, who used a $2,500 grant from the League of Women Voters Education  Fund to form SWIG, said she began by contacting community organizations that  might be interested in learning more about the water problem.  </P> <P> "The thing we did," she said, "was get on the telephone. We just called the  heads of organizations and from that, we were really surprised at the results  we got." She said the group's informational meetings attracted up to 70 people  and that about 30 people have indicated interest in meeting regularly to  monitor the water project.  </P> <P> Unlike Baca, Johnson said she has found the EPA staff interested in drawing the  community into the Superfund process. "The staff of EPA is terrific," she said.  "They are very happy to do anything we need."  </P> <P> But, she said, she sees little difference between the community work group,  which EPA's proposed community relation plan says cannot be organized, and  SWIG, which she and other residents have formed on their own.  </P> <P> Ziemba noted that public interest in the ground-water problem has risen and  fallen several times. When the EPA signed a cooperative agreement with the  Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District in 1985 to provide community  relations and technical assistance, he said, the district was going to play a  much bigger role than it is playing now.  </P> <P> </P> <P> District's Early Efforts  </P> <P> The district initially hired a full-time community relations officer to perform  work under the EPA contract. But the employee quit after six months to take  another job and was not replaced. Berlien said the community relations effort  was scaled back after it became clear that "there weren't any citizens groups  or community people that were particularly interested in what was going on."  </P> <P> Berlien said there was a flurry of interest in ground-water contamination at  the end of 1979 and in early 1980, when it was first disclosed that dozens of  San Gabriel Valley wells were contaminated with suspected cancer-causing  chemicals, such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE). There  was another burst of interest in 1985, he said, when the state Department of  Health Services notified 5,300 homes and businesses in Hacienda Heights that  their water was unfit to drink. The state withdrew the notice a few days later  after reassessing the health hazard.  </P> <P> But Berlien said it has been difficult to sustain public interest in  ground-water pollution because the contamination is scattered over a wide area,  and water suppliers have managed to meet state and federal drinking water  standards by drilling new wells and making other adjustments.  </P> <P> "People have always been told that their water is safe to drink," Berlien said.  "And that kind of confuses people, because they don't know whether they have a  problem or not."  </P> <P> In addition, Berlien said, the Superfund project is moving so slowly that it  seems pointless to hold community meetings when there is seldom anything new to  report. The EPA has estimated that it will take decades to bring the  contamination under control.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Final Plan  </P> <P> Under its cooperative agreement with the EPA, the water district is supposed to  help implement the community relations plan. Lacking a final plan, Berlien  said, his office has simply been doing what it thinks "needs to be done."  </P> <P> Berlien said he received the latest version of the community relations plan in  February along with a note from CH2M Hill that said: "We're planning to  incorporate final changes, print up and bind copies and send them out to the  repositories in the next two weeks or so."  </P> <P> Berlien said: "I haven't heard anything about it since then. What's happened to  it, I just don't know."  </P> <P> Berlien said the cooperative agreement originally was for 18 months, but it has  been extended without changing the spending ceiling of $402,205.  </P> <P> Although the water district is a contractor with EPA, it also has been a strong  critic of the cleanup effort.  </P> <P> At a congressional subcommittee hearing on the ground-water project conducted  by U.S. Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente) June 5 in Baldwin Park, Berlien  complained that the EPA has failed to develop a comprehensive plan and that  "water suppliers do not have a clear idea of where the cleanup project is  headed." He urged the EPA to provide more funding, hire more staff and open a  local office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Community Interest  </P> <P> The congressional hearing attracted 250 people, including representatives of  the East Valleys Organization, a church-based group that has declared its  intention to raise community concern about ground water to speed the cleanup.  </P> <P> Berlien said the creation of SWIG and the declaration by the East Valleys  Organization are the first evidence of strong community concern about ground  water since the brief surge of interest during the Hacienda Heights  contamination scare in 1985. But whether that interest will be sustained, he  said, remains to be seen, given the slow pace of the cleanup project.  </P> <P> The latest version of the community relations plan is based on community  interviews conducted three to six years ago. But even then there was impatience  with the rate of progress. The plan notes that "several people, including  elected officials, have stated their frustration with the length of time it is  taking to perform studies and take action to clean up the contamination."  </P></p>

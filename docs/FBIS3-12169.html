			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has commented publicly  for the first time on the decisions made at today's cabinet  session. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports:    [Begin recording] [Segal] Speaking in English to delegates  at the fifth conference of Jewish media, Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin sharply condemned the massacre in Hebron and said that the  peace process must continue. The prime minister was later  interviewed by Israeli correspondents and here is Yitzhaq  Rabin's first comment on the dramatic decisions made at today's  cabinet session. The prime minister was first asked about his  initial objection to the cabinet's ultimate decision to  establish of a state commission of inquiry on the massacre in  Hebron.    [Rabin] I think that we could have managed without it. I  think that it will occupy the attention of many military  elements because it is a state commission of inquiry. I assume  that everyone will want an attorney to look into how to prepare  his defense. I think it will divert a great deal of attention  from the main goal. However, since the issue was brought up with  the support of several cabinet ministers, and since I do not  fear the findings of such a commission -- especially not with  regard to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] or the defense  establishment in general -- I would prefer not to sidetrack the  main effort of getting the peace negotiations back on track by  starting arguments over whether or not a commission of inquiry  should be set up. Therefore, let us appoint such a commission.    [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, to how many of the radical  settlers do today's cabinet decisions apply?    [Rabin] The security forces, the IDF, and jurists will  examine each case. Each such proceeding -- and we even decided  on administrative detentions -- will be carried out by the  military commander; or in other words, the right of appeal will  be heard before a military appeals committee with a military  judge and not by the defense minister and a civilian judge from  an Israeli District Court, as was the case in the past.    [Segal] Are we talking about individual cases, or dozens,  hundreds, or thousands of people?    [Rabin] I do not want to specify numbers. This decision  does not deal with numbers or isolated steps. This is a policy  which we will implement on a selective basis whenever required  against certain people. I think that such people, while only a  small minority among the settlers, constitute the focal point of  friction, especially, but not only, in the Hebron area. The  cabinet's decisions apply solely to them and not to the great  majority of settlers in the territories.    [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, the PLO has already rejected  today's cabinet decisions as insufficient. What is your  reaction to this?    [Rabin] The cabinet's decisions were adopted by the Israeli  Government which decides what will happen. If some people do  not like them, then that is a pity.    [Segal] Could this hinder the resumption of the peace talks?    [Rabin] These are our decisions. I see no reason not to  resume the negotiations unless the PLO and the Palestinians want  to reward someone who not only murdered Palestinians but sought  to murder the peace process.    [Segal] Mr. Rabin, the country is on fire. There is rioting  in the territories, in Yafo, and even in the Bedouin settlements  in the Negev. What in your opinion can be done to stop this  wave of rioting?    [Rabin] The despicable murder carried out in Hebron against  worshipers at a site holy to both Jews and Muslims has  undoubtedly inflamed passions. Just try to imagine what would  have happened had such a massacre taken place at a holy site  where Jews were praying. Would we not all be up in arms?    [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, do you believe that the talks  with the PLO in Washington could resume this week?    [Rabin] As far as Israel is concerned, the answer is yes.  The ball is currently in the PLO's court.    [Segal] In his speech earlier this evening, Rabin revealed  that the state commission of inquiry would be chaired by Supreme  Court Justice Me'ir Shamgar.

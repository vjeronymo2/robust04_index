In some areas along that part of the border, which is close  to the town of Khorog, the opposition also plans to lay mines  made of explosives stolen from state storehouses, the bureau  said. It said the border guard command had launched a set of  measures to ensure the safety of troops and stabilize the  situation on the Khorog section of the border.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As pollution prevention methods become more accepted and their efficient and effective performance is better established, insurance firms will be more likely to account for the potential risk-reducing benefits of pollution prevention programs in setting insurance premiums. EPA requests that industry discuss the likelihood and possible extent of such savings in its comments on the proposed regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5. Savings From Reduced Cost of Capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Compliance by pollution prevention under Option 3/S can provide financial benefits to firms by reducing the cost of capital. Decreases in the amount of pesticides being used can reduce contingent liabilities associated with worker safety and environmental compliance issues, and may also provide preferential recognition and valuation in the public capital markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The factors that influence the cost of capital to a firm include: the firm's expected financial performance; the variability of the firm's financial performance; the financial structure of the firm and the associated variability in the performance of the instruments by which the firm's assets are financed; and the relationship of the variability in the firm's own financial performance to that of other firms and competing investment opportunities. These factors determine the overall riskiness of a firm as an investment or lending opportunity. In general, actions that reduce the riskiness or expected variability of a firm's financial performance will reduce its cost of capital. Adoption of pollution prevention measures can reduce the riskiness of the firm's financial performance through:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Avoidance of contingent liabilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For similar reasons to those outlined above for reduced insurance costs, use of pollution prevention measures by PFPR facilities can reduce contingent liabilities that pose a risk for creditors and investors. For example, more efficient use of PAIs and the use of dedicated lines for each PAI or product can reduce the overall level of worker exposure to PAIs due to elimination or reduction of cleanup due to product changeover. In addition, the reduction or reuse of PAIs can reduce or eliminate pollutant discharges, thereby reducing risks to the surrounding community from accidental spills or leakage and also reducing the risk of being found in violation of discharge limits. Each of these contingencies may pose a financial risk to the firm. Elimination or reduction of such contingent liabilities should reduce uncertainty about future financial performance and result in lower required returns for creditors and investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Increased managerial control of the firm <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Facilities that prevent pollution associated with PAI use will be better able to control the financial impact of environmental regulations. Firms that limit but continue to discharge effluents are left with the risk of achieving compliance with possibly more stringent environmental requirements in the future. Firms that implement pollution prevention (i.e., source reduction and recycling of wastewaters) to eliminate discharges are proactively avoiding, and therefore controlling, the possibility of these future compliance costs. The removal of this cost uncertainty should make those firms that adopt pollution prevention less risky to invest in or lend to.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preferential recognition and valuation by investors and lenders <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Some investors preferentially search for firms that apply effective and proactive pollution prevention programs. For example, some mutual funds include a social/environmental responsibility component in their charter. Firms that are perceived as environmentally responsible may be awarded a higher valuation and lower cost of capital in the public capital markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Improved firm financial performance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Finally, some consumers may favor products of firms that are perceived as environmentally responsible (as defined by the individual consumer). To the extent that a mechanism exists for consumers to be aware that a given firm has undertaken pollution prevention programs, consumers may favor that firm's products over those of its competitors and thus improve the firm's business prospects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on the likelihood and possible extent of such financial benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, although EPA has been able to quantify only partially the potential cost-savings benefits of pollution prevention, EPA believes that these benefits may significantly improve the financial circumstances of many facilities and firms that choose pollution prevention as a means of complying with the proposed PFPR effluent limitation guideline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I.

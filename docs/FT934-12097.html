			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): New dawn for the fiftysomethings - Design for an ageing population Forget the youth market. The only growing sector of the UK population is the over 50s, according to Danielle Barr of the 3rd Age marketing consultancy. National census figures indicate the population aged 50-54 will rise by 29 per cent between 1991 and 2001. The same group, by then aged 60-64, will increase 32 per cent over the next decade. Marketers and manufacturers have arguably been slow to awaken to this grey dawn. But at a conference at London's Royal College of Art next month*, designers and advertising people will attempt to show that design for this age group can bring a wide range of benefits. In the past, design for the elderly demanded the creation of products to satisfy 'special needs' associated with various degrees of disability. Innovation is still vitally necessary here, but there is a new agenda, too. Increasingly, people entering what has been called their 'third age' from 50 to 75 are able-bodied, mobile and affluent. Dire predictions have been made of conflict between generations as a swollen elderly population gobbles up resources amassed from the taxes paid by a proportionally smaller working population. It is possible that the wealth of the new elderly will be largely consumed in paying for their own health care. But it is equally possible that healthier living followed eventually by sudden natural death - a phenomenon known as the compression of morbidity  -will leave them free to make more pleasurable purchases. The problem is that there are not yet the products aimed to please these people. 'What l don't see enough of are things l can't wait to own,' says Roger Coleman, director of the Design Age programme at the RCA who turned 50 this year. Services such as holidays and financial services can be safely targeted at this group, but it seems products cannot afford to be explicit about their suitability for older people for fear of deterring other buyers. Yet, as Coleman points out, 'these are the people who were led to believe in their youth that their wish was the manufacturer's command. Should we expect them, for example, now to wear dowdy clothes?' A few manufacturers recognise the 50-plus generation is the one that grew up with rock and roll. Levi's range of jeans using the euphemism 'loose fit' could be seen as hinting that they suit the broader beam of older people. Some car manufacturers have not taken on board - either in their designs or in their advertising - the fact that more than 40 per cent of small to medium-sized cars are bought by people aged 45 or more. The supermarket chain, Safeway, was sceptical, too. It became a sponsor of the Design Age programme because it thought it might gain publicity, rather than because it thought it might learn something. However, in projects with RCA students aimed at finding ways of making shopping easier for the elderly, Richard Scott, director of construction at Safeway Stores, discovered that many ideas benefit all customers and some bring immediate advantage to the retailer as well. One idea was to lower the height of the top shelves in Safeway stores, helping the young and the old and easing shelf-loading. Another project was to create a basket carrier for elderly customers with relatively small amounts of shopping, so they would not be encumbered by a heavy basket on one arm. The right carrier design should bring additional benefits. By pushing their baskets in front of them, customers would carve a narrower path, allowing more comfortable shopping. 'The most extraordinary thing is how quickly people understand the principle of universality in design,' says Scott. Design for the elderly can lead to better design for all. * 'Design for our Future Selves' conference, November 9-12 at the Royal College of Art, Kensington Gore, London SW7 2EU. The organisers would welcome business and industry delegates. Roger Coleman: Tel 071 584 5020.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Auditing rules welcomed THREE QUARTERS of accountants believe the new self-regulatory mechanisms for auditors have improved the quality of their auditing, an academic survey reports. Only 5 per cent of their clients have noticed any change, though, except for an increase in fees, since audit regulation was introduced by the professional accountancy bodies in October. The findings come in an analysis of the experiences of 160 practitioners by Ms Stella Fearnley of Southampton University and Mr Michael Page of Portsmouth University. Accountancy firms said audit regulation had helped them enhance standards of work with more systematic recording of work performed, changes in audit methods, better planning and more staff training. They said audit regulation was costing a significant amount. Set-up costs for firms with three or fewer partners were Pounds 4,900 on average and recurring fixed costs were estimated at Pounds 3,400, most of which represented lost time. They said little had been recovered through fees to clients. Four fifths called for the abolition of the statutory audit for smaller companies but most wanted some remaining safeguards to preserve the quality of the financial information presented. The study reflects the conclusions published last month in the official report to the Department of Trade and Industry from the three chartered accountancy bodies covering the UK. It shows that only 11 of the 158 randomly chosen auditors visited in the first year met all 13 quality control tests drawn up and emphasised that there were 'procedural shortfalls' in many firms. There are an estimated 10,200 auditors registered with the three chartered accountancy institutes and a further 1,000 with the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. But 160 firms between them audit all listed companies, with eight firms auditing three quarters of them. Only 20 firms each audit more than five listed companies. Two thirds of auditors are sole practitioners and 90 per cent have four or fewer partners.</p>

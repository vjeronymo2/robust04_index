How on earth  should we handle this situation that emerges from the process of  advancement and development? The deputies of the people's  congress and the members of the provincial committee of Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], who were  attending the current sessions, frankly and sincerely aired  their views and suggestions.    According to the information dispatched by reporters (Fan  Shijun) and (Zhang Guoxing) from the sessions, Hebei Province  effected a relatively big increase in financial revenues in 1993  to make a new breakthrough of historical significance.  According to statistics, the province's financial revenue  totaled 14.39 billion yuan, an increase of 44.4 percent over the  previous year, exceeding the average national increase level by  4.5 percentage points. In 1993, governments and financial and  tax departments at all levels in the province kept the idea of  invigorating the economy firmly in mind, and tried all possible  means to realize the program on invigorating Hebei's economy as  well as various other objectives. Major indicators were that  various fields raised and circulated funds to accelerate the  construction of key projects, continued to increase input in  agriculture, continued to support the technological renovation  of large and medium-sized enterprises, and continued to launch  the activities of creating high-revenue counties and eliminating  subsidy receiving counties, yielding remarkable results. Fengnan  and Huanghua counties's realization of 100 million yuan in  financial revenue in 1992, was followed by Qian, Fengning,  Zunhua, Wuan, Fengrun, Yutian, and Hengshui so that they joined  1993's list of counties with 100 million yuan in financial  revenue. [passage omitted]    In 1993, the province made a breakthrough of historical  significance in financial revenues that was fully affirmed by  the deputies of the provincial people's congress and the members  of the provincial CPPCC committee who were attending the current  sessions. However, the deputies and the members also worried  about the tight financial circumstances in some localities. In  particular, some localities were unable to issue wages on  schedule, that caused great concern among deputies and members.  Chen Hui, vice chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee and  deputy director of the provincial committee of the China  Democratic National Construction Association, revealed in her  speech to the session that according to the statistics compiled  early this year, the province as a whole owed teachers of  primary and middle schools a large amount of wages, thus not  only affecting teachers' enthusiasm but also forcing some key  teachers to change jobs frequently. Director of the province's  financial department, Zhang Xianpu, analyzes the reasons for the  large increase of financial revenue in some parts of the  province, and the tight financial situation in others, in his  report on the implementation of the 1993 provincial budget and  the 1994 draft budget: The first reason was that although the  province as a whole effected a relatively big increase in  financial revenues last year, the increase was mainly brought  about by localities at or above the city and prefectural levels,  and the increase in localities at or below the county level was  not as great. Only 28 counties and county-level cities  surpassed the national revenue average. Some counties and  county-level cities did not effect an increase in their  revenues, and some even experienced a decline. The second  reason was that factors for revenue increases due to policy  increased, and, in particular, appropriations used as wages  increased. The third reason was the low quality of many  products of the province, and the difficulties in production and  management that was experienced by some enterprises. The fourth  reason was the indulgence in serious extravagance and waste by  some localities and units which incurred huge losses of state  property. [passage omitted]</p>

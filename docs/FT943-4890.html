			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Free trade pledge sought Australia and Japan will push for a free trade pledge at the next summit of the Asian Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum in Indonesia in November, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said yesterday at the end of a four-day visit to Japan, Australia's largest trade partner, that he thought Japan wanted 'to see a commitment to trade liberalisation in the region'. Mr Keating's announcement came after talks with Mr Tomiichi Murayama, his Japanese counterpart. The Australian leader gave firm backing for Japan's attempt to become a permanent member of the UN security council. In return, Mr Murayama promised Australia that it would not be excluded form any trade accord between Tokyo and Washington, believed to be the first such guarantee from a Japanese prime minister, said Australian officials.</p>

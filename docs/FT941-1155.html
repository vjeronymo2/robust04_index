			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sad story Sir, Buyers of books who hope to bequeath their libraries in useable condition to their children will be saddened by your report (Commodities, March 16) that 'buyers are reluctant to pay adequate premiums for the chlorine-free product (paper)'. Five per cent extra on the price of a book or periodical would cover the cost of paper destined to last a century or more, and I would be more than willing to pay for it. Too many of my books and periodicals bought 20 to 50 years ago are already beginning to turn brown, to disintegrate. Perhaps there is a case for pressure by governments, such as has worked so well for 'green' petrol. Peter Parkinson, 2 Rue de la Croix, 11200 Cruscades, Lezignan-Corbieres, France</p>

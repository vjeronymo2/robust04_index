			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Improvement for Lotus Development LOTUS Development, the US personal computer software company, reported improved fourth-quarter earnings despite a slight drop in sales. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 14.6m, or 35 cents a share, up from Dollars 5.8m, or 14 cents, a year ago when the company took a Dollars 24.4m restructuring charge. Revenues declined 1 per cent to Dollars 246m from Dollars 249.2m. A pre-tax gain of Dollars 15m from the sale of stock in Sybase, another software company, was offset by a Dollars 15m pre-tax restructuring charge for costs associated primarily with the closure of the company's Puerto Rican manufacturing subsidiary. For the year, Lotus reported net income of Dollars 80.4m, or Dollars 1.87 a share, up from Dollars 43.1m, or 98 cents, in 1991. Revenues increased 9 per cent to Dollars 900.1m from Dollars 828.9m. Sales of Sybase stock produced a pre-tax gain of Dollars 49.7m for the year. Excluding extraordinary items in both years, net income declined by 7 per cent to Dollars 57.2m.</p>

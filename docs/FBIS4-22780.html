			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Podlipskiy: "The Commission on </F> Operational Questions: The Antimonopoly Committee Revolted  Against the System"]    [Text] The members of the governmental commission on  operational questions yesterday unequivocally accepted the  opinion of the Antimonopoly Committee that fundamental reform of  the Russian system of goods certification is needed. However,  the GKAP [State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of  New Economic Structures] did not really expect to convince all  opponents immediately; obviously one of its objectives was  simply acquainting first vice premier Oleg Soskovets with an  alternative viewpoint on this problem.    Sergey Bezverkhiy, chairman of the Committee on  Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, presented his  view of the department's problems in present conditions.  According to him, Russia has now joined three international  certification systems and is already completing negotiations to  join several others (certification of metals, composites, and  railway transport). But there are a number of unresolved  problems in the domestic system. Above all this means the weak  legislative base; in Russia only 6 normative enactments "cover"  this area, while there are 33 of them in Japan, 160 in the  United States, and more than 300 in the European Community.  Moreover, the switch from the Soviet certification system to a  purely Russian one--GOST R [All-Russian State Standard]--must be  accompanied by a concurrent reworking of the "Soviet" standards.  But the Committee's capabilities do not allow it to conduct  refinement of the 26,000 old GOST's quickly.    Oleg Soskovets gave his opinion on the report briefly:  "Resounding, but nonsensical." The first vice premier treated  the Antimonopoly Committee expert's report, which generally  questioned the feasibility of preserving the Russian  certification system in the present form, with much greater  attention. In the GKAP's opinion, at least two defects are  inherent in it. The first is, that from a practical standpoint,  the mandatory procurement of a certificate of compliance with  national GOST's (which, incidentally, is a purely Russian  invention) provides the Russian exporter with no advantage--the  quality of the Russian (Soviet) standards themselves is yet to  be proven in the West. By the way, even on the domestic market  the system of total certification has not resulted in better  quality goods. The second defect is that monitoring and  commercial functions are combined in the Committee--the right to  issue certificates of compliance is delegated only to testing  centers and laboratories under the Committee's jurisdiction. At  the present time, GKAP specialists possess information on  "arrangements" (for example, by the certification company  "Rostest-Moskva" [Russia-test Moscow] with Moscow customs) which  result in the formation of a monopoly on this type of services.    [First Box]    During the period 1992-1993, more than 225,000 certificates  were issued on Russian output, including 180,000 for foodstuffs.  Moreover, about 108,000 certificates were issued for imported  output, and of them about 100,000 were for food products. More  than 2,600 types of goods did not receive certificates because  they did not meet safety requirements, and that includes 2,000  types of food products.    [Second Box]    Russia has joined the following international certification  systems:     -  highway transport means certification system  (Geneva Convention of the United Nations European Economic  Commission);    -  MEK [International Electrotechnical Commission]  electrical equipment testing system for compliance with safety  standards (accreditation of Russian laboratories within its  framework scheduled for May 1994);    -  Brussels Convention on Mutual  Recognition of Control Marks for Firearms and Ammunition  (accreditation of Russian laboratories scheduled for June 1994).</p>

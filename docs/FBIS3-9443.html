Assessing relations between both states, Walesa said that "it  is not so good that it could not be better."    The president granted an interview to representatives of the  Hungarian media in connection with an official visit to Poland  by Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, which starts on Monday [28  March].    "I am going to call for jointly encouraging our governments  and businessmen for greater cooperation; this has to be  strengthened, and the visit is to serve this purpose," the  president said when asked what he expected from Goncz's visit.    Walesa did not rule out an increase in military cooperation  between Poland and Hungary. "We cannot build any kind of third  structure because neither the West nor Russia would be happy  about it, but we have to say that, if our freedom and  sovereignty are in danger, we will fight. There is no free  Poland without a free Hungary," the president said.    Asked to comment on his conflicts with parliament and on  prospects of the present Sejm, the president said: "Such  conflicts will always exist until we stabilize our political  systems. The previous parliaments did not live through their  full terms of office. If the public is satisfied with the  present parliament, it will survive."</p>

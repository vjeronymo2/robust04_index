			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (7): Avoiding the pitfalls / Profile of Salomon Brothers Buried in the annual report of the Association of Foreign Banks in Germany is a sentence which expresses foreign bankers' frustrations at doing business in Germany. 'The universal banking system prevailing in Germany. . . knows how to successfully prevent competitors from penetrating traditional business relationships,' the report says, lamenting the fact that foreign banks' share of the German banking market has stuck at a modest 5 per cent. 'Many foreign banks stub their toes in this market,' agrees Mr Nicholas Coulson who joined the board of Salomon Brothers' German operations last year. Salomon is one which has managed to avoid the pitfalls and 'make intelligent use of the opportunities' which present themselves in Germany, the former S. G. Warburg executive says. Salomon made DM40.3m net profits in 1992 and had a DM10.2bn balance sheet at the end of that year. The figures for 1993 have not been released yet but Mr Dan Lee, Arkansas-born managing director of Salomon's German operations, says that they improved substantially. In itself this is not surprising, given the excellent conditions prevailing in the world capital markets last year, but there is no doubt that Salomon has developed a strong franchise within Germany - the most recent figures from the Association of Foreign Banks show that in 1992 Salomon was the most profitable foreign investment bank in Germany, with the biggest balance sheet. If a year ago one had asked around the Frankfurt banking community why this should be, rivals would have put it down to Mr Peter Coym and Mr Frank Beelitz, the two men who opened up Salomon's German operation in 1986. But they left last year to join Lehman Brothers where they are hoping to repeat the success they enjoyed at Salomon. Mr Lee argues that the personnel changes have had no disruptive impact on Salomon's development - below board level, the senior management team has remained extremely stable in the seven years that Salomon has been in Germany, he says. The firm has done wll precisely because of the continuity of client coverage in Germany, Mr Lee claims, combined with the ability to deploy the resources of Salomon's worldwide network for the benefit of German clients. Another attraction has been a relatively cheap source of funds. 'Over the past seven years Germany has evolved to be one of Salomon's cheaper sources of financing worldwide,' Mr Lee explains. 'This allows us to run large trading positions here and to fund the rest of the group.' The bank's profits, he says, come chiefly from trading in government securities, equities and derivatives, and from capital market transactions where the bank makes use of its international placing power. In the Eurobond markets, it was joint lead-manager last year - with Deutsche Bank - on the World Bank's D-Mark Global Bond issue, the first of its kind, as well as on two smaller issues raising DM300m. In the domestic D-Mark bond market it was lead manager on a DM750m issue for the state of Baden-Wurttemberg. This year, Salomon lead-managed the second-ever D-Mark Global Bond, a DM2bn issue for the public sector L-Bank. It was also co-lead manager, co-manager or underwriter in 11 Eurobond issues and six domestic bond issues, following on from 100 such mandates last year. The bank has about 125 people working in Germany: 40 on the trading floor, 55 in the back office and the rest providing corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, research and other services. Salomon plans to expand at a pace consistent with the growth of new business opportunities. Mr Lee stresses that there is no hurry to achieve any targeted growth in personnel, recognising that finding the right people can be difficult in Frankfurt, given the intense competition to employ native Germans who have had experience of working in the Anglo-American financial services sector.</p>

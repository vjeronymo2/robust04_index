			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: BEIJING;  </P> <P> THE PLAYING FIELDS OF ASIA  </P> <P> Politics are mixing with sports in Beijing this week as athletes from divided  nations meet on and off the playing fields in the Asian Games.  </P> <P> In a sign of easing tensions between Nationalist Taiwan and Communist mainland  China, a team from Taiwan will be competing under the name "Chinese Taipei."  The presence of teams from both North Korea and South Korea has helped raise  enough excitement in Seoul that 416 South Korean journalists are registered to  cover the events. The games, which run to Oct. 7, are also providing a pretext  for expanded diplomatic contacts between Beijing and Hanoi, which have had  tense relations since a brief border war in 1979.  </P></p>

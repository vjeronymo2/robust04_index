			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Steady demand for Austrian bank's offering The eurobond market saw a large number of new issues yesterday in a variety of currencies, with Osterreichische Kontrollbank's Dollars 400m offering of five-year bonds the main attraction. The fixed-rate bonds, which mark the Austrian bank's first foray into the dollar sector since September 1993, were priced to yield 17 basis points over US government bonds. Syndicate managers said the pricing was quite tight compared with similar eurobonds already in the market, such as the World Bank's five-year global bond, trading at 11 basis points over, and Japan Development Bank's eurobond, which is trading at 22 over. Nevertheless, they found steady demand from retail investors in Switzerland and the UK, and good institutional support, lead manager Goldman Sachs said. One syndicate manager said: 'The deal should have come around 20 basis points over, but nevertheless it will go well.' Another official said: 'They chose the right part of the yield curve to marry retail and institutional demand, although not all the bonds will be sold at 17 over.' The bonds are due to be freed to trade this morning, after being held in syndicate overnight for the opening of the Japanese market. The return of cautious optimism to government bond markets following the German elections, and a shortage of US economic statistics this week has boosted new eurobond issuance in recent days, syndicate officials said. 'There has been a lot of activity in the last couple of days on the back of the elections in Germany,' said one salesman. 'We are also approaching the year-end and many lead managers are bidding to move up the league table.' Late in the session, Abbey National First Capital BV launched a Dollars 500m offering of 10-year yankee bonds priced at 62.5 basis points over US government bonds. In the lira sector, the European Investment Bank launched a L200bn offering of four-year bonds, with a coupon of 10.15 per cent, fungible with the L400bn offering of bonds launched last week. Sources said the proceeds were swapped into floating-rate lire.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Observer: Marshalls law No doubt the great and the good attending today's CBI conference on corporate governance will continue to huff and puff about the need for non-executive directors. But are the institutions which put up the money doing any more than pay lip service to the idea? Take yesterday's Pounds 20m rights issue from Marshalls, the Halifax-based building materials firm. After 22 years at the helm, David Marshall stepped down as chairman last year handing over to brother Andrew. Although the Marshall family does not have a huge stake in the company, six out of the eight directors in its last annual report were called Marshall. Like most firms in its industry, Marshalls is going through a bit of a rough patch and it might have been thought that the City would insist on a few non-executive directors to keep an eye on the shop in return for underwriting the new capital. However, adviser Samuel Montagu insists that 'these guys are straightforward Yorkshire folk' and sees no need for them to bow to the latest fashion.</p>

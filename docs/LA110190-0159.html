			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD-CARE ZONING  </P> <P> The lack of logic on the part of the Glendale City Council has once again  presented itself with the question of not allowing child-care facilities in  residential areas. Given the current lack of adequate child-care resources, I  am amazed that the council members could simply dismiss the possibility of  taking advantage of this much needed community asset.  </P> <P> Even more difficult to understand is the pride our city leaders have taken in  the new electronic sign at Glendale College. Didn't anyone consider that the  money spent on it could have been better used to subsidize the college's new  child-care center -- a facility where no student can afford to take his child?  </P> <P> Since the City Council and the administrators of Glendale College can't see  where the real need lies, why can't Carnation and Glendale Federal realize that  their monetary contributions would benefit the community more if they were put  toward the early children education of Glendale's youngest citizens? I, for  one, would feel much more inclined to patronize these businesses if I could  witness their real commitment to our community.  </P> <P> DONNA FUREY  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan at the ANC </F> press center at the Carlton Center in Johannesburg -- live; at  1635 GMT TV 1 coverage is interrupted and broadcasting of the  conference continues on SABC CCV Television]    [Text] [Correspondent Estelle Pienaar] The ANC press  briefing is about to get under way. It will be addressed by Dr.  Pallo Jordan, assisting him is Carl Niehaus and also Marcel  Golding. Over to you, Pallo.    [Jordan] We are going into a very big ANC victory, and  though  there are at this point very limited figures available, based on  those figures we are projecting a majority of about 58 percent  for the ANC. We expect that we will be able to see that  reflected during the course of tonight in the figures produced  by the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]. We are  also expecting possible gains in Natal, the [Orange] Free State,  the Eastern Cape, and the Western Cape which could result in  that 58 percent figure, perhaps to 60 percent or more.    At this point we are still very confident that the current  ANC lead in the Northern Cape will hold, and based on our  returns, which are running slightly ahead of those that are made  available by the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], we  think that lead is going to be maintained. We are particularly  pleased about the strong showing of the Colored vote for the  ANC, and we think this is in part due to the fact that in the  Northern Cape Colored voters were evenly split in their support  between the NP [National Party] and the ANC, in sharp contrasts  to the trends that we have noted in the Western Cape. This is  particularly true for Colored voters in the rural areas where  our figures indicate that 4.5 percent rural vote went to the ANC  and against 55 percent of the NP.    The same was true of the urban areas such as Kimberley, and  we think that this reflects a change in the rest of the country  which differs very sharply from what occurred in the Western  Cape. We see the same trend also in Uitenhage, in Eastern Cape,  and other areas.    At this point in time the figures for the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] are exceedingly low because the  counting started so late. At this moment in time we are showing  a majority in excess of 64 percent, but we think that 60 percent  is closer to the actual showing we'll make. So one can expect  that 64 percent that we're seeing at present in the PWV might  well drop to around 60 percent. There are African rural areas,  many of whom were unfamiliar with the ANC at the beginning of  this campaign, and where we have struggled very hard to  familiarize people with the ANC and also to familiarize people  even with the symbol of the ANC and its slogans, showing a  particularly strong and high level of support for the ANC. In  areas such as the Northern Transvaal it runs as high as 98  percent among Africans in the rural areas. In the Eastern  Transvaal as high as 91 percent, and in the North West as high  as about 97 percent.    We think that this is extraordinary consolidation of the  support of the ANC in the rural areas in particular. The other  trend that we have noted in the election is that the Democratic  Party [DP] campaign does not seem to have paid out. We read  this in part as owing to the DP's concentration on an anti-ANC  campaign which has resulted in may white voters voting for the  NP at the expense of the DP. The DP in fact on current showing,  and we admit that these are early days, and most of the huge  urban areas have not yet reported back, but that showing at  present, it looks like the DP is going to fall into something  like forty, and will be replaced by the Freedom Front as the  second largest party among white voters.    The other trend which we have noted is that the PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] doesn't seem to be faring as well as  many had expected. There doesn't seem to be any identifiable  area of the country where the PAC has been able to show visible  support. This is true of areas where people expected it to make  a good showing such as the Transkei, the Northern Transvaal and  Eastern Cape. Early polling has showed that there are some gains  we are going to make in various parts of the Cape including the  Western Cape. We expect that by the time counting?closes in the  Western Cape you will note that the ANC total will increase by  about 4 or 5 points from the 24 percent that we're showing at  present. We will now attend to questions, thank you.    [Correspondent Callie Long] Dr. Jordan, four warrants have  been issued in connection with ballot papers that were destined  for the East Rand and Soweto. Do you regard this in a serious  light? Is it going to affect the outcome?    [Jordan] At this point in time one would not like to  speculate about that particular disclosure. We did mention a  few days ago that there were indications that there was mischief  afoot in this election, and we pointed specifically to the  non-arrivals of ballot papers especially in areas like the East  Rand and Soweto. We would like that very much in the hands of  the IEC to investigate, and we will defer (? some day). We  wouldn't like to speculate about the significance of that at  this point in time.    [Correspondent Sefakunyaka] Dr. Jordan, it is quite clear  that the National party and the African National Congress are  guaranteed a place in Parliament. Would you be prepared to  engage in the lottery of crystal ball gazing and tell us which  other parties you think might also come in, and how will this  affect a government of national unity?    [Jordan] The ANC commitment to establishing a government of  national unity remains unchanged and we will honor the terms of  the interim constitution that any party that gains 5 percent of  the ballot in the elections is entitled to sit in the government  of national unity. At this point in time the parties that  nationally will feature it would appear are the NP and the  Freedom Front perhaps. One is uncertain of what status the DP  will have at the end of counting, but as I say, we have not had  returns from the huge urban areas as yet, which might of course  change the picture very dramatically with respect to the DP.    [Unidentified correspondent] The PAC has virtually  disappeared from the political scene. Do you attach any  specific importance to that and what have you got for the  policies of the future?    [Jordan] Well, I would say that it is premature to make a  judgment about the significance of that. It is just something  that one is noting, because there had been high expectations of  the PAC's performance in certain parts of the country. I  wouldn't like to speculate about its significance at this point  in time.    [Correspondent Angie Caplianos] What is your reaction to the  slow flow of results coming in?    [Jordan] The slow flow of results, I suppose, is as a result  of some of the problems that the IEC has encountered. We are  aware, for example, that in an urban area such as Durban,  counting only started this morning. In the PWV, there seem to  have been a lot of teetthing problems all of yesterday and  counting started very late. In other urban areas, there were  instances of sit-down strike and go-slow by counters and that,  of course, has also [word indistinct] very negatively on the  rate at which we are receiving the returns. When we started  this conference, I don't think they had even reached the 20  percent mark yet, in terms of the votes that had been counted.  It means that the nail-biting will continue longer, but I don't  think we can help it.    [Correspondent] Mac Maharaj was quoted today as saying that  even if some parties didn't get 5 percent, they may be invited  to join in a government of national unity to increase stability  in the country. Is that an ANC position?    [Jordan] Now, the ANC has always been very insistent that we  want to make government as inclusive as possible and we want to  enhance stability and I am sure that that is the viewpoint which  could be looked at. Mac Maharaj at that point probably was  expressing a personal opinion, but it is one personal opinion  that runs counter to the thrust of ANC policy.    [Correspondent] It looks like the Freedom Front was able to  get a lot of support from the Afrikaner community. Now, you made  a commitment that if the Freedom Front got substantial support,  you would look again at the issue of a volkstaat [Afrikaner  homeland]. Are you still looking at that? Secondly, does that  change the attitude toward the Afrikaner community in a sense  that now there is a substantial support for a party which  actually does not want to be run or does not accept your  governnment, in a sense that they want to have their own  volkstaat.    [Jordan] No, our attitude to the Afrikaner community remains  unchanged. Afrikaners, like all other South Africans, are part  of this country. They have a home in this country and, in the  view of the ANC, they will always have a place in South Africa.  As to the issue of a volkstaat, our commitment to discuss the  issue of a volkstaat also remains unchanged. We have not said  that we will ever entertain the notion of a volkstaat. What we  have said is that we are prepared to discuss the idea of a  volkstaat with those who support it, with a view to ensuring  that those who want a volkstaat, and want to pursue a volkstaat  do not engage in unconstitutional activities or in armed  activity to attain their objectives. It doesn't mean that we  will ever embrace the notion of a volkstaat ourselves.    [Correspondent] I think one of the areas which is concerning  a lot of people is Natal. There have been reports of a number  of areas where ANC party officials were picked up, and I wonder  what happened. How many objections have actually really been  registered by the ANC?    [Jordan] The issues you raised have been placed before the  IEC and we have submitted quite a number of complaints with  respect to that with the IEC. In addition to that, we have also  placed a number of protests and brought to the notice of the IEC  other irregularities which you have not mentioned. We are aware  for example that there were a number of pirate voting stations  in various points of Natal. We've brought those to the notice  of the IEC. We've brought to the notice of the IEC other  irregularities, but we are leaving those matters very much in  the hands of the IEC because that is the machinery that was set  in place to deal with them.    [Correspondent] You seem to be conceding that you have no  chance of reaching 67 percent. I know you are worried that the  National Party will have a stranglehold on constitutional  changes in the future.    [Jordan] We are not conceding that we will not reach 67  percent. Every party goes into an election with a view to  winning as large a majority as it can win. It's like going into  a cricket match and saying, oh well, if you reach a century you  we will be content. You don't go in like that. You go in there  to knock the socks off the other team. If you make 2,000, good  luck to you. If your entire team comes out scoring ducks, too  bad; I mean, that's the way the game is played.    [Correspondent Gregory Katz] How would you explain the  party's relative lack of support in the Western Cape among the  coloreds?    [Jordan] I'm sure there are a whole number of reasons why we  were not able to win as much support in the colored community as  we had hoped for. One of those reasons I'm sure is a long past  during which the Western Cape, during the days of apartheid, was  regarded as the colored preference area which produced  competition for jobs, for scarce resources between African and  colored communities. I'm sure that is one explanation. But  certainly there are others as well.    [Correspondent] There is a very good showing of the Inkatha  party in KwaZulu/Natal. Is there a possibility that there will  be a national position for Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi (word  indistinct) the ANC's position?    [Jordan] The positions in the government of national unity  will not be determined by your performance in any particular  province. They will be determined by your performance in the  country as a whole. But as I said, the crux of ANC policy is  inclusivity; so we would not exclude the idea of the IFP being  part of a government of national unity even if the performance  does not measure up to the constitutional requirements.    [Correspondent] A similar question with respect to the  Freedom Front. They've made a reasonably -- at this point  anyway. [sentence as heard] Is there any likelihood that they  will be in a government of national unity? Related to that, how  does the ANC and its government expect to ensure minority rights?    [Jordan] To deal with the latter part of the question first,  we have never thought in terms of minority rights. We have  always thought in terms of individual rights. We've always said  that a constitution that guarantees the right of every South  African citizen, ipso facto protects the right of collectivity  of South African citizens, whether they are a majority or a  minority within the population. Secondly, the first part of  your question. It will be up to the Freedom Front, if it makes  that five percent ceiling threshold, whether or not it wants to  participate in the government of national unity. There is no  requirement that a party that scores that 5 percent threshold  should participate in the government. What the constitution  says is that it is eligible to participate. It's up to the  party whether it wants to exercise that option or not. So that  will be something you will have to put to the Freedom Front,  whether it wants to participate in a government of national  unity if it makes that 5 percent threshold.    [Correspondent] Will it be advised to do so by the ANC  government?    [Jordan] The constitution requires us to do so even if we  didn't want to do so, but we will invite it nonetheless.    [Correspondent] Just to follow up on the question about what  looks like the ANC did not achieve a two-thirds majority. Are  you disappointed in that result and what impact will this have  on the constitution-building and nation-building process down  the road?    [Jordan] Like I said, you go into a match to score the  highest score. So you are not going to be happy if you don't  score as highly as you would have liked to. It almost stands to  reason -- we would have been happier to make a two-thirds. Now  what impact that will have on the constitution-making process, I  don't think is of great significance because we had always  indicated quite clearly that whether or not we made a two-thirds  majority, we were not going to try to use that majority to  impose a constitution on the rest of the country. Even if we  had made a two-thirds or a three-quarters majority, we would  have striven to be as inclusive as possible. So that does not  change the manner in which we are going to behave in the  constitution-making body.    [Correspondent Brandon Templeton] Taking into consideration  the allegations of pirate voting stations and unavailability of  IFP stickers in KwaZulu/Natal -- does this mean that the ANC and  the IFP have come to some sort of agreement in the case of some  areas being...? [changes thought] Will it be possible to tell  whether a fair and free election was held in certain areas?    [Jordan] As I indicated, irregularities that have occurred,  that have come to our notice we have placed before the IEC.  It's the IEC's responsibility to deal with those  irregularities. We are not in the habit of making behind the  scenes deals with anyone about irregularities. [break in  transmission; news conference continues on CCV TV]    That was true not only in Natal, but true in many parts of  the country, especially on the first and second day of polling.  So, that is something specific to the Natal Province. It is a  problem, which I think is going to have to be resolved by the  political parties, together with the IEC. The issue of  reconciliation, I would think again, is something that has to be  resolved by the political parties, together with IEC.    [Correspondent] If we may return to the Western Cape for a  moment. By your own estimation at the end of the day, the ANC  may not get any more than 38 percent of the vote there. Can you  just give us a peep in the long term as to what ANC's policy  will be to, or strategy will be, to bring in more of the  so-called colored vote into the fold of the ANC?    [Jordan] The ANC will do what it has always done in the  past.  We fought this campaign on the issue of basic needs of South  African people. Well, we will continue to do that -- to place  the issues before the South African public.    [Correspondent Michael Havlett] A slightly technical  question: At what stage would you expect to make a claim that  you have won this election and that the ANC will be taking part?  [sentence as heard]    [Jordan, laughing] I wish I knew. I think you are all aware  that just last night we've been boogying on the second floor of  this hotel, because we anticipated that we would be able to make  that claim sometimes during the course of last night. Well, you  were disappointed. Everyone was disappointed. We are going to  boogie again tonight, but with far less expectation that we will  be able to make the claim tonight, but, you know, we will boogie  nonetheless, because we think it is about time we did. No,  really, I can't answer that question.    [Correspondent] Isn't there a point at which, you know, that  number of votes which you have got, which will guarantee you 201  seats in the assembly, or something of that sort? [sentence as  heard]    [Jordan] I suppose when we reach that point, we will be able  to do that, but when that will be, your guess is as good as mine  at this point.    [Correspondent] But that sets the trigger?    [Jordan] Something like that. Something like that.    [Correspondent] The ANC has emphasized non-racialism in its  policies. How bothersome is it that the vote broke down so much  along ethnic lines?    [Jordan] No, those have not broken down along ethnic lines.  There are certain parts of the country where that might be true,  but it's not the National Party, and we think that's very  significant. Even Northern Cape, for example -- most experts  anticipated that the ANC would not be able to win the Northern  Cape because of the large colored community there. Well, the  reverse has proved to be true.    [Correspondent] Do you consider the election as being free  and fair?    [Jordan] We would say on the whole free and fair, on the  whole free and fair.    [Correspondent] Would you give us some indication of what  Mr.  Mandela was doing today while he was watching the results?    [Jordan] He will come and boogie later when the results are  more firmly established. I don't think it will be proper to  talk about what the president is doing in private. [laughter]  He had some press engagements today.</p>

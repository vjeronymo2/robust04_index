			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Peaceful Siege"] </F>   [Text] The only haste that we, the Palestinians, are  sensing from Israel is in placing further measures and  restrictions while remaining oblivious to the damage being  inflicted on our various sectors, especially the workers, who  have been deprived of the source of their livelihood.    In contrast to the haste in restricting us, we are  witnessing  a slow down in the Palestinian-Israeli rounds of talks aimed at  working out the arrangements for implementing the self-rule plan  on the basis of the Oslo accord. Because there have been so  many rounds, we are no longer counting them, nor do we know  their exact number, or when will they end and for how long will  they continue, especially after the sanctity of dates has been  ignored. The Israeli side is keen on engaging in endless  squabbling over the details and formalities and in Byzantine  discussions, allowing this land that is thirsting for peace to  be a fertile ground for tensions and explosions.    Irrespective of how long the security siege continues, it  will not achieve security, safety, and stability for anyone in  this region, which in fact needs a peaceful siege before which  the shackles of sieges and military closures break down. The  Palestinian people, who are being subjected to the most powerful  pressures and to warfare in obtaining their livelihood, have not  lost their faith in the inevitable victory of a just peace; the  realization of their legitimate rights; liberation from  dependency in the political and economic spheres; and the  formulation of a sound basis for an infrastructure over their  land. These people are determined to cling to and persevere on  this land regardless of the storms raging now and then.    The important thing is that we must not allow frustration to  penetrate into our ranks, and we should always remember that the  darkest nights are followed by the light of dawn.    Finally, if we really want to safeguard our expected  independence, we must build an integral economy and launch  investment projects that ensure the absorption of our laborers;  secure for them a decent life; spare them the need of working  inside the Green Line; and keep them on our green land.</p>

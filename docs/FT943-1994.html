			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel deficit forecast The nickel market will be in deficit from this year through to 1996 and warehouse stocks are set to fall accordingly, Mr Hugh Morgan, Managing Director of Australia's Western Mining Corporation, said yesterday, reports Reuters. The outlook for nickel consumption was good, based on the likelihood of further stainless-steel capacity coming on stream in the next two years, he said at a presentation to the Association of Mining Analysts in London. Since 1984-85, stainless steel production had been rising at a faster rate than industrial production, and that was expected to continue, he added. This year the nickel market would be in deficit by 12,000 tonnes, compared with a 1993 surplus of 17,000 tonnes. In 1995 the shortfall would rise to 31,000 tonnes and by 1996 it was expected to reach 56,000. LME warehouse stocks would fall over the next few years as well, and should be around 50,000 tonnes by the end of 1996.</p>

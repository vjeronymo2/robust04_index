			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Whalers form own grouping A BREAKAWAY whaling organisation could further undermine the influence of the International Whaling Commission, the whaling regulator, which has seen repeated challenges to its jurisdiction this year. The North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (Nammco), founded by Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, declared at its first meeting that dissatisfaction with the IWC's ban on commercial whaling was the main reason for its creation. Iceland left the IWC at the June annual meeting. Norway, while remaining a member, plans to resume commercial whaling next spring. The two have repeatedly criticised the IWC, which includes many non-whaling countries, for pandering to animal rights arguments and refusing to agree quotas for commercial whaling even on a 'sustainable' basis. Nammco's influence will be greatly increased if Russia and Canada accept its invitation to join. Japan, one of the largest whaling countries, also attended the inaugural meeting as an observer. Nammco will also cover seals and pilot whales.</p>

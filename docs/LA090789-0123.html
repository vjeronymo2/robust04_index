			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEEN-AGER, BOY, 7, DIE IN ASSAULT RIFLE ATTACK  </P> <P> A 7-year-old boy and a teen-ager were shot to death Wednesday outside an  apartment building in South-Central Los Angeles when two men walked up and  began firing with AK-47 semi-automatic rifles, police said.  </P> <P> The outburst of violence at 3:45 p.m. near the intersection of 111th Street and  Broadway was apparently gang related although Los Angeles police investigators  said they had not determined a motive for the attack.  </P> <P> The gunmen first fired on Melvin Morris Gentry, 17, striking him once in the  chest.  </P> <P> Several feet away, a bullet hit the boy, identified as Lamont Compton, in the  head while he sat in a parked car with Judy Moore, 29, who suffered a gunshot  wound to her arm, according to Lt. Doug Collison.  </P> <P> Police said the victims later died of their wounds at Martin Luther King  Jr./Drew Medical Center.  </P> <P> Moore was treated and released from the same hospital.  </P> <P> Collison said two young assailants drove up to the apartment building in a  pickup truck and "approached a guy in front of this building."  </P> <P> "Both suspects were armed with rifles, and a large number of shots were fired,"  Collison said.  </P> <P> The suspects, who remain at large, fled in a blue pickup truck. They were  described as 18 or 19 years old and were armed with AK-47 assault rifles.  </P></p>

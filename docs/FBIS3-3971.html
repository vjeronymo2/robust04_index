Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military Commission and  director of the PLA General Logistics Department, said today at  an Army-wide telephone conference on agricultural and side-line  production that the armed forces' farming effort was significant  in reducing the burdens on the state, subsidizing supplies to  the Army, improving the soldiers' living standards and promoting  the reform and building of the Army.    He noted that in recent years, great progress had been made  in the farming by the armed forces. Last year, he added, the  whole Army produced 650 million kilograms of grain, 225 million  kilograms of meat, fish and eggs and 600 million kilograms of  vegetables, with a total value of 700 million yuan.    However, Director Fu pointed out, the prices on the market  have been rising quickly. So there was still a gap between the  current board expenses of soldiers and the actual need, although  the Central Military Commission had decided to raise the level  of the soldiers' board expenses.    In order to narrow the gap, Fu stressed, it was necessary to  make greater efforts to develop agricultural and side-line  production so as to raise the forces' self-supply abilities.    Director Fu called on the leadership of the armed forces at  all levels to pay closer attention to and strengthen the  management of agricultural and side-line production, to raise it  to a higher level.</p>

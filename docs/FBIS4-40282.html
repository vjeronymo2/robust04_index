			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 15 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb President  Radovan Karadzic said in Moscow on Wednesday that Russia had an  objective attitude and was strongly and sincerely committed to  peace in Bosnia, unlike the United States which he said was  favouring the Bosnian Moslems and was, deplorably, not sincerely  for peace.    Winding up his visit to Moscow, Karadzic said that Russia  was  not siding with the Serbs, but understood the Serbs' problems  and was striving to find solutions which would be equally just  or equally unjust to all three parties to the Bosnian conflict.    Speaking to Yugoslav reporters in Moscow, Karadzic asked  whether it was possible to reach peace if only one side -- viz.  the Serbs -- was working for it. He wondered that individual  circles in the United States were supporting the fundamentalist,  pro-Iranian regime in Sarajevo.    They have not only caused the war in Bosnia, but are keeping  it alive with their skillful game of imposing unacceptable  solutions on the Serbs and then accusing them of prolonging the  war, Karadzic said and added that the Serbs did not want Russia  to enter into a confrontation with the West because of them.    He explained that the Russian Parliament understood that the  Serbs' peace efforts were sincere, that they had made better  offers at the latest talks in Geneva, but had finally accepted a  compromise for the sake of peace, even if it had to be for only  a month.    At Geneva, the Bosnian Serb side had offered a ceasefire for  a year, the international community proposed one for four  months, but the Moslems and Croats, after painstaking  negotiations, finally agreed to only a month's suspension of  hostilities.    Karadzic said that the size of territory in the division of  Bosnia was not the biggest problem in the matter of territorial  delimitations, and that the Serbs were willing to agree to the  offer of 49 percent of Bosnia (as against 51 percent for the  Moslem-Croat federation) if they were given the right quality of  territory.    He said that agreement could easily be reached if, for  example, the Serbs were to get Sarajevo and Tuzla, but added  that percentages as a means of dividing territory should be  abandoned.    The important thing is that both the Moslem-Croat federation  and the Bosnian Serb republic should be viable states, he  explained. The Serbs are taking into consideration the Moslems'  need to have a compact state, and the international community  must take the same approach to the Serb state, he added,  insisting that the Bosnian Serb state must not be scattered  around like five Nagorno-Karabakhs, but that it too must be  compact.</p>

[passage omitted]    Addressing a crowded ceremony in al-Yarmuk camp in Damascus  yesterday on the DFLP's 25th anniversary, Hawatimah said that  the Oslo-Davos agreement [as heard] is a partial and separate  agreement that gives nothing in return. He noted that this  agreement was concluded behind the backs of the Palestinian  people and their intifadah and that it is bound to fail.    'Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], also delivered a  speech on behalf of the joint PFLP-DFLP command and the alliance  of Palestinian forces. Sayf Bin-'Ali also delivered a speech on  behalf of the Arab liberation parties and movements, and 'Ammar  al-Musawi, deputy head of Hizballah's Political Bureau,  delivered a speech on behalf of the Lebanese national and  Islamic resistance. [passage omitted]    The rally was attended by a number of secretary generals,  members of political bureaus and central committees of  Palestinian factions, a number of representatives of the  Lebanese national and Islamic movement and Arab liberation  movements, some members of the diplomatic corps accredited to  Damascus, and a crowd of citizens.</p>

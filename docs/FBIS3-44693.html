			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation today said  that If the U.S. side clings obstinately to its course [yi yi gu  xing 0001 1942 1324 5887] on the bilateral trade of textile  products, China will be compelled to take appropriate  retaliatory measures.    The spokesmen today issued a statement to lodge a serious  protest [yan zhong kang yi 0917 6850 2123 6231] against the  United States' unilateral move to cut import quota of textiles  from China.    The Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement on textile products  expired  on 31 December 1993. The two sides held three rounds of talks  prior to the expiration date but could not reach an agreement.    The spokesman said: When the two sides are about to hold the  fourth round of talks, the U.S. side unilaterally declared sharp  cuts in import quota of textiles from China. "This is a very  irresponsible move. It has not only aroused strong reaction  [qiang lie fan ying 1730 3525 0646 2019] in China but also  generated extensive dissatisfaction [guang fan bu man 1639 3131  0008 3341] in the United States. It will seriously influence  [yan zhong ying xiang 0917 6850 1758 0742] the economic and  trade relations between China and the United States."    He said: The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation solemnly [zheng zhong 6774 6850] declares that the  Chinese side will continue the talks according to the original  plan and solve the problem through negotiations. If the U.S.  side clings obstinately to its course, China will be compelled  [po 6612] to take appropriate retaliatory measures[bao fu cuo  shi 1032 1788 2238 2457].</p>

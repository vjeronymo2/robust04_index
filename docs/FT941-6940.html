			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Books: A front for emotional deception QUIET MOMENTS IN WAR: THE LETTERS OF JEAN-PAUL SARTRE TO SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR 1940-1963 translated by Lee Fahnestock and Norman MacAfee Hamish Hamilton Pounds 25, 320 pages If Jean-Paul Sartre had had been asked 'What did you do during the second world war, Daddy?' by the child he never sired (though not for want of trying), the answer would have gone something like this: 'I inflated red-coloured balloons and then launched them. I used them to plot the direction of the wind. I would give wind-charts to my superior, an officer in the artillery. What he did with them I've no idea; but, duty done, I would return to the barracks to play chess or read a detective story.' Sartre might have confessed that his duties as a private in the meteorological unit in Alsace of the French Army were so non-time-consuming that he was able to do a great deal of writing as well. Until he was captured in 1941 his wartime output was phenomenal. He wrote the whole of The Age of Reason, the first volume of his novel-sequence The Roads to Freedom in his leisure hours, plus 15 notebooks (the surviving ones have been published as Notebooks From A Phoney War) in which he sketched out theories derived from Heidegger and Husserl, the foundation of his massive philosophical work Being and Nothing. In addition, he wrote almost daily letters to his mother, his young mistress Wanda Kosakiewicz, and to his mistress-companion, Simone de Beauvoir. Wanda and her older sister Olga had been pupils of Beauvoir in Rouen before the war. At that time Olga had become attached to Sartre and it was she who inspired the character of the philosopher's girlfriend Ivich in Sartre's novel. The sexual triangle formed by Olga was also used by Beauvoir in her novel She Came to Stay. But now it was her sister Wanda who was Beauvoir's young rival for Sartre's affections. It is Sartre's letters to Beauvoir at this period that are published in English translation as Quiet Moments in a War. Though the background is familiar they add significantly to our knowledge of Sartre. His discussions of work in progress alternate with richly ironic descriptions of daily life in the unit, covering such topics as relations with his Jewish corporal, intrigues to get a decent billet, and flirtations with the blowzy Alsatian waitress in a cafe he always used for lunch. Then there is the tantalising prospect of leave, continually postponed, and constant requests to Beauvoir for money. As an impression of the futility that preceded the Fall of France, observed from the Front line, the letters could not be bettered. They complement the previous volume of his correspondence with Beauvoir (from 1926 when they first met to 1939). Both volumes were published together in French as Lettres au Castor et a quelques autres. Castor was Beauvoir's pet-name always used by Sartre when writing to her. It means 'Beaver' in French and serves as a pun on her surname and her industry; but it also refers to Castor and Pollux, the Heavenly Twins of classical legend, and as such serves as an emblem of the relationship between Sartre and Beauvoir. That relation caused her as much anguish as it did joy. 'You, my little Beaver,' he writes in March 1940, 'you who are me. I love you so much'. He uses her throughout as an echo-chamber as he recounts in great detail the current state of play with Wanda and the other women in his life. We can see plainly the emotional double- and treble-life he was leading, the deceptions it involved when he went on leave and had to confront both women. After the French collapse which Sartre refused to believe would happen, the surviving letters are few. The book concludes with one or two written in New York after the war. They reveal a rapidly spreading celebrity, and contain news of fresh emotional entanglements. There is also an amusing description of the John Huston menage in Ireland where Sartre stayed without Beauvoir while working on the script of a film about Freud. The translation is serviceable, the editing sparse.</p>

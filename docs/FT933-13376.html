			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / MoD 'overruled on arms exports' FOREIGN Office officials were in favour of the government circumventing its guidelines on exports to Iraq and Iran if it was felt to be in the 'national interest', the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yester-day. Under guidelines officially in place from 1985 to late 1988, the government was supposed not to approve exports that would 'significantly enhance the capability of either side to prolong or exacerbate' the Gulf conflict. But giving evidence to the inquiry, Sir David Miers, a former Foreign Office minister, said that between 1986 and 1988 he and other officials agreed to override military criteria when considering certain exports if it was felt that British economic and diplomatic objectives could be better served by their approval. Among the factors taken into account were the views of the US and of Saudi Arabia, as well as the potential loss of market opportunities for British companies at a time when France was increasing its commercial presence in the Middle East. Documents made available to the inquiry confirm that as a result defence equipment which some experts at the Ministry of Defence considered should have been embargoed was exported to both Iran and Iraq. This was before ministers at the Foreign Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, and the MoD agreed to adopt a more flexible policy on arms in a secret policy change at the end of 1988. Yesterday Sir David rejected a suggestion by Lord Justice Scott that officials had adopted a 'cynical approach' both in the way they failed to apply the guidelines and in the bland information about government policy that was offered to parliament. Sir David said: 'Our approach was extremely conscientious . . . each case was looked at very carefully and it was felt that one should be very cautious about what should be appoved.' Sir David is now the UK ambassador to the Netherlands. He will give further evidence today.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by President Fidel Ramos on former Foreign </F> Affairs Secretary Raul Manglapus' mission to Indonesia; place  and date not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] With respect to the scheduled meeting sponsored by  some private groups on the situation in East Timor, I have sent  a mission to Indonesia to convey a message from me to President  Suharto. The mission will also call on Mr. Ali Alatas, the  Indonesian foreign minister.    The mission which left for Jakarta early on Monday is headed  by former Secretary of Foreign Affairs Raul Manglapus, with  retired Major General Jose Magno and Undersecretary for Foreign  Affairs Rodolfo Severino as members.    The mission will reaffirm the Philippines' solidarity with  Indonesia as a close friend and neighbor, and as partners in  ASEAN, specifically, to reiterate the Philippine commitment to  the support for the territorial integrity of the Republic of  Indonesia including the province of East Timor.    The Philippines has affirmed this commitment and the support  openly in [pause] last 19 years in the United Nations and in  other forum.    The Manglapus mission will also take, [changes thought] make  clear that the Philippine Government dissociates itself from the  conference on East Timor, that it looks for with disfavor upon  the use of Philippine territory to question the territorial  integrity of a friendly neighbor, and that it disagrees with  their premises on which the conference is being conveyed.    It will explain why, under the Philippine Constitution, it  is  possible for the Philippine Government to stop a gathering of  private Filipino individuals from taking place. At the same  time, the mission will assure the Indonesian Government of the  Philippine Government's disavowal of this particular conference  and of continuing Philippine solidarity with Indonesia on the  question of East Timor. The Philippine Government has already  stated this position before and will continue to manifest it  strongly and in various ways.    The Philippines highly values its relationship with  Indonesia  which has been steadfast in its friendship with the Philippines.    I hope that all concerned will avoid doing anything that  will  damage the mutually beneficial relations between our two  countries.</p>

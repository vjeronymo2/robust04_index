			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK National Criminal Intelligence </F> Service: "National Criminal Intelligence Service Reshapes  Itself"]    [Text] Albert Pacey, Director General of the National  Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), today outlined the way  forward for the service in its fight against major criminal  activity in the UK.    `NCIS was formed two years ago out of disparate units drawn  from various parts of the police service. Having established  itself as an effective intelligence-gathering organisation, it  is now appropriate to ensure that the structure of the  organisation is capable of continuing to deliver high quality  intelligence packages to our main customers: regionally based  law enforcement agencies.    `Following wide consultation and an internal review, a  revised mission statement and strategic aims have been  introduced. The new strategy is intended to position NCIS in  the intelligence world and to give sharper focus to its work.    `In order to deliver the new strategy the structure of NCIS  has been revised and will comprise:    -- UK Division encompassing all five regional offices and  the  current Scottish/Irish Liaison Unit;    -- International Division which will integrate the  intelligence product of Interpol more fully within NCIS. It will  also contain the European Drugs Liaison Officer network and a  newly created Europol section to act as the national focal point  for intelligence to and from Europol HQ in the Hague; and    -- HQ Division providing strategic intelligence by means of  a  revamped Strategic and Specialist Intelligence Branch. This  will maintain an organised crime unit, football unit and  specialist crimes unit. Additionally it will house a newly  formed economic crimes unit and a new drugs unit.    `This new structure will allow NCIS to provide leadership  and  excellence in criminal intelligence. We have moved away from a  `commodity' based approach to crime to a `functional' one which  will clarify our role. Underpinning this revised strategy will  be our new integrated computer `brain': ALERT which is due to  come on stream from 1 April 1995. It will be a flexible system  allowing for the passing of intelligence and its analysis.    `I believe that this new strategy and structure with its  clearly defined areas of activity and clear lines of  communication will prevent duplication of effort and ensure that  intelligence is not lost. NCIS will continue to lead the way in  providing high quality intelligence to law enforcement agencies  and together combat major criminal activity.'  <H5>  Notes </H5>   1. Albert Pacey, CBE [Commander of the most noble order of  the British Empire], QPM [Queen's Police Medal], has been the  Director General of the National Criminal Intelligence Service  since August 1993. He was speaking today at a press conference  at NCIS HQ.    2. The following guiding principles have been established in  the review of NCIS structure:    - NCIS is a criminal focused organisation;    - the business of NCIS should, where possible, be split on a  functional rather than a commodity basis;    - the development of tactical intelligence on UK nationals  residing in the UK should be performed in the regional offices;    - the development of strategic intelligence should be  carried  out at headquarters;    - the development of tactical intelligence on UK nationals,  or non-UK subjects of interest to NCIS, who live or are  primarily based outside the UK should be performed at  headquarters;    - there must be clearly defined areas of activity with clear  lines of communication to prevent duplication of effort and to  ensure that intelligence is not lost;    - NCIS should establish its own unique identity, with a  structure which meets the needs of the organisation and its  users.    3. The organisation's new mission statement, structure and  strategic aims are attached. (Hard copy only.) PRESS ENQUIRIES:  Susan Daniels: 071 238 8431</p>

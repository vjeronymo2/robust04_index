			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Nigerian poll talks boycotted PRESIDENT Ibrahim Babangida's plan to re-run Nigeria's presidential elections on August 14 was set back yesterday when the Social Democratic party boycotted a meeting called to arrange the poll, writes Paul Adams in Lagos. The SDP decision comes as the rift widens between the military government and an increasingly critical judicial system and the press. General Babangida this week banned recourse to the law courts by opponents and threatened more curbs on press freedom. There is increasingly bold criticism of the annulment of the June elections by elder statesmen and active politicians of both parties, and detailed press reporting of divisions and indecision within the ruling military hierarchy. Yesterday's meeting had been called by the National Electoral Commission (NEC) under a new chairman, Professor Edet Uya, responsible for organising fresh elections. So far only one party is prepared to take part, the National Republican Convention (NRC), which claims its poor showing in June was because the polls were flawed and accuses the SDP of using illegal tactics. The SDP candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola, who had a clear lead when counting was stopped, says fresh elections are unjustified. Mr Abiola has taken the government to the high court in Lagos to restrain it from holding fresh elections, and applied to the Supreme Court to overrule the annulment of the June 12 polls. However, one of the four recent military decrees seems to have deprived Mr Abiola of legal recourse by depriving the courts of jurisdiction in suits challenging the poll annulment. Critics of the government say the new timetable is impracticable and the SDP has warned that any attempt to hold elections in Lagos and other big cities of the south-west, heartland of Mr Abiola's support, will lead to violence. Gen Olusegun Obasanjo, former head of state, and other retired civilian and military leaders have twice in the past week condemned President Babangida's manipulation of the electoral process, coupled with warnings of catastrophe for Nigeria if the government continues on its course.</p>

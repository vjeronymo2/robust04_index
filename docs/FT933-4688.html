			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / World Trade News: European anger over car deal EUROPEAN car industry leaders yesterday attacked a new car trade deal between the European Community and Japan, saying it was unacceptable for Tokyo to boost its market share during the EC sector's worst decline since the second world war, Reuter reports from Brussels. The board of directors of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said the deal meant Japan's EC market share would rise to at least 12.5 per cent this year from 11.3 per cent last year. In a statement issued after discussion at a board meeting in Frankfurt, the association said this increase ran counter to a 1991 EC-Japan agreement limiting Japanese car exports to the EC for the rest of the decade. 'At a time when European automobile manufacturers are announcing massive workforce reductions, an increase in Japanese market share is unacceptable,' the statement said. The 1991 arrangement was based on the principle of fair sharing of market downturns as well as increases and both sides had undertaken to uphold the spirit and the letter of this understanding, the association said. The latest agreement, announced in Tokyo last weekend after talks between the European Commission and Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, would cut Japanese car sales in the EC by about 100,000 this year while the market would shrink by at least 2.4m. Japan agreed to lower the ceiling on its 1993 exports of cars and light commercial vehicles to the Community to 980,000, compared with an earlier limit of 1.089m set in April. The April accord was based on a forecast that EC demand would fall by 6.5 per cent in 1993; the new deal is based on a fall of 15.9 per cent. The motor industry association yesterday welcomed both sides' efforts to adjust their market forecasts, but called on them to implement a transition period under the 1991 accord to complete European restructuring smoothly.</p>

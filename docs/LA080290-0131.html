			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: HIGH LIFE;  </P> <P> A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> TEENS BUILD CONFIDENCE AT SEMINAR  </P> <P> Focus is exactly what Mike McCaffrey hopes he has brought to the lives of  teen-agers who have attended his seminars over the past 16 years.  </P> <P> The FOCUS program has been presented to hundreds of business people over the  years, but McCaffrey's summer conference is aimed at youths 16 to 19 years old.  </P> <P> He teaches effective communication, the necessity of a good self-image,  affirmation of goals and development of self-esteem. Last weekend's conference  was at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Through a process of thinking, writing and analyzing, participants discover  ways to set goals as well methods to reach them.  </P> <P> "You would, perhaps, be amazed by your own initiative," said McCaffrey,  referring to goal-setting and goal-getting.  </P> <P> Although FOCUS involves a lot of work, teen-agers seem to find the four-day  seminar fun. The personal atmosphere makes the project more enjoyable -- only  25 are allowed in each group.  </P> <P> Colin Anderson, 19 and a sophomore at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, says the  conference was much more than he had expected. Anderson's mother took part in  the program through her work and encouraged him to attend. "I've really learned  a lot," Anderson said. "He (McCaffrey) taught me about goal-setting and  communicating. It's not just talking. You've got to be a good listener too."  </P> <P> Andrea Ellis, 17, attends a boarding school in Arizona and has made two trips  to attend McCaffrey's seminar. "I've changed so much since last year," she  said. "Because you learn so much here about trust, responsibility,  communication . . . everything."  </P> <P> For more information about the FOCUS seminar, call (714) 497-6616 or write to:  Mike McCaffrey &amp; Associates Inc., P.O. Box 4101, Laguna Beach, Calif.  92652.  </P> <P> "Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired." -- Robert Frost  (1874-1963) JENNIFER TURNER  </P></p>

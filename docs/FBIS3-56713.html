			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz January 15 TASS -- Northern Ossetia is  getting ready for the elections of its first president on  January 16.    Sources at the Central Electoral Commission told ITAR-TASS  everything has been prepared. The ballot sheet includes names  of two candidates -- that of North Ossetian Parliament Speaker  Akhsarbek Galazov and Prime Minister Sergey Khetagurov; the rest  four candidates quit the election campaign.    According to information of the North Ossetian Humanitarian  Research Institute's sociology service, Galazov has the highest  rating.    North Ossetian mass media circulated today a decree of the  Russian president "on suspension of the state of emergency  regime on part of territories of Northern Ossetia and  Ingushetia."    The decree says the Russian president has decided to suspend  from midnight of January 16 through midnight of January 17,  1994, the validity of the state of emergency regime on part of  Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia that has been prolonged by the  Russian president's decree of November 30, 1993. A reason for  this is the need to ensure citizens' right to vote during the  elections of the North Ossetian president.    Allied forces attached to the temporary administration on  territories of the Mozdok, Prigorodnyy regions and adjoining  areas of Northern Ossetia and the Malgobek and Nazran regions of  Ingushetia shall take measures to protect citizens and ensure  order in public places.    The North Ossetian situation is relatively calm. Not a  single inter-ethnic armed clash has been reported over the past  24 hours. The Russian peace-makers together with the local  law-enforcement bodies fully control the situation in the  security zone.</p>

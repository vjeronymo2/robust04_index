			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Krisztina Koenen report: "South Korea Remains Calm in </F> Nuclear Controversy"]    [Excerpts] Seoul, 17 June -- South Korea intends to react  soberly to the conflict with the communist North. [passage  omitted]    The government seems to agree that one must be prepared for  anything and must react flexibly. At first, however, it seemed  as if there were insurmountable differences between the ruling  Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Democratic Party:  While the opposition had called for compromise with the North,  including diplomatic recognition by the United States, in the  interest of safeguarding peace, the government party seemed to  rely on a policy of strength. The opposition assumes that this  might have been supposed to be a gesture toward the military,  which has gradually been out of politics under Kim Young-sam.    Strength and striving for peace are not irreconcilable,  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, one of the main actors in the  Korean drama, said in an interview with this newspaper.  Unfortunately, one has had to recognize that in the past,  progress with North Korea was possible only if one negotiated  from a position of strength. Like President Kim, Han, too,  thinks that the military situation on the Korean peninsula is  not more threatening than in the past.    The possibility that North Korea will use nuclear weapons as  soon as it has them cannot be ruled out. And even if this does  not happen, nuclear weapons could become a means of permanent  blackmail. Then one must expect the danger of military  provocations with conventional weapons to grow. However, the  greatest threat is emanating from the international  proliferation of nuclear weapons, which is to be expected in any  case, if North Korea has nuclear weapons.    Foreign Minister Han categorically rejected criticism from  the ranks of the opposition Democratic Party that the United  States has reacted excessively to the North Korean refusal to  have its nuclear facilities examined by the IAEA and is pursuing  its own interests in the region, which are not identical to the  South Korean interests. On the contrary, Han says, the official  policy of the United States is characterized by great patience.  The U.S. Administration has done everything possible to promote  negotiations, and for North Korea it would have been very easy  several times to give in without losing face.    South Korea has always advocated direct negotiations between  the two Korean states; however, so far this has been in vain.  North Korea rejects direct negotiations by arguing that the  South has not signed the cease-fire agreement which put an end  to the Korean war. Han referred to agreements that were signed  by North and South Korea, among others one in 1992 in which they  state that they will not acquire nuclear weapons.    The South Korean Government has little enthusiasm about the  alleged private trip by former U.S. President Carter to  Pyongyang. The opposition, on the other hand, has welcomed  Carter's efforts for mediation. If he returns with new  proposals from Pyongyang, they will be examined thoroughly, Han  Sung-chu said.    The foreign minister expressed satisfaction about the  international support for South Korea. So far, China's role has  been constructive, the government in Beijing has promoted the  negotiations in its own way. He also expressed satisfaction  about the close cooperation with Japan. Even though Japan might  have problems with the Korean minority who feel committed to  North Korea, he is sure, nevertheless, that the country will  follow the measures which the United Nations will decide, within  the limits set by the Japanese Constitution.    Han thinks that at the moment an international conference on  the issues of this region would be of little help, even though  he does not basically reject such an event. First, the current  conflict must be settled and only then will there be the right  time for international discussions, the South Korean foreign  minister said.</p>

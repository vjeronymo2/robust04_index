			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON HIGH SCHOOL SPIRIT  </P> <P> I read where the L.A. City school governing body is thinking of a realignment  of the City football playoff system.  </P> <P> I am of the school that believes that the more champions you have, the more  happy student-athletes, proud communities and families you have.  </P> <P> If anything, I urge a return to the three-division alignment, lest we see  first-round matchups like Banning vs. Marshall.  </P> <P> PETE ARBOGAST  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

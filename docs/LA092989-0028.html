			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Jerry Dunphy, perhaps the most well-known face on the local news scene, will  begin anchoring Disney-owned KHJ Channel 9's 8 and 9 p.m. newscasts on Nov. 6.  The veteran anchorman, who most recently led KABC Channel 7 to a decade at the  top of the news ratings heap, signed a record-breaking, multimillion dollar  contract with KHJ in July. Pat Harvey, formerly an anchor in Chicago, will  co-anchor the broadcast with Dunphy, and the station said Thursday the two of  them will assume the primary anchoring responsibilities when the station  unveils its three-hour prime-time newscast in January. A station spokeswoman  said the fate of current anchors Tom Lawrence, Lonnie Lardner and Linda Edwards  has not been determined. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

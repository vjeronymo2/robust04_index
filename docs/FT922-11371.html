			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Arts: Looters and pillagers but above all traders - The Viking exhibition in Paris MOST people see the Vikings from the point of view of their victims. The conventional image is of berserk brutes in dragon-prowed ships looting towns and burning monasteries. After unleashing a Darwinian struggle for survival among the top families of western Europe, the Viking threat simply petered out; Scandinavia once more became marginal to European civilisation. How much more there was to the Vikings is brought home by an extraordinary exhibition in Paris. Les Vikings: Les Scandinaves et l'Europe 800-1200 is mounted by the Council of Europe and the Nordic Council of Ministers. With more than 600 items, the majority from Scandinavia, this embarrassment of riches is enough to bring even the hardiest visitors to their knees with exhaustion. A folie de Vikings has now gripped the French, fascinated, for example, to discover that they owe the word for lobster, homard, to their Norse persecutors. In consequence, visibility in the Grand Palais is not good. The installation is stylish, but the labelling sets a new standard in uninformativeness. I grumble in the hope something can be done when the show moves on. Fortunately, the catalogue is a wonderful find. Nothing less than an encyclopaedia of the northern world, it is packed with information on everything from Icelandic sagas to the salt-fish trade. Armed with such a handsome yet unusually portable book, the exhibition's dingiest finds become fascinating. A tatty fragment of 10th-century cloth was once part of billowing, brightly-coloured Viking trousers, rather like a Turkish peasant's. Another wool scrap tells archaeologists that when Vikings were hard-up, they trimmed their jackets with fake fur. The sheer quantity of 9th- and 10th-century material is almost beyond belief; skis, carved beds from the famous ship-burials, a tool-box and its contents from Gotland, amulets of amber shaped like Thor's hammer, a bone flute and Pan-pipes from York, and bits of boats. Swords inscribed in Latin suggest that the Frankish kings' embargo on selling arms to the Vikings was useless - unless, of course, it was booty. But there is a mass of evidence in support of the view that the Vikings were traders first, warriors second. I particularly liked a carved stick which was an invoice for a shipment of pepper. The exhibition opens windows on to an unfamiliar northern world. We meet the Faroese, the fiercely pagan Laplanders, and the redoubtable Finnish ladies who were buried with their axes. The Scandinavians' Baltic neighbours also feature memorably; one of the most magnificent sights is the complete sets of ladies' jewellery, complete with cowry shells, from the museum in Riga. Between 800 and 1100, Viking ambitions spanned almost the entire known world. Grave-goods and caches of buried treasure in their homeland recall the ceaseless forays of warbands, as far as the coasts of Spain and Morocco, down the Volga to Byzantium (there are Viking graffiti in Haghia Sophia), Syria, and Central Asia. Even so, the mind boggles to think how a 7th-century bronze figurine of Buddha ended up at the Swedish trading-post of Helgo. From Canada comes precious testimony to the settlement discovered 30 years ago at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland. It was not a success, unlike Viking settlements on Iceland, the Duchy of Normandy, and above all, Kiev and the kingdom of Russia. Equally fascinating are the finds which suggest the civilising process at work. In an idle moment, an 11th-century Dane scratched in runic letters on a cow-bone, 'Kyss mik]', 'Give us a kiss]'. Passing love-notes under the table hardly squares with our image of the ferocious gens Danorum. (After-dinner entertainment for a band of Danish warriors in 869, was to pelt their captive St Edmund, king of East Anglia, to death with the dinner service.) Christianity transformed the Vikings. Till the mid-10th century - later in Sweden - they were worshippers of Thor and Odin. A 10th-century burial from Denmark contains two skeletons; a young man dressed in imported silk, and an older man, decapitated. It recalls Adam of Bremen's story of the corpses of sacrificial victims hung like pheasants in the grove at Uppsala. The last room contains spectacular artistic proof of what happened once Thor's worshippers had evolved into pilgrims and crusaders. There are wondrous beauties here, such as the carved wooden font from the church of Norre Snede in Jutland, ivory crucifixes made from walrus teeth (an important Scandinavian export), grave-stones and furniture, and an graceful iron candelabrum in the shape of a longship. Just how far the Vikings had travelled is summed up by a 12th-century shoe from Bergen. Embroidered runes along the top spell out amorvicithomniaoth - a gallant shot at Virgil's Amor vincit omnia, 'Love conquers all'. The wooden portal of the church at Hylestad in Denmark shows how delightfully the Viking tradition of interlaced animals married with Romanesque figurative art. It tells the story of Sigurd, alias Siegfried, and the dragon. Precious manuscripts of Snorri Sturluson's books testify to the intellectual sophistication of clerics who, in writing down the legends of Valhalla, made perhaps the single most influential contribution of Scandinavia to European culture. At the Grand Palais, Paris, until 12 July, then in Berlin (Altes Museum, September 1 - November 15) and the Nationalmuseet, Copenhagen, December 26- March 14 1993.</p>

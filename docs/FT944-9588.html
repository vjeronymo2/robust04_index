			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: British Steel There is no doubt the spectacular profits momentum at British Steel will continue as economic recovery in Europe gathers pace. But the six-fold increase in interim earnings per share will not stop investors asking whether now is the time to sell. The issue is whether the full cyclical upswing in earnings has been discounted in a share price up nearly 30 per cent against the market this year. Higher prices and volumes will ensure that British Steel's pre-tax profits will soon rise to beat the Pounds 733m achieved in 1989-90, the peak of the previous cycle. The top of the current cycle is likely to be 1996-97, in which pre-tax profits could amount to Pounds 900m, some 33p of earnings per share. This far ahead, there is necessarily considerable imprecision about such forecasts - perhaps profits will exceed Pounds 1bn. But assuming a conservative outcome, the shares do not look cheap. At 159 1/2 p, they are trading at nearly five times peak earnings, not far short of the peak valuation in the last cycle. Optimists argue that the recession due for 1998 or thereafter will be gentler than the previous one. British Steel, for one, believes that steady demand from Asia will offset the impact of downturn in Europe. If this were to be the case, the shares could arguably command a higher rating now, on the basis that the stability and therefore quality of earnings was set to improve. However, the optimistic scenario ignores the woeful lack of progress in eliminating subsidies and overcapacity from the European steel industry. The shares are supported now by an above-market yield, but a rerating would be undeserved.</p>

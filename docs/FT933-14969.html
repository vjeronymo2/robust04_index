			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Russia lurks in the shadows of G7 feast RUSSIA emerged at last week's Tokyo summit as an intrusive but inevitable presence at Group of Seven gatherings as it struggles to switch from frightening superpower to market-based democracy. The bearish figures of the two Borises - President Boris Yeltsin and his equally tall finance minister, Mr Boris Fyodorov - stood out in sharp contrast to their slight Japanese hosts in a vivid double act combining both the old and the new Russia. While Mr Yeltsin used his talent for plain speaking to push for better access to western markets, the younger Mr Fyodorov reassured his western counterparts they have a solid interlocuter who knows the details of what further economic reforms involve. Mr Yeltsin, despite joking at a final news conference that he would not be allowed back into Russia if he returned the disputed Kurile islands to Japan, did little to mend fences with Tokyo. But he said he was prepared to discuss the sovereignty issue on a long-delayed bilateral visit in October. Western leaders, confirming more than Dollars 43bn (Pounds 28.6bn) in aid and loans for Russia, treated the Russian leader with a mixture of tact and caution. Mr Yeltsin was immediately invited to next year's G7 gathering in Naples. As President Bill Clinton put it, Russia was of crucial political significance even if it did not yet qualify to become a full member. The problems of other former Soviet republics could not help but follow Mr Yeltsin to Tokyo. However, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, was relaxed enough to talk, if only to comment on the various crises breaking out in the former Soviet Union. He announced, for instance, that Russia wanted United Nations peace monitors to help Russian troops impose a settlement on the southern republic of Georgia and separatist Abkhaz rebels accused of receiving support from Russian troops out of Moscow's control. This followed an appeal for humanitarian assistance sent to the G7 summit by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, whom many G7 politicians know personally from his days as Soviet foreign minister. But most worrying was Ukraine, whose President Leonid Kravchuk asked the G7 on the eve of the summit not to forget economic assistance to the second most powerful republic after Russia. While Mr Yeltsin was in Tokyo, it made new threats not to give up its nuclear weapons as required by the Start 1 disarmament treaty which the US and Russia want it to ratify. In an attempt to make it feel less excluded, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin said they would offer Ukraine a 'trilateral deal' to encourage it to stick to earlier plans to become a nuclear-free state.</p>

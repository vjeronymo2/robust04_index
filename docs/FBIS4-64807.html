			<p>BFN     [Text] A House of Representatives multi-party delegation  under House President Alexis Galanos will go to Israel this  evening for a three-day official visit. Speaking at Larnaca  Airport before the delegation's departure, Galanos said the  visit is of great importance for strengthening relations between  Cyprus and Israel. The efforts under way for peace in the Middle  East, he added, and the latest agreement signed between Israel  and the Palestinians, open great possibilities for Cyprus as  well, to promote a solution to its problem.</p>

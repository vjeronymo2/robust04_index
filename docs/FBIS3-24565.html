			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A.K. Morocha, Moscow Electronic Engineering </F> Institute; UDC 621.382]    [Abstract] The existence of purely transverse acoustic  waves along the boundary of two isotropic half-spaces first  described in Akusticheskiy zhurnal Vol. 24 No. 4,  1978 is discussed, and it is noted that if both half-spaces are  piezoelectric crystals, a purely acoustoelectric wave may  propagate along their acoustic contact boundary without an  intermediate layer. An attempt is made to demonstrate that a new  type of purely transverse wave may propagate parallel to the  acoustic contact planes of two piezoelectric 43m crystals  whereby the acoustoelectric field is localized in the  near-contact layer whose thickness is on the order of the  wavelength, i.e., the wave amplitude attenuate on either side of  the contact boundary equally as fast as in ordinary Rayleigh  waves. The structure of the purely acoustoelectric Stonley wave  is plotted. The source data and the outcome of acoustoelectric  parameter analysis of the new type of purely acoustoelectric  waves for such contacting piezoelectric crystal pairs as GaAs  with ViGeO[.sup]20[/], InSb with InAs, ViGeO[.sub]20[/]  with ZnS, ViGeO[.sup]20[/] with InAs, GaAs with Si, ZnS with  Si, and ViGeO[.sup]20[/] with Si are summarized. It is shown  that the use of the new type of purely acoustoelectric waves  whose existence is predicted in the article may be promising in  monolithic integrated acoustoelectronics for developing  functional devices with a latent acoustic channel, e.g., active  and passive acoustic waveguides without losses, multilayer delay  lines, acoustoelectric amplifiers and generators, convolvers,  etc. Figures 2; tables 2; references 4: 2 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

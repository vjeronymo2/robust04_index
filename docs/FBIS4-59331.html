			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Acting Prime Minister Muhammad Sa'id </F> al-'Attar at a news conference with correspondents at the Prime  Minister's office in Sanaa on 11 May--recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. First, I would like to welcome all of you. I am  happy with this first meeting in my capacity as the head of the  Council of Ministers. Also, since [words indistinct] I have not  met with you often. Therefore, this is an opportunity [words  indistinct] all of us. I will begin this news conference with  an approximately 10- minute introductory statement. Afterward,  I will take your questions. We want a dialogue to be  established between ourselves and journalists. Statements are  not enough. We hope this dialogue will provide a clear picture  of what is really going on in Yemen. I do not want to start  from the very beginning of the crisis, or the so-called Yemeni  crisis. I believe all of you know a great deal about it.  However, allow to me to say that the [word indistinct] crisis  began many months ago, specifically [words indistinct] the last  six-seven months. [passage omitted]    I would like to reiterate what all leaders in Sanaa have  said. The crisis was started by members of the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] Political Bureau. We distinguish between the YSP  and its leadership, or some of its (?leaders). This is because  [words indistinct] is rebellion against constitutional  legitimacy. In view of this rebellion, and after the first  battles took place, the Army of the Republic of Yemen had to  play its role and perform its national duty. This Army has  played its role. [sentence indistinct]. However, contrary to  what has been [word indistinct] here and abroad, the battle is  not between the north and south. This is untrue. This is  because among the Yemeni Armed Forces fighting today in support  of legitimacy and the constitution are many southern brigades.  This statement is supported by the fact that the defense  minister, who was appointed two days ago, is from the Abyan  region. He is not the only one. There are many southerners  among the Armed Forces. In fact, as you know, thousands, or at  least hundreds, of our brother troops who are fighting against  the official troops join us daily and fight against the other  side. This is clear. You and the Information Ministry, God  willing, should visit these areas to see for yourselves this  [word indistinct].    This is the point I wanted to [word indistinct]. Therefore,  it is not a north-south battle, nor even a battle between the  General People's Congress and the YSP. Rather, it is between  the legislative and Constitutional authority on the one hand and  the rebels on the other. Some elements of the (?political  bureau rebelled) [words indistinct]. This is the situation  [words indistinct].    So, back to Arab mediation. When we were asked about Arab  troops being sent to disengage the two armies, our response was  that there are not two armies or two countries. Rather, there is  one country and one constitutional authority, representing  constitutional legitimacy versus rebels. [Words indistinct]  discussing troops [words indistinct]. If we want so [word  indistinct] this is being observed. I will give an example from  Europe. In France, there are some rebels in Corsica. The  French Government is fighting them, but there are no  international troops disengaging the two sides. The same can be  said of Ireland and many other states. If now or in the future  something takes place against Egyptian authority [words  indistinct] separation in Asyut or elsewhere, will we send  troops to disengage them and the Egyptian government? Do we  want to send disengagement troops between the Algerian  Government and those who represent the opposition, for example?  If it happens in the United States that Los Angeles, for  example, clashes with the official government or security  troops, will disengagement troops be sent there? I believe this  is a wrong idea.    Therefore, we support dialogue. We are ready to accept and  welcome all mediation, particularly by sisterly states.  However, this is on condition that they distinguish between  sending troops, and exchanging views and ideas and proposing  solutions. The government is fully prepared to discuss them  within the framework that has been approved by the entire Yemeni  people, which is the constitution, unity, democracy--not only  [word indistinct] democracy, but also political, economic,  cultural, and information democracy. In this framework, we  welcome all mediation -- strictly within this framework.    As for [words indistinct], a brother from the chief of staff  command will brief you on the situation from a military point of  view. I have a long experience in this field. As you perhaps  know, I was an official during the events which were called the  70-day siege in Yemen [words indistinct]. Then, I was the  minister of economy [word indistinct] and adviser to brother  [name indistinct], may God have mercy on his soul, who was a  great citizen, a great nationalist, and a great struggler. We  have some experience, but it is not part of my responsibility  [words indistinct] to give details. However, I can say one  thing. We hear international press reports talking about an  advance here, a retreat there, and that the media [sentence  incomplete as heard]. We want all our military statements in our  media to be credible. We do not want to exaggerate. All  figures [words indistinct] and the regions in which we are  deployed, I hope will be visited by all correspondents.  [sentence indistinct]. We are one people. As President 'Ali  'Abdallah said [words indistinct), we differentiate between a  rebellious clique from the YSP and the entire people, who are  part of us and our (?blood). We are very sad that we have to  kill each other. This is a crime [words indistinct] the  brothers in the political leadership of the YSP. This is what I  wanted to say. Now I will take your questions. Thank you.</p>

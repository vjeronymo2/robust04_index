			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smelters seek help for their tormentors - The problems behind the damaging flood of Russian aluminium THE RUSSIAN aluminium smelter manager can hardly be expected to give much thought to the crisis Russian exports are causing in the west European industry. As he struggles to keep production going so that he can earn foreign currency to buy food for his workforce and their families and urgently needed spare parts for worn-out equipment, he faces more pressing problems. Uncertain supplies of alumina, the essential raw material, and electricity, without which the power-hungry aluminium industry cannot operate; difficulties in finding transport to bring raw materials in and ship metal out; and the complexities of new export taxes on his metal are all conspiring to make his life a nightmare. The European aluminium industry understands the seriousness of the Russian manager's situation. But it cannot simply stand inactive as a flood of Russian aluminium threatens to devastate a large part of European smelting capacity. The unexpected surge in exports of aluminium from the former Soviet Union to 1m tonnes last year has already forced the closure of 500,000 tonnes of west European smelting capacity, or roughly 12 per cent. If Russian exports do not fall substantially, more capacity will go because Europe is the western industry's high-cost production area. Against the present aluminium price, hovering just above 50 cents a lb, the Anthony Bird Associates consultancy group estimates Italy's average cost at 76 cents, Spain's at 72 cents, Germany's at 65 cents and the UK's at 62 cents. Compared with this Venezuela's average cost is put at 47 cents, Canada's at 49 cents and Australia's at 50 cents. Nevertheless, as Mr Hans Seebauer, secretary-general of the European Aluminium Association, points out: 'we in Europe have environmentally clean smelters which are closing down but in the former Soviet Union smelters emitting high levels of pollutants continue to operate'. His association has made an urgent call for help to the European Commission, asking for trade talks to start as soon as possible. Otherwise, he says, the European aluminium industry is faced with 'further dismantling.' However, Mr Seebauer insists: 'We don't want to solve the problem negatively. We have to find a way of helping the former Soviet Union. But we also have to find a way to stop it choking our industry.' He has some imaginative suggestions to offer. For example, the western industry could help the Russians to modernise their smelters, a process that would inevitably mean the closure of some capacity in the short term. Mr Seebauer suggests there are European aluminium companies that would be willing to buy metal from Russia from the mid-1990s and could offer firm commitments. Armed with such contracts, the Russians should be able to raise finance through normal commercial banking channels. Mr Karl Wobbe, who heads the aluminium operations of VAW of Germany, has personal experience of the frustrations of dealing with the Russian industry. He says it is not possible for the European aluminium companies to solve the complex difficulties unaided. VAW has for some time had a research and development partnership with the former Soviet Union's Vami research institute and has been invited to modernise some smelters. 'We've done some feasibility studies, but there is no money available (in Russia) for this,' he says. Ironically, by driving down aluminium prices to their lowest-ever level in real terms, Russian exports have seriously undermined the European industry's financial strength - and thus its ability to help Russia. Mr Wobbe suggests that the deadlock would be broken if individual European governments or the European Community offered some kind of financial guarantee to companies willing to help the Russian industry. The European Aluminium Association has already contacted the governments of France, Germany and the UK and officials at the European Commission. All were sympathetic but uncertain what could be done. The European governments are also acutely aware that the Dollars 1bn in foreign currency Russia earned from aluminium exports last year is Dollars 1bn they will not be asked to provide in some other form of loans or aid. Mr Wobbe points to another looming cloud of uncertainty. Of the estimated 3.5m tonnes of aluminium production capacity in the former Soviet Union, about half went into military and associated equipment such as rockets and aeroplanes. This demand has virtually disappeared. He says: 'Russia has some excellent equipment for fabricating aluminium but it must be adapted. They need money and technology and they are asking for help. 'Many western companies have been to talk about possible joint ventures and to look at the plants and equipment. There is a growing sense of disappointment among the Russians that none of these visits have come to anything.' This lack of western interest is understandable given the lack of the financial and statistical information a big quoted company would expect to have before entering a joint venture. Also the Russians, according to Mr Wobbe, are short of ideas of their own. 'Make a proposal, is what they say. They don't think about their domestic market. They want to use their cheap labour to make low-cost fabricated aluminium products for export and for foreign currency. 'We must help the Russians convert their aluminium industry at all levels and help them use aluminium domestically for their own population,' says Mr Wobbe. In the meantime, VAW is keeping its financial commitments in the former Soviet Union to a minimum. It is taking Russian metal, converting it to foil and the foil is made into products for the domestic market at a plant in Michailovsk in the Ural mountains. The Russians would like this co-operative effort to develop into a proper joint venture but Mr Wobbe says: 'It could all change very quickly. We never know whether the same management will be in place in two or three months time. There might still be another political upheaval. The risk of this is very high - too high to put much money in at the moment. But this is a market with huge potential'. Meanwhile, the European Aluminium Association continues to hope that the Commission soon will put formal pressure on the Russians to reduce aluminium exports to the 1990 level (about 300,000 tonnes). Among other proposals, should negotiations fail, is one for a quota system that would allow duty-free imports up to a certain tonnage, above which duty would be levied. However, as Mr Seebauer points out: 'This would help the situation in the short term. But in the longer term a more profound solution is needed'.

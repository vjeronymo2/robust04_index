			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Markets: Wisdom and foolishness - London Do the Seven Wise Men, the government's panel of independent economic advisers who reported this week, owe their name to the Three Wise Men in the bible or the Five Wise Virgins? I plump for the latter. While waiting to greet the bridegroom, the wise virgins armed themselves with reserve supplies of lamp-oil. When the bridegroom arrived, their five foolish sisters had run out of oil, and begged for help. 'But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.' This clear preference for market solutions is strong evidence for the link with today's economists. The connection is closer still: by the time the foolish virgins had found their fresh supplies of oil, the bridegroom had arrived and barred the door, leaving them out in the cold. Like much economic advice, that of the Five Wise Virgins proved theoretically impeccable but practically useless. It remains to be seen if the Seven Wise Men do any better. Their first dollop of advice, published yesterday, included a call for a two-point cut in base rates 'in the next few months' from Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs. He is unworried by the threat to sterling that a big cut in interest rates might pose, and adds: 'Incidentally, if the underlying inflation rate moves above the top end of the 1-4 target range this year, it should be ignored . . .' This was greeted with wry smiles by those who remember that immediately after sterling's exit from the ERM in September he warned against the foolish temptations of just the policy he is now recommending. Well, times change. Perhaps inflation is yesterday's story, as Tim Congdon, the other City forecaster on the government's panel, argues. He is expecting underlying inflation in 1994 to be only 1 per cent, and can envisage prices actually falling in the mid-1990s. Since these two economists rarely agree about anything, their lack of concern about inflation is striking. Investors share this view. Gilts continued their rally during the week, with the yield on 10-year gilts dropping to 7.85 per cent, a drop of a quarter-point in a week. Issuers seem to be viewing this as a not-to-be-missed opportunity to lock in cheap long-term money: Argyll issued a Pounds 150m sterling bond on Wednesday, and there are more to come. Even the first of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation reports, also published this week, failed to dent the bond market's optimism much - though the Bank was noticeably more concerned about inflation than Davies and Congdon. The report also contained the chart on the right. It shows the slide in export margins, which is probably already starting to reverse as a consequence of sterling's devaluation. As the chart on the right showed, the squeeze on exports coupled with the slowdown in retail sales has had a crippling effect on manufacturing output. Just as interesting, however, is the fact that import margins have been under pressure even while sterling was over-valued in 1991 and 1992. As the Bank points out, this may mean that importers have little scope for sacrificing profitability to preserve market share. That is potentially good news for domestic producers - especially as this week's January retail sales figures, a rise of 2.3 per cent compared with a year ago, confirm the steady upwards trend in the volume of goods sold. Though the stock market had a setback, in sympathy with Wall Street, on Tuesday, the FT-SE 100 index ended the week at 2840.0 down only 3 points. Companies making rights issues or acquisitions were viewed in a remarkably benign light, always a sign of general bullishness. Bowater asked for Pounds 295m for an acquisition in the US, and its shares ended the week at 517p, up 33p. Bellway, a medium-sized builder, sought Pounds 33.6m; its shares fell only 14p to 382p. RTZ was also given the benefit of the doubt, even though its Dollars 470m purchase of US coal assets is the sort of foray into an untapped field that in more pessimistic times would have caused ripples of fear. Its shares closed the week at 646p, down only 15p. Kingfisher, announcing the Pounds 560m price of its acquisition of Darty in France, was also greeted warmly: its shares closed the week at 576p, up 49p. The market seemed in two minds, however, about what was possibly the best corporate news of the week: a 16 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits at Glaxo, and a strong hint that it was not planning the bid for Warner-Lambert of the US that traders had feared. Glaxo shares, under pressure for much of the week because of worries about what President Clinton's health care review would do to drug prices in the US, bounced sharply on the news in very heavy volume. The downtrend resumed on Friday, however, and the shares closed the week at 666p, down 38p. It was enough to make the wisest virgin feel foolish.</p>

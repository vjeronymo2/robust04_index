			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Gould urges return to full employment MR BRYAN Gould, Labour MP for Dagenham, called on the party's leadership last night to produce proposals highlighting the need for an interventionist economic policy to secure a return to full employment. He interpreted the acceptance of the full employment objective by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, in his speech to the TUC last week as a belated recognition that the 'cosy consensus' with the government on macroeconomic policy had ended. Stressing that Mr Smith's TUC speech had signalled 'a most significant shift in policy', Mr Gould said it had met the demand of himself and others that a line should be drawn under membership of the ERM. Mr Gould said Labour could reclaim the freedom of setting its own policies on interest rates, exchange rates and public spending with a view to meeting 'real economy targets like full employment'. Mr Gould complained that Labour's treasury team had 'resolutely failed so far to address these issues' and left a significant gap in policy.</p>

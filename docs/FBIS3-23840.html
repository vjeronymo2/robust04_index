			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Tokayev, president of the Ivanovo Oblast </F> Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and chairman of the  Board of Directors of AO Kraneks Machine-Building Company:  "Reforms for the People and not at Their Expense"]    [Text] Again, I must promulgate the basic points of the  economic program being put forward by the Ivanovo Oblast Union  of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. But that is just the way it  is: we have still not received a proper reaction on the part of  the government. This is why, with a feeling of complete  solidarity, I am joining my colleagues from the neighboring  oblasts and, once again, by taking action in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA,  I want to set forth the vision of the reforms from Russia's  textile region. And currently a large machine-building center.    Our main principle in the realization of the economic  policy,  which must be followed, is extremely brief: reforms for the  people and not at their expense. The reforms should improve the  lives of all people who are ready to work honestly and not  reduce them to total impoverishment. The reforms should be  carried out through improvement of the organization of the  country's national economy and not through devaluation of the  citizens' money and exorbitant taxes on commodity producers.    What is decisively important for the Ivanovo Oblast's  economy  is the stabilization of the situation in the textile industry.  In order to have this, first of all, it is necessary to solve  the matters of supplying raw material at acceptable prices and  selling the output at prices which would cover the average  industry costs.    It would seem that everything is simple. But, in practice,  we  are running up against insurmountable barriers. The actions of  government economists, which are aimed at pushing Uzbekistan and  other cotton-growing republics out of the ruble domain, have  sharply aggravated the situation in the textile industry.  Extremely necessary are urgent intergovernmental agreements on  the organization of a payment union between the republics and,  what is most important, permanent monitoring of their  implementation.    The following may be said with respect to the economic  situation in the country: a policy, under which the production  of the majority of goods becomes unprofitable and it is more  worthwhile for the enterprises to stand idle than to operate,  runs counter to the country's national interests.    The stabilization of the state's finances, about which they  have been talking for more than a year now, is really the most  important task. But, with unconditional priority given to the  stabilization of production and the creation of new jobs. It is  necessary to fight against inflation. But, given the current  landslide decline in production, it is impossible to restrain  inflation in principle, since the decline in production is not  of a structural nature, but rather, of a general nature. It is  necessary to extend the state's economic policy directly to the  commodity producer. And, in order to do this, the federal organs  of power must, without delay, implement a number of urgent  measures.    The first item is taxes. Currently, with respect to the  commodity producers, they exceed all reasonable limits. Such  taxes are becoming nothing more than an economic noose. Over the  millennia of the development of market relations, experience has  proven that, in order for a commodity producer to produce goods  and to support himself and the state, he should direct one-third  of his income toward the development of production, keep  one-third to himself for subsistence and give the remaining  third to the state so that it could protect him from foreign and  domestic foes, educate the children, develop the infrastructure,  and so on. You will not think of anything new here and there is  no need to do so. Deviations from this scheme do not produce any  kinds of additional funds for the treasury, but only lead to the  degradation of production, which is what we have at the present  time.    This is why it is necessary to limit legislatively the  maximum rate for all types of taxes and other obligatory  payments from commodity producers to an overall level no higher  than 35 percent. Likewise, it is necessary to exempt  legislatively, without any stipulations, from taxation the  profit directed by the commodity producers toward the  replenishment of their working capital.    The second requirement involves the banks. It is currently  absolutely clear to everyone that the confusion in the banking  system is being deliberately maintained, since, with a discount  rate of 210 percent or higher, it is an inexhaustible source of  easy profit for sticky-fingered workers and, first and foremost,  for those in the banking system itself. It is known that the  larger the transmitted payment amount, the longer it goes  through the banks, since it is a more dainty morsel for them. At  the same time, it makes no difference how it is transmitted --  by telegraph or by mail.    Until such time that sanctions, which exceed by a minimum  factor of 2 the possible dividends for delaying payments, are  applied to all the banks, including the Central Bank, there will  be no order there.    The third direction is investments. The state's current  investment policy cannot be called anything other than suicidal.  The fixed capital in industry is 70-80 percent worn out, while  investments are practically nil.    Everyone remembers quite well that, in the not-too-distant  past, the entire investment process in the country was provided  through two sources: centralized and non-centralized, i.e., the  enterprises' own resources. Today, for all practical purposes,  the state has abandoned centralized capital investments, while  the majority of enterprises does not have enough internal  resources even to maintain current production and to pay wages.  The investment total amounts to a big fat zero. Also, no one  even dares think about credit, given the current bank interest  rates. So it turns out that, given the current investment  policy, industry is doomed to extinction. There is one way out  -- exempt from taxation all the profit directed toward  investments in production and also provide legislatively a  special bank investment rate for credit for housing construction.    The prices for energy resources are another point. No one is  about to refute the obvious truth that everything should cost  what it costs. This is an axiom, without consideration of which  a normal market and an effective economy cannot exist. But here  we need to determine firmly just whose economy we are getting  ready to help out of a crisis -- our own or the West's. If it is  the West's, then we are on the right path. And, in this  instance, it is really necessary to raise the prices for raw  materials to the world level as quickly as possible. Domestic  consumers will not be able to pay for them and all the raw  materials will happily stream into the West at bargain prices.  At the same time, our own industry will shut down -- here is  your sales market for old imported stock!    However, if we firmly intend to help the Russian economy out  of the crisis, then the main task of industrial policy today  should be the creation of conditions for the stable production  of domestic goods and the introduction of such legislative  statutes as would motivate a commodity producer.    The stability of prices for primary energy resources plays a  key role in the attainment of these goals. No one in the world  has ever managed to stabilize an economy when the prices for  energy resources keep jumping higher. Our position in this mater  is unambiguous: the state should take it upon itself to regulate  the prices for energy resources temporarily.    Specific demands on the government arose among the commodity  producers in the implementation of economic ties with the  republics which were part of the former [Soviet] Union and are  currently sovereign states, as well as in the conducting of  foreign trade policy. The thoughtlessly destroyed ties in the  relations with the current CIS countries should be restored,  while the artificially created barriers should be removed.  Otherwise, for a long time to come, we will each separately be  attempting unsuccessfully to create closed economic cycles. And  this at a time when the capitalistic West is proceeding along  the path of combining efforts. Is this not a paradox on our part?    There are the matters involving exporting and importing. For  the time being, there is also a lot of confusion here, which is  playing into the hands of the fanciers of easy profit.  Meanwhile, the scheme is well-known: the export duties on raw  material goods should bring the domestic prices for the exported  raw materials into line with world prices, ensuring a reasonable  standard of profit for the exporter and enriching the state  budget. However, the import duties in turn are called upon to  ensure the reasonable primacy of domestic commodity producers on  the one hand and, on the other, to destroy monopolism and to  create a competitive environment inside the country, while not  serving as exclusively fiscal goals. Also unconditional should  be a decision to exempt from customs duties imported  manufacturing equipment and components for the production of  competitive products.</p>

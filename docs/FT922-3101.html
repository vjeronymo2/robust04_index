			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex developing jet fuel futures contract THE NEW York Commodity Exchange (Comex) is developing a jet fuel futures contract, which it hopes to submit for approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before the end of the year. The move will not improve Comex's already antagonistic relations with the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), which is considered the primary energy market. Nymex's heating oil futures are currently used by airlines to hedge their jet fuel price risks. But, according to Comex, jet fuel users have increasingly looked for a product that more closely corresponds to their needs. It believes that there is sufficient demand for a jet fuel contract. Nymex, which has in the past investigated the possibility of launching its own jet fuel futures, decided against doing so because it deemed that the number of players was too small. Its spokeswoman, Ms Nachamah Jacobovits, said that while heating oil was not a perfect hedge, many airlines used it and 'are happy with the level of liquidity'. Comex, a metal exchange trading copper, silver and gold, has been keen to broaden its product range. Its new chairman, Ms Donna Redel, has been contemplating a renewed effort at trading aluminium as well as financial futures based on the Eurotop 100 stock index, to be developed in co-operation with the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam. In spite of the existence of sour crude contract on Nymex, Comex moved ahead to win Commodity Futures Trading Commission approval for a Dubai sour crude future in April and plans to launch it in co-ordination with the International Petroleum Exchange whenever the market ripens. Comex also said in April that it intended to list futures on platinum and palladium, both of which are traded on Nymex. Nymex retaliated by suggesting it would consider contracts on silver and gold. The jet fuel contract, thus seems to be only the latest in a series of Comex challenges to Nymex. The two exchanges have had sporadic merger talks in recent years, but these have always foundered. Nymex, which shares quarters with Comex and three other New York exchanges, even withdrew last year from a joint move to a new trading floor.</p>

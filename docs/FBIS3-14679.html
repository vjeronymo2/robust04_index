			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hala Boncompagni] </F>   [Text] Beirut, March 30 (AFP)--Politicians and newspapers  voiced fears on Wednesday that Lebanon's week-old ban on  unofficial news broadcasts could turn into a long-term blackout,  after the government delayed a new media law.    A special ministerial committee is to discuss ways of  modifying a draft law, Information Minister Michel Samahah said  at the end of an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday.    But Beirut newspapers expected the discussions to be drawn  out, noting that the draft law had already been shelved for more  than two years.    The new law "will never authorise private media to broadcast  news but instead invite them to collaborate with the official  radio and television," the pro-Syrian daily AL-SAFIR.    "A majority of cabinet ministers support a definitive ban on  private radio and televisions, which were born of the war and  must end with the end of the war," it said.    Private radio and television stations have been banned from  broadcasting news and political programmes since March 23. The  government has restricted all news coverage to state-run Tele  Liban and Radio Liban.    The move came as the authorities launched an investigation  into a church bombing last month that killed 10 worshippers and  wounded 54 others.    The authorities accuse seven members of the Lebanese Forces  (LF) Christian militia of involvement in the attack. They have  arrested the group's deputy Fu'ad Malik and outlawed the LF,  which formed a political party in 1991.    The move against the LF, one of the militias widely held  responsible for much of the bloodshed and destruction in  Lebanon's 1975-1990 war, has divided public opinion.    But the ban on broadcasts has led several political and  religious leaders as well as ordinary people to express fears it  could mean an end to Lebanon's political freedoms, although the  government insists it's only temporary.    Former MP Butrus Harb charged that the ban was shifting  Lebanon "from a democracy to a totalitarian regime."    The leader of the Iranian-backed Hizballah movement, Shaykh  Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, warned that "the turn of the print  media will come, and Lebanon will become like all Arab  countries, colourless and insipid."    Right-wing Christian Phalange Party leader George Sa'adah  joined in to say that "a distinction must be made between  security problems and freedom of opinion."    State-run Tele Liban, meanwhile, started Wednesday to  broadcast hourly news bulletins for the first time since its  creation in 1959 to fill the news vacuum in the country.    Official Radio Liban, which is picked up on medium wave in  the Greater Beirut area only, also began broadcasting news on  its FM channel to cover the entire country.    Around 50 private radio and television stations sprouted up  during the war, most of them illegally.    The ban affects around 20 stations which broadcast daily  news  and political programmes, including Future Television which is  owned by billionaire Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT MOVING SWIFTLY TO STIMULATE, TRANSFORM COUNTRY;  </P> <P> LATIN AMERICA: BOLD STEPS OF THE LAST SIX MONTHS ARE STIRRING EXCITEMENT -- AND  UNCERTAINTY.  </P> <P> President Fernando Collor de Mello, 41, likes to drive fast cars and  motorcycles. He has even taken the controls of a supersonic jet fighter on one  of his much publicized weekend outings. And during the week in his Planalto  Palace office, Collor is also a man in a hurry.  </P> <P> He has ordered a bold series of measures during his first six months in office  that are rapidly changing the government and economy of this country. As Brazil  absorbs the changes, brisk cross-currents of excitement and uncertainty are  sweeping the nation of 150 million people.  </P> <P> Collor's critics call him rash and authoritarian. But with his forceful  personality and his public relations skills, he has kept the hopes of most  Brazilians high so far, opinion polls indicate.  </P> <P> He has also wasted no time in his efforts to win overseas support. On a  whirlwind tour before taking office, he met with President Bush, Japanese,  Soviet and European leaders, and he is scheduled to meet again with Bush in  Washington on Sunday.  </P> <P> While it is too early to assess the ultimate success of his leadership, Collor  is clearly in the driver's seat as Latin America's largest nation speeds toward  a future that, for better or worse, will bear his indelible mark.  </P> <P> So far, the ride has not been smooth.  </P> <P> As a result of Collor's tough anti-inflation measures, the economy is in a  slump that government officials refuse to call a recession even though it has  all of the earmarks of one. Meanwhile, prices continue to rise at discouraging  monthly rates of more than 10%.  </P> <P> Collor acknowledges that the tough part is not over.  </P> <P> But the difficulties are part of the process of change, he insists. What  matters most, he tells Brazilians, is that his administration is stripping down  and reforming a bloated and sluggish government, overhauling an outdated  industrial sector, opening up the overprotected national economy to the  stimulus of the global market, and preparing Brazil to move up as quickly as  possible from Third-World underdevelopment to First-World economic prowess.  </P> <P> Collor is part of a pattern across Latin America and elsewhere around the  world: From Mexico City to Moscow, national leaders are putting new emphasis on  private enterprise, free trade and lean government in the universal quest for  economic progress. But in few Western countries has the transformation begun  faster than in Brazil under Collor.  </P> <P> That is partly because of strong, pent-up popular demand for change after 21  years of military government and a five-year transitional period before Collor  took office March 15. An economic crisis, including inflation of 84% in the  month before his inauguration, added to the urgency. And his own impatient,  action-oriented style has kept things clipping along since then.  </P> <P> "President Collor runs his government as if he were an executive of a  multinational corporation," commented the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo. "He  likes to make decisions instantly, he is always calling in promises, and he is  convinced that time is money -- rarely do conferences surpass the limit of 15  minutes."  </P> <P> Critics label Collor's fondness for recreational speed as exhibitionism, but  many analysts see it as part of the president's deft public relations efforts  to project an energetic, macho image that will help maintain popular support  for him and his often painful reforms.  </P> <P> In a survey published early this month by Ibope, Brazil's top polling firm, 60%  of those interviewed said they trusted the president, and 79% said he was doing  a fair, good or excellent job.  </P> <P> David Fleischer, an American-born political science professor at University of  Brasilia, is critical of Collor but gives him high marks in public relations.  </P> <P> "He's doing very well in terms of publicity and rhetoric," Fleischer said.  "Good communications and marketing skills got him elected."  </P> <P> Collor's election victory last December capped a phenomenally successful media  campaign that began when he was the obscure governor of a small, poor state in  northeastern Brazil. As a presidential hopeful, he drew increasing public  attention by lambasting corrupt politicians, overpaid and lazy bureaucrats, and  cozy businessmen who depend on official favors.  </P> <P> But in Fleischer's view, Collor is part of the "old system," interested only in  changes that favor the established social and political order and supported in  Congress by "exactly the same group that he berated so much during his campaign  last year."  </P> <P> Before he became president, many people were skeptical of Collor's will to make  changes that would favor Brazil's poor majority and disturb the dominant elite  by altering the status quo. A foreign banker who was one of the skeptics now  says:  </P> <P> "I'm a convert. I think Collor really does want to change things. I think he  really does represent a new wind in this country."  </P> <P> The banker said Collor's actions have proven his determination to break venal  relationships between big business and government and to demand efficiency in  public administration.  </P> <P> Alexandre Barros, a political scientist who works as a consultant to private  investors, said opinions about Collor in the Brazilian business community have  swung radically since mid-March, when the new president froze most deposits in  the financial market and warned high-profit monopolies and oligopolies that  their free ride was ending.  </P> <P> "At first there was total perplexity," Barros said. Then, when inflation  rapidly subsided and business picked up, there was lot of optimism based on  "wishful thinking," he said. "I think that now people have a more balanced  view."  </P> <P> For example, Collor's industrial policy, which includes a phased reduction of  import barriers, pleases many businessmen but worries others looking for  protection from foreign competition.  </P> <P> "I am optimistic in the middle term, because I think Collor's policies are  going in the right direction," Barros said. But in the long run, he predicted,  underlying problems such as deficient educational and health care systems for  the Brazilian masses will retard development.  </P> <P> Some analysts are less optimistic about Collor's prospects for getting  inflation under control, a step considered essential for healthy economic  growth.  </P> <P> Collor and his economic advisers blame the persistence of the inflation on a  society that accepts rapid price increases as normal and on businessmen who  fail to cut costs and refuse to reduce profits.  </P> <P> "Inflation has not gone down because we still have some reticence on the part  of certain businesses to assimilate the changes," said Joao Cunha,  undersecretary of economy. But Cunha predicted in an interview that the  government policy of tightly restricting the money supply eventually will force  businesses to hold down prices.  </P> <P> "We are certain that by the end of the year we will have inflation well below  the level of 10% a month," he said.  </P> <P> The monetary policy has dampened economic activity, while inflation is eating  away at real wages. Most independent economists are calling the slump a  recession.  </P> <P> "I would not say we are in a recession," Cunha said. "I would say we are  entering a phase of reduced activity."  </P> <P> The degree of reduction will depend on the cooperation of business, unions and  consumers, he said.  </P> <P> The official goal is to stabilize inflation at 2% to 3% a month by the end of  the year. "If we achieve stabilization, after the first quarter (of next year)  I feel we can start thinking about growth again," Cunha said.  </P> <P> Meantime, workers are clamoring for raises in their eroded salaries. The press  has reported more than 500 strikes since March. A power strike put out the  lights in Brasilia for 10 hours, even darkening Collor's residence.  </P> <P> Collor's reforms began the day he took office, when he reduced the number of  government ministries from 24 to 12, and since then he has kept up an  almost-steady barrage of measures. Among them:  </P> <P> Ministries have dismissed, retired or furloughed more than 250,000 of the  government's 1.6 million workers.  </P> <P> Collor has ordered the sale of 42 luxury homes, formerly provided as  perquisites to ministers and other senior officials, as well as 20,000  apartments for bureaucrats, 4,500 cars and five airplanes.  </P> <P> Plans have been made to auction off scores of government-run corporations. The  first sales have been delayed until early next year, but a recent presidential  decree ordered government-run companies to reduce spending by 25% across the  board.  </P> <P> The president has reduced military spending from 6% of the national budget to  2.2%.  </P> <P> Collor's Economy Ministry has begun eliminating import restrictions and  lowering customs duties so that foreign goods may compete on the Brazilian  market, helping to keep prices competitive, and imported machinery and  components can be used to improve the quality of Brazilian products.  </P> <P> A new government program will provide $3 billion in financing for development  in science and technology over four years to make Brazilian industry more  competitive internationally.  </P> <P> The economic team has reached a preliminary agreement with the International  Monetary Fund that foresees $2 billion in stand-by credits for Brazil. The IMF  agreement is regarded as a preliminary step for renegotiating Brazil's  $117-billion foreign debt, which has not been serviced for more than a year.  </P> <P> In its letter to the IMF, the government says it will have a surplus in its  budget this year, wiping out the deficit Collor inherited in March.  </P> <P> A literacy program will invest $600 million this year and next in teaching 25  million illiterate Brazilians to read and write.  </P></p>

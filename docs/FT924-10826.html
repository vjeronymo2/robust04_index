			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer Marks and Spencer's interim figures show starkly why it has bitten the bullet on pricing in its autumn marketing campaign. While earnings per share are up a very creditable 22 per cent, sales are flat. True, the earnings rise is gilded because last year's figure was depressed by exceptional items, but underlying profits growth is being fuelled by cost control and cash management. That process must have a finite limit, however much this recession teaches companies to find hidden fat. Hence Marks' need to get sales moving. In these deflationary times price is the chosen weapon, and the company is consciously hazarding margins to bring in extra sales. The strategy of consistent low pricing will strengthen Marks' position in the longer term. But with other retailers running near-permanent sales, it may be difficult to get the message across meanwhile. If that proves to be the case, Marks may not reap the extra sales to compensate for reduced margins. The risks of losing margin and market share are just as strong in food as they are in clothing. Like-for-like sales are under pressure at the supermarket giants, and while Marks insists that its value-added food is not losing out, pressure can only build as the recession continues and more superstores open. Despite the woes of the economy, investors should not lose sight of Marks' fundamentally strong position. The freehold empire largely untroubled by rental pressures, a cast iron balance sheet and a solid franchise all support the company. The shares may dip as investors fret about the near term outlook; the question is what kind of a premium they are prepared to pay for such a core holding.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Checking on Quality"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the  National Council of the Slovak Republic, presented letters of  appointment to new members of the Slovak Television Council in  Bratislava yesterday. On this occasion, he mentioned their  responsibility under the law to check on the quality of  television broadcasts. He stressed that this would be one of  the council's crucial tasks in the preelection period and voiced  the conviction that, in its new composition, the council would  build on the positive results of its predecessor. The letters  of appointment were taken over by Peter Kollar, Stanislava  Benicka, Kornel Foldvari, Terezia Salayova, Kristian Bezak, and  Jozef Prusak, who became chairman of the Slovak Television  Council. Jozef Prusak told TA SR that the reconstructed  council, whose other two members are Eva Kristinova and Dusan  Jariabek, wants to become thoroughly conversant with materials  being prepared for the parliament, as well as with documents  pertaining to the operation of Slovak Television. This applies,  in particular, to the television statutes and to the code of  ethics of employees of this public corporation that is to be  drafted.</p>

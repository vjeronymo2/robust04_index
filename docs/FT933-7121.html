			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Technology: Price pressure - Upgrading a PC is possible but can cost as much, if not more, than a new model The age of the disposable personal computer is here. In spite of the growing number of manufacturers producing 'green' PCs, the sad fact is that most systems are built to be thrown away and, in the short term, little is being done to change that. It all comes down to economics. In the world of PCs, new technologies are being introduced and adopted so quickly that it is rarely worth upgrading an older computer. For anyone who does not want a disposable PC, there are theoretically a number of technologies that could make life easier. However, there is no guarantee as yet that they will work. One solution is the idea of the upgradeable computer processor. It has been used by various PC manufacturers over the years in building so-called 'future-proof' PCs. There is no better illustration of the pitfalls of this approach, though, than the recent array of 'Pentium-upgradeable' systems. Pentium is Intel's latest computer processor. Pentium-upgradeable systems were supposed to allow users to remove the moderately powerful Intel 486 processors and replace them with the Pentium processors, as these became available to users, in order to achieve the much higher performance. Unfortunately, when the Pentium processor was installed on the 486s, over-heating problems occurred. In addition, memory and storage capacity were not always installed in the most appropriate configuration for Pentium-based systems. Owing to such problems, even the properly-executed Pentium upgrade often ended up costing as much as buying a brand new Pentium system - and it still did not deliver the same levels of performance as an off-the-shelf model. If upgrading PCs were just a matter of solving the problematic processor installations, however, an appropriate method could eventually be found. The complicating factor in the process is the fast pace of change in the complementary technologies - especially in video display, memory and in data storage areas. The performance of personal computer video in particular has improved dramatically in the past few years. In most IBM-compatible PCs, video output is generated through the use of a display adaptor expansion card that sits in one of the PC's 'expansion slots', but these adaptor cards run at a rate of only 8 Megahertz. While 8 MHz speed was fine in 1984, today's fastest PC processors can run at between 40 and 66 MHz - with 100 MHz 486 processors not far off. A variety of solutions to meet the video and memory requirements have been put forward including video accelerators, faster processors on the video display adaptors - as well as more memory. Whatever changes are made to the video card, however, it still has to communicate with the motherboard of the PC at only 8 MHz. And this is where 'local bus' video comes in. This is a way for the video circuitry to talk 'directly' to the processor over a 'local bus' - rather than the standard AT expansion bus (data channel). This means that a local bus video system has to be built on to the motherboard of the computer in a proprietary fashion - at least until some form of local bus video standard evolves. There are 32-bit expansion slots in existence, but none will yet operate at the speeds that can be achieved by hanging a local bus directly off the processor. Local bus video systems claim to be able to run at between 33 to 50 MHz. And with today's Microsoft Windows applications demanding that amount of additional performance, it is clearly a technology that will be increasingly in demand over the coming years. There have also been significant improvements in increasing PC memory capacity - either random access memory (Ram) or magnetic storage. Again, this would enable Windows applications to be loaded on to a system which originally had too little memory capacity to run such software. Although technology advances make PC upgrades possible, they are still problematic. So if you want a better PC than the one you already own the most simple answer may be to buy a new one. The real challenge will be to find a home for the old computer.</p>

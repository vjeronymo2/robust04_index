			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Kyrgyz credit deal expected THE former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan expects to sign a Dollars 300m-Dollars 350m (Pounds 212m-Pounds 248m) loan agreement soon with western credit institutions led by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Mr Tursunbek Chyngyshev, the Kyrgyz prime minister, said in London yesterday. Agreement on the loan would enable the Central Asian republic to continue with its free market reforms. The republic had so far privatised 11 per cent of the country's former state property, mainly in retailing and services, the prime minister said. It hoped more than a third of the country's industry, agriculture and services would be in private hands by the end of this year, and two-thirds by the end of 1994. Mr Chyngyshev, who is in the UK on a five-day visit, said he hoped western counties would help to underpin economic restructuring with technical assistance and foreign investment in particular. The government of Kyrgyzstan was ready to guarantee foreign joint ventures in the republic. Reform was proceeding with the help of grants such as the Ecu9.23bn (Pounds 7.49bn) European Community technical assistance grant for former Soviet states. However, the republic's economic progress was being hampered by the instability of the Russian economy and the rouble. If the rouble failed to stabilise, Kyrgyzstan, part of rouble economic zone, would introduce its own currency if it secured sufficient funding. Observer, Page 17</p>

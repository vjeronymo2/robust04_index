			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival continues  at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas this weekend. Highlights from  today's and Sunday's program follow.  </P> <P> TODAY  </P> <P> 'Criminal Law'  </P> <P> United States, 1989, 112 minutes  </P> <P>  8:15 p.m.  </P> <P>  Nervy performances by Gary Oldman as a hotshot Boston attorney and Kevin Bacon  as a rich psychopath aren't enough to save this contrived psychological  thriller, directed by Martin Campbell and written by Mark Kasdan, from seeming  morbid and incredible. Mechanical rather than persuasive or suspenseful from  start to finish. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered legal action re-started STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK-based international banking group, yesterday disclosed that a legal action against it by a Malaysian businessman had been re-started in the high court in Singapore after it was dismissed by Malaysian courts. Standard said the proceedings against it had been re-started by Monsia Investments, which is controlled by Mr Yap Yong Seong. The Pounds 98m claim relates to assets sold by the bank after Mr Yap's company allegedly defaulted on a loan. Standard said the claim, was 'without merit and wholly misconceived'. It said that it would 'vigorously and confidently' defend the action on the basis of its legal advice. Standard said it was continuing to press its own claims in the Malaysian courts to recover from Mr Yap and his associated companies sums that it was due.</p>

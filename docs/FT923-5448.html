			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Arts: The Secret Life and His Majesty FEW English artists have any real subject except England: it's the well-spring from which they draw all their sustenance. It was to be expected that Harley Granville-Barker - the Trollope of playwrights - would flounder when tackling dethroned European monarchy, and so it proves. Barker completed His Majesty, his final play, in 1923; this staging by the Orange Tree, Richmond, is its world premiere. The director, Sam Walters, who directed the first-ever production of Barker's The Secret Life at the Orange Tree in 1988, does much to animate this curio. As a comment on Europe, it throws off pre-echoes of present-day Romania and ex-Yugoslavia; as a comment on kings, it suggests that monarchy is an anachronism; as a expression of Barker himself, it reflects his own abdication from the centre of British theatre. Its discussion is never less than intelligent, though often less than dramatic. Barker always risked too much wordiness and plot detail, and here went overboard on them. It hangs fire. The scene-changes in this production are more vivid than the play. Sam Dastor is a world-weary king, monotonously gracious and resigned, not unlike an Alan Bennett vicar. Caroline John's Queen, with a slight staginess that's appropriate, has welcome energy and poise. Meanwhile at the Royal Lyceum Theatre the Royal National Theatre has given two rehearsed readings of The Secret Life. Here too the dominant note is resignation, even abdication. The play is set on the cusp of the upper and upper-middle classes, and - like His Majesty and unlike The Voysey Inheritance and The Madras House - suffers from its narrow, privileged social horizons. Its main life occurs in its varied depiction of relations between men and women. The Royal National Theatre should not be presenting a play-reading where most of the cast project so poorly, indeed unprofessionally. I would call Rachel Joyce's method of acting a fake-radiant drone if I could have heard more than a third of her words, but I couldn't. Michael Gardiner inflicted on two roles the same woollen consonants, cloudy vowels, soggy sibilants and dull pacing. Helen McCrory's narration was drab and underpowered; one fears for her reading of Barker's Ann Leete next week. The cast offered incorrect pronunciations of 'loggia' and 'sine qua non'. The characters who open the play by talking about Wagner mispronounce his characters' names and have no notion of how his music goes. Manning Redwood, Jo Stone-Fewings and Mary Mitchell all gave otherwise charming, detailed but too subdued accounts. I might fault Brenda Blethyn's Joan for its breathy little-girl voice - but I was merely grateful for its audibility. Rosemary Martin and James Laurenson were in another league - sharply focused characterisations alive in every detail. And, in the central role of Evan Strowde, Alan Howard gave an object-lesson in every kind of projection. Every flick of his eyes, eyebrows, head, every gesture or stab of his pencil conveyed the role's inner and outer lives. Reading most of the role pianissimo, he always showed perfect mastery of breath. There's something burnt-out about Howard these days that adds an exceptionally poignant restraint to his delivery. Using about five per cent of his virtuoso technique, he dominated the endeavour, illumined the play, and thrilled me to the marrow. His Majesty was running at the St Brides Centre. It transfers to the Orange Tree Theatre on September 3, where it runs until October 10</p>

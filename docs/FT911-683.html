			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Optimism about inflation boosts Madrid THE SPANISH market broke out of its narrow trading range of the previous few days, with a gain of 1.1 per cent in moderate trading. Most bourses were closed yesterday for Ascension Day, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID firmed in response to rises on Wall Street and on hopes that next week's inflation figure would show only a small rise. The general index gained 3.0 to 282.55 in turnover of Pta13bn, up from Pta11bn. A rumour that Banesto was looking to sell a stake in Petromed, its oil arm, to BP at about Pta9,000 a share lifted Petromed Pta180 to Pta7,830. Cepsa, a rival oil company, gained Pta50 to Pta2,240 in heavy volume of 232,291 shares. The banking, oil and construction sectors were strong. Popular added Pta250 to Pta11,150 and Banesto gained Pta65 to Pta3,725. MILAN closed little changed in technical trading before the end of the trading month on May 15. The Comit index eased 0.5 to 574.38 in volume estimated at less than Wednesday's meagre L109bn. Pirelli Spa was one of the few big movers, rising L50 or 3 per cent to L1,675 on news that the board of Continental, the German tyremaker, was meeting at short notice to discuss possible co-operation with the Italian company. Alleanza, Generali's life insurance unit, also rose 3 per cent or L1,600 to L53,100 after reporting a 26.7 per cent rise in 1990 net profit to L131.2bn as well as a scrip issue. HELSINKI rose 0.9 per cent with two large transactions dominating otherwise quiet trading. Kesko, the wholesaler, gained FM0.50 to FM40 with 222,300 shares traded, while Interbank B shares slipped FM0.10 to FM12.90 on 148,000 shares. The Hex index added 10.09 to 1,089.62 as turnover eased to FM24m from FM44.5m. ATHENS's general index fell 34.53 or 3.1 per cent to 1,063.70, while the banking index lost 61.48 or 4.9 per cent to 1,205.24. ISTANBUL's 75-share index fell 86.89 or 2.3 per cent to 3,608.01.

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Solidarity leader Lech Walesa will meet the leaders of two traditionally  pro-Communist political parties today to discuss forming a non-Communist  coalition government in Poland, his aides said. They said he will meet in  Warsaw with Roman Malinowski, leader of the United Peasants' Party, and Jerzy  Jozwiak, head of the Democratic Party. Walesa called last week for a government  excluding the Communist Party and uniting his movement with the two small  parties, which have suggested they want a more independent role. Czeslaw  Kiszczak, a Communist named as premier Aug. 2, is trying to persuade Solidarity  to join a "grand coalition" government.  </P></p>

SAWT AL-SHA'B has learned that preliminary investigations  have shown that these defendants received aid from a foreign  country and were trained in the use of weapons in Afghanistan.  They planned to carry out acts of sabotage in the Kingdom in  order to destabilize the country and obstruct Jordan's  democratic march.    The public prosecutor accused all defendants of possessing  and using explosives and automatic weapons and joining an  illegal organization. It is noteworthy that the competent  security organs recently confiscated some weapons and explosives  in the possession of these defendants.</p>

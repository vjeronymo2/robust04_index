			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Accountants scornful of Heseltine's 'wealth' jibe ACCOUNTANTS have resp-onded with anger to remarks by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, that there are too many 'wealth managers' and not enough 'wealth creators' in business. In a letter to Mr Heseltine, Mr Ian Plaistowe, president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said he was 'surprised and disappointed' by the remarks - made to the Institute of Directors last Friday. Mr Plaistowe said Mr Heseltine had been 'badly briefed' on the accountancy profession by his officials. He insisted that the profession was 'one of the few sectors in which the UK is a world-beater in terms of quality and breadth'. He accused Mr Heseltine of falling into 'a notorious elephant trap' by trying to compare the number of accountants in the UK with those overseas, when the statistics measure profess-ions with very different functions. Mr Plaistowe said accountants would not survive unless they were providing skills and services that the market wanted. He also argued that graduates applied for jobs with accountancy firms because these organisations spent so much money on training, 'which puts most of the rest of business to shame'.

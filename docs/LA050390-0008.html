			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIXON LETTERS  </P> <P> I write to express my gratitude and appreciation for your readers of whom I am  proud to be one.  </P> <P> I was amazed and not a little disgusted at your giving a podium to Nixon and my  final impulse was to say so.  </P> <P> Then I thought of the wonderful letters writers and knew I could depend on them  to come through once again.  </P> <P> I was rewarded, more than I ever imagined -- 63 anti- and only two pro-Nixon  letters! Wonderful!  </P> <P> I hope you are properly chastened.  </P> <P> MILDRED G. KRAMER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

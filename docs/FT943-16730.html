			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Ailing dollar has markets guessing - Where next for the US currency? For many of the thousands of football fans who went to the US for soccer's World Cup, the weak dollar could not have come at a better time. But those among them with equity and bond investments back home are likely to find the weak dollar more of a mixed blessing. Few investment strategists believe financial markets can flourish against the background of an ailing dollar, and many would cite the US currency's poor performance this year as a key cause of the generally unsettled state of world financial markets. One point to note is that while the dollar has fallen to a post-war low of 98.55 against the yen, it has actually been fairly stable against many other currencies. Indeed, the trade-weighted value of the dollar is not much below where it was at the beginning of 1990, and it is nearly 10 per cent above the low it touched in the third quarter of 1992. Then, the exchange rate was Dollars 2/Pounds 1 (now Dollars 1.55) and DM1.40/Dollars 1 (now DM1.58). From a sterling perspective, figures from Record Treasury Management, a company specialising in currency risk and currency funds, show that in the six months to April 1994, the sterling/dollar trading range was barely more than 2 per cent. Going back to 1980, however, the average is closer to 10 per cent. Even in recent weeks, sterling has struggled to make progress against the dollar, and few analysts feel it will change much in 6-12 months. From a consumer perspective, it is doubtful if the weaker dollar has had much impact. In 1992, travel companies reported a surge in travel to the US, but there has been no repeat this time. Although travellers have greater spending power, Thomson, the largest package travel operator in the UK, reports that bookings are steady. The UK is not a particularly large importer of consumer goods from the US, either. Imports tend more to be of a capital nature, such as computers and aeroplanes, with long-term financing arrangements unaffected by short-term currency movements. As for the present, analysts are split about the investment implications of the lower dollar. Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New Court, says investors should not be concerned. He argues that the dollar is a side issue, the key concern for financial markets being the strength of the US economy. 'It is a tremendous mistake to believe that weakness in the dollar is likely to tell you something about likely US interest rates,' he says. But John Reynolds, global strategist at Natwest Markets, notes: 'With the US long bond market still holding the key to the outlook for world markets, a weaker dollar is just grist to the mill for inflation bears.' In other words, further dollar weakness would put more upward pressure on US interest rates. This would probably have a negative effect on US bond and equity prices, with a spill-over into other international markets - the pattern ever since the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates on February 4. What of the future? Reynolds believes the dollar has probably overshot on the downside and that a bounce can be expected. 'Dollar-based investments are probably, on a 12-month view, going to be a wise thing to do,' he says. Beyond that, he and many other analysts are bearish about the dollar so long as the US continues to run a large trade deficit. A final caution. Currencies are notoriously difficult to predict and most analysts have been wrong on the dollar so far this year. There is no reason why it should not confound the market again.</p>

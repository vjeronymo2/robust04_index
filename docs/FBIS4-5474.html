			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Truong Tan Sang, chairman of the Ho Chi Minh </F> City people's committee, by an unidentified NHAN DAN  correspondent on "the city's foreign economic activities" --  place and date not given]    [Summary] [Correspondent] "Could you, Comrade Chairman,  give your observations on the results of the city's foreign  economic activities over the years and on their course of  development in the period ahead?"    [Truong Tan Sang] "As far as Ho Chi Minh City is concerned,  foreign economic activities are a very important part of the  city's socioeconomic development strategy. They have had a  positive impact on various economic activities and have helped  increasingly develop the economic growth rate."    The export volume of industrial products and processed farm  produce have increased with every passing day. "We have been  able to maintain an annual increase in our import-export volume  of approximately 15 percent. In 1993 the export volume of  processed industrial products accounted for 64 percent of the  city's total exports. Over 80 percent of the city's equipment  and machinery were imported. Tourism and support services made  up 15 percent of the city's annual revenue."    Foreign capital invested in the city is increasing. "Foreign  invested capital in 1991 was as large as the figures of many  previous years combined. In 1992, foreign invested capital  increased 1.3 fold over 1991. In 1993, it was 1.8 times as much  as that of 1992."    In the years to come, especially 1994, the city's foreign  economic efforts will be directed at consolidating our existing  markets, opening new markets, strengthening and establishing  more market monitoring organizations, encouraging economic firms  to find new foreign markets, striving to attract more foreign  capital investment in the infrastructure and in the development  of advanced technologies, and promoting the production of  export-oriented goods.    [Correspondent] Could you, comrade, tell us whether  effective foreign economic activities have had any impact on the  city's economic development?    [Truong Tan Sang] "Foreign economic activities have been and  are a very important factor for socioeconomic development in the  city." Noteworthy is the fact that they have become a source of  revenue for the state budget. "In 1993, revenue from taxes  levied on imports and exports was estimated at 2,600 billion  dong. This helped increase the city's 1993 budget revenue by 44  percent over 1992."    So far, "the city has licensed 280 investment projects with  a  total investment capital of $2,238 million, of which 159  projects with a total capital investment of $500 million have  been deployed, providing jobs for 25,000 workers."    [Correspondent] "The operations of party and mass  organizations in joint ventures with foreign countries have  become an issue. What is the city party committee's policy  toward this issue?"    [Truong Tan Sang] There are trade union organizations in a  number of joint ventures with foreign countries. "But in  general, setting up party and mass organizations in joint  venture establishments has not been given due attention. That  is why there have been disputes over privileges between workers  and enterprise owners in certain establishments. These disputes  have not been settled promptly, thus adversely affecting  production and business environments. As the scope of  investment will grow bigger in the future, the establishment and  consolidation of such party and mass organizations must be  carried out urgently in order to protect the legal interest of  investors and workers within the framework of the law now in  force."    [Correspondent]: Thank you, Comrade Chairman.</p>

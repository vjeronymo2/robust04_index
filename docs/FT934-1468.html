			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Cocoa slips but bulls undismayed Cocoa prices wilted under the heat of heavy speculative selling towards the end of the week, although analysts remained bullish about the market's longer term prospects. After sustaining a Pounds 32 fall to Pounds 989 a tonne on Thursday the London Commodity Exchange's March futures position yesterday broke through a technical support area around the Pounds 980 mark as selling by a US commission house and a UK broker snow-balled into a full-scale bear run. The next support area, at Pounds 965 a tonne , was tested, but after a brief dip to Pounds 963 a tonne the price bounced to Pounds 967 a tonne at the close, down Pounds 69 on the week. The peaceful transition of power this week in the Ivory Coast, the biggest cocoa producer, following the death of veteran President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, had removed one factor that had been helping the market to hold on to recent gains. And sellers received further encouragement from indications that the Ivorians might market next year's mid-crop - harvested between April and June and amounting to about 15 per cent of the total - immediately, rather than with the main crop, as they did this year. Traders said there was also some profit-taking this week ahead of the publication at the end of the year of European Union report that could recommend the use of more cocoa butter substitutes in the manufacture of chocolate. Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodity analyst at London broker GNI, said he was still 'a long-term bull towards cocoa' but thought the market had 'got a bit ahead of itself and attracted a lot of speculative interest'. It could fall to about Pounds 900 a tonne, he said, but there remained strong buying interest. The LCE coffee futures market had a tranquil week, with prices locked in a narrow trading range. By yesterday's close the March position had surrendered an earlier Dollars 13 rise to end the week Dollars 3 down on balance at Dollars 1,264 a tonne. London Metal Exchange contracts built on last week's strong gains on Monday but then succumbed to a heavy bout of profit-taking that left most with net losses on the week. Zinc traders appeared to put a mildly bullish construction on reports that weekend talks on plans for co-operatively financed European production cuts, though inconclusive, were 'encouraging'. But, ironically, Tuesday brought news that the Netherlands' Budel smelter, which had seemed doomed to closure because of environmental problems, had been saved by an eleventh hour deal with national and provincial governments allowing the storage of hazardous, cadmium-containing waste. Budel supplies about 5 per cent of the western world's zinc. That day saw a sudden reversal in the fortunes of the zinc market, the three months price ending a six-day, Dollars 80-a-tonne advance with a Dollars 37 fall to Dollars 996.50 a tonne. But that fall could be mainly attributed to the sudden evaporation of the general bullish sentiment that had been pervading the LME, and in particular to a sudden sell-off in the aluminium market after a big rise in LME warehouse stocks was reported on Tuesday. The three months price of zinc edged up Dollars 1 over the past two days to end Dollars 30.75 down on balance at Pounds 987.50 a tonne; while the aluminium price bounced from a mid-week low of Dollars 1,087.50 to close yesterday at Dollars 1,114.50 a tonne, down Dollars 22.25 on the week.  ------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------- Aluminium      +13,175  to  2,434,500 Aluminium alloy   +220  to  48,760 Copper          -1,850  to  586,700 Lead              +525  to  299,975 Nickel            +906  to  121,626 Zinc            +6,875  to  884,350 Tin                -25  to  18,890  -------------------------------------</p>

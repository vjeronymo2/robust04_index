			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Reinsurance plans under scrutiny The reinsurance arrangements of life insurance companies are among the targets of the government's drive to close more tax loopholes. The aim is that from next year reinsurance should not be a way for life companies to protect investment returns from tax, but should be confined to reducing their exposure to particular death risks. Tax officials will consult the life insurance industry before setting out how the rate of return will be calculated and which types of reinsurance will be affected.</p>

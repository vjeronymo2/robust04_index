			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Food &amp; Drink: Matured to the sound of bagpipes - Giles MacDonogh tipples malt whisky at two Scottish distilleries THE FIRST commercially marketed malt whisky crossed Hadrian's Wall in the early 1960s and, since then, a further dimension has been added to the drinker's world. That trickle has turned into a stream, with roughly 100 different single malt whiskies now on offer, breeding a new race of enthusiasts who go about collecting new releases with the same passion as children used to spot trains. To the best of my knowledge, none of the commercial blends has suffered at the hands of single malt whisky; indeed, almost all the distilleries are owned by companies possessing at least one branded spirit. Now we can approach whisky almost as we enjoy varieties of good wine. I should be happy to see more. Many distilleries remain closed as a result of rationalisations which took place in the industry a generation ago. This is particularly true of the whisky stills on the islands, which were too remote to have even a tourist industry to support their continuation. Scotland's smallest distillery, Edradour, near the old spa-town of Pitlochry, has known how to benefit from the streams of visitors who visit the Highlands every year, and now about half of its production is sold from the cellar door. Edradour is owned by Campbell Distillers, now part of the Pernod-Ricard Group. Its blended whiskies include Clan Campbell and House of Lords. Only about 20 per cent of Edradour, however, is purloined for the blends, the rest is sold as a 10-year-old single malt. Only about 2,000 cases are made annually on the distillery's two small stills. Everything is small scale in the buildings which cluster on either side of the Edradour spring. Since 1966 all the whisky has been run off into casks formerly housing oloroso sherry. By 1996 this 'sherrying' process will be complete, and the Edradour, like the more famous Macallan, will be a 100 per cent sherry-wood malt. Campbell Distillers' other malt, Aberlour, produces more than 50 times as much whisky as Edradour. Although it is only a stone's throw from the Spey it has little of Edradour's charm. The first licensed distillery on the site burnt down at the turn of the century and the new buildings are dour and functional. The only historical charm is provided by St Dunstan's (or St Drostan's) Well, where - according to legend - heathen chieftains were baptised. If Aberlour looks modern, Kenny Fraser, head 'brewer', is adamant that nothing has changed in the whisky itself: 'We still make whisky as we did 50 years ago, although it's a little more sophisticated,' he says. Computers now watch over the process from the steeping of the grist or milled, malted barley to the transformation of the sweet, porridgy wort into beery wash prior to distillation. The wash is distilled twice, then run off into cask and left to mature. 'Mature in peace' is what I nearly wrote, but Kenny serenades the casks with his antique bagpipes; something perhaps more pleasant for Scotch whisky than it would be for most people living on the other side of the border. Kenny arrived in 1970, so all the Aberlour currently on the market was reared in this way. I am happy to say that he put down his pipes in order to put me through a tasting of Aberlours and Edradours at different stages of their development from the new-run spirit to the 1969. I have always found new whisky rather attractive with its smells of pears, raspberries and bananas. It is hard to tell that it is not fresh, fruit schnapps until you taste the cereal character on the palate. About 10 years ago, malt distillers began to re-use Bourbon casks to house Scotch whisky. Now malts fall into two main styles: those which derive their mellowness from years in Kentucky oak and those which absorb a sweet, raisiny character from ageing in old oloroso casks from Jerez in Spain. The straight, 10-year-old Aberlour has a strong nutty, buttery character with a bouquet of raisins and dried apricots which marks it out as a sherry-wood whisky. Edradour is rather sweet, with a taste of honey and walnuts; a real after-dinner whisky. More recently Aberlour has released two superb 21-year-old whiskies: a 1969 and a 1970. These are perfect illustrations of the two schools. The '69 is all sherry-wood and smells like rich fruitcake with a hint of smokiness. More of a whisky-drinker's whisky is the '70, the first made by Kenny Fraser. This was housed in Kentucky casks, giving it a nutty, cereal character with a porridge-like smell recalling the wort. These are two whiskies which will make admirable additions to a collection. Information: Edradour is open to visitors all year. Tel: 0796-2095. Around 3,600 bottles of the numbered 1969 Aberlour will be sold from duty-free shops only. Some of the 8,000 bottles of the Aberlour 1970 will be available from specialist merchants.</p>

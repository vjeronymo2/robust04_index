			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview of Captain 3rd Rank (Res.) Mikhail Kolchev by </F> Vyacheslav Mamontov, place and time not indicated: "Why a  Military Trade Union?"]    [Text] A lot has been said and written lately about  the Independent Trade Union of Service Members (NPSV). Press  attention was drawn to it by the scandalous departure of one of  the leaders from the organization and his announcement of the  self-dissolution of the NPSV. This incident also interested me.  Especially since two years ago, as soon as the trade union  appeared, I prepared the first article in the military press  about it. How then are things going with the public association  of service members today? What problems is the NPSV resolving in  the field of social protection of the man in shoulder boards? I  asked the Chairman of the Central Committee of the NPSV, Captain  3rd Rank (Res.) Mikhail Kolchev to talk about this.    [Mamontov] Mikhail Ivanovich, two years ago, in instituting  the military trade union, you made a loud statement about  independence in its name. From what did you want to be  independent? From the Defense Ministry? From the existing system  of resolving the social problems of service members?    [Kolchev] Indeed, the name of our organization was perceived  by many in the literal sense. But we were trying primarily to  say to service members that we intended seriously and in a  businesslike manner to work at the protection of their  professional, socioeconomic, and spiritual rights and interests.  And in these things one can hardly succeed by relying solely on  oneself. For this reason, we immediately began to establish  contacts not only with the state organs, but also with the  public associations that have set themselves the task of social  protection of service members. We proposed to them that we join  forces. The reply was a simple one: "Every man for himself." We  came forward with the initiative to create a supervisory  council, consisting of the representatives of public  organizations of service members, for monitoring the expenditure  of the resources received from the sale of written-off military  equipment. It was calculated that by selling just one submarine,  we could provide housing to all the apartment-less officers in  Moscow. But this too turned out to be something no one needed.  So we resolve our tasks by our own efforts, naturally without  refusing the assistance of interested departments and  organizations. In this context, we have established close  contacts with the Defense Ministry, the Ministry of Social  Protection, the Federal Employment Service, and the Russian  Union of Veterans of Afghanistan.    [Mamontov] But after all, things did not develop smoothly  between you and the Defense Ministry at first.    [Kolchev] I won't deny it. Bureaucrats turned up who, upon  learning about our existence, tried to put a spike in the wheel.  In accordance with the Law on Trade Unions, the ministries and  departments are obliged to sign collective contracts for each  year with the labor collectives (in the army these are military  units). We sent all the constituent and organizational documents  in this regard to the Defense Ministry, but they were  pigeon-holed. They began to procrastinate, which we saw as an  attempt to close the trade union. Military jurists joined the  fray and tried to prove the unsoundness of our organization from  the legal standpoint.    It was hard to guess where it would all end. But we found a  quite simple solution. We prepared all of our programs and  documents and wangled a reception with the defense minister.  After becoming acquainted with our materials, Pavel Sergeyevich  supported us. The approaches to resolution of the urgent  problems of the army proposed by the trade union were a surprise  to him. By all appearances, someone had given him non-objective  information about us, which boiled down to [saying] that people  had come together in the military trade union to fill their  pockets at the army's expense.    [Mamontov] How do the rank-and-file members feel about these  initiatives of the central committee of the military trade union?    [Kolchev] They support us completely. We keep them  constantly  informed about our work by sending out informational digests to  the primary organizations. I have to say that the number of  members of the NPSV is growing constantly. Recently "newcomers"  have turned up in Kaliningrad, Orel, Voronezh, Liyepaya, St.  Petersburg, Kursk, Samara, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Khabarovsk.    In order to combine efforts in social protection of service  members, we have put forward an initiative for creation of a  Federation of Trade Unions of the Power Ministries and  Departments, and also put forward proposals to the corresponding  authorities regarding the creation of trade unions of the Border  Troops, the MB RF [Russian Federation Ministry of Security], the  tax police, the customs committee, and the Cossack formations.  Now there are already organizational committees formed to hold  constituent conferences for these trade unions.    [Mamontov] Judging from the available information, the trade  union is more known for its construction work.    [Kolchev] We are indeed greatly involved in supplying  housing  to service members. And here we have achieved some results. For  example, jointly with the International Migration Commission  (MMK) we have devised a program for construction of housing and  social adaptation of service members. Its essence lies in the  integrated resolution of the housing problem and retraining of  officers and warrant officers, discharged to the reserves, for  civilian specialties with allowance for the desires and needs of  the regions for particular professions. The program also  provides for allocation of resources to service members for  organization and development of their own affairs.  Implementation of the program began with the signing last year  of a contract to finance housing construction with the Agency  for International Development (AMR), which represents the  interests of the U.S. State Department, and a contractor, the  Fund for Financial Support of Small enterprises, which is a  structural component of the NPSV. After this, an additional  contract was signed between the AMR, the MMK and the NPSV for  the retraining of discharged service members. The work done in  this area by the trade union is unique in its way. You see, for  the first time investment funds are being sent directly to the  contractors, bypassing the state distribution channels.    But we are building housing not only with help from abroad.  We are trying to find a construction contractor and a sponsor,  and are finding parcels of land and signing contracts. For  instance, we were able to reach an agreement with the Murmansk  Nickel Combine for payment of construction for housing for  officers of the Northern Fleet using their products. We found a  company that would buy the nickel and pay the expenses for  construction. The result: 20 families of the Northern Fleet  members will have well-appointed housing. And the NPSV will  receive nothing for itself from this.    Naturally we understand that we cannot stick solely to  apartment problems. We also have other accomplishments. For  instance, in seeking to expand participation of the military in  privatization, we went to the government with a proposal to  provide state support to the association "Russian Business  Center of Reserve Service Members" organized by the NPSV. The  association was to assume full responsibility for social  adaption of former service members in a number of regions of  Russia. A draft order of the RF government was prepared  regarding the creation of a network of production enterprises on  the basis of the military camps freed up as a result of army  reform, with the participation of discharged service members and  their family members. Even now we have several such camps to our  credit and are beginning work to implement this project.    The military trade union has established the "Military  Investment Company," which is opening up the prospect of  financing our further programs for social and general living  arrangements of service members. Besides this, we have now begun  implementing the international project "Russian Life" to create  a military insurance company of the West European type, and are  also working to implement the concept of a non-state pension  fund for former service members.    [Mamontov] The military trade union is two years old. That  is  pretty young. It is true that you have a lot of work to do. But  surely you didn't undertake this work for the sake of building  apartments for discharged military, and creating different kinds  of funds?    [Kolchev] The problems which we must deal with today  naturally do not have to be inherent to the military trade  union. Construction of housing, the retraining of discharged  service members, these are state tasks. In the future we intend  to ensure that they remain so. Through the legislative  initiative which the military trade union possesses, in contrast  to other public associations, we will defend the professional,  socioeconomic, and spiritual rights and interests of service  members. You see, now many different documents are appearing  which infringe on the rights of the military, do not correspond  to the provisions of the Constitution, and violate the generally  accepted norms of human rights and freedoms. So we have no end  of work ahead of us. And we have already set about doing it. We  have prepared and sent to the government documents in which we  ask the state to assume the obligation of providing servicemen  with housing.    But ideally, the work of the trade union must boil down to  accomplishment of middleman functions between the Defense  Ministry and the persons signing the contract for performance of  military service. Here we will have to ensure compliance with  the terms of the contract, by providing legal, juridical, and  social assistance to service members, and protecting their  interests in different conflict situations with their employer.  Without interfering in the principle of one-man command. As you  see, it is a subtle and complex problem. And we have to be  serious about it. For that reason we hope that the service  members will support us in every way. After all, only by  combining our efforts can we obtain respect for the army and for  the military man, and be able to live and do our duty to the  Motherland worthily.    [Mamontov] Thanks for the talk, and good luck in your work.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 1 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The preliminary draft of the "Fiscal 1994 Unfair  Trade Report" compiled by the Industrial Structure Council (an  advisory body to the minister of international trade and  industry), which has been examining the unfair trade policies  and measures of the United States, and other major trading  partners of Japan, was made public.    With regard to the United States, the draft report  criticizes  its trade policy of setting numerical targets and expresses  serious concern about the unilateral measures it takes, such as  those based on the Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Act  (on the identification of and sanctions against countries guilty  of unfair trade practices). It suggests that Japan should make  full use of GATT conflict settlement procedures to resist such  U.S. actions. It also points out that to dissuade the United  States from adopting such policies, Japan needs to promote the  introduction of more transparency into government procurement  procedures, the abolition of nontariff barriers, and the easing  of regulations.    This report, which will be issued in May, is the Japanese  version of the "Global Trade Barriers" report issued by the U.S.  trade representative on 31 March. Since Japan-U.S. economic  frictions have been intensifying recently, the United States is  expected to react strongly to the Japanese report.    The report is divided into two sections, the first part is  an  overview and the second part goes into specific issues. The  overview discusses: 1) what constitutes unfair trade policy;  2) major trade partners; 3) a general discussion of each trade  partner; and 4) responses to unfair trade policies. The report  determines unfairness based on the Uruguay Round general  agreement to be signed by participating nations in Marakkech,  Morocco, in mid-April and the basic principles of international  law. The section on major trade partners includes the United  States, the European Union (EU), ROK, Hong Kong, Australia, and  five other countries and areas with which Japan conducts most of  its trading activities.    The second section deals with 13 unfair policies and  measures--such as quotas, antidumping measures, and subsidies,  respectively--pointing out the problems and the countries  adopting those policies.    According to the draft report, the United States is guilty  of  unfair practices in nine of the 13 areas, repeating its record  in fiscal 1993. The EU is brought to task in four areas (six in  1993) and the ROK, five (six in 1993).    In the case of the United States, the report stresses that  it  takes unilateral measures, abuses antidumping measures, and  gives priority to U.S. products in government procurement. In  particular, the paper takes issue with such unilateral measures  as the revival of the Super 301 provision and the financial  retaliation bill.    The report also takes up the U.S. trade policy of setting  numerical targets, which the United States strongly demanded at  the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, expressing strong  criticism. It states that setting numerical targets for the  future to ask Japan to increase imports "is not only lacking in  economic rationality, but also runs counter to the spirit of  GATT."    Apart from the 10 major countries and areas, the report also  discusses China and Taiwan, which are preparing for GATT  membership, for the first time, pointing out "barriers to be  rectified." For China, the report asks for consistency and more  transparency in its systems and improvement in the areas of high  tariffs and import and export quotas. In the case of Taiwan,  high tariffs, the service trade, and subsidies are cited, with  the request that it take timely measures.</p>

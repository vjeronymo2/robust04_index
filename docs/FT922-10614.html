			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Bayer down 8% to DM812m BAYER, the German chemical group, yesterday announced a drop of 8 per cent, to DM812m (Dollars 492m), in pre-tax profits for the first quarter. It expressed little hope of any marked improvement this year. The results showed a much flatter decline than those of its domestic rivals, however. Hoechst's pre-tax result was down 26 per cent in the first three months, while BASF suffered a 25 per cent slide. Bayer's stronger performance reflected its greater involvement in the non-cyclical pharmaceuticals sector, accounting for half of profits. It said its operations in the US and parts of western Europe had experienced initial signs of economic revival. Group turnover was 4 per cent higher at DM11.2bn, but eased by 2 per cent in Europe to DM7.5bn. In North America, however, there was a 17 per cent increase to DM2.3bn, helped by the stronger dollar. The company said trends in the consumer and industrial sectors were different. This year, its hopes were concentrated on consumer-related products such as cosmetics, while its expectations on the industrial side weren't as positive. Health care products were buoyant in the first quarter, with a 14 per cent jump in sales to DM2.3bn. Industrial chemicals showed a 6 per cent turnover improvement to DM2bn. The agricultural division also improved.</p>

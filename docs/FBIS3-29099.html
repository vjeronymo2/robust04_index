The general secretary of the People's Party of Pakistan,  Rafiq Ahmad Sheikh, declared that the Pakistani Government and  people will as ever fully support the principled stand of the  Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and the government of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea for achieving the  independent and peaceful reunification of the country without  foreign interference and solving the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks.    The president of the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon,  Walid Jumblatt, voiced support for the efforts of the WPK and  the Korean people for reunifying the country through confederacy  in accordance with the three principles of national  reunification and solving the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks.    The general secretary of the People's Unity Party (Unionist)  of Jordan, Talal Hafun Ala Mai, said the Korean people, under  the wise guidance of His Excellency Kim Chong-il, are undaunted  by the imperialists' pressure and blockade. He expressed the  belief that the Korean people will surely win the struggle  against imperialism.    "I will regard it as my obligation to support the Korean  people's cause of national reunification," he added.    The general chairman of the Central Direction Council of the  Golkar Party of Indonesia, Harmoko, received a delegation of the  WPK on February 8. He said it is natural that Indonesia, a  member nation of the Non-Aligned Movement, expressed support for  the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.</p>

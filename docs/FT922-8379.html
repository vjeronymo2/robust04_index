			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Value promised in DoE Canary Wharf decision A CLEAR assurance that any decision by government departments to rent office space in Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf development or elsewhere in London's Docklands would be taken on 'strict value-for-money grounds' was given by Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, in the Commons last night. During the resumed debate on the Queen's Speech he was closely questioned by Labour MPs about reports that the government was about to throw a lifeline to the troubled property developer. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary and a candidate for the Labour leadership, said it was quite remarkable that the 'white knights' who appeared to be riding to Olympia &amp; York's rescue were Mr Howard and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The two departments they controlled - environment and trade and industry - were apparently contemplating paying 'very large sums in rent to Olympia &amp; York for otherwise unlettable office space'. Mr Gould recalled that it was Mr Heseltine who initiated the London Docklands Development Corporation 'and invested so much of his reputation in its success'. Denying that there was any 'mystery' about the decision to consider renting office space in Docklands, Mr Howard said it was well known that the building occupied by the Department of the Environment in Marsham Street, Westminster, was to be demolished. Mr Howard said that, according to the advice given to ministers, the best value for money now available was in Docklands, although not necessarily in Canary Wharf. 'We will make our decision on the basis of the best value-for-money available,' he said. The government secured a majority of 31 (323-292) to defeat a Labour attack on its environment and education policies in the Commons last night. Liberal Democrat and Ulster Unionist MPs joined with Labour in the first challenge to the government since it secured an overall majority of 21 in last month's general election.</p>

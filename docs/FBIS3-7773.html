Therefore, in principle the Russian plan  involves greater authority and thus also a quicker solution. We  shall see who is pleased with this initiative and who is not.  For the time being the replies from the West have been a bit  reserved and ambiguous. However, we support such an initiative  in any case. Regarding the U.S. plan, if we demand  self-determination for ourselves and know that the Serbian side  would not agree to any sort of political dependence or  subordination to other sides, we have no democratic right, and  we must allow the negotiations between the Muslims and the  Croats, especially in the political sphere, as long as they are  not to our detriment. These talks have to do with an internal  matter, a question of their domestic relations, so to speak;  naturally, this is all based on the fundamental assumption that  this will not be a military alliance, as it was at the beginning  of the war, but a political integration that suits them.    [Unidentified correspondent] Given the circumstances, how  should one understand the position of the Serbs and define the  Serbian interest?    [Koljevic] Well, I believe that this was already defined a  few days ago -- in THE WASHINGTON POST yesterday or the day  before -- namely, that the Serbs will be absolutely free to  choose their form of constitution, that they will be able to set  themselves up independently in the Srpska republic or unify with  Serbia, which is actually the wish of the people and in our  natural historic interest. This is already being mentioned  publicly as a viable option in the United States if this thing  between the Muslims and the Croats proves to be viable.</p>

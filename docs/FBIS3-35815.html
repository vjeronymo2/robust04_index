			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of the </F> All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, by  Vladimir Zaynetdinov and Valeriy Gorchakov; place and date not  given: "Evening Call to Anatoliy Lysenko. Is It Becoming  Quieter on the Screens?"]    [Text] It is entirely likely that millions of television  viewers of the Russian channel may soon be left without their  favorite serial "Santa Barbara," the "A" program, and live  relays of sports matches. The volume of television and radio  broadcasts has been halved -- the Ministry of Finance has cut  the budget of Russian television by one-half. Anatoliy Lysenko,  general director of the All-Russia State Television and Radio  Broadcasting Company, has painted a very gloomy picture.    [Lysenko] This year we will need almost 1 trillion rubles  [R] to be able to work normally. Of this, 77 percent goes  automatically to the Ministry of Communications to pay for  broadcasting. The meager funding is liable to cause the loss of  the broadcasting network on the large territory of Russia.  Relay transmitters will be closed down.    The sum is a large one, and yet this is a political issue  rather than an economic one. Today television and radio are the  only links between individual regions in Russia and the center.  If we come off the air in these regions, then the air space  will definitely be pulled apart by local television companies.  The disintegration of the single television air space may mark  the beginning of territorial disintegration. What about the  Russian-speaking population in "nearby foreign countries"? For  example, the Baltic states only relay our channel. There the  price of communications services is even higher.    No one in the government is particularly looking into the  heart of the matter today. They believe that having "Ostankino"  will be enough but, after all, even "Ostankino" has had its  budget cut by 50 percent. With the disappearance of the Russian  television station, Russian national television as such will  cease to exist. "Ostankino" is an interstate channel.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Maybe it is worth thinking about  national commercial television? Independent television!    [Lysenko] The idea is a good one, but economically  impossible today. What commercial structure would pump billions  into something just like that, with practically zero profit? In  our country everyone has gotten used to the idea that television  is free.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What lies in store for the employees  of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting  Company?    [Lysenko] Approximately a 40-percent reduction -- primarily  among the journalists. Televized shows, the most attractive  programs, will have to be given up -- they are the most  expensive. We will keep children's broadcasts to the end, and,  naturally, "Vesti."    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is the solution?    [Lysenko] The only thing that can save us is state support.  But somehow I do not believe we will get any. In the three  years of our existence there have already been five edicts of  the Russian Federation president on support to the Russian  television company, but when it comes down to it, it turns out  that there is no money. This is frequently stated by people who  have ratified the latest edict. We have nothing and no one to  pin our hopes on. Boris Nikolayevich has the last word.</p>

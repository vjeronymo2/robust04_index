			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hillsdown sees heavy trading SHARES in Hillsdown Holdings were the most heavily traded in the London market yesterday as the company announced a boardroom shuffle which included the replacement of Sir Harry Solomon, the chairman. A maintained dividend was also pledged. The shares, which have surged in recent days, rose 8 to 130p in heavy turnover of 23m. Analysts heralded the board changes as a possible turning point in the company's fortunes, with the new chairman expected to hasten Hillsdown's restructuring programme andconcentrate on its core food manufacturing. Among the disposals already being hinted at in the market yesterday was the sale of Hillsdown's furniture business, with Silentnight rumoured as a potential buyer. However, in the short term many observers see Hillsdown continuing to struggle to improve earnings. Mr Carl Short at Nomura commented: 'Hillsdown needs pruning back, but it will be a long and difficult task. There is unlikely to be any impact on the business from the new management until 1994.' He predicted a 26 per cent drop in earnings per share this year, following falls of some 15 per cent in both 1990 and 1991. GEC in demand Aggressive buying by Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL), the French-owned stockbroker, was said to have been res-ponsible for the strong performance by GEC late on Tuesday and throughout yesterday. CLL moved into the market after what was described as a 'very positive' meeting on Tuesday with Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, Mr David Newlands, the group's finance director, and CLL's institutional clients. Mr Mike Styles, an electronics specialist at CLL, said the GEC directors had detailed the company's strengths, highlighting the success of the Alsthom joint venture, the group's dividend growth policy, strong cash position and the impressive balance sheet. 'If you do not believe the UK recovery story, then look no further than GEC,' said Mr Styles. GEC shares moved up 7 to 269p on volume of 5.6m. RMC flurry Suggestions that Cazenove, RMC's stockbroker, had hoisted its current year profits forecast for the aggregates group and promoted some keen buying interest in the stock was the prime motivation behind a strong performance for RMC shares, finally 15 ahead at 542p. Dealers said the initial flurry of buying had uncovered 'a horrible shortage of stock', and led dealers to mark the shares sharply higher. Building specialists said Cazenove had increased its earnings estimate from Pounds 140m to Pounds 152m, although this was not confirmed by Cazenove, which never discusses its market operations with the press. The general consensus for RMC's 1992 earnings ranges from around Pounds 140m to Pounds 155m. RMC shares have substantially outperformed the Footsie index in recent months. Since early October, the shares have risen more than 40 per cent while the Footsie has moved up around 10 per cent. Owners applause Tour operator Owners Abroad won applause for the deal struck with LTU, the German holiday group which earlier this year bought the Thomas Cook travel agent chain. Analysts said the agreement, in which Owners and Thomas Cook took a 10 per cent cross-holding, would benefit the UK operator financially and strategically. Among the many upgrades, Smith New Court raised this year's forecast by Pounds 4m to Pounds 38m. Paribas moved to a buy, arguing the deal would not only ensure Owners' dominant presence as the UK's second largest tour group, but also that it still did not rule out a bid from rival Airtours. However, others in the market, who had climbed aboard in the hope of an Airtours bid, felt otherwise and baled out. After dropping sharply, the shares recovered to close a penny down at 87p in turnover of 4m. Airtours was ahead by the same amount at 264p. Stocks with a perceived international exposure were helped by the steady flow of encouraging economic pointers from the US. ICI improved 11 to 1033p and BOC saw good two-way business and was bought up to 762p to leave a net advance of 14 on good turnover of 1.1m. Reuters improved 13 to 1346p. A unit of Reuters announced that it had bought new securities lending software from two UK-based companies for an undisclosed sum. The recent oil/gas discovery off the coast of Burmah made by Premier Consolidated continued to drive the latter's shares higher; they closed 3 firmer at 21p on keen turnover of 6.9m. At least three of the leading UK building materials companies, Blue Circle, Tarmac and Pilkington were being touted as potential bid targets by market operators yesterday. A late bout of bid speculation saw all three share prices move ahead. The heaviest trading was in Pilkington, the troubled glass manufacturer, which last week raided its reserves to pay a maintained interim dividend. Pilkington settled 5 up at 90p on turnover of 5.9m. Tarmac, also among the market's bid favourites in recent months, moved up 6 1/2 to 106p with 5.4m shares traded. Blue Circle put on 3 at 178p on 1.8m. Tate &amp; Lyle improved as the market dwelt further on the impact of the new sweetener deal being negotiated with PepsiCo. However, observers pointed out that Tate had been optimistic on the subject for several weeks and most of the upside was already in the shares. They moved 1 1/2 higher to 399p. Some media stocks took heart from research on advertising prospects. Analysts said one survey, emanating from the US PaineWebber media conference, was predicting US advertising growth next year of between 0.2 per cent and 3.7 per cent. Pearson, which has significant exposure to the US, rose 10 to 391p as marketmakers found themselves short of stock. However, Reed International, seen as overvalued, eased a penny to 632p. Media-buying company Aegis fell 3 to 17p after the group announced more restructuring and Pounds 20m in exceptional costs. The company said trading conditions were expected to remain difficult in the main European markets. The Daily Telegraph exceeded its issue price for the first time yesterday. The shares were floated at 325p in June but began trading around the 290p level. Yesterday, the stock climbed 8 to 330p. Mirror Group remained firm, closing 3 1/2 stronger at 89 1/2 p, helped by some talk that the administrators were considering placing part of their stake at 125p. Specialist chemicals manufacturer MTM was the principal casualty in the London stock market yesterday. The shares halved in value after the group announced the need for further provisions because of poor trading. MTM said: 'The continuing high level of debt and associated interest payable, as well as the exceptional fees being incurred has negated any short term financial progress being made. The decline in the pound/dollar exchange rate has increased the group's sterling obligations. MTM shares closed 16 lower at 15p. A stock overhang was responsible for the decline in Associated British Ports. The stock gave up 7 to 341p. Shares in Alvis jumped 5 to 19p after the results. Among aerospace stocks, the news that the Airbus consortium had won an order for 28 aircraft from ILFC led to strong demand for British Aerospace. The shares jumped 7 to 147p in heavy trade of 8.3m. Strong demand for Rolls-Royce after it said it would supply Dollars 160m of engines to power ILFC aircraft was tempered by dividend worries The shares closed 5 1/2 higher at 109 1/2 p. Optimism in the sector also boosted Smiths Industries and the stock firmed 4 to 352p. Smith New Court, however, remains cautious. Two trades totalling 15.4m shares in BET were executed at 75p, apparently an overnight tax-related deal. BET closed unchanged at 83p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (56).

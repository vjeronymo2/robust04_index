India has been working hard to establish a political process and  stage a show of holding elections there for the last two years.  However, it failed badly in its efforts. Now again, the Indian  government has established a committee to reinstate a political  process in occupied Kashmir. This committee, composed of  parliament members, will present recommendations on how to  restart a political process. Earlier, India had tried to bring  its former faithful and loyal Kashmiris forward to do this job.  Dr. Farooq Abdullah was given a lot of coverage in the media in  this context. He was sent abroad as a member of Indian  deputations and efforts were made to send him to military areas  in Srinagar behind military security. The Kashmiri people were  told that Dr. Farooq Abdullah's recommendations are very  important in freeing Kashmiri freedom fighters in Indian  military custody and that he can help in resolving other issues  also. Thus, Farooq Abdullah sat in Srinagar's military camp,  sent out a message to the people, and waited for them to come  visit him. However, soon the Indian government learned that the  Kashmiri people have not only dismissed Dr. Farooq Abdullah, but  also hate him. Not only Farooq Abdullah, but every pro-India  Kashmiri is the target of their hatred. After the assassination  of Wali Mohammed Raitu, former speaker of Kashmir Assembly,  pro-India Kashmir politicians living in Jammu and Indian areas  felt unprotected and were looking for protection. The Indian  government deployed additional troops for their protection. The  Indian efforts to establish a political process in Kashmir were  greatly set back by Wali Mohammed Raitu's assassination. The  pro-India Kashmiri politicians are scared and are hesitating in  supporting India now. They are not prepared to come out in the  open. The Kashmiri leaders associated with the National  Conference and the Congress Party consider themselves  unprotected despite all the security. They are moving to other  cities quietly. This situation shows that India's plans to  establish a political process in Kashmir appears to be ruined  again.    Meanwhile the militant organizations in occupied Kashmir  have  made it clear that they will not let any efforts to establish  political process in the state be successful. The control of the  Indian military is limited to around military camps only. No  system is left for the daily administration of cities and  villages. On the other hand, the freedom fighters have full  control over their areas and they administrate the daily affairs  there. The Indian soldiers and paramilitary forces enjoy a broad  range of privileges. However, because of their fear of the  freedom fighters, they have become very corrupt. For a little  money they even sell their weapons and ammunition. The military  officers have to court martial soldiers every other day for  selling weapons and ammunition. The incidence of corruption is  so frequent that even Indian newspapers have started to publish  news about it. The Indian government and the military high  command are greatly perturbed by this situation. One reason for  their distress is that despite quick transfers and other actions  they cannot put a stop to these corrupt practices. Some  observers have suggested that the Indian military and  paramilitary personnel have become demoralized as they have no  clear goal for fighting this war against the invisible enemy in  Kashmir. In addition to selling weapons, they also destroy them  and relate incidents of imaginary confrontations with the  freedom fighters and losing their weapons there.    The laws, especially anti-Muslim laws, that were prevalent  in  occupied Kashmir before the present campaign began are slowly  disappearing. Slaughtering cows in occupied Kashmir was a crime.  This law was enacted during the Dogra regime. A person whose  "crime" of slaughtering a cow was proved was sentenced to 14  years of hard labor in jail. This law is still part of the  present legal books in occupied Kashmir. However, now people  slaughter cows openly and eat its meat with great pleasure.  These days, beef is sold at 35 rupees per kilogram in Srinagar  in the open market. Other anti-Muslim laws in occupied Kashmir  are meeting the same luck. Even the Indian officials there know  that India has no future in occupied Kashmir and the Kashmiri  people will not accept India.    Although political processes has ended in occupied Kashmir  and the militant organizations have taken over, Sayyed Gailani  and Shabir Ahmed Shah have great influence among the people.  Amanullah Khan of the Liberation Front is also greatly respected  there. However, Sayyed Gailani and Shabir Ahmed Shah are revered  there and perhaps that is the reason India has jailed them. A  major part of these leaders' lives is being spent in Indian  jails. The feeling that India refuses to accept any practical  solution to the Kashmir problem just because of its enmity  toward Pakistan and its unwillingness to work with Pakistan to  find a solution gives strength to the political leaders in  occupied and Azad Kashmir. Therefore, we should provide an  opportunity to Kashmiri leaders on both sides of the Line of  Control to find a respectable solution to this problem. This  feeling was expressed by the All Parties Huriat Conference and  Azad Kashmir leaders, especially Prime Minister Sardar Abdul  Qayum Khan many times. This idea is getting support in Western  nations now. It was learned that Lord Aubry of the British  Parliament is trying to organize a conference in which Kashmiri  leaders from both sides can participate. President Abdul Qayum  Khan has expressed a desire to participate in this conference if  the leaders of occupied Kashmir are also given the opportunity  to participate in it. There is no restriction on him or any Azad  Kashmir leader for participation in this conference. However,  India will not permit leaders of occupied Kashmir to  participate. If these leaders are not allowed to take part in  this conference, the main goal of this conference will not be  achieved and his participation will be useless. India should  create an appropriate environment if it desires to improve the  situation in occupied Kashmir and wants to find an acceptable  solution of the Kashmir problem. Otherwise, it would be  understood that India is not willing to be  reasonable.</p>

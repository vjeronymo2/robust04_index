			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Surveys show C2s starting to change their allegiances THE HEADLINE figures of this weekend's opinion polls showed the Tories making up some of the deficit on Labour. But there was still precious little cheer for them in the fine print. It showed that the battle of Jennifer's ear had left health unrivalled as the campaign's main issue. Although the broadcast did not appear directly to have bolstered Labour's ratings, neither did it significantly harm them. Overall, the party remained comfortably ahead of the Tories on this key topic. The polls again highlighted the Conservatives' failure to get tax on to the agenda and underlined Labour's continuing improvement on matters of economic competence. Perhaps most worrying of all for the Tories, two surveys showed them heavily losing the struggle for vital C2s votes. It was this skilled working class that underpinned the victories of the Thatcher years. According to ICM for the Sunday Express, Labour's lead among the C2s stands at a startling 14 points, up from just 5 two weeks ago. NOP for The Mail on Sunday put Labour's edge among C2s at 6 points, double what it was a week earlier. NOP for The Independent on Sunday offered the Conservatives a glimmer of light, suggesting that 65 per cent of C2s thought their taxes would rise under Labour. But Mori for The Sunday Times indicated that only 12 per cent of voters saw tax as one of the prime issues determining which way they will vote. That compared with six out of 10 respondents who regarded health as a key issue. Labour's lead as the party with the best National Health Service policies was left intact in the wake of the Jennifer broadcast, with Harris for The Observer putting it at 14 points. The LibDems' decision to keep out of the subsequent slanging match over how the subject's name entered the public domain lies behind the strong increase to 30 per cent in the number of NOP/Independent on Sunday respondents saying the party was running the most impressive campaign. In a good week for the party, Mr Paddy Ashdown, its leader, has closed to within 5 points of John Major in his personal ratings as tracked by NOP/Mail on Sunday. A total of 51 per cent now think Mr Major is doing a good job, against 46 per cent for Mr Ashdown and 35 per cent for Mr Kinnock. In Scotland an opinion poll by Mori for the Sunday Times confirmed Labour's strong lead, putting it on 42 per cent (down one point from a week ago). The Scottish National party was on 27 per cent (unchanged), the Conservatives on 20 per cent (unchanged) and the Liberal Democrats on 10 per cent (up one point).</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Steel profiling plant to close British Steel Strip Products is closing its profiling plant at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham with the loss of 56 jobs. The closure is part of a rationalisation plan to be carried out over the next few months. It follows the purchase in March of two profiling plants from RTZ, the international mining group. The acquisitions improved British Steel's market position but with continuing overcapacity it wants to cut costs by closing one of its three plants, which turn flat steel sheets into shaped products.</p>

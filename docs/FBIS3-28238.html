			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Manae Kubota, head of the  Economic Planning Agency (EPA) and also member of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP), said Friday [4 February] the current  wrangling over a new tax within the ruling coalition parties is  heading toward settlement.    Negotiations are under way between the SDP, a chief opponent  of the 7 percent "national welfare tax" proposed by Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and other groups in Hosokawa's  seven-party coalition, the EPA director general told a press  conference. But an early settlement is possible only if the  coalition parties agree to revise the content of the new tax,  particularly its purpose and the rate of taxation, Kubota said.    Kubota strongly dismissed the new tax as a source of  financing for the 6 trillion yen income tax cut expected in the  government's new pump-priming package, branding it "a  consumption tax increase in disguise."    It is "very regrettable" that the prime minister decided to  introduce the new tax without going through "due process,"  including full discussion among the coalition parties and  working to achieve a national consensus, Kubota said.    She said the EPA is prepared to announce the new economic  package as soon as the dispute over the new tax is settled.    Kubota said the new tax should be modified so that the use  of  its proceeds is limited to social welfare-related areas.    Hosokawa's new tax does not oblige the government to use the  proceeds in specific ways even if it is called a welfare tax.    She also sought a revision of the tax rate, explaining the  need for full-fledged discussions to justify a specific rate.    As for the timing of the tax's enforcement, she said it  should be delayed as long as possible in view of the economic  impact.    Kubota said she is prepared to resign as EPA chief if the  national welfare tax is endorsed as it currently stands.    In reference to the 6 trillion yen tax cut, Kubota said the  scale of the measures should have an impact on the Japanese  economy, especially on stagnant personal spending.</p>

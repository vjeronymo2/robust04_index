			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo (Japanese </F> Trade Union Confederation), by unidentified MAINICHI SHIMBUN  reporter, from the "Listening Without Reservation" column; place  and date not given]    [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How do you rate the Hata  government?    [Yamagishi] The Hata government is a government led by  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. Mr. Koji Kakizawa,  who once attacked the reformist policies of the coalition  government in the Diet interpellation session, has become  foreign minister. A majority of the Hata cabinet members are  former Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] cabinet members. The Hata  government is a carbon copy of the LDP government. The Hata  government is positively responding to legislation at a time of  emergency and constitutional debate which is aimed at paving the  way for Japan to exercise its right to collective defense. The  Hata cabinet is different from the Hosokawa cabinet and most of  the Hata cabinet members are hard-liners. The Hata cabinet will  not push for reform. Changes occurred because political  intentions to change worked when the Hosokawa cabinet was in  place. With the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and  Sakigake [Harbinger] out of the coalition, however, the Hata  government has largely lost its internal-check mechanism. The  issue of foreign policy and defense is the tip of an iceberg.  What concerns me is that such a trend may appear in domestic  policy.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How will Rengo deal with the situation?    [Yamagishi] Rengo maintained a cooperative relationship with  the Hosokawa government. This time, however, Rengo has no  choice but to wrangle with the Hata government over policy. I  feel as if my relatives have become other people.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Mr. Shigeto Nagano resigned as justice  minister for making remarks that the Nanjing massacre was a  "fabrication." What is your opinion?    [Yamagishi] I felt as if I was listening to broadcasts aired  by the Japanese military during the war. Mr. Nagano is a  convicted criminal [kakushinhan]. What is at issue is why Prime  Minister Hata appointed Mr. Nagano as justice minister knowing  what he does about him. If the prime minister himself decided  to appoint Nagano as justice minister, he should be held  politically responsible and questions should be raised about his  choice. If the prime minister appointed him as justice minister  after being pressed by others, that is a problem. I cannot help  but say that Mr. Nagano was appointed as justice minister in  line with a certain political strategy. The basic posture of  the Hata cabinet is being questioned and Prime Minister Hata's  appointment of Mr. Nagano as justice minister is not an issue  that can be resolved simply by revoking the controversial  remarks and Nagano's resignation. In principle, the Hata  cabinet deserves to suffer defeat in a no-confidence vote in the  Diet.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The talk is that a general election  should be held after dissolving the House of Representatives.    [Yamagishi] The Hata cabinet should seek the public  confidence at the earliest date.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Will the general elections be held under  the current multiseat constituency system?    [Yamagishi] The most desirable way is to hold the general  election under the new electoral system. If no decision is made  on the demarcation of small constituencies, it will create a  political vacuum that may continue for six months or a year.  This should not be allowed to occur.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] A major political task is reform of the  current tax system. Is there any possibility that the issue of  reforming the current tax system will lead to the dissolution of  the House of Representatives?    [Yamagishi] Effort should be made to draw a fruitful  conclusion to reform of the current tax system by June, when the  current Diet session ends. The SDPJ should not shun the issue  of reforming the tax system on the grounds that it has now  become an opposition party; that would be irresponsible.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What, then, will happen next?    [Yamagishi] North Korea's suspected development of nuclear  weapons will likely generate heated debate on the issue of  Japan's security. The security issue could provide the excuse  for a no-confidence vote in the Diet against the Hata cabinet.  It is highly possible that the issue could then trigger the  dissolution of the House of Representatives.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What would be the main points of  contention in the ensuing general election?    [Yamagishi] I think the tactics of power politics would be a  major issue. Other points of contention would be the choice  between open politics and back-door politics. The choice  between politics for the people and politics for party interests  will be taken up as a major campaign issue at the next general  election.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are you going to deal with the  chilled relationship between the SDPJ and the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP]?    [Yamagishi] I cannot agree with the suggestion that Rengo  should distance itself from the chilled relationship. If Rengo  fails to handle the sour relationship properly, it would lead to  another split in Rengo. Rengo will play a role helping to patch  up their differences, while at the same time presenting the two  parties with its own policies. With the SDPJ at odds with the  DSP, how can we form a new liberal political party?    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Would you explain the plan to form a new  liberal political party?    [Yamagishi] The SDPJ has proposed forming a new liberal  political party from liberals from the SDPJ and the DSP, but I  do not agree with the plan. There is a misunderstanding that  the new liberal political party will be formed by liberals  mainly from the SDPJ and the DSP. I, however, intend to rally  all liberal forces. Specifically, I intend to rally reformers  from the SDPJ, the DSP, Sakigake, the Japan New Party and the  Mirai [Future] Party, the LDP, and other reformers keen to break  away from the LDP. The LDP does not know the meaning of reform.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of Rengo  forging an alliance with the LDP?    [Yamagishi] There is no such possibility. The LDP is a mix  of jade and stone. The jade is better than the stone. Rengo  advocated the need to tear down the 1955 system and form a  non-LDP government.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What are the major issues and where do  the liberal forces stand on them?    [Yamagishi] They are the Constitution and Japan's  international contributions. Liberal forces attach the maximum  importance to the current peace Constitution. Defending the  Constitution has both a negative and positive aspect. Japan  should make non-military international contributions. Japan  should make such international contributions in the non-military  and civilian fields through a reformed United Nations. Japan  should not play the role of the Self-Defense Forces on the world  stage. Japan should, rather, play the roles of the Ministry of  Health and Welfare, the Environment Agency, and the Ministry of  Labor. I hope that the Hata government will pay attention to  workers when it handles domestic policy.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] When do you think the general election  will be held?    [Yamagishi] In July at the earliest. It would then be held  shortly after the Naples summit, which is scheduled for early  July.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Some trade unions appear to have started  preparing for the general election already.    [Yamagishi] They have probably started preparing for the  general election. Many trade unions are aware that they must  prepare for a general election which is not too far away.</p>

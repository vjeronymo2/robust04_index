			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / Olympia &amp; York shake-up ahead of Dollars 20bn talks: Jubilee Line extension in doubt as banks assess Canary Wharf developer's funding OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the world's biggest property developer, last night announced a management shake-up and the appointment of financial advisers to guide it through the reorganisation of its borrowings. An executive close to the group said these were 'in excess of Dollars 20bn'. The disclosures came as it emerged that the future of the Pounds 1.3bn Jubilee Line underground extension to London's Docklands has been thrown into doubt by O&amp;Y's financial difficulties. Mr Paul Reichmann, chief executive officer of Olympia &amp; York, said that Mr Tom Johnson, the former president of Manufacturers Hanover, the US bank, had been appointed as the new president of Olympia and York Developments, O&amp;Y's main property subsidiary. Mr Johnson is replacing Mr Reichmann in that post, allowing Mr Reichmann more time to 'focus on Canary Wharf', according to an O&amp;Y adviser. Canary Wharf in Docklands is Europe's biggest new development of office blocks and is at the heart of O&amp;Y problems because of its huge construction costs. Mr Reichmann said that O&amp;Y 'remains fully committed to the completion of its Canary Wharf project'. O&amp;Y also said that JP Morgan, the US bank, James D Wolfensohn, the corporate finance advisory firm, and Burns Fry, the Canadian investment bank, had been appointed to advise O&amp;Y on its negotiations with banks. Two senior bankers who will be involved in the forthcoming debt talks said yesterday they expected the banks would have to convert part of their loans to O&amp;Y into equity, as part of the reorganisation of the property developer's borrowings. They said repayments on some of the debt would probably be rescheduled and there was also likely to be a need for new cash injections into O&amp;Y from the banks. The banks are forming a steering committee to handle negotiations with O&amp;Y. Bankers said that Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce would head the steering committee. O&amp;Y has formed a planning committee to manage negotiations with the banks. This will be chaired by Mr Johnson rather than by either of the Reichmann brothers, who own O&amp;Y. 'The problem for Mr Reichmann is that he is asset-rich and cash-poor. The real estate crunch has caused him to suffer gargantuan losses on paper and his assets are not as liquid as he thought they were,' said one banker. Mr Reichmann said yesterday that when the debt restructuring was completed 'it will take us through the current period of global recession in the real estate industry'. Mr Steven Miller of Wolfensohn will be vice-chairman of O&amp;Y's planning committee. Mr Miller was a vice-chairman of Chrysler and a decade ago restructured the US automotive manufacturer. However, bankers said the reconstruction of O&amp;Y's balance sheet had less in common with Chrysler reorganisation than with negotiations held in the 1980s with Latin American countries on the rescheduling of their debt. Other members of the planning committee include Mr John Zuccotti, president of O&amp;Y's US operations. Separately it emerged yesterday that O&amp;Y has not yet signed the agreement to contribute Pounds 400m to the project to extend the Jubilee Line to east London, which was agreed in principle with Mr Cecil Parkinson, then secretary of state for transport, in 1989. This contribution is be-ing looked at by banks as part of O&amp;Y's debt reorganisation. 'You won't find the banks building the Jubilee Line,' said a banker closely related to O&amp;Y. 'O&amp;Y made a commitment to the government that it would fund the construction. But that had nothing to do with the banks.' However, he said there would be detailed discussions between the banks, O&amp;Y and the government about how to finance the underground railway line. O&amp;Y is due to make its first contribution to the Jubilee Line extension, of Pounds 40m, at the end of this month with another Pounds 60m due at the end of March next year. The balance of Pounds 300m is not due until construction of the extension is complete in 1996.</p>

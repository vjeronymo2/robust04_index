			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / The Mood Of Britain: Clearing up after one hell of a party - Michael Cassell concludes his pre-election trip around the UK. He finds a sense of optimism in Essex, in contrast to the deep pessimism that persists in other areas of the country which have lost their past and not found a future BOSS CARS, one of the flashier motor dealers out along the Romford Road, stands ominously empty. It seems the customers went first, followed in quick succession by the cars and then the boss. 'We've got more motors to flog than Fergie's got fellas,' claims Trevor Satoretti, one of the surviving cheeky-chappy dealers kicking their heels on car lots to the east of central London. 'If you offered a free motor with every gallon of petrol you still wouldn't shift them,' he says. Trade is bad, he adds, but declines to put his theory to the test. Much of the route from the City out through Bow, Stratford, Forest Gate and Manor Park towards Essex proper, the land of conspicuous consumption, is lined by unchanging inner-urban neglect. In spite of appearances the local economy has until recently been thriving. In places like Chadwell Heath the fortunes of first-generation retailers have flourished on the strength of fat pay packets and easy credit. Video super-markets vied for business with satellite television distributors and camcorder and computer-game specialists. Beyond Dagenham, with its rows of privatised, customised council homes boasting satellite dishes and festoon curtains, lie Gidea Park and Harold Wood. Here, people like Henry France, an office equipment supplier, have made a 'quick turn' on privatisation share issues and have begun to worry about inheritance taxes. Driveways are jammed with Mitsubishi Shoguns and Suzuki Vitaras. 'Some of these houses need car park attendants,' mutters Nesta Beglan, a cleaning lady heading along The Ridgeway. The good times rolled in Essex in the 1980s. It became a cliche for base materialism and the butt of jokes in which the local youth are portrayed as sex-crazed simpletons loaded with cash. (By way of a printable example - Essex girl to friend: 'Do you like Chanel No. 5?' Answer: 'No, I only watch Sky One.') Lynne Transom is the real thing; a 22-year old Essex girl who lives in Barking and commutes into the City to work. She says of the jokes: 'Many are based on the idea we've got above our station, that we're better off but can't handle it. Talk about a classless society - it's pure snobbery.' Lynne and her family remain optimistic in spite of the recession. 'Times are harder, but we haven't done badly at all and want to do better,' she says. The Greek island of Mykonos, not Leigh-on-Sea, is this year's holiday destination. But if the 1980s saw a materialistic binge, the early 1990s brought the hangover. Mallards, the Ilford jewellers, advertises cash loans against the diamonds or Rolex watches bought in better times. 'Mrs Thatcher invited everyone to the party, then made them pay for their own drinks and left them to clear up afterwards,' claims George Wickham, a former police sergeant from Brentwood. 'We had a brief spell of prosperity, but I doubt we've made much real progress.' He points to the alienation of the 'have nots' from the 'haves'. The plight of those who have temporarily tasted a better life, only to have their aspirations dashed by the recession, can seem particularly hard. At Seven Kings, beyond Ilford, the streets are lined with Victorian villas converted into double-glazed castles. Dozens are for sale. Roy Ellis, a 30-year-old toolmaker, wants Pounds 67,000 for his three-bedroomed home close to the station. A former council tenant, he has no regrets about buying but needs something cheaper to ease the family budget: 'Buying a home was supposed to be a one-way bet. But loads of owners here have had to jack it in.' Ellis is not exaggerating. Mortgage arrears hearings at Ilford County Court rose by more than three quarters last year, with about half the cases resulting in repossession. With nearly 10,000 jobless people on the Ilford register, local job centres recently had just 64 vacancies. Winston Simms, an unemployed roofer from Hornchurch, is looking for building work: 'I did well for a bit but I'm right back where I was seven years ago,' he says. 'Isn't everyone?' In spite of repossessions and the credit card debts, the answer to that question for most Essex men and women appears to be 'No'. Working people here have invariably asserted themselves and live their lives the way they want; they rarely reminisce about some past golden age. There may be anger, a feeling of betrayal borne out of a return to relative hardship, but for most there remains more of a sense of delayed advancement which they expect to resume. The optimism is by no means universally shared around the country, and deep pessimism persists in areas which have lost their past and not found a future. It is, however, possible at the end of the journey to draw together some common strands journey which will form the backdrop to the coming election. For the majority, most of the 1980s were materially good. Real household incomes rose by more than a quarter; many people surprised themselves and bought homes, shares and even timeshares. The British became sceptical of government's ability to intervene and prevent industrial decline; coalmines and steelworks were shut, eliciting human sympathy but invoking a new realism about the value of state-sponsored rescues. About 1m more people became self-employed - though not always because they wanted to. The British were not weaned off the state; the economic shake-out forced the many jobless to become directly dependent upon it. And though people may yet accept the princi-ple of more choice in the public sector, it is to the state they expect to turn for education, health and public transport. By the end of the 1980s, deep reservations also persisted about the legitimate parameters of private enterprise. In the end, higher bills and higher boardroom salaries helped give privatisation a rather shady reputation. The 'divided nation' of north against south is not a cliche, though this recession has temporarily inverted the old order, with the south faring worst. The most notable division, however, is not purely geographic but also economic. Since 1979 the top half of the population raised its income by four times, the poorer half by only one quarter. The solidarity which bound those in and out of work in areas of deprivation has also broken down. Surveys invariably show Britain as a contented nation, but it has the second-highest divorce rate in Europe, a quarter of all households consist of a single person and births outside wedlock have more than doubled in 10 years. The family, another political pedestal of the 1980s, is being redefined. 'Large numbers of people have no one close to them to talk to, but they now appear more prepared to seek out someone who may help,' says Philip Hills, branch director of the Samaritans in Colchester, trying to explain the 50 per cent increase in cases on his books. 'Many have done very well for themselves and their families in recent years. But human hopes and problems remain basically the same.' In the 1987 general election, with Thatcherism at its height, Labour made a play for the nation's social conscience. The argument centred on the case for lower taxes for some or better public provision for all. The Tories claimed they could do both. Five years ago, Labour resoundingly lost the debate and the vote. This time it is trying the same tack, appealing to the voters' to follow it on to the higher, more expensive moral ground. Its real challenge is to convince the voters that, like them, it no longer has hang-ups about wealth-creation and prosperity and that it can deliver, in a constructive partnership between state and private enterprise, a better future. Mr John Major, who must strive to sharpen the contrast in political messages when most of the differences seem slight, must demonstrate that unpopular elements of his political bequest have been exorcised. His task is to promote a kinder, gentler Toryism, capable of looking after those knocked off the ladder of opportunity, but primarily intent on promoting individual rights, choices and personal ownership. If the opinion polls are to be believed, people from the Isle of Skye to the Isle of Sheppey remain divided on which flag to follow.

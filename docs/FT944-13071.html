			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Carignon appeal rejected Mr Alain Carignon, the former French communications minister who resigned in July following a corruption scandal, faces continued detention in a Lyon prison after his appeal was rejected yesterday. Mr Henri Blondet, the presiding judge, said there was 'serious, detailed, and corroborated evidence' against the former minister, who is charged with accepting gifts from business groups and arranging the rescue of his indebted campaign newspaper by a utilities company. In return, it is alleged that a water privatisation contract in the city of Grenoble, where Mr Carignon is mayor, was awarded to the utilities company. The Carignon investigation is one of a series of corruption probes which have rocked the centre-right government of prime minister Edouard Balladur and French business this year.</p>

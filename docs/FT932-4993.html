			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Tories shelve plan for environmental agency PLANS TO set up an environment agency have been put off by the government because there is not enough time in the next session of parliament, which begins in November, for the legislation to create it. The decision means that the bill will not be passed until 1995 at the earliest, bringing a further delay to fulfilling the Tories' election promise in this area. The Conservative manifesto pledged to establish an agency which combined the functions of the National Rivers Authority, the Inspectorate of Pollution and the waste regulation function of local councils. Postponing the bill is a sign that ministers believe 'green' issues have fallen down the political agenda and are well below law and order or education. News that the plans have been shelved came as Labour prepared to enhance its own appeal on environmental issues. Mr John Smith, the party leader, is to use a speech today to an audience of environmentalists and party officials to stake Labour's claim to be environmentally friendly. The lessening priority attached by the government to green issues which is signalled by the delay also offers Labour the chance to intensify its attack on claims that value added tax is to be imposed on domestic fuel to help the UK meet the commitments it accepted at the Rio summit last June. The green bill had originally been pencilled in for the present legislative session, but a row between the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture over the role of the agency put it to the back of the queue for parliamentary time. The legislation was also expected to cover hedgerows and national parks. This time, the policy had been agreed, but the bill was forced out of the programme at the last minute by the weight of Home Office measures. Environmental campaigners have already questioned the green credentials of Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, but the government's business managers dropped the bill while Mr Michael Howard, now the Home Secretary, was at the DoE. Ministers insist that in spite of the lack of legislation, the UK will be able to maintain its leading edge on environmental issues. 'The bill would not necessarily have been the centrepiece of our environmental policies anyway,' one said yesterday.</p>

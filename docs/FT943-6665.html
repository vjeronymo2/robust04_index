			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Gold Gold is torn between its role as an investment and its position as a commodity. The investment fundamentals are hardly positive. Rising US interest rates have increased the cost of holding non-yielding assets. The resurgence of inflation, which gold bugs predicted would be well established by now, has notably failed to materialise. The weakness of the dollar has made bullion a dismal investment for yen or D-Mark based investors. Meanwhile the hedge funds which fuelled gold's rally to over Dollars 400 an ounce last year appear to have turned sellers. Against this gloomy background it is surprising that bullion has remained so steadfastly around Dollars 380 through the usual summer lull. The pull of the wider commodities cycle might explain gold's resilience. It is certainly more difficult for gold to tumble while other metals are racing ahead. Economic recovery should mean greater demand for rings and other trinkets. The autumn will be important in this regard, as jewellers prepare for Christmas. Industrial demand might also be expected to pick up in line with the economic cycle. But the suspicion remains that investors and speculators rather than consumers will determine the final outcome. Another wave of selling by central banks, for example, could tip the balance against gold. Having seen bullion remain so stable during the summer doldrums, though, speculators must be tempted to try driving the price back through Dollars 400. With demand moving in their favour and inflation worries in the wings they may just succeed.</p>

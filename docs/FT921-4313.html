			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Poster blow to Tories IT appears the Conservatives will have to embark on their general election advertising blitz without the free use of Imperial Tobacco's poster sites, David Owen writes. Mr Peter Middleton, the Bristol-based company's sales and marketing director, said yesterday that it had 'no plans' to repeat the generosity it showed in the 1987 general election campaign. Then, the group - a cornerstone of the far-flung Hanson empire - made several hundred of its 2,500 permanent sites available to the Tories free of charge. Mr Middleton said it was 'highly unlikely' Imperial would hand the sites over this time, although it had not yet been asked. The company had its own commercial interests to pursue, he added. After the Budget, he suggested, Imperial would have its own important brand messages to communicate. Hanson has been a highly visible Conservative supporter over the years, contributing Pounds 652,000 to the party's coffers between 1979 and 1990, according to figures compiled by the Labour party. In 1990 alone the group's contribution to the Tory cause totalled Pounds 80,000. This put it fourth in the list of corporate givers to the Conservatives for that year behind United Biscuits (Holdings), the food manufacturer, Allied-Lyons, the brewing and drinks group, and P&amp;O, the shipping company.</p>

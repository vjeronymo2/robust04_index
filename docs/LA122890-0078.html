			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GHOST FLEET CARETAKER NOT READY TO ABANDON SHIPS;  </P> <P> MARITIME BATTLE: HE SAYS THE 66 VESSELS STORED IN A CHANNEL ABOVE SAN FRANCISCO  ARE READY FOR SERVICE IF THE NATION NEEDS THEM AGAIN. CONGRESSIONAL CRITICS  WANT TO JUNK THEM.  </P> <P> Scores of old rusting ships line a channel of an inland bay northeast of San  Francisco, looming out of the fog like a fleet of Flying Dutchmen condemned to  sail forever.  </P> <P> And they will, if Charlie Johnston has his way.  </P> <P> Congressional critics want to junk the 66-ship Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, but  Johnston, caretaker of the "ghost fleet," says that the ships are ready to  weigh anchor if the nation needs them again.  </P> <P> "Many of these ships go back to service in World War II, Korea, Vietnam," said  Johnston, 40, the fleet's acting superintendent.  </P> <P> During the last session of Congress, the ships here and at Ft. Eustis, Va., and  Beaumont, Tex., came under fire from the House Small Business Committee's  subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and energy.  </P> <P> "The taxpayers are getting repeatedly fleeced . . . for these maritime  cadavers," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), subcommittee chairman. William S.  Broomfield of Michigan, ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, described the ships as "glorified rust buckets."  </P> <P> The array of ships that local landlubbers call the "mothball fleet" is  impressive from a distance, however, and the spookiness that earned it the  nickname "ghost fleet" is evident while approaching in a tugboat.  </P> <P> They're tied in rows, anchored at the bow and stern and joined to one another  by gangplanks. Almost all are gray, and rust stains their hulls.  </P> <P> They include the Glomar Explorer, the CIA ship built to retrieve a sunken  Soviet submarine. Since the secret voyage off Hawaii in 1974, the 618-foot ship  has been waiting for a new role.  </P> <P> "We keep the Explorer here for the Navy," Johnston said, explaining that the  Glomar isn't Maritime Administration property, as nearly all the other ships  are.  </P> <P> You can't visit the Glomar, but the Meredith Victory, dubbed "The Gallant Lady"  for rescuing thousands of Korean War refugees, can be boarded.  </P> <P> Paint chips litter the deck, leaving metal naked to the elements and rust is  everywhere. Painters used to keep busy on the fleet, but money ran out in the  mid-1980s.  </P> <P> "Besides, to us rust is no big deal as long as the metal is sound," Johnston  said as he stamped his foot to show the steel's hardness. "If it really got bad  we could put another plate over it."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency is proposing to define ``shucked shellfish'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.3(s) as meaning molluscan shellfish that have one or both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shells removed. The labeling and recordkeeping requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in &sect;123.28(c) apply to shucked shellfish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is proposing to define ``tag'' in &sect;123.3(t) as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record of harvesting information attached to a container of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellstock by the harvester or processor. Under proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1240.60(b), the tag or bill-of-lading will identify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor, harvester, date of harvest, and State, including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific location of harvest. Most shellfish-producing States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and countries currently require that shellfish harvested in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters bear documentation with such information. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information is the minimum necessary to permit ready  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification of site and time of harvest of the shellfish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because raw molluscan shellfish directly reflect the quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the harvesting area, this information is necessary to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance that the shellfish were harvested from an area that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe and open for harvesting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Purpose and Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 123.5(a) of the proposed regulations references the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> umbrella CGMP guidelines in part 110 as providing general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance with regard to such matters as facility design,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials, personnel practices, and cleaning and sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. Because part 110 provides guidance of general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability to all foods, the agency intends that this guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will continue to be valid for seafood processors when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations at part 123 are issued in final form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;123.5(b) makes clear that the purpose of subpart A of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 123 is to set forth requirements specific to the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and importation of fish and fishery products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. HACCP Plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.6 that commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors and importers of fish and fishery products develop and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement HACCP plans in keeping with Principle 6 of the NACMCF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed previously. Development and implementation of an HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan requires that processors think through the entire process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow from raw materials to finished product shipping to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that safety hazards are controlled by design, and that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate that process as a matter of daily routine. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers, the thought process will begin with a decision from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whom and from where to buy fishery products and follow through to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements for shipment to the United States, storage in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States, and end when the product leaves the control of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer. The plan provides the structure for the preventive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls, including the recordkeeping associated with those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls, that a processor or importer is to employ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, FDA has tentatively concluded that the essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements of this structure must include: (1) The identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of hazards to ensure that the processor or importer knows what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hazards are, so that it controls them by design rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by chance (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)); (2) the identification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical control points to ensure that the processor or importer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knows where to monitor to prevent or minimize the occurrence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the relevant hazard (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(2)); (3) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification of critical limits that must be met at each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical control point, so that the processor or importer has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective standards in place by which to determine whether it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling the relevant hazard (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(3)); (4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the identification of procedures for how and when the processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or importer will monitor the critical control points to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both that monitoring is done as a matter of routine, and that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is done in an appropriate manner and with sufficient frequency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish preventive control (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4)); and (5) a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping system for that monitoring that will establish for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor's or importer's benefit that it is effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing a system of preventive controls, and record how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those controls are operating over time (proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.6(b)(5)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recordkeeping system is the key to HACCP. As explained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the records will enable the processor or importer, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultimately the regulator, to see the operations of the processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or importer through time, rather than only how they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functioning at a particular moment in time. Among other things,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP records can reveal trends that might otherwise go  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undetected until significant problems occurred. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

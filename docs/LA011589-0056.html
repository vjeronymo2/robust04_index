			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING'S LEGACY  </P> <P> Had he lived, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would have celebrated his 60th  birthday today. He would be proud of the progress that has resulted from the  civil-rights movement that he led. Legal segregation by race is prohibited.  Laws safeguard equal opportunity in the workplace, in housing, in schools, in  the courts, at the polls, in every public arena.  </P> <P> Black Americans have made spectacular individual gains since King's  assassination in 1968. Elected officials, lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs,  journalists -- the list of black achievement goes on and on. The future holds  even greater promise for black children.  </P> <P> "I am free to become a lawyer, a doctor or even a judge because Dr. Martin  Luther King Jr. marched for justice, peace and freedom for all," wrote Lana  Wade, 9, a fourth-grader at Western Avenue School. "I might even become  governor of one of our 50 states such as Pennsylvania . . . . I can be a  preacher, a teacher, mother or even Ms. Texas." Her essay was a winner in the  annual contest sponsored by the Los Angeles branch of the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, the national civil-rights organization founded by King  30 years ago.  </P> <P> But as a recent Times series, "The Racial Gap," points out, neither fame nor  fortune can immunize the successful members of minority groups from old  prejudices.  </P> <P> The new form of racism may be more subtle, but the assumptions are the same.  Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young comes out of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York  and a guest assumes that he isa parking attendant. A popular black broadcaster  moves into a wealthy Miami neighborhood and a neighbor assumes that she is the  cleaning lady. A black pediatrician practices in Washington, D.C., and white  colleagues assume that her patients are poor, teen-age mothers. The insulting  misperceptions are not harmless. The slights can take an even greater toll when  the stale stereotypes carry over into the workplace or into social situations.  </P> <P> When integration was a novelty, Americans seemed to make a greater effort to  integrate socially. With the passage of time, that is no longer the case.  Minorities often seem invisible at major social events. Although mingling at a  cocktail party may seem a small matter, being ignored exacts a penalty higher  than simply spoiling a good time. Social contacts are often essential to job  advancement and business.  </P> <P> King fought for opportunity -- an equal shot at decent jobs, housing, schools,  futures. There have been gains. And losses. Millions of black Americans, an  underclass, live in poverty. As the nation pays tribute to the civil-rights  leader on his birthday, Americans must again make a conscious effort against  racism of every kind and degree.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marek Wielgo: "Coupon Reprivatization"] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Ownership Transformation [MPW]  offers securities to those whose property was nationalized  illegally in the 1940's and 1950's, not a return of the  property.    Yesterday [6 May], the Economic Committee of the Council of  Ministers [KERM] debated the draft law; KERM is then to send its  remarks over to MPW. A preliminary version of the draft law  which will take KERM's remarks into account, will most probably  be announced on Tuesday [10 May]. It is quite possible that a  first reading of the governmental draft reprivatization law and  the already prepared draft coming from Sejm deputies, will take  place in the Sejm at the end of May and the beginning of June.  <H5>  A Limited Reprivatization </H5>   MPW wants reprivatization to include not all those who have  claims but only those whose property was taken away from them  illegally in the 1944-58 period, as well as all those who have  still not received the reimbursements they had been promised.  Those former owners who have already received some form of  benefit -- even if the benefit does not equal the value of the  property lost -- would not be entitled to reimbursements.    The current residence of persons applying for  reimbursements,  would be irrelevant. Anybody who at the time of nationalization  had Polish citizenship and has not lost it up to now, could  apply for reimbursements. So reprivatization would also cover  persons of dual citizenship. The issue of heirs to those whose  property was nationalized, has not been settled yet.    According to preliminary estimates, reimbursements would be  paid exclusively in the form of reprivatization coupons (this  would also apply to former owners of Warsaw-area land).    But former owners would not get as much as experts would  assess their losses to have been. For instance, if the value of  the property taken away from an owner does not exceed 1 billion  of today's zlotys, then the former owner would receive 1 billion  zlotys in coupons. Former owners of property which was worth  more than 1 billion would not receive the property's value in  coupons. They would get 1 billion plus some part of what  remains above that amount.    One would be able to introduce these reprivatization coupons  (which should actually be called reimbursement coupons) into  circulation for a period of up to 10 years. In order to retain  the coupons' real value, they would be valorized by an indicator  of investment price increases (there is preliminary talk of  about 10 percent per year).    Therefore, an owner of such coupons could sell them for  cash,  could buy with them real estate put up for auction by gminas  [small administrative units] and by the State Treasury, or  exchange them for shares of enterprises being privatized.    Former owners would receive the right of preemption of their  old real estate being sold by the State Treasury or by a gmina.    Ownership Transformation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek stated  yesterday that he is opposed to holding a referendum in which  all citizens would speak out on whom to return property to, and  how much of it (the government is also considering such a  possibility).  <H5>  An Unlimited Reprivatization </H5>   Another draft reprivatization law has been sitting in the  Sejm for six months now. It was prepared jointly by MPW and  associations comprising former owners in the summer of 1993  (when there was no Sejm). The draft law found its way into the  current Sejm as an initiative by Sejm deputies from virtually  all deputies clubs.    Among other things, the draft law envisages a very  comprehensive reprivatization (without the restrictions  suggested by the government). In those cases where it is  possible, property would be returned either in its natural form  or in the form of a so-called unwanted property which means for  instance waste land. Reprivatization coupons would be handed out  as a last resort.    The law would not conflict with the interests of "third  persons who acquired nationalized property in good faith" (for  instance farmers who received land as a result of agrarian  reforms, or factories established on the basis of nationalized  plants).  <H5>  Owners Protest </H5>   A reprivatization council at MPW demands reimbursements in a  natural form. According to Krzysztof Laszkiewicz, the council's  chief, 2.5 million hectares of land is not being cultivated  whereas there are some former owners who could utilize the land.  Yesterday, the council expressed sharp criticism of the  governmental initiative, and announced that the former owners  will protest and will file a law suit over the governmental  draft with international institutions designed to watch over  observance of human rights, among them the UN and the Helsinki  Committee.</p>

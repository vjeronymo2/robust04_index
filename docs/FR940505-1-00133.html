			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this proposed permit system, all operators of marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pleasure craft will be required to carry an emission permit on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> board their boats while operating in the FIP area. Since boats  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are often operated in areas other than where the owner resides,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits will be required only for operation of a boat within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP area, not for ownership of a boat within the FIP area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boat-owners who reside in the FIP area but only use their boats  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside the FIP area would not be required to purchase permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two types of permits will be sold, annual permits and daily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use permits. Owners of boats meeting the new emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above would be eligible for permanent emission permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> free of charge. Owners of all other boats could choose to buy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either an annual permit which would allow them to operate their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boats in the FIP area for the entire year, or a daily use permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would allow them to operate their boat on a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified day in the FIP area (owners could also purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple daily use permits if they plan to operate their boats  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the FIP area for only a few days per year).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fees for emission permits will be based on the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess emissions of pre-standard engines compared to engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the new emissions standards described above. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of permit fee calculation, the engines of marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pleasure craft will be divided into the following classes: 4-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle gasoline inboard, 4-cycle gasoline outboard, 2-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline outboard, 4-cycle gasoline sterndrive, sailboat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> auxiliary engines, and personal watercraft (e.g., Jet Ski). EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites comment on whether these general categories are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for permit fee calculation, or whether they should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be further subdivided to reflect differences in emissions or use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within a class (e.g., some of these classes, such as 2-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outboards, could be further subdivided based on horsepower to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the very wide range of horsepower, usage, and total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions that might be seen within the class).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Average excess emissions per engine would be calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately for each engine class based on the difference between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sum of average HC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions for pre-standard engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the sum of average HC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions for engines meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the appropriate new standard. Total average excess emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would then be calculated as the product of average excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions per engine for the engine class and the time of use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the engine class. For an annual permit, time of use would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be based on the average annual use for the particular engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class. For a daily permit, eight hours of continuous use would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be assumed for all engine classes. EPA requests comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other options for time of use when assessing fees for daily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA currently estimates that a boat with a typical pre-standard 2-cycle gasoline outboard motor would be assessed an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual fee of approximately $400, based on typical emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates and hours of use and using a rate of $10,000 per ton of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess emissions (this example assumes 35 hours of annual use,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with HC emissions reduced from 118 g/hp-hr to 35 g/hp-hr as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of the new standard while NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions increase from 2.4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g/hp-hr to 4.7 g/hp-hr; this example is based on EPA's best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current estimates which may change as more information is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received and as the engine standards are finalized). At this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, EPA believes that this fee level will effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discourage the operation of pre-standard engines in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. However, EPA will monitor the effectiveness of this fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level in discouraging operation of pre-standard engines, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the fee per ton if needed to discourage virtually all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To obtain a permit a boat owner would have to present to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the permit office documentation regarding the engine class and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether or not the engine meets the new emissions standard. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boat's state registration documentation may be sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ascertain the engine class. If not, one time physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections may be needed, in which case EPA would seek to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegate such inspections to local or state agencies. Engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the new emissions standard will be required to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeled as such by the manufacturers. Boat owners will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to show that their boat engines have such a label in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to obtain a free permit. In the absence of such proof,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the permit fee will be based on the assumption that the boat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine does not meet the new standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some boat engine manufacturers may already be producing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines that meet the new standards, before the labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements have been finalized. These manufacturers have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option of presenting to EPA evidence (in the form of emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test data which meets EPA's test requirements for these engines)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of which engines met the requirement before it went into effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If EPA accepts this evidence, owners of such engines could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify for a free permit if they can prove that their boat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine qualifies based on the serial number of the engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

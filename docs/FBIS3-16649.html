Tallinn's Arguments Prove Unconvincing for Moscow"]    [Text] Estonia's territorial claims on Russia formed the  topic of yesterday's hearings in the Duma. An active pressure  being put by the Estonian side of late on the residents and  local authorities of Pskov and Novgorod Oblasts (free  distribution of Estonian citizenship, issue of Estonian  passports and real estate privatization certificates on Russian  territory) has run against Moscow's harsh reaction, something  unexpected by Tallinn. Not only representatives of Russia's  state power in these oblasts, but also all the power structures  have received instructions to cut short, using all legal means,  "Estonian provocations." Simultaneously, the Russian Foreign  Ministry and the Federal Border Service have produced a draft  government decision to tighten checkpoint rules along the  Estonian border. The emergence of this document came as an  unpleasant surprise for Estonian representatives attending the  hearings.    In the view of Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma  International  Affairs Committee, having signed on 12 January 1991 a treaty  with Russia on the principles of interstate relations, Estonia  virtually recognized the absence on its part of territorial  claims (in Article 6, the sides recognize each other's  territorial integrity and territorial sovereignty). Because of  this alone, references to the Tartu Peace Treaty signed in 1920  have no legal force. The very progress of talks that terminated  in the signing of this treaty attested to the Estonian side's  intention to get from Russia as much as possible in solving the  state border problem. (The talks were frequently interrupted by  Tallinn while Estonian troops, which had resumed military  actions, were moving deeper into Russian territory).    Besides, in the opinion of the Russian side, having become  part of the USSR in 1940, Estonia lost its status as an  international law entity. Hence, there exist at least two  reasons for which Tallinn's territorial claims (incidentally,  they studiously avoid this term in Estonia) today are unfounded.  Tallinn's representatives at the hearings, naturally, disagreed  which such a solution of the border question. In their opinion,  Article 2 of the Tartu Treaty is in effect even today; that is,  the border should run across the present territory of Pskov  Oblast. Russia intends to dot the "i's" by toughening the  border area rules and strictly indicating the position of border  checkpoints. Russia will draw the final border "on location"  even if Estonia declines to take part in this process.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ouagadougou, June 15 (AFP) -- Authorities in Burkina  Faso said Wednesday [15 June] that an attack by "Tuareg rebels"  had been carried out on its territory, the first time such an  incident has been officially acknowledged.    Interior Ministry Secretary General Pascal Benon said the  group, probably from Mali, opened fire on a coachload of  passengers on June 9 near Djibo, 190 kilometres (120 miles)  north of Ouagadougou and injured three of them. The group also  intercepted an official car, Benon said.    Several other clashes have been reported since last  December.    The Tuareg rebellion has been raging in neighbouring Mali  and  Niger since the early 1990s, leading some 7,000 people to seek  refuge in Burkina Faso.    Military reinforcements were sent to the area at the start  of  the week. Benon said the situation was "very tense" and  stressed that there was a danger local people might decide to  "settle their scores with the Tuaregs for themselves."    The refugees have gradually been relocated in a camp run by  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees at the village of Ferrelio  to the north of Djibo.    The authorities in Ouagadougou want the UNHCR to move the  camp away from the border. However, the UNHCR wants Burkina  Faso, one of the poorest countries in the world, to pay the  costs, estimated at 184 million CFA Francs (330,000 dollars).    The country's 1,000-kilometre (600-mile) frontier with Mali  and the 500-kilometre (300-mile) one with Niger are considered  practically uncontrollable by the Ministry.</p>

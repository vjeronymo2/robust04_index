			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLIANCE WITH KING TARNISHES THE PRINCE  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration's long and tortured crusade against leftist  insurgencies in Latin and Central America has muddied the moral waters among  friend and foe.  </P> <P> Israel's initial involvement in these activities demonstrates that a small  power is ill-equipped to play big-power games without suffering severe damage  to its reputation and image.  </P> <P> In its insistence on propping up the Contras in Nicaragua, undermining the  Sandinistas and staving off Fidel Castro's forces, the Reagan Administration  used any and all means at hand to the point where Americans and allies like  Israel, soldiers and spies, free-lance mercenaries, arms salesmen,  drug-peddling dictators and the drug overlords themselves became entangled in  an unsavory mix.  </P> <P> The results were, at best, mixed. President Bush, who once had dealings with  the drug-dealing Gen. Manuel A. Noriega of Panama, now has declared a war on  America's drug problem and sent military aid to Colombia. In the process, Bush  has also quietly left the Contras to wither on the vine and die an ignoble  political death.  </P> <P> One of the casualties of these complicated Reagan-Bush policies -- which led,  among other things, to the Iran-Contra scandal -- apparently is the reputation  of Israel.  </P> <P> In the last few weeks, news reports have surfaced portraying Israeli  mercenaries at the center of drug dealing in Central and South America. The  "evidence" was a highly doctored piece of videotape advertising the security  firm Hod Hahanit, or Spearhead, headed by Yair Klein, a former lieutenant  colonel in the Israeli Defense Forces.  </P> <P> Yet to focus on Israelis, real or imagined, is a highly suspect approach.  </P> <P> We have already noted Bush's relationship with right-wing Latin American  dictators while he served as Reagan's vice president. The CIA dealt with drug  traffickers to help finance the Contra war in Nicaragua. In a world where arms  dealers, drug dealers and terrorists mix freely and are all employed in the  cause of "freedom fighters" or as anti-communists, it seems strange to single  out stray Israelis as sinister forces in those dealings and to suggest that  they operated with the guidance of their government.  </P> <P> This is remarkably similar to the tarnished paintbrush used on Israel for its  part in the Iran-Contra affair. The truth is that Israel and the Reagan  Administration had signed a document of strategic cooperation, which was  perforce interpreted differently and unequally by the two partners. As is often  the case, the weaker partner paid a higher price.  </P> <P> Strategic cooperation meant that Israel, a small country with a highly skilled  military, would provide the pincers of a bulldozer -- meaning that Israeli  weapons would be used to buy influence in Iran with an eye toward bettering  relations between Washington and Tehran and working toward the release of  American hostages in Lebanon.  </P> <P> The consequences of this policy are already well-known. But if Israel played a  key role in the overtures and dealings with Iran, its role thereafter was  minuscule as money gained from weapons sales found its way to the Contras. In  Central America, the United States and its crew of military experts, National  Securty Council officials and CIA operatives were the initiators and the  actors, not the Israelis, although it is probable that some Israeli experts and  free-lancers may have had a peripheral hand in matters there.  </P> <P> Latin America as a whole is full of professional mercenaries, soldiers of  fortune, "consultants" of all stripes who hire themselves out to regimes of  whatever political stripe -- and yes, even to drug lords. The mercenaries come  from all over, many of them from the United States, as well as Europe and the  Third World. No doubt a small number of them are Israelis.  </P> <P> It is one thing to accept the reality of military professionals and arms  merchants for hire. It is quite another to suggest that Israelis -- and there  are very few there -- should bear a special onus, and to suggest sinister  Israeli governmental machinations at work. Yet, the emphasis on Israel is  damaging precisely because it mars Israel's image, despoils the good deeds of  an ally acting in good faith as part of a strategic cooperation agreement. It  continues to be true that Israel bears a large moral burden, the kind not  bothered with by such countries as Syria or such groups as the Palestine  Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> Putting the onus on Israel has become a blossoming industry in the media. It's  a carryover from Israel's role in Lebanon and the one-sided visuals provided by  the Palestinian uprising. It is also an example of a view held by the prophetic  Machiavelli, who wrote five centuries ago that when a small prince allies  himself to a mighty king, he will be cast adrift when he is no longer needed.  </P></p>

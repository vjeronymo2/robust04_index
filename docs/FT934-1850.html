			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LCE aims to expand agricultural futures The London Commodity Exchange says it is looking to expand its agricultural futures contracts if Europe moves towards a free market. 'The launch of a European grain contract would require a change in government attitudes. There's no need to hedge at the moment because European Union prices provide a base level,' says Mr Robin Woodhead, chief executive of the exchange. The exchange at present trades domestic wheat and barley futures, where volume rarely climbs above 500 lots a day. But a recent study of the contracts showed that companies such as Dalgety found them useful in hedging grain sales in the UK. 'We found the trade were very anxious that we didn't de-list those contracts. They are very well established and cover their costs,' says Mr Woodhead. The LCE realises that while the contracts remain domestically-based they will never trade high volumes, but in order to boost turnover, they would have include international trade.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Close Bros edges ahead to Pounds 6.34m CLOSE BROTHERS, the City merchant bank, reported a marginal increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.21m to Pounds 6.34m for the six months to January 31, writes David Barchard. Earnings per share, however, rose by 13 per cent to 11.56p because of a reduced tax charge following two acquisitions last year. Mr Rod Kent, managing director, said that most of the profit centres reported creditable trading performances and the bank had a good performance by the standards of the rest of the sector. The group's loan book increased by 4.5 per cent during the half to Pounds 250m. Mr Kent said that bad debts were at very low levels and provisions were slightly below those of the last six months. The interim dividend is raised from 2.8p to 3p.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> SALE OF NATIVE PLANTS PLANNED BY SOCIETY  </P> <P> Once wild-and-weedy native plants are making a place for themselves in home  gardens, according to the California Native Plant Society, whose members are  sponsoring a plant sale in Ventura today.  </P> <P> In the past few years, many native plant species have been developed into  tidier, more compact varieties, said Patt Wilson McDaniel, president of the  Ventura County chapter of the nonprofit group.  </P> <P> While society members have long found indigenous species desirable, popularity  has swelled because of the new varieties and their water-saving habits, so CNPS  plans to offer twice as many plants as in last year's sale, McDaniel said.  </P> <P> Members will be on hand to share their expertise on cultivating the plants and  will have literature available on local planting conditions.  </P> <P> The one-day sale will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Ventura High School  stadium parking lot off Poli Street west of Seaward Avenue.

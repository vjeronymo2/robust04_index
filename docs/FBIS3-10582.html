Bernard Sansaricq with the responsibility for the physical  attacks on employees of the Senate administrative service.  [passage omitted]    Firmin Jean-Louis, the official senate president, says he  has  advised the senators not to go to the premises of the Senate in  order to avoid any clashes. Jean-Louis has called the incidents  barbarous acts. Sen. Jean-Louis says he asked the police chief  to intervene to stop the acts of banditry, but that he remains  unsatisfied.    [Begin Jean-Louis recording, in Creole] [passage omitted]  The  first thing we did was to communicate directly with  Port-au-Prince Police Chief [Lieutenant] Colonel [Joseph Michel]  Francois. I had a long telephone conversation with him. I  explained to him the situation the way it had been explained to  me. As Senate president, I formally asked him to take the  necessary measures to ensure not only the safety of the building  [corrects himself] of the buildings, but also the safety of the  senators. He told us that -- just as he agreed to send  policemen on 7 March at the request of Sen. Sansaricq -- he  agreed to send soldiers to the Senate. The soldiers may ensure  safety both inside and outside of the building, but they will  not intervene in what may happen between senators. This  supposedly means that the soldiers can do nothing in the event  that senators aim weapons at one another. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

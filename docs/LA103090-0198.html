			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> EVANS CUT LOOSE BY RED SOX  </P> <P> Last week the Boston Red Sox said they wouldn't exercise Dwight Evans' contract  option, and now they've cut him from the team.  </P> <P> Evans' 19-year career with the Red Sox formally ended Monday when the team  placed him on unconditional release waivers.  </P> <P> By placing Evans on waivers, the Red Sox did the outfielder-designated hitter a  favor. That's because Evans is a Type A free agent, according to the  statistical rankings released last week.  </P> <P> If Evans, 39, had not been waived, he would have had to file for free agency  with the Major League Baseball Players Assn. and a team would have had to give  up an amateur draft choice in order to sign him. But if Evans clears waivers by  Thursday's deadline, he would be able to sign with any team without it having  to give up a draft pick.  </P></p>

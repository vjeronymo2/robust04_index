			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: BTR Nylex defies recession BTR Nylex, the Australian industrial group controlled by BTR, has defied the recession with a solid profit and dividend lift in the first half of 1992. Net earnings rose 20 per cent from ADollars 153.2m to ADollars 183.8m (USDollars 132.2m) on a 14 per cent sales boost to ADollars 2.61bn (ADollars 2.28bn). The interim dividend is up from 4.5 cents to 4.75 cents. Directors said the group had not experienced any real improvement in demand in its main markets. They indicated earnings had benefited most from restructuring, cost reductions and contributions from acquisitions. The effect of acquisitions was mainly evident in the newly-created corporate activities division which lifted pre-tax profit from ADollars 28.2m to ADollars 56.8m. The other main improvement came in the packaging division, which lifted pre-tax profits to ADollars 158.5m from ADollars 124.2m. The construction products and resources side lifted its contribution from ADollars 43.8m to ADollars 55.5m.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Subsidy call for high definition TV technology A CONSORTIUM including leading electrical manufacturers and television companies is urging the government to introduce subsidies to encourage broadcasters to make programmes using high defini-tion television technology (HDTV). The government is already opposing European Commission plans to offer broadcasters Ecu850m (Pounds 680m) in aid to introduce HDTV programmes. But the consortium, including Sony, the consumer electronics manufacturer, BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster and Dixons, the electrical retailer, claims its plans would involve smaller subsidies. The consortium's move comes as the European Community faces deadlock over the plan by the commission to subsidise the transition from conventional television broadcasting and stimulate the market for HDTV. Member countries have so far been unable to agree on the commission's proposal. The UK, in particular, is strongly opposed and at a meeting of the EC's telecommunications council in June Mr Edward Leigh, UK technology minister, said the plan was 'totally unacceptable'. He said: 'We will oppose any expenditure until we see . . . a convincing business case (for a subsidy).' The business case was put forward in a report prepared for the commission and appears to have been generally well received by member countries. The commission is optimistic that a majority of members are moving closer to finalising most aspects of the plan, apart from the most contentious issue - the amount of the proposed subsidy. Such agreement paves the way for discussions over subsidy levels at a meeting of European telecommunications ministers in Brussels next month. The consortium's proposal, which is being studied by the Department of Trade and Industry, could be seen as a compromise with its calls for much lower subsidies than in the commission's plan. The UK's stance against any subsidy appears increasingly to be in the minority on the issue. The DTI said: 'We are working on coming up with a response to the commission's study.' However, a level of subsidy significantly lower than the proposed Ecu850m is unlikely to achieve the commission's objective of creating a critical mass of broadcasts to stimulate the market for high definition television.</p>

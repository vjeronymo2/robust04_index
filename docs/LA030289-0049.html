			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PHILHARMONIC CHAMBER MUSIC CONCERT AT GINDI  </P> <P> Having left you in such a state of good humor, the musicians almost made you  forget the fact that they had delivered crackerjack performances at Gindi  Auditorium, site of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society concert  Wednesday evening.  </P> <P> Seven instrumentalists -- drawn mostly from the younger generation of  Philharmonic players -- brought punch and point to Stravinsky's "Histoire du  Soldat," the closing work. Each played with clarity and nearly spotless  precision; together they produced a reading with driving momentum and unusual  tautness. Heading up the band was Camille Guastafeste, who played with devilish  panache; joining her were clarinetist David Howard, bassoonist Patricia Kindel,  bassist Christopher Hanulik, trumpeter Rob Roy McGregor, trombonist Herbert  Ausman and percussionist Raynor Carroll.  </P> <P> Gail Eichenthal, the KUSC announcer whose mellifluous voice introduces  Philharmonic broadcasts, narrated. Using a text adapted from the original by  Alan Parker and herself (the additions being mostly humorous updatings), she  read with relaxed poise.  </P> <P> Earlier, violinist Judith Mass, violist Meredith Snow and cellist Gloria Lum  gave a compelling account of Beethoven's Trio in G, Opus 9, No. 1. Superb  control, flawless balances and absolute precision of ensemble helped make this  a truly memorable reading. The three generated a remarkable degree of tension,  tempered by lyricism and refinement. The music flowed with a ceaseless feeling  of direction and the Finale virtually bubbled over with good-natured  ebullience.  </P> <P> By intermission, one might well have forgotten the more sober -- relatively  speaking -- reading of Hindemith's Sonata in C that opened the concert, had it  not been for the taste with which violinist Barry Socher and Zita Carno  delivered the brief work.

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Ford to lift Dagenham production Ford, the US carmaker, is increasing production at its assembly plant at Dagenham, east London, in response to stronger demand in the UK new car market. The plant, which was a byword for poor labour relations at the end of the 1980s, has also achieved a big improvement in productivity and quality, according to Ford. The group is raising Fiesta car output at Dagenham from 940 to 1,000 cars a day from May or June. It has a capacity to produce 1,240 vehicles a day, but output fell as low as 740 a day at the bottom of the recession in late 1992. A month ago Ford announced that it was increasing production at its plants at Halewood on Merseyside and at Southampton. Mr Jacques Nasser, chairman of Ford of Europe, said the Dagenham plant, which also produces the Courier light-van ranges, had reduced the time taken to build a car (measured in hours per car) by 45 per cent between 1989 and 1993. During the same period the cost of manufacturing Fiestas there had fallen by 23 per cent. Ford's UK vehicle assembly plants at Dagenham, Halewood, and Southampton were now performing marginally better than its assembly plants in Germany in terms of total costs, having closed the damaging competitive gap that existed at the end of the 1980s. Mr Nasser said the Dagenham plant had 'made huge improvements in productivity and cost effectiveness, and has become a competitive manufacturer of top quality products'. The turnround in its fortunes has been dramatic and follows warnings by Ford in 1990 that its survival was in doubt. In 1990-91 the group launched a recovery plan to improve quality and productivity. The strategy included simplifying the Dagenham operation by transferring all Sierra production to Belgium, reducing the UK plant to a single model line.</p>

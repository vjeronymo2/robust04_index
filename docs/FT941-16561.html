			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Bosnia presses for protective Nato air strikes Bosnian officials are planning a diplomatic drive to persuade Nato to launch air strikes against Serb positions as a means of protecting aid convoys and lifting the siege of Sarajevo. Separately, in a letter sent to this week's Nato summit in Brussels, the Bosnian government urges the defence alliance's involvement in any peace plan agreed between Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. 'Nato is the only entity that can muster the necessary forces with the proper mandate and resources that are critical to a successful programme,' it said. The letter coincides with growing impatience within the European Union over failure to reach a negotiated political settlement. Yesterday, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, said the Nato summit must 'give a signal. . . We must seriously consider whether to carry out air strikes'. The US and Britain sent a demarche to Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic at the weekend stating that air strikes in support of aid convoys had not been ruled out. In an interview on BBC television yesterday, Mr John Major, British prime minister, reaffirmed the UK's readiness to launch air strikes if the UN requested Nato to do so. The renewed attempts by the Bosnian government to involve Nato came as Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international peace negotiators, sought agreement between Bosnia and Croatia on a ceasefire in and around Vitez, a Croat enclave in the centre of the republic. Talks, which had been due to open in Bonn on Saturday, were postponed until yesterday after shelling at Sarajevo airport prevented Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic's departure. The talks between Mr Izetbegovic and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia will aim to end conflict in central Bosnia and reach agreement on the future status of Mostar in western Hercegovina. Bosnia's access to the sea under an eventual peace agreement will also be discussed. But Bosnian government officials yesterday said they were determined to hold on to the area around Vitez. 'There are crucial military installations and production facilities here,' a senior diplomat said. Moslem forces pushed forward against their Croat adversaries in the town of Vitez as British UN troops braved the fighting to rescue fleeing civilians. The clashes heighten the prospects for all-out military intervention by Croatia, after warnings last week by Mr Tudjman and senior Croat officials that Zagreb would intervene if the Moslems did not halt their offensive in the strategic Lasva valley, in central Bosnia. A British officer in Vitez yesterday said the Moslems appeared to have launched a surprise pre-dawn attack. At least four people were killed, including three children, and more than 30 injured in the fighting, according to local officials. As the fighting flared, British forces in armoured personnel carriers helped evacuate civilians from surrounding villages. Meanwhile, spurning western threats to launch air strikes against Serb forces attacking Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic reiterated his aim to create a Greater Serbia. 'Our goal is to unite with Serbia, we cannot hide that. This is our right,' he told an assembly session marking the second anniversary of the declaration of his self-styled Serb state. The meeting was held in Pale, the mountain stronghold less than 10 miles east of the besieged Bosnian capital. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

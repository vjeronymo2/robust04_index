			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (12): PCs move into management - Profile of ASK with minicomputer-based Manufacture Resource Planning (MRP) software products being one of the vanguards of this change. But now change has come to the revolution. Smaller desktop personal computers are starting to take on the management of big manufacturing systems in ways that traditional MRP software suppliers - and even PC hardware companies - considered impossible only a few years ago. One of the best examples of this change lies at Compaq's European manufacturing plant at Erskine, Scotland. When it built the factory in the late 1980s, even PC manufacturing high-flier Compaq could not risk trying to run its MRP system on Compaq PCs and instead installed US software group ASKs MANMAN manufacturing business management software on a Hewlett-Packard minicomputer at the site. Although Compaq would have dearly loved to run the manufacturing process for its PCs using its own PC products, the company was realistic enough to know that this was not possible with the technology available at the time. This month, however, Compaq will start looking at a new ASK product - known as MANMAN/X - that will run on Compaq PCs that use the Unix operating system. The acronymns are not important here - the issue is that MRP systems are soon to be able to be offered on the kinds of small systems that even modest manufacturing operations are able to afford. ASK also predicts these systems will have to be much more tightly integrated to manufacturing processes and planning in the future. According to ASK marketing manager Mr Paul Eggleton, a wider appreciation of manufacturing software issues cannot come too soon. 'Historically, manufacturing information systems have concentrated on addressing the needs of a single facility or a particular function across a company,' he says. 'Applications for manufacturing planning, purchasing, accounting, finance and customer service functions have reached a high degree of sophistication  -however, the degree of integration between these applications outside the plant level and with the rest of the organisation remains low.' He suggests that a much higher level of co-operation will be vital in the future - and that software has a key role to play in bringing this about. 'The number of organisations now operating the manufacture of different components in a number of plants in the Far East, with final assembly at plants in the USA and Europe is increasing,' says Eggleton. 'There is thus a growing need for a framework to manage the data as a single entity across the entire corporation - not as a collection of business functions, products and facilities. For example, this will enable a car manufacturer to switch its sourcing and supply of parts, and location of end unit production, dependent on current geographic market conditions.' ASK designs, develops, manufactures and markets a number of integrated management information systems for manufacturing companies - including the well-known MANMAN modular series of software products for the manufacturing, marketing, financial and management reporting needs of manufacturing companies. To get an idea of how MRP sky-rocketed over the past 20 years, you only need to look at the evolution of a company like ASK - which now boasts annual sales of more than Dollars 400m. The company was founded in 1972 by Ms Sandra L Kurtzig, who recently stepped down as chief executive officer, but still remains chairman of the board, and by Mr Martin Brown, who also still retains a key role in the firm. Ms Sandra and Mr Martin originally provided programming services for clients in San Francisco's Bay Area until they started doing some custom programming between 1972 and 1974. The first big custom product to come out of this work was a Manufacturing Automation (MA) system, for which the original logon code was MAMA. But to fit in with an operating system requirement for a six-letter logon, it was eventually extended an MANMAN was born. The product was first produced for HP's range of computers as Ms Sandra's husband was working at HP and she was able to produce a product to sit on a database on one of HPs minicomputers. Ms Sandra then produced first the MRP application that used a database on a minicomputer and was promptly told she couldn't do things like that. After some hard work and a fair amount of marketing, Ms Sandra's efforts put ASK well ahead of the market and set the style for the others in the emergent MRP market - and soon other integrated systems were using databases on minicomputers. The real breakthrough in this is that it made an MRP technique, which had previously only been available to IBM mainframe users in large companies, available to smaller companies. And now that power is going to be offered to even smaller enterprises with the availability of a Unix version capable of running on PCs. It could be the next wave of the MRP revolution.</p>

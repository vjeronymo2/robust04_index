			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / People: Gateway loses finance director Gateway Group, the supermarket business still struggling under the debt from the Isosceles leveraged buy-out in 1989, has found a new finance director. Martin Gatto, 43, was headhunted from the private and secretive Sun International leisure group, where he was chief financial officer. As a consequence of his appointment, Gateway coyly says 'Geoff Cooper, the current group finance director, will be leaving Gateway'. He will not go empty-handed, as the quiz show host might say. With a three-year rolling contract he is expected to pick up decent compensation, although terms have yet to be fixed. The parting seems to have been amicable; David Simons, chief executive since January, has now 'completed his management team'. Cooper joined Gateway in 1990, under David Smith who led the LBO. Gateway has also found some non-executive directors. They are David Thornham, managing director of Midland Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking - Midland Bank organised the group's financial restructuring in June; Peter Nevitt, president of Mitsui Nevitt Capital Corporation, a 5.4 per cent shareholder in Isosceles; and Alan Giles, managing director of Waterstones Booksellers.</p>

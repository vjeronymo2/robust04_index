			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The date 16 June 1994 marks the 70th anniversary  of the Military Academy and the 70th anniversary of the founding  of the Huangpu [Whampoa] Army. President Li Teng-hui issued a  message of greetings to mark the occasion, exhorting the Armed  Forces to carry forward the Huangpu spirit, to shoulder heavy  responsibility, to safeguard national security, to be the  cornerstone of social stability, to be the means for building  and reforming the nation, and to be the backup force for  national unification.    President Li said: The founding of the Republic of China  [ROC] is aimed at building a wealthy, strong, and unified  country to enable all Chinese countrymen to be blessed by the  Three Principles of the People. Although this goal has been  initially achieved in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, our  compatriots on Mainland China are still living under Communist  totalitarian rule. Our country is still in a divided state and  is still being ruled separately. Moreover, Communist China's  threat against Taiwan -- our national rejuvenation base -- has  always been there.    President Li pointed out: Therefore, currently our work, on  the one hand, should be aimed at building up the Armed Forces  and heightening combat readiness to ensure Taiwan's security,  and at gaining the initiative in developing relations with the  mainland. On the other hand, we should endeavor to sustain  Taiwan's economic development and to promote democracy and  constitutional rule, so that we may use a more spectacular  "Taiwan Miracle" to induce a peaceful change on the mainland and  to pursue national unification in a democratic way so the people  can enjoy freedom and equal distribution of wealth. Therefore,  the Armed Forces' tasks not only have not been reduced because  of the end of the period of mobilization for suppressing the  Communist rebellion; on the contrary, the nation's reliance on  the Armed Forces will increase as the country carries out  national building and reform in all fields.    President Li said: This year marks the 70th anniversary of  the founding of the nation's Armed Forces. Over the last 70  years, to fulfill Dr. Sun Yat-sen's wishes and to rescue the  nation from great dangers, the Armed Forces, under the  leadership of late President Chiang Kai-shek, have successfully  carried out the Northern Expedition with a small army against  larger ones, and have won the War of Resistance Against Japan  with a weaker army against a stronger one. And, over the last  40 years and more, our officers and men of the new generation  have smashed Communist China's repeated armed provocations in  the Taiwan Strait. They not only have strengthened the national  rejuvenation base to provide a secure and stable environment for  developing the "Taiwan Miracle," but also have laid a foundation  for achieving national unification in a democratic way so the  people can enjoy freedom and equal distribution of wealth.

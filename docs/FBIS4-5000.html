			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior Foreign Ministry official said on 5 April  that in connection with the DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons  development, Japan and the United States might discuss the issue  of concluding an "acquisition and cross-servicing agreement  (ACSA)" during U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's stay in  Japan, which is scheduled to begin from 19 April. If the ACSA  is signed, Japan can provide fuel and services to the U.S.  forces.    It is expected that if economic sanctions are imposed  against  North Korea, Japan will be asked to supply fuel to the U.S.  warships participating in naval blockade. The United States has  long been asking Japan to sign the ACSA. Meanwhile, as tension  has mounted on the Korean peninsula, opinion has prevailed  within government offices, such as the Foreign Ministry, that a  rear-echelon support system should be established immediately.    The government will seriously consider the conclusion of the  ACSA if the United States renews its request. However, the same  Foreign Ministry official said: "Discussions within the  government will not be smooth."</p>

In the first half, when the exceptional arose, profit was only Pounds 62,000. Mr Reg Barr, chairman, said borrowings were reduced significantly in the second half and, coupled with lower interest rates, led to a decrease in interest costs from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 663,000. Turnover came to Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 24.4m). Earnings per share worked through at 6.34p (12.35p).

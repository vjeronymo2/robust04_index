			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, a regular sitting of the Cabinet of Ministers  took place. Heads of republican departments and oblast  administrations, Almaty and Leninsk administration heads, and  chairmen of the boards of leading banks were invited. At issue  was the outcome of the Republic's social and economic  development in the first quarter of the current year. In the  Republic's national economy, negative trends increased in  January-March, leading to a decrease in production and higher  inflation. The problem of settlement of payments has become  even more urgent. It has practically paralyzed all branches of  the economy. As stated on 1 April, 1,084 enterprises are at a  complete or partial standstill. As result, the gross domestic  product in January-March decreased by 30 percent compared to the  same months last year. The volume of production output  decreased by 30.9 percent and that of the capital investment of  state enterprises and organizations decreased by 68.3 percent.    A very serious situation is brewing in the fuel and energy  complex. Production of electricity fell by 14 percent, coal by  10 percent. Recovery of oil, gas, and gas condensate has also  decreased. Oil refineries have refined 2.8 mn [million] tonnes  of oil, which equals 64.5 percent of the total reached in the  first quarter of last year.    The situation in the metallurgy complex has deteriorated.  Decrease of light industry is ongoing. The agro-industrial  complex is also turning a loss. Last autumn 58,000 heads of  cattle and many horses and camels, about 1.5 mn sheep and goats  died, although, as has been said, farm units had enough fodder.  As a result, production of meat, milk, and eggs is lower  compared to the first quarter of last year.    Preparation for the spring sowing campaign is a matter of  special discontent. Most equipment is in poor repair. Many  state and collective farms do not have enough good quality  seeds. The situation with fuels and lubricants is critical.  Not only single farm units, but also whole rayons do not have  any fuel at all. In this connection, speakers said every  possibilities should be found to provide all necessary things  for farmers to carry out the sowing campaign on all planned  areas. In the food industry the decline of production is by 33  percent. In capital construction, at the expense of all sources  of financing, 11 percent only of all planned facilities was  commissioned. Residential housing construction is in dire  straits. Despite the strict financial policy of allocating  credits from the budget, the rate of inflation has not  decreased.    Introduction of the national currency did not help curb  inflation. Liberalization of prices for basic foodstaff of 5  January and continuing increase of prices for spare parts, fuel,  raw materials and equipment on the part of the CIS partners has  significantly increased inflation. Inflation is also increased  by the trend of producers to increase prices for their products  as well as by inflation forecasting expectations of the  population. The public welfare has significantly decreased.  Last year an average monthly salary increased by a factor of  14.2, and consumer prices increased by a factor of 23.  Simultaneously, indexes and tariffs for paid services have  skyrocketed. Everyday consumer services increased by a factor  of 24 times, municipal payments, 62. Upkeep of children in  nurseries is 31-times more expensive now than a year ago.  Medical services cost 37-times higher.    First Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, who chaired  the sitting said: "In conformity with the government's plans  for January-March, legal norms continue to be formed as the  basis for the market economy. Measures envisaged by these plans  are being implemented in general as far as the economic policy  towards the CIS partners are concerned." Speaking about future  prospects, the vice prime minister said that in the second  quarter the gross domestic product is predicted to be increased  by 6 percent and the output of the industrial production by 8  percent. This will help to improve the situation in the social  sphere.    The sitting also examined the progress of preparation for  celebration of the 150th anniversary of Abay Kunanbayev. The  progress is extremely unsatisfactory. In this connection a  number of ministries, departments, and heads of oblast  administrations were given concrete tasks to improve the  situation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sonia Mossri and Gustavo Patu] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- Disagreements among the members of the  economic team prevented Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero from  announcing during his swearing-in ceremony on 5 April the rules  for transition into the new currency, the real.    The only consensus within the economic team is the  feasibility of putting the real into circulation on 1 June,  despite the fact that the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] prefers 1 July. Finance Ministry advisers observe that  the acceptance of the URV [Real Value Unit] is widespread.  Several price indexes have already adopted the URV as the new  unit of reference.    The PSDB believes that the creation of the new currency on 1  July will help the candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso. According to PSDB projections, inflation  should be below 5 percent by October.    One of the main controversial subjects among the economic  team members is the exchange system that will be adopted  following the creation of the real; that is, the dollar  quotation in the new currency.    Central Bank [BC] President Pedro Malan, BC International  Affairs Director Gustavo Franco, and special adviser Jose Milton  Dallari do not favor a fixed exchange rate (that is, a fixed  dollar price in reals).    However, Economic Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch and  special adviser Edmar Bacha defend a fixed exchange rate during  the first stage of the real so as to curb inflation more quickly.    Another point of disagreement is the manner by which  inflation will be eliminated at the moment of transition from  one currency to the other. This means not taking into account  the price variations of the periods before and after the  creation of the real. The objective is not to transmit the price  variations of the old currency (cruzeiro real) to the new  currency.    As for prefixed contracts [credit card payments or purchases  in installments] other economic plans had adopted a conversion  scale with daily conversion indexes. Given that these are  short-term contracts (an average 30 days), part of the economic  team believes that the anticipated announcement of the date of  creation of the new currency does not make the adoption of a  conversion scale necessary.    The economic team has not yet agreed on mechanisms for  eliminating the monetary correction during the month that the  real will go into effect, and the following month.    Gustavo Franco, who used to push for the issuance of a  decree  that would establish rules to eliminate the inflationary  residues, now has begun to say that the subject is "very  complicated."    The rules for the adoption of the URV in the financial  system  also cause contradictions. In the past two weeks Franco and  Dallari envisaged creating as soon as possible CDB's [Bank  Deposit Certificates] in URV's. Malan and BC Norms Director  Claudio Mauch believe that the immediate adoption of such a  measure would be precipitate.    Another controversial point is the conversion of public  utility rates into URV's. Dallari believes that a daily  correction of fuel and electricity prices would further bolster  inflation.    The creation of a special BC directorate with the sole  objective of looking after the issuance of the real implies  further problems. The subject is being discussed behind closed  doors because the creation of such a directorate requires  congressional approval.    The measures that divide the economic team are:  <H5>  The Date for Placing the Real into Circulation </H5>   The most probable date is 1 June, as most of the team wants,  while Cardoso and the PSDB favor 1 July with an eye on the  elections calendar.  <H5>  Backing for the New Currency </H5>   This is the mechanism to guarantee the real, to turn it into  a strong currency. It is not yet known what portion of the  exchange reserves will be used to guarantee the real, or whether  the government will take any actions in this regard.  <H5>  Dollar Exchange Rate </H5>   Part of the economic team wants a fixed exchange rate; that  is, that the dollar price in real should always remain the same.  The BC defends a fluctuating exchange rate.  <H5>  Financial System </H5>   The Finance Ministry wants a faster adoption of the URV in  the financial system, while the BC favors a more cautious  approach.  <H5>  Public Utility Rates </H5>   While some members of the economic team defend the immediate  conversion of public utility rates into URV, others consider  that such a measure would fuel inflation as the utility rates  could increase daily.  <H5>  Special BC Directorate </H5>   The BC would create a special directorate only to look after  the issuance of the real. Finance Minister Ricupero has not yet  given the green light for this project, and the economic team  has not yet defined how the measure will be sent to Congress.  <H5>  Inflation </H5>   It has not yet been decided how to eliminate inflation in  real cruzeiros at the moment of the creation of the real. Other  economic plans adopted a conversion scale to discount the  inflationary expectations embedded in prefixed contracts.</p>

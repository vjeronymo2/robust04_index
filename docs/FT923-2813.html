			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Yes vote may help Denmark - PM A YES in France's referendum on the Maastricht treaty would generate goodwill among the EC countries for finding a solution to the problem caused by Denmark's rejection of the treaty in a referendum in June, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. This view was expressed by Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, after a cabinet meeting yesterday. However he also suggested that a sizeable No vote would be equally helpful to Denmark, hinting that it would soften up the attitude of other governments towards reaching an agreement with Denmark. 'One thing is certain: the treaty will not come in to effect on January 1, 1993,' he said. This was not only because of the Danish problem, but because the EC's budget measures must be agreed upon before the treaty could be implemented.</p>

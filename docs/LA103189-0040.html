			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EX-SUN-TIMES EXECUTIVE SEEKS DAILY PILOT  </P> <P> The owners of the Orange Coast Daily Pilot are negotiating to sell the daily  newspaper to former Chicago Sun-Times publisher Robert E. Page, who is  reportedly interested in building a string of community newspapers in Southern  California.  </P> <P> Kirk Cheyfitz, president of the publishing division of Adams Communications  Corp., which purchased the Pilot last year from Ingersoll Publications Co.,  confirmed that the company was negotiating the paper's sale.  </P> <P> "We have been having some talks with Bob Page, and we might be able to conclude  a transaction in the near future," he said.  </P> <P> Cheyfitz emphasized that a sale was not yet certain. He said that no  discussions had taken place with any other potential buyer although Adams had  received no less than a dozen calls from people wanting to buy The Pilot.  </P> <P> A source who asked not to be identified said Page was seeking to acquire the  Glendale News-Press, which is owned by game-show impresario Mark Goodson and  managed by Ingersoll under a contract whose termination was announced Oct. 24.  News-Press Publisher Judy Kendall declined all comment on the report.  </P> <P> Goodson's newspaper operations reportedly are strapped for cash after  purchasing the Morristown Daily Record in New Jersey two years ago for $155  million. Goodson announced on Oct. 24 that he was selling the New Haven  Register and terminating the long-standing agreement with Ingersoll to manage  his newspapers.  </P> <P> Page, who heads a Boston-based company called Page Media, formerly was  publisher of the Boston Herald and the Chicago Sun-Times. In 1986 he led a  management buyout of the Chicago paper from its former owner Rupert Murdoch.  Page could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The Orange Coast Daily Pilot, which primarily serves the Costa Mesa-Newport  Beach area, has struggled with declining circulation and advertising revenues  over the past decade. But Cheyfitz said a turnaround had begun since Adams  purchased the paper.  </P> <P> Circulation, which had dropped to 20,000 last year from 40,000 in 1982, has  rebounded by about 3,000, Cheyfitz said. Display advertising and classified ad  revenues also were up, Cheyfitz said, but he could not provide figures.  </P> <P> The Pilot, which until 1983 was owned by Times Mirror Co., publisher of The  Times, switched to being a morning publication earlier this year. Cheyfitz said  Adams was "really happy with the progress" that had been made since the  acquisition. He noted that the weekly community newspaper operations that were  purchased with The Pilot -- the Huntington Beach Independent and the Fountain  Valley Independent -- also were doing very well.  </P> <P> Adams has launched new "Independent" weeklies in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa  and won its battle with Baker Communications, which recently closed the weekly  Newport Beach Ensign.  </P> <P> Adams Communications, founded by soft-drink entrepreneur Stephen Adams in 1982,  is based in the Minneapolis suburb of Wayzata and has holdings in radio,  television, magazines and outdoor advertising in addition to newspapers.  </P> <P> When the Pilot was sold to Adams last year, it reportedly was losing money, and  the purchase price was not disclosed. Cheyfitz said that if the sale to Page  was completed, it would be for significantly more than the price Adams had  paid.  </P> <P> Rosemary Churchman, publisher of The Pilot, could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

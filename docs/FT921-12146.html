			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Verbal basis of Goldman deals shocks City INSTITUTIONS have expressed surprise that Goldman Sachs, the US investment house, dealt with secretive trusts introduced to it by the late Mr Robert Maxwell simply on the basis of 'verbal confirmation' that they were unconnected with Mr Maxwell. Their comments came as investigators uncovered another offshore trust, TIB Inc, which is understood to be involved in the alleged illicit operation to support the shares of Maxwell Communication Corporation. Investigators, who now believe that hundreds of millions of pounds missing from Mr Maxwell's public companies were used to prop up MCC's shares, have focused on several deals last spring and summer in which Goldman sold MCC shares to trusts in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Although the orders came from the independent lawyers who managed the trusts, the money to buy the shares is now known to have come from Mr Maxwell's private companies, and after dealing, some of the shares were held in private Maxwell companies. It is illegal under UK company law for a company to use its own funds to buy its shares without shareholder approval. Before dealing, Goldman obtained verbal confirmation that the buyers were not connected with Mr Maxwell, and obtained written confirmation in all but one case afterwards. However, as indications of the share support operation have emerged, Goldman has become concerned that it could have been misled. Institutions and brokers with experience of dealing with Goldman were surprised that the investment house had considered verbal confirmation to be sufficient because of its 'famously tough' vetting of new clients and other parties with which it deals. In their view Goldman has been among the most rigorous of the brokers, both in complying with regulations and in protecting itself against credit risk in dealing. One large institution said yesterday: 'They are very definitely in the meticulous camp in all aspects of dealing and it would be extremely unusual for them to relax that.' Another said: 'It's a real struggle to get accepted as a client - you have to fill in a mound of paperwork, and if you get a little box wrong, it can all come right back to be done again,' while showing the Financial Times the half-inch-thick pile of statements required by Goldman for dealing in futures and options. There is no suggestion that Goldman has broken the rules of the Securities and Futures Authority in the UK or the Securities Exchange Commission in the US. According to the SFA's current rules, there is a general obligation on the broker to 'know your client' but this does not apply if the broker is approached 'for execution only' - simply to transact the deal, rather than to offer investment advice. However, other brokers said last night that they were reluctant to take on large 'execution only' orders because of the credit risk in dealing with unknown parties.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Comments by Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of Fuji Xerox </F> Company and acting chairman of the Japan-U.S. Economic  Consultative Council, on Japan-U.S. economic relations in an  interview with ASAHI SHIMBUN economic reporter Yomei Tsuji;  place and date not given]    [Text] I think the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, which  collapsed in February, will be resumed in the foreseeable future  since Washington is changing its attitude.    At the summit with former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  in  February, U.S. President Bill Clinton had to be tough toward  Japan. Because his administration had criticized the former Bush  government as being weak-kneed toward Japan, Clinton had to  adopt a result-oriented policy in talks with Hosokawa on  macroeconomic measures to rescue the Japanese economy and on  such trade sectors as automobiles, auto parts, and insurance,  which symbolize the trade ties between the two countries.    Moreover, at the time, he was severely criticized at home  for  the Whitewater land deal. To ease the criticism and win in an  off-year election scheduled for September, Clinton had to  disprove the evaluation of him that "although the President  makes courageous remarks, he does nothing."    Thus, he could not say "yes" to Japan's macroeconomic  measures, including a single-year tax cut plan.    I believe Washington's attitude began to change in  mid-March.    When I visited the United States in early April with other  Fuji Xerox executives, I met with a top manager of a U.S.  company. This influential businessman criticized the whole span  of the Clinton administration's trade policies toward Japan and  other countries, saying: "Its policies are too hard to bring a  solution."    In the background of his criticism, there is the fact that  the Japanese bureaucrats' repeated assertion that "the United  States is demanding the setting of numerical targets, which  would lead to managed trade" has gradually been accepted in  Europe and other countries, and this tendency is also seen in  the United States. I am sure Washington feels resentment  against this trend, but.... [as published]    Circumstances surrounding the U.S. economy have also  changed.  Washington now has to check inflation. It has changed its  exchange policy to prevent the dollar from further depreciating.  The policy is different from that adopted in February, when  high-ranking U.S. Government officials repeatedly made remarks  in favor of the appreciation of the yen and the depreciation of  the dollar.  <H5>  Japan Should Not Presume on a Soft U.S. Stance </H5>   Even some U.S. Government officials have begun to question  the Clinton administration's excessive emphasis on economic  issues in its diplomacy. Thus, it would be no surprise if the  United States tries to seek cooperation from Japan in dealing  with the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The Office of  the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), which was a little too  tough in the trade talks, is also criticized for its hard-line  policy.    How should Japan respond to the change in the U.S. attitude?  I think when the government makes a decision on tax reform  during June, it should decide to implement income tax cuts next  year and the year after as well. Also, it should indicate as  many specific measures as possible to open wider Japanese  markets in its external economic policy outline.    In view of the fact that the Hata Cabinet is a minority  government, Washington will not make urgent demands. But Japan  should not give the impression that it is presuming on a soft  U.S. stance. It also should not think that "we win because we  are right, and because we are right the United States has begun  to show the white flag."    Such things are necessary because if Japan-U.S. relations  worsen, it will have an adverse impact on the economies of not  only the two nations but also Asia and the world.    "The Japan-U.S. relationship is the most important in the  world." This famous phrase is what former U.S. Ambassador to  Japan Mike Mansfield said when he plainly described the gravity  of Japan-U.S. relations. President Clinton has also made  similar remarks.    Historically, Japan has followed the same path as the United  States for half a century, since WWII ended in 1945. There are  numerous things in Japan that have been influenced by the United  States. They include the Constitution, the education system,  and the market control system, which has formed the Japanese  economy's foundation.    Economically, Japan-U.S. trade occupies a overwhelmingly  large portion of world trade. The relationship of  interdependence, or what can be called the unification of the  two countries, has rapidly progressed since the eighties. Now,  without Japanese-made parts, U.S. industries cannot flourish.  Conversely, U.S.-made software is holding up the Japanese  high-tech industry. As such, a firm mutual aid system has been  erected.    When the world economy's growth is slowing down, what should  Japan and the United States do to maintain their mature, huge  economies' growth while respecting each other's position? This  is an important question of the day.    What is important to the future is the  Japan-U.S.relationship  in Asia. The economies of China and other Asian countries are  rapidly growing. Naturally, Japan has an interest in these  areas. The United States also tries to make inroads into Asian  markets, and it is considering preventing Japan from  monopolizing the markets.    Meanwhile, Asian countries strongly hope that Japan and the  United States maintain their close relationship because they  want to seek cooperation from the United States in security and  big technology arenas, and cooperation from Japan in technology  for civilian products and economic fields.  <H5>  Japan Needs To Make Known Its Efforts to Other Countries </H5>   Some people argue that the United States, which always seeks  a target for its hostility, will target Japan, instead of the  Soviet Union, now that the Soviet Union no longer exists in the  post-Cold War era. This is not a lie, but we should not attach  exaggerated importance to it.    The major cause for the worsening of bilateral relations is  Japan's trade surplus. It is inevitable that other countries  call the current situation abnormal, in which Japan continuously  registers a huge surplus in trade with not only the United  States but also the European Union (EU) and Asian countries. We  also have to think it abnormal.    However, some economic experts point out that figures about  Japan's trade surplus are inaccurate because services trade is  belittled in calculating them. Even so, the problem is that  there is actually a widely accepted view that because of Japan's  trade surplus, many Americans have lost their jobs.    It is said that although the United States imports many  Japanese-made goods, Japan has closed its markets to U.S.  products by exercising unfair trade practices. This assertion  has spread with exaggeration and has deepened U.S. distrust of  Japan. This cannot be ignored.    Japan needs to take actions to reduce its trade surplus, and  make known its efforts to other countries. We should think that  objective criteria and numerical targets discussed in the  Japan-U.S. trade talks are aimed at reducing Japan's trade  surplus. They are not fundamental, grave issues between Japan  and the United States.    There are arguments that although the United States has a  20-  percent share in the world market, its market share in Japan is  a mere 2-3 percent, and this is unusual; and that the United  States lacks efforts to increase its market share in Japan. The  issue of setting objective criteria is different in nature from  such unproductive arguments. The purpose of setting objective  criteria is to have some mutually agreeable, qualitative, and  quantitative yardsticks to gauge the effectiveness of trade  surplus-cutting and market-opening measures.    If it is difficult for the Japanese and U.S. Governments to  set up objective criteria, the private sector should take over  the task. And with the agreed criteria, the two nations should  equally promote the opening up of their markets.  <H5>  Ozawa Should Play a Role as Coordinator </H5>   Once the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks reopen, we have to  make sure that they function properly this time.    To that end, we need able men on both sides who are capable  of easing the trade friction. On the Japanese side, (Shinseito  Chief Secretary) Ichiro Ozawa should come to the front to become  a major cabinet minister so he can play a role as coordinator in  a dignified manner. Acting as coordinator in his present  position would be questioned at home and in the United States.  On the U.S. side, Vice President Al Gore should be prepared to  come to the front.    I also would like to propose establishing a consultative  body comprising not only politicians and bureaucrats but also  private sector representatives.    Because the Hata Cabinet is a minority government, it is  uncertain what will happen after the 1994 budget bill clears the  Diet. This may be the reason that politicians are reluctant to  make clear-cut remarks. The politicians' evasive attitude will  make it inevitable to put a lot of weight on bureaucrats, but  excessive weight on the administration is undesirable. I think  if private sector representatives participate in the trade talks  and raise questions, this will help cut back dominance by  bureaucrats.    The important thing is for Japan to actually reduce its  trade  surplus.    Opening up of the Japanese autos, auto parts, and insurance  markets is a main topic in the Japan-U.S. trade talks. Japan  should actively correct Japanese companies' management and  traditional business practices because they are major obstacles  to opening these markets.    Japan also needs to reduce the number of government  regulations. Deregulation will help increase Japan's imports and  give an opportunity to people in the monetary, communications,  broadcasting, and other sectors to create new businesses. A  system should be established under which workers, who become  jobless because of deregulation, can find new jobs in other  sectors.    Moreover, Japan needs to increase its public works  investment, especially in new social infrastructure. It is  important for the nation to improve social infrastructure to  better the quality of lives, and to set up information and  communications networks, an area in which Japan lags behind the  United States. Also, the government should reduce its  expenditures without complaining about the severe financial  condition.    Japan must carry out these things on its behalf, although it  will bring pain to the nation. It should stop producing  everything. It should entrust some industries to other nations.  I believe this is the duty Japan should fulfill as an advanced  nation.</p>

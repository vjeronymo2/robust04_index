			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: A gamble on spending It has been clear for a while that the foreign exchange and gilts markets would eventually need reassuring on the trend in government borrowing. The cabinet duly promised yesterday that previous spending limits for 1993-94 would not be exceeded. Mr Lamont must now be hoping that the autumn spending round can proceed in an atmosphere of calm. Whether such hope will prove more tangible than his green shoots of recovery is another matter. The government does not have much of a record for keeping to its targets. The task during the next financial year will be all the harder because growth will be much lower than the 3 per cent originally expected. Unemployment and other benefits will thus considerably exceed expectations and some serious cuts in discretionary spending will be needed if the target is to be met. The risk to the equity market is that this will be perceived as yet another blow to recovery prospects. Yesterday's announcement does not undo the fiscal stimulus implicit in last November's spending plans for the current year and in the government's various pre-election pledges. But from now on nervous consumers will be much more aware of the tightness of government purse strings. If that delays the recovery much longer, spending curbs designed to support sterling could have the opposite effect as Mr Lamont comes under yet more pressure to cut short term interest rates.</p>

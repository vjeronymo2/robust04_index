			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: First Executive hit by Dollars 643m tax claim ATTEMPTS to rehabilitate Executive Life of California, the main operating unit of troubled Los Angeles-based insurer First Executive, have run into a serious obstacle from the Internal Revenue Service, which claims to be owed Dollars 643m. Mr John Garamendi, the Californian insurance commissioner who seized control of Executive Life earlier this month, warned that the move 'could force the company into liquidation and jeopardise the savings of hundreds of thousands of policyholders and annuitants'. The Los Angeles office of the IRS, however, said that while it was obviously concerned about policyholders' welfare, it had a duty to the US public to make sure that demands for back tax were logged. The IRS claim covers tax which the authorities say the company should have paid in 1981, 1982 and 1983, together with penalties and interest due because of the non-payment. The IRS declined to split the tax sum from the penalty/interest charges, although there were reports that the actual tax claim totalled less than Dollars 250m. The IRS acknowledged that the penalties/interest element was likely to be substan-tial. The Californian regulators have recently suggested that rehabilitation efforts were centring on talks with a European consortium, led by Altus, part of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank. Yesterday, officials at the Insurance Department said they did not know what the reaction of the consortium had been to the tax demand. However, Mr Garamendi said that he would 'do everything in my power to stop this IRS raid on the assets needed to pay Executive Life policyholders. I plan to immediately contact both the Bush administration and Congressional leaders,' he added.</p>

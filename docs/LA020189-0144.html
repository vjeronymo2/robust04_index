			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> WORKS OF THE 'JEWISH BACH' PERFORMED BY KOL ECHAD CHORALE AND ORCHESTRA  </P> <P> If you haven't heard of David Nowakowsky, you aren't the only one. The  19th-Century composer and synagogue musician is not listed in either the New  Grove or Baker's dictionary. Thus, Sunday's program at Temple Bat Yahm in  Newport Beach offered a rare opportunity to hear music by a man one writer  calls the "Jewish Bach."  </P> <P> But, aside from the fact that Nowakowsky put his talent into the service of his  faith, there is little to justify the sobriquet. His music is harmonically  static, rhythmically bland and only sometimes contrapuntal. It does effectively  integrate the modal and melodic elements of Jewish chant into a harmonic style  akin to a number of Russian composers of the 19th Century but is bogged down by  repetition and predictability.  </P> <P> Conductor Alan Weiner effectively led the Kol Echad Chorale and Orchestra in  six of the composer's works. Aside from a few minor pitch problems, the  25-voice volunteer choir sang with considerable polish. The orchestra was  first-rate, and one should single out concertmaster Mark Kashper, who delivered  the important violin solos with virtuosity.  </P> <P> Tenor David Lefkowitz proved an impassioned soloist in five of the works.  Unfortunately, the New York-based cantor produced a thin sound, exhibited  limited fluency in melismatic passages and had a distracting tendency to shift  from side to side continuously.  </P> <P> Before intermission, baritone Nathan Lam served as cantor in Milhaud's  infrequently heard Service Sacre. Lam sang with a clear, resonant sound and  fine expression but ran into pitch problems in his upper register. The work  exhibits both reflective calm and Gallic exuberance, but seems to go on  forever; there is simply too much music and too little variety.  </P></p>

Quite  recently, in 1992, progressive public opinion as a whole  rejoiced at the closure of two industrial reactors located in  the secret underground complex at Krasnoyarsk-26 that produced  weapons-grade plutonium, the substance used to fill nuclear  warheads. This event really was something to be pleased about.  However, unresolved problems connected with radiochemical  production and the territories contaminated by this nuclear  production were swept under the carpet; these problems are now  making themselves felt with increasing frequency. What is to be  done with the accumulated plutonium and radioactive waste? And  finally, what is to be done with the thousands of people who  forged the nuclear shield? This entire cluster of problems has  come to the fore in the closed city of Krasnoyarsk-26.  <H5>  Time Bomb </H5>   Environmental catastrophe is the natural result of the work  carried out by the Krasnoyarsk nuclear scientists. The true  scale of the environmental contamination is only now becoming  apparent. For almost 30 years liquid radioactive waste from  military production has been pumped underground -- into the  aquiferous sand and clay strata beneath the ``Severnyy''  installation. Radioactive waste is still being pumped today.    According to data published openly in the press, the  underground reservoir has received millions of cubic meters of  radioactive waste with a total radioactivity level of hundreds  of millions of curies. On the basis of its design parameters,  this reservoir is now full to capacity. The underground  reservoirs are infinitely expandable. Nevertheless, if an  additional RT-2 plant is then built to reclaim the spent nuclear  fuel, it seems likely that ``Severnyy'' will have to accept  tritium.    This installation is unique in many ways. In the opinion of  specialists, it is the only storage facility in the world that  operates a dual system of injection and discharge wells. As  radioactive waste is pumped in, underground stratal water is  drawn off. These processes deep underground are monitored via a  system of observation wells.    The site of the installation is also extremely interesting  --  it is located in the Yenisey valley (the distance between the  river channel and the edge of the installation is 750 meters) on  a high terrace (100 meters above the level of water in the  river). Experts are extremely skeptical about the impermeability  of the screen designed to stop the radioactive waste from moving  toward the river. And, generally speaking, ``tongues'' of  waste, judging from geological maps of the area, can travel  unpredictably large distances.    But that is not all. The installation is located in an  extremely unfavorable site in geological-tectonic terms.  Hydrogeologist A. Goryunov has the following to say:  ```Severnyy's' location is unique. The fact is that in zones  where there are regional faults, the various elements of the  earth's crust are arranged in blocks, so to speak, and this  basically cannot ensure safe, long-term storage of nuclear  waste. Moreover, world experience demonstrates that in  geotectonic conditions such as these, there is an increased risk  of seismic activity.... These processes are unpredictable. The  installation poses a potential contaminatory threat to the  Yenisey and the waters of the Arctic Ocean. Accidents connected  with leakage of radioactive waste are possible and could be  described as serious and global in their implications.''    Liquid industrial waste is conveyed to the installation via  a  15km-long pipeline. According to V. Savelyev, director of the  chemical isotope plant, no cases of radioactive waste leaking to  the surface have been noted throughout the period the plant has  been operating.    Meanwhile, last fall a public environmental-technical expert  study of the installation began. A preliminary conclusion on  the results of the investigation into the radiological condition  of the soil along the course of the pipeline has already been  prepared within the framework of this study. The results have  been described as ``conflicting.''    Your IZVESTIYA correspondent has met with V. Chechetkin,  leader of the field investigation and director of the regional  center for radioecological studies. According to him, two major  areas of radioactive contamination and eight localized spots  have been discovered. At the same time, a contaminated sector  of the Yenisey floodplain not far from the river bank is causing  particular alarm. The streams and gullies located in this  region, and also the surface washout, create favorable  conditions for the migration of radioisotopes into the general  water system. The nature of the contamination leads us to  suppose that it may be due to ``seepages'' [prolivy] of liquid  radioactive waste.    Chechetkin also indicates that the site of the installation  on the side adjacent to the village of Bolshoy Balchug is  unguarded. There are specially-built wells that anyone can use  located at intervals of 100-150 meters. There are also  organizations not directly involved in nuclear production  located in the vicinity of the pipeline. All these constitute  additional risk factors.    On the whole, it is obvious to the independent investigators  of ``Severnyy'' that it should stop operating. More up-to-date  methods should be used to recycle radioactive waste.  <H5>  Yenisey's Nuclear Spoor </H5>   In a climate of absolute secrecy, the lucid minds of the  Soviet defense industry have been destroying the mighty Yenisey  for over 30 years. Water from the great river -- the ``hub of  Russia'' -- was cleansed of suspended particles and used to cool  the radioactive parts of nuclear reactors, after which it was  returned to the Yenisey.    Recently a number of expeditions have studied the state of  the river. Radioactive contamination of the Yenisey floodplain  can be traced from the point where waste has been discharged  along the course of the river to the Yenisey Gulf; the  contamination occurs in patches. Plutonium-238 and -239,  cobalt-60, cesium-134 and -137, strontium-90, and other isotopes  have all been found in riverbed sediment, algae, sections of  river bank washed by floodwater, shoals, sandbars, and islands.  Fish containing man-made [tekhnogennyy] radionuclides have been  found both downstream of Krasnoyarsk-26 -- at distances of many  hundreds of miles -- and upstream, in the vicinity of Greater  Krasnoyarsk. The investigators caught one fish which positively  ``glowed'' at 580 microcuries per hour.    The plutonium content of the soil in some areas of the  floodplain is tens of times higher than the total level of  contamination. According to data presented by specialists from  the Applied Geophysics Institute and the Krasnoyarsk Scientific  Center of the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of  Sciences, the concentration of plutonium in riverbed sediment  and this sort of soil is so large that chance wind-borne  transfer of contaminated earth and inhalation of the dust by a  human being would be equivalent to the maximum permitted annual  intake of plutonium into the human organism.    The decades of the Cold War have poisoned this mighty river  for a long time to come: Plutonium-239 has a half-life of  24,000 years, and according to scientists, it remains dangerous  for 10 times the length of this half-life, that is to say for  240,000 years.    It makes no sense to blame anybody for the madness that has  occurred. But it is hard to understand why the tradition of  secrecy is being maintained to this day. Even now it is unclear  how many curies of long-life radionuclides the combine has  discharged into the environment. Information about plutonium  contamination of the air, soil, and water remains confidential,  despite the fact that data has been published in the United  States showing how many tonnes of this deadly substance was  produced by the combine, despite the fact that Siberian  ecologists know these figures, and despite the existence of  calculations about the possible amount of plutonium lost during  production.... The nuclear scientists are refusing to release  essential documents to the ecologists who are currently studying  the state of ``Severnyy.''    People should know what conditions they are living in, they  are entitled to know where and where not to gather berries, go  fishing, and graze cattle. The most dangerous areas should be  marked and fenced off. At the very least, we should try to  eliminate radioactive contamination from areas along the river  bank and close to settlements. But most important of all,  research work is currently being carried out and amendments are  being made to the project to build the RT-2 plant at  Krasnoyarsk-26. It seems that for the Ministry of Atomic Energy  and Krasnoyarsk's nuclear scientists, the question of whether or  not to go ahead with construction is not even on the agenda.  Apart from their natural desire to preserve their cadres, no  other arguments are basically being advanced.</p>

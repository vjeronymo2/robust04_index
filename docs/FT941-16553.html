			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / France wins Dollars 2bn Saudi arms deals France and Saudi Arabia have agreed to establish a joint committee to discuss commercial co-operation and finalise industrial and armaments contracts worth an estimated Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.34bn), after a visit to Riyadh by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister. French officials said the two-day visit, which ended yesterday, had resulted in provisional agreements to upgrade four missile-launching frigates and maintain Saudi Arabia's Shahine anti-aircraft def-ence system and Crotale missile system. The accords could be concluded in the next few weeks, said one French official. But the French delegation, which included Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister, Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, and Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, failed to reach agreement on a contract for three new missile-launching frigates valued at more than Dollars 3bn. French hopes for an agreement on civil aviation made progress, without reaching a final agreement. Mr Balladur's delegation was attempting to encourage Saudi purchases of Airbus aircraft which are manufactured by a European consortium, including Aerospatiale. The consortium is in competition with Boeing of the US to provide airliners to renew the Saudi fleet.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's natural gas monopoly Gazprom has warned  several republics and regions of the Russian Federation that it  would cut off gas supplies to their industrial enterprises due  to their debts.    In telegrams sent to the republics of Karachay-Circassia,  Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, Bashkiria and  Daghestan, to Perm, Novosibirsk, Astrakhan, Kemerovo, Rostov and  Voronezh Regions, and to Stavropol Territory, Gazprom says it  will suspend its gas deliveries to them between May 4 and 9 and  demands that they present schedules for the payment of their  arrears, totaling about three billion rubles, a sum which,  according to Gazprom sources, is much higher than the overall  debt for Russian gas of other former Soviet republics, including  Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.    The sources told the Oil Information Agency that Moldova had  still not presented its own schedule for the repayment of a debt  which had reached 131 billion rubles by April 1. As of April  15, Gazprom slashed its supplies to Moldova by one-third. The  sources said that this year the republic had transferred "not a  single ruble" to Gazprom's bank account, having paid part of its  arrears with food exports. The Russian-Moldovan talks on the  debt problem, originally scheduled for the end of April, have  been postponed until this Friday, the sources said.    In an agreement signed by the two countries' governments  late  last year, Moldova pledged to send to Russia 145 million  dollars' worth of food and consumer goods as payment for part of  the 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas the republic is due to  receive from Gazprom this year.    Russia today charges Moldova 80 dollars for 1,000 cubic  meters of gas. Moldova, in turn, charges Russia 1.5 dollars per  100 kilometers for every 1,000 cubic meters of gas pipelined  through Moldovan territory to Romania.</p>

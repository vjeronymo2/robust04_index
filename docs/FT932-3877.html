			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Impressive debut on market for Thai group SHARES in PTT Exploration and Production, the Thai oil and gas company, rose sharply above their initial public offering price on the first day of trading on the Thai stock exchange yesterday, giving a much-needed boost to the government's privatisation plans. In an otherwise lacklustre market, PTTEP shares peaked at Bt54.50 (Dollars 2.16), up 65 per cent from the Bt33 offering price, before falling back to Bt47.50 at the close, valuing the company at Bt12.35bn. PTTEP, 85 per cent owned by the state Petroleum Authority of Thailand, is the country's first privatisation issue this year and the only listed exploration and production company. The 14m shares set aside for non-Thai institutional investors in Asia and Europe were six times oversubscribed. PTTEP's performance goes some way towards compensating for Thai Airways International's poor showing since 7 per cent of its shares were floated last year; yesterday Thai closed at Bt41.75, compared with its Bt60 initial public offering price. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, one of the lead co-ordinators and advisers for the PTTEP issue, says its conservative estimate for the company's net present value is Bt39 per share.</p>

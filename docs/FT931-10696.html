			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: Dunhill goes back to its roots - A company that is cashing in on nostalgia AT THE turn of the century London was a city of small shop keepers. Mass-production had not yet got under way and business was largely made up of small cottage industries. For historians what is fascinating is trying to identify just why some of the small cottage industries died and why others grew into hugely successful modern companies. Take Alfred Dunhill. In the late 19th century Dunhill was just a little tobacco shop, one among many. Almost all later fell by the wayside but Dunhill prospered and is now busy turning itself into a big player in the luxury goods industry. Like most successful businesses it was kick-started by a man who was intuitive enough to anticipate the way the world was going, to offer customers what they had not yet realised they wanted. Motoring, he foresaw, was going to be the coming thing and so he developed what he called the Dunhill Motorities - fine leather coats to keep out the wind, foot-muffs to warm the feet, motoring-masks, fur-lined goggles, brass lamps, picnic baskets; the ideas came thick and fast. From Motorities (which he foresaw would be less in demand once motor-cars became enclosed and warmer) he moved into an ingenious range of lighters, watches and accessories. Now that it has become fashionable for companies to look to their roots Dunhill, in its centenary year, is doing just that - affirming its spirit, celebrating its history, digging deep into the archives. It has launched an Pounds 8m advertising campaign to persuade owners of Dunhill collectables to sell them back to the company.  Already, several rare pieces have been bought but there are still some special pieces (such as the 'Dorothy' rose lighter - a marvellously kitsch design with a platinum and gold basket topped by 60 cabochon rubies for the roses) which the company longs to have. Dunhill has also been inspired to try and recreate the best of the pieces. It has started with a few key designs - the golf ball lighter, a classic of the 1930s; a marvellous short leather motoring jacket based on the Motorities coat; a range of watches inspired by a 1930s Dunhill range; and the Sylphide Lighter. Sadly, not all the designs have been recreated as finely as the originals - technology and time move on and what was expensive way back in the 1930s is almost unaffordable in the 1990s - but all have something of the original spirit. Pictured here are some of the first pieces from the new Heritage Collection, to be available in mid-March from Dunhill, 30 Duke Street, St. James's, London, SW1Y 6DL and branches.</p>

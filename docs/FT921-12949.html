			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Unemployment jumps fourfold in Hungary UNEMPLOYMENT in Hungary quadrupled last year as companies shed labour in the face of recession in both domestic and east European markets. December saw the largest jump in unemployment since Hungary's economic reforms began. A rise of 55,000 last month took the year-end unemployment total to 406,000, or 8.5 per cent of the workforce. The official forecast that unemployment will not exceed 580,000 in 1992 sits uneasily with the latest indications that job losses are intensifying. An impending wave of bankruptcies is likely to reinforce the trend, although the recession is set to ease. Gross domestic product is officially expected to stabilise in 1992 after falling about 8 per cent in 1991. The immediate political fall-out from rising unemployment has been contained by a widespread public perception that many, especially gypsies, abuse the unemployment benefit system.</p>

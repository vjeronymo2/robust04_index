			<p>BFN     [Text] The multinational observers will apparently begin  deploying in Hebron next week, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  determined today after meeting for the first time with  representatives of the countries participating in the force.  The foreign minister added that the 160 observers from Italy,  Denmark, and Norway will mainly engage in administrative duties:  60 of them will report on the situation in the field directly  to the Israeli security forces, and the other 100 will advise  the Israeli Government and Hebron Municipality in a bid to  attain a normalization of the situation in the city.</p>

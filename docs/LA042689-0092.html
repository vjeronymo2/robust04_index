			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PILE OF LUMBER FALLS, KILLING EX-MAYOR  </P> <P> Cam Briglio, former Monterey Park mayor and city councilman, was crushed to  death Tuesday by a stack of lumber that fell on him at his home in the 600  block of Orange Avenue, police said. He was 52.  </P> <P> Police and Fire Department officials responded to calls from a neighbor, who  said she heard a loud crash followed by Briglio's pleas for help, Police Sgt.  George Verbeck said. Firefighters located Briglio under the pile of lumber in a  back room of the house, Verbeck said. Power saws were needed to cut through the  lumber and extract Briglio, who died about an hour after arrival at Garfield  Hospital.  </P> <P> Briglio served as mayor from Feb. 9 to Dec. 14, 1987. In Monterey Park, City  Council members are appointed to the office of mayor on a rotation basis.  </P> <P> Briglio's term on the City Council lasted from April 10, 1984, to April 12,  1988, during which he survived a recall effort initiated by opponents who  differed with Briglio over real estate development issues. He lost his bid for  reelection in a campaign that featured heated debate over the development issue  as well as the city's changing ethnic makeup.  </P></p>

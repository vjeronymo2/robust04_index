			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Sri Lanka to investigate 'three business deals' Sri Lanka's new government will investigate three multi-million dollar business deals set up by the country's previous rulers, Mrs Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the newly-elected prime minister, said yesterday. The deals, a Dollars 73m (Pounds 48.6m) arms agreement with Russia, the purchase of three Airbus jetliners, and the import of 5,000 buses from India and Britain, would be investigated by the Finance Ministry, she added. 'In the arms deal, 10 per cent has been paid in an unconventional manner without following procedure,' she alleged. According to a report by the army's Directorate of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, obtained by Reuters this week, a consignment of eight BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles also had defective engines and steering systems, despite Russian assurances the vehicles would be fully overhauled and defects repaired. A second cargo of eight BMP-2s arrived last week and is waiting at Colombo airport, army officials said. They were part of a controversial arms deal with Russia, now suspended by the government, for 200 armoured vehicles, gunboats, helicopters and transport aircraft, for use in an offensive against Tamil guerrillas fighting for independence in the island's north and east. Mrs Kumaratunga said Airbus Industrie had agreed to a 10-day grace period to sign an agreement, earlier scheduled for last Monday for the delivery of three A340-300 jetliners. 'We are studying the agreement,' she added. Mr Dharmasiri Senanayake, Aviation Minister, said the Dollars 300m Airbus contract, criticised by the People's Alliance when it was in opposition as being too extravagant, would not be cancelled because of international obligations. Officials of the People's Alliance coalition, which won the August 16 national poll, have accused unnamed officials of receiving 'commissions'. Mrs Kumaratunga said the treasury had overspent Rs33bn (Pounds 433m) under the former United National Party government which ruled for 17 years. 'Because of this deficit, the Central Bank was about to print money. I had to stop that.' The Prime Minister, who is also the finance minister, said she was looking at ways of bridging the gap.</p>

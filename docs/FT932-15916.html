			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / BMW to assemble cars in Vietnam BMW, the German luxury carmaker, plans to assemble cars in Vietnam from next year in a venture signalling the rapid pace of the country's economic change. The company has signed an agreement to set up a sales, parts and service network in Vietnam, and intends to assemble up to 200 cars a year. Although the initial number of units is modest, Mr Bernd Wiegand, managing director for BMW Asia, said the decision was 'strategic' and reflected the company's confidence in the development of Vietnam and the availability of qualified labour. Manufacturing will be confined to the 316i and the 520i models, to be built from from assembly kits shipped from Germany. Some parts will be manufactured locally. The venture is important in Vietnam's quest for foreign investment, backed by radical economic reforms as the country moves away from central planning and state control, but hampered by a US embargo, dating back to the Vietnam war, on doing business with the communist country and by poor infrastructure due to lack of funds. Many foreign manufacturers, however, are attracted by a cheap and enthusiastic labour force and by the opportunities Vietnam will present when the US ban is fully lifted and funding from international financial institutions begins to flow. The motor industry in Vietnam is in its infancy, and the road network is badly in need of upgrading and repair, but many Vietnamese have substantial savings in cash which could be used to buy vehicles as the economy grows and the infrastructure improves. The agreement is with Vietnam Motors Corporation, a Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m) joint venture 70 per cent owned by Columbian Motors of the Philippines - which assembles Japanese and South Korean cars in the Philippines - and 30 per cent by Hoa Binh, a state-owned bus manufacturer based in Hanoi, northern Vietnam. BMW has similar assembly agreements in Thailand, Uruguay, Malaysia and Indonesia, but it exports its cars directly to 115 other countries.

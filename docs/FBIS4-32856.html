			<p>BFN     [Text] Sucre, Bolivia, 26 May (EFE) -- Bolivian President  Sanchez de Lozada announced today his intention of establishing  a Constitutional Court to restructure the judiciary.    After meeting with Supreme Court members in Sucre, the  country's administrative capital, Sanchez de Lozada announced  that he will promote the establishment of a Constitutional Court  during the extraordinary congressional sessions that started  last week, and during which the constitution will be amended.    After meeting with Sanchez de Lozada, acting Chief Justice  Gualberto Davalos expressed the Supreme Court's opposition to  the establishment of a Constitutional Court.    Davalos explained that the Bolivian Supreme Court has and  will always oppose the establishment of a Constitutional Court,  because it believes it would undermine the Supreme Court's  powers and the autonomy of the judiciary.    Sanchez de Lozada expressed his determination to propose the  establishment of a Constitutional Court in the constitutional  amendments, and cited several European and Latin American  countries that have one.    The Bolivian Supreme Court has been virtually paralyzed  since  last year in view of impeachment proceedings undertaken against  its president, Edgar Oblitas, who has been charged with  extortion.</p>

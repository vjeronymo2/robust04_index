Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Medicare contractor budget is organized around the previously listed functional areas that are performed by the fiscal intermediaries for Part A and the carriers for Part B. FY 1992 was the first year in which we developed a bottom-line unit cost for each individual contractor. The following narrative describes the methodology used to calculate individual line-item costs. This methodology will be considered as general reference for contractors as they develop their FY 1995 budgets, and also to provide additional explanation in determining how certain costs and savings were determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Bill and Claim Payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The individual fiscal intermediary and carrier workload levels for FY 1995 are determined by using a statistical forecasting model. Using the same data, we are also projecting the number of bills or claims a fiscal intermediary and carrier may expect to have pending at the end of the FY 1994. We then combine the FY 1995 receipt estimate with the anticipated end of FY 1994 pending level, and subtract the estimated FY 1995 pending for each fiscal intermediary and carrier to establish a processed workload; that is, Estimated FY 1995 receipts + Estimated end of FY 1994 pending ^ Estimated end of FY 1995 pending = Estimated FY 1995 Processed Workload.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to price individual contractor bill and claim workload, we develop a unit cost that is the cost of processing a single bill or claim. The individual fiscal intermediary and carrier unit costs for FY 1995 are calculated from the unit costs in the FY 1994 Notices of Budget Approval. The calculations include increases to recognize the cost of new legislation. Savings achieved from operating efficiencies also are part of the formula employed in computing FY 1995 target unit costs. The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to resolve any differences within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Private View: Playwright seeks fair trial SIX YEARS out of Cambridge with a history degree, aged 28, Rod Williams has never had a proper job. But he is not unemployed. He sits in his bedsitter at the top of a house in Kentish Town, north London, for up to seven hours a day, typing. When he has had a good day he treats himself to a curry. When things have gone badly, he doesn't. Supported by the dole, a bank overdraft, part-time teaching and the occasional windfall - an Arts Council grant, a privately-funded prize - he spends about Pounds 100 a week. He has no wife, lover or children to worry about. Rod Williams is a playwright, in a country where the creative artist is too often regarded as an eccentric supernumerary and at a time when the market for new plays has probably never been smaller. 'If it rains', he said, 'I get wet feet. All of my shoes have got holes.' This is not a hard luck story. Williams has volunteered for his life on the fringe. He is not obsessed, not driven by an imperious Muse. Furthermore, he has had a success. His first play, No Remission, a gripping study of three lifers in a prison cell, was awarded second prize in the Mobil/Royal Exchange competition in 1988, was staged on the Edinburgh Festival fringe in 1990 and today comes to the end of a highly-praised run at the Lyric Studio in Hammersmith, London. Success may be intoxicating but it does not pay many bills. Williams has earned terrific plaudits from No Remission and Pounds 600 in cash. Poverty, he told me, is a grind. 'The only way to improve as a writer is to write. It's a bit like clocking up mileage. On the other hand, writing is a very solitary activity and the poorer you get the more solitary it becomes because your social life withers away. You don't meet people through work. 'I've certainly felt over the last two or three years 'My God, now I know what the grind of poverty is like.' Of course, I'm not homeless or anything. What I'm experiencing is nothing compared to real poverty, but it's a grind compared with what I've been used to.' Williams is used to a comfortable middle-class life in the Home Counties. His father is a Canadian lawyer who moved to England and married a British girl. His parents divorced when he was 11 but he was able to go to Bedales School and won a place at Trinity College, Cambridge. He is quick-witted and softly spoken, a bit earnest in the articulation of his views, occasionally comic. He has a sophisticated, sceptical and very independent mind, and plays Scriabin on the piano. He wrote his first play at the age of nine, a country-house murder story. For it, he bought large quantities of fake blood which he stitched in sachets to the schoolboy actors' T-shirts. Unluckily, the blood leaked out long before the planned finale of multiple stabbings. At Cambridge he made three short films. Then BBC Scotland showed interest in a TV play and Williams, though by now realising that very few people make a living from playwriting, was committed. After No Remission he wrote Creative People, the story of a power struggle in a telephone sales company caused by the arrival of a cult-trained new manager. Again the BBC has shown interest, again without result. His third play, finished last week after two and a half years, is a satire about cryonics, the fashion for having your body deep-frozen after death for eventual revival when science solves the problem of how to do it. The Life of the World to Come, involving seven characters, Americans, in a Caribbean tax haven is intended not so much to mock cryonics as to satirise what Williams regards as the primitive superstition of even advanced societies. I asked the author why, in No Remission, he had chosen a subject and a vernacular so far from his own experience. 'I think you have an intuition, an instinct. It sounds like a crazy idea: I hadn't been to prison. People warned me that however good the play was it wouldn't ring true, and if it did ring true, nobody in the theatre would know it and would suspect that it didn't. But when you decide what you're going to write about, nothing is going to stop you. 'It was another crazy idea to write a play in a foreign language, American. But you're driven to write when you have a hunch that you'll be able to do it.' A former lifer from Barlinnie jail declared No Remission to be the best play about prison he had seen. A group of convicts' wives were reduced to tears by it and said it was too strong to be shown to inmates. 'I've written a play about prison,' Williams said, 'but prison is just bricks and iron, a destination where people end up. In a way prison represents - I don't want this to sound too high-falutin' - their fate for at least two of my characters.' Fate, as personified by ancient Greek tragedy, played a large part in Williams' inspiration. He has become an avid reader of Aeschylus and Sophocles and finds confirmatory solace and stimulus in Aristotle's Poetics. 'For me style and form are subordinate to content. The problem of drama is how to compress so that everything is essential - how to avoid the prosaic. That is something into which Aristotle had tremendous insights. Every time I read the Poetics a new sentence will spring out.' Are you fatalistic yourself? 'Not in any superstitious sense. Only in the sense that character is fate and in so far as I think your cognisance of your own character is much more limited than you realise. I think that's also true of a culture and it's a kind of hubris to claim to understand it more than you do. 'To me, socialism was a form of hubris. It claimed an understanding of society and culture and economics: the boldness of its claims was so total and yet so completely wrong.' What are your politics, then? 'I regard Left and Right as terms which have been used to bamboozle minds that should have known better. Who is anything now? There's no longer any excuse for being Left or Right. Those are just ways of preventing yourself looking at society and its problems.' No Remission has been been called an old-fashioned play, a criticism which Williams takes as a compliment to his craftsmanship. 'I get very easily bored in the theatre,' he said. 'You know, I'm not a sort of theatre buff. A good play is about a specific environment in which everyone can be interested. It should be immune to fashion.' What about feminist and ethnic plays? 'A play's a play. It's either good or bad.' Even if it's written for a designated audience? 'Well, I haven't any time for that. Political plays, like melodrama, become obsessed with the villain - in this case Late Capitalism is usually the villain and it has to be personified in a totally implausible way.' For a play to last it should create its own life, he continued. Too many relied on current topics or opinions to give them a third dimension. 'In ten years' time those plays will just look two-dimensional again.' Then what motivates you to write plays? 'I look at it this way. I write for myself: I write for me as the audience. I hope there will be another big audience for what I write. There's the pleasure of writing and polishing dialogue. There is a pleasure in being the God of your own world. I suppose I'm rationalising post hoc: I haven't got pat answers . . . 'I suppose the desire to force people to see things your way. I suppose that's what you do. You give them a vision of reality and they have to accept it. The nice thing is you never know what people are going to say. 'I want them to enjoy themselves, that's another thing. But I haven't got an agenda. The writing of the play is an end in itself. Obviously I want it to be enthralling. People might misunderstand it. But if they enjoy it and they get something out of it, that's the bottom line. 'There is a view that a writer wants to change the world. I just don't know if I do or not. I think it is true that I want people to look at the stuff and say 'Yes, this is real, this is plausible.' You cannot doubt the seriousness of this dramatist. Yet he says he is not resigned to living a life of poverty. If he cannot make it, he will stop. 'You can make a living but it may take a very long time. On the other hand, one good play can be very, very valuable. So I motivate myself with that fantasy. If I can't get anyone interested in this new play I shall be forced to do something else. I won't mind that. Sooner or later there has to be a reckoning.' If that moment arrives, I asked, what would you do instead? 'I don't know. I had thought of training to be a graphologist as a source of income. That also fascinates me. You see, there is a view that writers just have to write, that whatever the objective circumstances they'll do it. There's a certain amount of truth to that but there's a lot of nonsense as well.' In that brotherhood of anonymous toilers Rod Williams has had the self-confidence, talent (and luck) to be 'discovered'. But in these days of rising costs and ultra-cautious producers the detection of new talent is only the first step. Will the author of No Remission now get a proper hearing?</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry: A healthy appetite for world markets - The food industry accounts for a quarter of exports and has been hit by the recent Gatt deal. But there could be new opportunities An English schoolgirl who was asked in the 1980s what she associated with Denmark, replied: 'pig, pig, bacon, pig'. This may not be an uncommon image, but there is much more both to modern Denmark and to its food industry. Though it rears more than 20m pigs a year and still provides the best-selling imported bacon in Britain, Denmark, with only 5m people, produces enough food for three times that number. It also has a large share of world markets in other areas apart from pigmeat where it has specialised, such as cheese and fresh and frozen fish. The food industry provides between 12 and 18 per cent of Denmark's domestic employment, (depending on the definition used), and accounts for about 25 per cent of the country's merchandise exports. Denmark is the world's fifth-largest exporter of food products, according to a report produced for the Ministry for Industry last year, and a 16 per cent increase in output over the past 10 years has enabled it to maintain its share of world markets. Manufacturing industry long ago overtook agriculture as the country's main export industry, and now provides about 70 per cent of the country's merchandise exports, but agriculture and fisheries still account for about 5 per cent of total employment and roughly the same share of total production. The rise of the primary food industries - pigmeat, dairy products and fish - has been accompanied, too, by the development of companies in associated industries, many of them world leaders. These include Novo Nordisk, Christian Hansen Group and Grindsted Products, producers of food ingredients such as enzymes, emulsifiers, stabilisers and flavourings; Foss Electric and Radiometer in instrumentation; and APV Danish Turnkey Dairies and Niro Atomiser in food processing machinery. Carlsberg has, of course, established itself, too, as a leading international brewing company. Danisco, the sugar, distilling, frozen vegetables and packaging group, is less well-known internationally but has become one of the largest European producers of beet sugar through acquisitions in Sweden and Germany, and is one of the country's largest listed industrial corporations. The food and food technology industries, because of their vital importance to the health of the Danish economy, have been pinpointed by the government as one of the sectors on which Denmark's future growth and prosperity will depend. For this reason the government is helping to finance a substantial programme of research, which, it is hoped, will enable the country to lift the quality of its products along the route from the farm to the table. The strong position which the country holds in the food industry goes back a long way. Denmark was one of a few countries in Europe which did not react to the challenge of cheap American corn in the 1870s by raising import barriers. Instead, its farmers had to find alternative sources of income, and as a result, developed a lucrative market exporting butter, eggs and bacon to the UK. The country's food and food technology industry has never looked back. Since entry into the then European Communnity further support for Denmark's primary agricultural industry has come from the common agricultural policy, which subsidises exports to non-member countries. Yet, a threat of sorts does now hang over the sector in the shape of the recent Gatt agreement, which calls for a reduction of 34 per cent in the volume of exports of subsidised products. Mr Bjorn Westh, minister for agriculture, sees the Gatt agreement as a challenge, which opens up opportunities to win new markets. and he is calling for an attacking policy on the part of Europe to make the best of these opportunities. Mr HOA Kjeldsen, president of the Agricultural Council (an umbrella organisation for almost all the Danish farmers' organisations) shares the minister's view, although, as he says, his members 'face a harsh period of adaptation'. The rest of Europe has a special reason to be interested in the Danish food industry and its ability to adapt. A large share of Denmark's agricultural exports goes to non-European Union countries, especially cheese, a product in which Iran is the largest export market by tonnage. The Middle East is an important market for butter and milk powder and Japan has overtaken the UK as the most important market for Danish pigmeat (by value, though not by tonnage). As Mr Westh points out, policies which allow Denmark to continue to export to third countries should be of interest to other European countries. Otherwise, the products concerned will be offloaded on to the European market, causing serious downward pressure on prices. He wants the European Union to consider bringing the European corn price down to the world market level. This would eliminate the subsidy element in the production of pigmeat and poultry, which are fed on corn products. No quantitative restrictions, would as a result need to be imposed under the terms of Gatt agreement, on exports. Mr Kjeldsen also wants Europe to introduce B-quotas for milk production. The B-quota would be priced at the world market price and could be used to help Denmark to maintain its exports of cheese, butter, and powdered milk exports outside Europe. Prospects for the primary food industry clearly depend on access to world markets, but Denmark has one important advantage. Pigmeat, the most important agricultural export product, is not directly supported under the common agricultural policy and its exports are therefore not threatened by the Gatt agreement in the same way as dairy products and beef. Though pessimists focus on the food surplus in European countries in considering the future of the agricultural food industry, others, such as Mr Erik Juul Jorgensen, head of the private Institute for Food Studies and Agro-industrial Development, in Copenhagen, focus on the global market. They predict a strong increase in demand for food, and see few limits to the potential for Danish production and exports, given a satisfactory world trading regime. In a 1992 report, Mr Juul Jorgensen argued that Denmark could double production by its agricultural, food processing and agro-technical industries between 1990 and 2001. The pig farmers have shown the way. Between 1989 and 1993, pig production increased from 15.5m to more than 20m animals per year, or by 30 per cent. Pigmeat prices over the past year have been so low, however, that no further increase in production is expected. Mr Bent Sloth, chairman of the Association of Danish Slaughterhouses and himself a pig producer, predicts that pig output will not rise from the present level for several years. However, Mr Westh believes production may well reach 25m by 2000, and Mr Juul Jorgensen sees no reason why it should not reach 30m during the first decade of the next century. A feature of the agricultural sector is the domination by the co-operative movement. Two co-operative dairies, MD Foods and Klover Milk, account for 90 per cent of the milk produced on farms. Five slaughterhouse groups account for almost all the pig production. MD Foods and the two largest slaughterhouse groups, Danish Crown and Vestjyske Slagterier (West Jutland Abbatoirs) are among the largest companies in their industries in Europe. The co-operatives, which are governed by a democratic system of one man, one vote, provide the dairies and slaughterhouses with a unique degree of vertical integration from farmer through processing to export sales. One of the disadvantages of the co-operative system according to its critics, is its inability to raise equity capital from external sources. The co-operatives have found a way round this limitation, however, through the establishment of MD Foods International in the dairy sector, and Tulip International in the meat sector, MD Foods, which has invested heavily in the UK dairy industry, and Tulip, which is the processing arm of Danish Crown, (producing such items as minced meat and ham, as opposed to fresh and frozen cuts), are partly financed by equity from Danish institutional investors. Critics of the co-operatives also say the industry has been slow in embarking on production of more highly processed foods, such as charcuterie products and convenience foods, but Mr Kjeldsen rejects that charge. 'Most of our exports are high-quality, processed raw products. We obtain attractive prices, for example, for our pigmeat exports to Japan, because we make products with a uniform high quality. We would earn less if we went into highly processed convenience foods and sold them under our brand names, a business that requires an enormous investment.' Although the farmers are enduring tough times at the moment, Mr Kjeldsen is not discouraged. 'When young people ask me if there is a future in farming, my answer is: Yes. There will always be problems, but there are problems whatever sector you are in. A well-educated farmer has a good future in Denmark,' he says confidently.  ----------------------------------------------                 WORLD EXPORTS                Denmark's share  ---------------------------------------------- Pigmeat                             26% Frozen fish                         13% Fresh fish                          12% Milk, cream                         12% Cheese                              10% Bakery products                     10% Total world exports               0.85%  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Kim Moller and Henrik Pade, Industrial Success, Samfundslitteratur, 1988  ----------------------------------------------</p>

In an interview for a UNIAN  correspondent on the occasion of this date the BSF commander  said that he comes out against the fleet's politicization.  According to the admiral, despite a number of agreements  reached by the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, the status of  the fleet remains suspended thus giving rise to problems as far  as the material basis and the personnel are concerned. Eduard  Baltin pointed out that the preservation of the Black Sea Fleet  as a combat unit and an outpost on the borders of the  Commonwealth countries are regarded by him as a priority at the  present stage. The BSF commander is anxiously waiting for the  heads of the two states to find a solution acceptable to both  sides.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 17 February broadcasts the  80-minute fourth of a 10-part series consisting of nine  lectures, and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV  Lecture Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming  the Economic System."    The fourth lecture, entitled: "Separated Financial and  Taxation System," is given by Vice Minister of Finance Xiang  Huaicheng.    Xiang Huaicheng begins by noting that according to a State  Council's decision, the tax assignment system -- a new system  for financial management -- came into force beginning 1 January.  Xiang says this marks an important reform in China's financial  and taxation system, and goes on to explain:    1. The background and significance of conducting reform of  the tax assignment system: Since the founding of New China, the  state has basically practiced unified state control over revenue  and expenditure; the financial management system has been  reformed many times since the reform and opening up policy was  adopted; and finally, various forms of contracted financial  responsibility systems have been adopted in various localities.  However, as the market gradually plays a bigger role in  distributing resources, the shortcomings of this system are  becoming more apparent. Therefore, based on Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided  to establish a socialist market economy and strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control; to achieve this goal, the  tax assignment system has been introduced.    Xiang defines the tax assignment system as "a financial  management measure for assigning various categories of taxes  into central and local revenue as based on the division of power  between central and local authorities." According to this  principle, all categories of taxes are put under three main  taxes: Central tax, central-local sharing tax, and local tax.  "While dividing power and assigning taxes," Xiang stresses:  "It is also necessary to establish separate central and local  taxation organs and systems." Having described the basic  framework of the tax assignment system, Xiang states some  advantages of the system, mainly: Rationalizing the  distribution relations between the central and local  authorities, gradually increasing central government's revenues,  and gradually establishing a unified market around the country.    2. The specific contents in the reform of tax assignment  system: To start with the reform, the power between central and  local authorities must be divided clearly first, then comes the  division of taxes. Xiang says the general principles for  dividing taxes are, as clarified in the "Decision" adopted by  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee:  "The categories of taxes required for safeguarding national  rights and interests, and the exercise of macroeconomic  regulation and control are assigned as central taxes; the main  categories of taxes directly related to economic development are  assigned as sharing taxes; and categories of taxes that can be  properly collected and managed by local authorities and are  conducive to inspiring the enthusiasm of local authorities are  assigned as local taxes." Xiang then goes on to explain why  value-added tax, stamp tax (imposing on stock transactions), and  resource tax are assigned as sharing taxes. As a result of the  reform, the proportion of the national revenue taken by the  central authorities has risen from 38.6 percent to about 57  percent as a whole. However, Xiang says this does not mean that  the central authorities have greatly increased their tax income  or transferred their financial deficits to local authorities,  because, he explains: "One of the principles for this reform is  to maintain local authorities' vested financial resources." In  compliance with this principle, the central fiscal organ will  first collect sharing taxes, and then return and transfer the  part belonging to local authorities every year. Xiang stresses:  "A very distinct Chinese characteristic in this practice is  that the central authorities do not instruct how to use the  funds returned; the local governments have full rights to decide  how they should be used."    Having expounded the principles for this reform, Xiang  immediately explains why the central authorities must take  nearly 60 percent of national revenue, why the tax assignment  system affects localities only slightly, and why the central  fiscal organ does not greatly increase its revenue income  through this reform (because of the aforementioned practice of  returning funds to localities).    3. Key features in tax assignment system reform: Xiang sums  up the basic features of this reform as "a mild and step-by-step  reform" and gives some facts to support this point; for example,  the original distribution setup remains unchanged temporarily,  the central government takes more only from the increased amount  in the value-added tax, and local interests are taken care of.    4. Some problems to be attended to in the course of reform:  To effectively carry out tax assignment system reform, Xiang  calls for implementing other supporting reforms properly, namely  the reform of business tax system and reform in the distribution  of profits between the state and state-owned enterprises. He  says it is also important that reforms in other systems  (investment system, enterprise management system, foreign trade  system, financial and foreign exchange system), which are  launched together with this reform, be carried out properly,  because they are closely correlated.    At 0715 GMT Xiang concludes: The most important matter is:  "We must unify our thinking and action in carrying out all  reforms, including tax assignment system reform." Xiang  stresses the need to help cadres and people understand the  contents of these reforms, and relations among reform,  development, and stability, so as to gain their support.</p>

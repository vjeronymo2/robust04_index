			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Scots power group attacked Scottish Power, the privatised utility which supplies southern Scotland, was yesterday criticised by its consumer watchdog for not passing on more of the financial benefits of privatisation to its customers. The Southern Scotland electricity consumers' committee said that the 2 per cent reduction in Scottish Power's 1994-95 tariffs was little more than it was obliged to make to conform with the electricity regulator's formula. The committee said it had urged Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, to tighten the formula to 'ensure that the financial benefits of privatisation be extended to the consumer in whose interests the industry has been privatised'. Professor Thomas Carberry, chairman, claimed that Scottish Power made a 41.5 per cent profit on the turnover of its electricity supply business in 1993-94. It said it expected Scottish Power's shareholders to be the main beneficiaries, but said it would be 'prudent' if the consumers were also to benefit. He regretted that the extension last year of competition in electricity supply to customers taking more that 100kw a year had led to only 4 per cent of Scottish Power's former customers switching suppliers. Most electricity companies, he said, had 'set out to corral their customers by offering discounts which . . . were modest'. More effort should have been made to alert them to their freedom to choose their supplier. Mr Duncan Whyte, Scottish Power's joint chief operating officer, rejected the committee's criticism. Tariffs had fallen 4.8 per cent in real terms since privatisation in 1991 and were among the lowest in the UK. British Coal has received Pounds 3.24m in government subsidies for coal sold to the power-generation companies over and above its long-term supply contracts. The subsidy arrangement was put in place after the 1992 coal crisis.</p>

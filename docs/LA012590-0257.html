			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ONLY THE TV WILL WITNESS COACH'S GROWL  </P> <P> Texas-El Paso basketball Coach Don Haskins, still suffering from a severe case  of laryngitis, said he likely will remain sidelined the rest of the season.  </P> <P> Haskins, nicknamed "The Bear" because of his sideline growl, said his voice has  improved recently, but he won't return court side because he tends to yell  during games.  </P> <P> "I even screamed at the TV set," Haskins said, referring to the Miners' road  loss to Hawaii he watched last week.  </P> <P> Haskins has missed nine games but has attended home practices. Norm Ellenberger  has been Texas-El Paso's interim coach since Dec. 23.  </P> <P> The Miners are 5-4 during Haskins' absence.  </P> <P> "If something isn't broke, why fix it?" Haskins said. "My presence would change  things, and that wouldn't be good for our basketball team."  </P> <P> Haskins underwent a biopsy in October, and a doctor determined he had  laryngitis, which plagued him for a year.  </P> <P> The doctor also said Haskins does not have cancer.  </P></p>

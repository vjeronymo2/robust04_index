			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Foreign Secretariat has denounced hearings at  the U.S. Congress requested by Congressman Robert Torricelli,  and it has described the move as open intervention and  anti-Mexican.    Deputy Foreign Secretary Andres Rozental said Mexicans find  this attempt to cast judgment and besmirch our country's  reputation to be unacceptable. He added that the move is  apparently stems from the resentment of some people who do not  like the fact that Mexico maintains normal relations with Cuba  or who may be upset by the approval of NAFTA.    It must be made very clear, according to the official, that  the implementation of NAFTA grants no one outside of Mexico the  right to judge matters that are solely up to the Mexicans to  resolve. We have never accepted, nor will we accept, the  exercise of trusteeships over our sovereignty, Rozental stated.</p>

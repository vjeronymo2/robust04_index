			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Britain threatens to limit US flights into Heathrow THE TRANSATLANTIC air war flared up again last night with the British government threatening to limit US flights to Heathrow in retaliation against efforts to undermine British Airways' rights in the US. The UK's tough reaction is expected to revive tensions over transatlantic air services and threatens to complicate the already difficult negotiations on a new 'open skies' agreement between the two countries. The UK is accusing Washington of seeking to curtail BA's rights to offer joint code sharing services with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier in which BA owns a 24.6 per cent stake. Code sharing is a growing trend in the airline industry and enables two airlines to use their respective ticketing codes. This enables an airline to offer a service with a single code even if part of the journey is made on the other carrier. In the case of the BA-USAir partnership, BA operates the transatlantic legs while USAir serves the US domestic sectors. UK airlines obtained rights to code share with US carriers under the so-called Heathrow Deal negotiated in 1991 which allowed American Airlines and United Airlines into Heathrow, the world's biggest international airport. The latest row follows an application to the US government by BA in August to expand its code sharing services with USAir. After a three months delay, the US announced last Friday it would only give approval for the new BA code sharing services for the next 60 days instead of the usual 12 months. Lord Caithness, the UK aviation minister, described the US decision as a 'provocative act quite contrary to our agreement with the US'. He added the UK government felt the move would prejudice BA because airlines cannot plan on a 60 days basis. The UK is not taking immediate action, but has given notice it will withdraw permission for one flight a week each by American Airlines and United Airlines from Heathrow to Chicago and Washington respectively from 12 January - the date BA's code sharing approval expires, unless renewed by the US before then. It is the first time the UK has threatened to block flights by US carriers in London, but Lord Caithness said the government felt it had no option after the 'surprising' US decision. He said the UK was committed to liberalisation, but the 'open skies' negotiations with the US were a separate issue with the existing Heathrow agreement. Washington had so far given no explanation for its action, except to state that the decision was linked to the current bilateral talks with the UK over a new aviation agreement.</p>

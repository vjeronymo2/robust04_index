			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / 'Misled' economists rap Bank A squabble developed yesterday between City economists and the Bank of England over what analysts saw as the misleading signals which accompanied the publication of the Bank's quarterly inflation report on Tuesday. The initial reaction of many economists was that the report meant that interest rates did not need to increase. But national newspapers, following an off-the-record briefing, reported that interest rates were likely to rise over the next few months. 'The briefing is clearly designed to make the conclusions of the report more clear,' said Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers. 'But if they're going to do a briefing, they should make it on the record or put their comments directly in the report.' Mr Gavyn Davies, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said: 'If you're going to produce an on-the-record statement to the markets in the form of an inflation report, why would you want to embellish that with an off-the-record briefing? It greatly diminishes the status of the inflation report.' Mr Davies wants the Bank to follow the practice of the German Bundesbank which normally holds on-the-record press briefings when it wants to make an announcement. The Bank was also accused of misleading the markets in August and September, when its actions in the money markets were interpreted as giving false signals on movements in interest rates. 'The Bank has confused the market three times - in August and September with signals over rate changes - and this time, which is the least serious,' said Mr Stephen Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell. However, Mr Bell said the Bank should continue to give off-the-record briefings. The problem of different interpretations also followed the August inflation report, when newspaper headlines again concentrated on a likely rise in interest rates, to the surprise of many economists. Base rates were duly increased in September. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said: 'It would be good for the markets if there was a bit more transparency.' Wire services have difficulty reporting off-the-record statements because they have to source all their quotes. The Bank has banned one agency, Markets News Service, from attending future briefings after it attributed a quote to Bank of England 'sources', a breach of the rules governing such briefings.</p>

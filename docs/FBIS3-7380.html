The wargame, which involves some 23 warships and no less  than  2,000 marines, is conducted yearly by the navy and that it has  nothing to do with the islands' dispute between Indonesia and  Malaysia, Western Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Suratmin of  Indonesia told reporters here after seeing off the troops and  warships heading for the wargames.    Suratmin also made a stress that the wargame is not a show  of  force.    Accompanied by the wargame director naval Commodore Widodo  A.S., Suratmin stated the the naval exercises are basically  aimed at improving the navy's operational ability in using the  fleet's integrated weaponry system.    Asked about the designated site for this year's wargame, he  said the navy has several times used the location as its site,  particularly for its amphibian landing group force.    The final activity of the wargame will be marked by the  landing of the amphibian force on the island on March 29 which  will be witnessed by Defence and Security Minister General Edi  Sudrajat and the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, Gen. Feisal  Tanjung.    For the first time, three non-military ships, namely a  tanker  of the state-owned Pertamina oil company and two ships of the  Sea Transportation's Directorate General are being deployed in  the wargame.    The participation of the non-military ships is considered as  the initial stage of the implementation of the "Wawasan  Nusantara", an archipelagic concept, and the "Hankamrata", a  public security system which involves the whole national  potentials.    The 23 warships participating the wargame consist of  frigates, corvettes, patrol boats, minesweepers, submarines,  tankers and landing ship tanks.</p>

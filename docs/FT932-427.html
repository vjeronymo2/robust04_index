			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Technology: Is there a doctor on the screen? - The use of telemedicine in remote communities is only now being fully explored When George Walker, a physician at the Dodge County Hospital in rural Georgia, sees a patient with a difficult case, he has an option not open to most other country doctors. Instead of sending his patient to a distant, more sophisticated medical centre, he and the patient can sit in front of a video camera for a teleconference-style consultation with a specialist 130 miles away at the Medical College of Georgia. Dodge County Hospital and the MCG are participating in an experiment with telemedicine - the application of telecommunications technology to the practice of medicine. Although the technology has been known for years and is largely 'off the shelf', according to Jay Sanders, chief of the MCG's Telemedicine Centre, its use for a variety of medical purposes is only now being fully explored. But experts say it could be an important answer to the question of how to raise the quality of healthcare in rural and other under-served areas, while at the same time reducing its cost. 'We really see a great future for this,' says Dina Puskin, director of the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy in Washington. According to the US Health Resources and Services Administration, 35m Americans live in medically under-served areas. These areas fail to meet the criterion of one primary-care physician per 3,500 people or one per 3,000 people in high-need locations. Prisons and mental hospitals, where transport of patients can be costly and difficult, are also prime targets for telemedicine. Puskin, who is also on the White House task force for healthcare reform led by Hillary Rodham Clinton, cautions, however, that while the federal government provides some funds for pilot projects in telemedicine, more experience would have to be gained before the system could be applied throughout the country. Georgia's Dollars 350,000 (Pounds 230,000) pilot programme, which began in September 1991 with state and private funding, is the most sophisticated use of telecommunications for healthcare in the US. It includes teleconferencing and upgraded medical devices such as an electronic stethoscope that magnifies the heartbeat or the sound of lungs breathing. Other diagnostic tools such as X-rays and ultrasound images can be transmitted to high-resolution monitors for study. The MCG is even working with the Georgia Institute of Technology to develop an electronic hand that will simulate a physical examination. The patient's doctor would don a glove to perform an examination, while the specialist, miles away, would place his hand in a sensory generator and feel the same texture, force and temperature. The speed and accuracy of digital transmission has helped boost telemedicine's possibilities, including conferring with specialists during surgery. Walker believes that for a rural physician and his patients 'communication is the major thing' that telemedicine offers. 'Patients love it,' he says, because they are reassured they are being cared for properly and relieved they do not have to travel far from their families and friends for treatment. Walker adds that, for him, conferring with specialists has 'been a valuable educational tool'. At least 11 other states either have telemedicine programmes or are about to begin them. Many of these are relatively limited pilot projects, but the information from this wider number of experiments should help answer some of the questions about telemedicine. The primary one is cost. Sanders says it requires a maximum investment of about Dollars 300,000 in equipment for a hospital to establish a telemedicine hook-up. By his calculation, if telemedicine keeps one patient per day at the rural hospital instead of having him or her referred to another institution, the hospital's net cash flow increases by Dollars 150,000 per year, making it possible to offset the investment in a relatively short time. But Puskin points out that expensive obstacles can exist. Some rural areas may not yet have adequate telecommunication lines and creating such infrastructure is costly. She also says: 'The financial equations will look better when the cost of equipment comes down - and the prices are coming down.' Another question for telemedicine is whether physicians will accept and use it. Sanders notes that doctors as a group have been relatively slow to use computers. And experts agree that there is little point in small community hospitals' investing in expensive technology if their doctors will not use it. But some doctors have balked with good reason. They have been forced to fight for reimbursement from insurance plans that refuse to recognise their telemedicine services. The insurers generally have been willing to cover radiology and pathology services because the transmitted images involved in those consultations are regarded as the same as looking at the real thing. Other types of consultations do not, however, meet an insurance requirement for the 'laying on of hands' and have been ruled out. While the American Medical Association has weighed in on the side of telemedicine to win doctor reimbursement, the issue is not yet resolved. But 'it will be' and in the doctors' favour, says Ted Hartman, who directed a telemedicine programme in Texas and is now an executive with insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. 'It has to be because that's the way health care will be delivered.' Once reimbursement is approved by the federal Medicare programme, which insures healthcare for the elderly, private insurers 'will fall into line,' predicts Hartman.</p>

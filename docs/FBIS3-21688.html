			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial report] Vienna NEWS in German on 24 Feb 94 on  pages 44-49 carries a 2,100-word "exclusive" report by Alexander  Czogalla, entitled "Street of Drugs," on heroin transports from  the town of Elazig in eastern Turkey to Vienna.    The meeting of two Turkish drug dealers with a Tunisian  customer in Vienna is described. According to an Interpol  report, drugs valued at 2 billion schillings were sold in Vienna  last year. NEWS describes in detail how the drug money is  laundered in Austrian casinos, paid into anonymous accounts in  several Viennese banks, and then transferred to Turkey.    The article notes that European investigators have been  concentrating on the small town of Elazig for two years. They  call it "Europe's heroin exchange" because "more schillings,  German marks, and dollars flow to the roughly 30 banks in the  town than to Ankara or Istanbul put together." Reportedly,  almost all heroin shipments to or via Vienna come from Elazig  and almost all the dealers caught by the Austrian drugs squad  are citizens of this town. Captain Gerhard Joszt from Interpol  in Vienna wants to bust this heroin connection together with his  European colleagues in Wiesbaden. "According to the police, 4.3  tonnes of heroin are delivered to Vienna every year," but only  16 kg were seized in 1992. It is noted that the drug bosses have  developed a "gigantic apparatus consisting of hundreds of  followers, clever action plans, and internal secret codes."    The report continues with a description of a visit to  Elazig,  which is booming. The people drive luxurious cars and wear  "models of Armani and Chanel." While the mayor denies that drug  deals are carried out in his town, a member of the Turkish  secret police states the following: "The crude opium from  Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, and Iraq is illegally taken here  across the border. It is transformed into heroin with the help  of French chemists in laboratories that are hidden in cellars in  Bingol and Palu, suburbs of Elazig. Then it is transported to  Europe overland in trucks with vegetables and fruit and by ship.  The smugglers mostly choose the Balkan route via Sofia or  Budapest. In Bratislava the heroin is loaded into Bulgarian or  Czech trucks and taken to Vienna." Five extended families are  in control of the drug business in Elazig, while their relatives  are in Austria, Germany, Spain, Belgium, and France.    The report concludes with the following statement of the  German mafia expert Dagobert Lindlau: "Because of its  negligence, Austria became the toy of organized crime long ago."</p>

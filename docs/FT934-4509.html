			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / People: Jersey pilots new board Blackburn Rovers' manager Kenny Dalglish must be glad that he is running multi-millionaire Jack Walker's pet football team and not his regional airline - Jersey European Airways - which is having its third shake-up in less than five years. Barry Perrott, 44, has replaced Trefor Jones, a former pilot, as managing director of JEA and group managing director of its parent, Walker Aviation. Perrott joined JEA just over a year ago as planning director after 25 years with British Airways. Jones had joined JEA two years ago and is a former president of the European Regional Airlines Association. Michael Robinson, JEA's financial director, is also being replaced. JEA, which describes itself as Britain's leading independent regional airline, declined to elaborate on the reasons for the management changes. JEA has a fleet of 16 aircraft and 360 staff; it serves 13 destinations and has been leading the fight for lower fares on the routes between Belfast and the mainland. Despite its name, its route network has expanded well beyond the Channel Islands. However, it is facing growing competition on some of its routes and Jack Walker, whose fortune has been estimated at Pounds 320m, will be conscious that owning a rapidly growing airline can be even more expensive than owning a premier league football club.</p>

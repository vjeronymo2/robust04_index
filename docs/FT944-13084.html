			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Kohl's talks centre on spending cuts: Germany's coalition negotiations The three parties in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new government emerged from their first session of talks yesterday, vowing to modernise Germany but promising to keep a very tight hold on its purse strings. 'Savings, savings, savings - that really is the most important element of these talks,' said Mr Werner Hoyer, the general secretary of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the small liberal party which shores up the coalition between Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU), the CDU's more conservative Bavarian sister party. The new government will reduce the federal civil service by 1 per cent - or 12,000 jobs - a year, make legislation simpler, introduce new laws to shorten notoriously complicated planning procedures and speed up court cases. 'Our country is in danger of becoming paralysed,' said Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU. 'We have to work out why it is that we have the greatest number of judges per head of population in Europe but court cases still take longer than anywhere else.' Another priority, following the first round of talks which focussed on tax and economic policies, will be to cut back the Staatsquote - the proportion of gross national product which is consumed by government spending - by 5 per cent to 46 per cent, where it was before German reunification. However, the parties would not say how much money would be saved by making cuts in social security spending, a thorny issue which has been thrust back on the agenda by company bosses who fear the new government will not do enough to cut Germany's high non-labour costs. The three parties will continue talks until midday today and begin again on Wednesday. Each of them has sent five people to the talks which are being chaired by Chancellor Kohl in the Bundeskanzleramt, his squat office complex. But for the occasional break, the negotiators are expected to remain huddled in there until mid-November. The Bundestag, or lower chamber of parliament, will hold its opening session in Berlin on November 10 but all eyes are focussed on Mr Kohl's re-election as chancellor, a vote which is expected to take place in the week beginning November 14. However, the FDP has indicated it wants the coalition talks wrapped up and future ministers named before a vote is called. Following its dismal election result, the second worst since 1949, the party is under pressure to secure as many concessions as it can from the talks before guaranteeing its support for Mr Kohl whose new coalition has only a 10-seat majority in the Bundestag. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the FDP leader, yesterday once again sought to stamp his leadership on the party which had to live through a bitter and very public bout of infighting after the election on October 16. 'The will to end the crisis in the FDP is there,' Mr Kinkel said. 'It is high time (to do so) unless we want forever to remain the party which is talked about more because of its squabbles than its policies.'</p>

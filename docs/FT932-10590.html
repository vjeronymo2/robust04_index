			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (11): A fresh start to an uncertain end - Heinz Kramer discusses the country's relations with the European Community RELATIONS between Turkey and the European Community seem to be back to normal after more than a decade of tensions and frustrations. On November 9 last year, the Association Council was able to agree on a variety of measures which are intended to bring new life to the dormant EC-Turkey association agreement. After more than a decade of inaction, it was decided to resume work on the completion of the customs union which, according to the agreement, should be established by the end of 1995. Added to this was the creation of a political dialogue between the EC and Turkey on the highest level - ie, including head of states and governments. First meetings of newly established or revived groups of experts, among which the Customs Co-operation Committee ranks most prominently, and the visit of Turkey's deputy prime minister, Erdal Inonu, to Brussels and other EC capitals in early 1993 underline the seriousness of the new approach. Turkey, in compliance with its contractual obligations, put into effect, as of January 1, 1993, further reductions of its customs tariffs for imports from the Community at a magnitude of 10 to 20 per cent; and it abolished various special funds for which, in past years, extra levies on imports had been charged. Such levies contravene the stipulations of the association agreement. The continuing economic problems posed to the Turkish economy by the creation of the customs union are, however, revealed by the exemption from the tariff reductions of certain sectors of business like automobiles, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, after heavy pressure put on the government by representatives of these sectors which fear for their international competitiveness. The extra levies, too, have not really been abolished together with the funds, but instead have been transferred to the still existing mass-housing fund, the rates of which have been slightly raised. Hence, the most recent Turkish measures can be regarded as another step in the right direction, but still leave much to do if the deadline is to be met. Turkey is at least showing goodwill in its efforts to normalise relations with the EC. The Community, on its side, still has difficulties in reciprocating. Greece, because of its perennial bilateral conflicts with Turkey over Cyprus and the situation in the Aegean Sea, continues to block any substantial moves of the Twelve towards an improvement. For this reason, there is no prospect of releasing Community aid to Turkey of a magnitude of 600m Ecu pledged under the fourth financial protocol initialled in 1981, nor is there any hope of fully implementing a comprehensive package of technical and economic co-operation measures presented to the Council of Ministers by the Commission in July 1990, the so-called Matutes package. The Twelve are also very reluctant to phase out the non-tariff trade barriers which, in clear violation of the association agreement, impede the free import of Turkish textiles and clothing into EC markets, and which have to be abolished if the customs union is to be a reality. Other measures foreseen in the association agreement, such as free movement of workers, not to speak of Turkish accession to the EC (for which Turkey applied in April 1987), are much further away from being seriously considered. By concentrating on the details of the association agreement, one could get the impression that economic issues are at the heart of EC-Turkey relations. Nothing could be more misleading. The association, from its very beginning in the early 1960s, was mainly intended to serve political ends. EC members wanted to bind closer to the west a country deemed to be an indispensable ally in countering the strategic threat from the east. The Turkish political and economic elite, on their side, saw EC membership as the final objective which would make irreversible Turkey's 'westernisation', begun by the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Hence, Turkey's relations with the EC in the framework of the association agreement have always been influenced more by political factors than by economic developments. This also applies to the new momentum created by the meeting of the Association Council of last November. Although the former political basis of the relationship has been eroded by the collapse of the Soviet empire, 'the Turkish role in the present European situation is of the greatest importance', in the words approved by the European Council at last June's Lisbon summit. EC members view Turkey as an important stabilising factor, not only in the Middle East but also in the crisis-ridden process of restructuring the Soviet heritage in Central Asia and the Caucasus, as well as in relation to the re-opened European powderkeg in the Balkans. Hence the great interest in high level political dialogue with Ankara. In Turkey, the international attention attracted by the country's new strategic role has created a climate of growing self-assertiveness, best represented by the remark of late president Turgut Ozal on the occasion of the summit of Turkic republics last October, that the 21st century will be the 'Turkish century'. But the Ankara government also realises that, in order to meet European expectations and its own aspirations, Turkey needs the support of strong partners. Ankara, therefore, is able and ready to downgrade its sensitivity concerning political differences with the Community, and to do its share in the efforts for a revitalisation of relations, which seems to be in the interest of both sides. But the change in the international environment has even more far-reaching consequences. Both Turkey and the EC are using new mental maps. In Turkey, the public is increasingly aware that there is more to the definition of modern Turkish identity than Anatolia, the nation, and Europe-orientated 'westernisation'. The emergence of a new 'Turkish world', stretching from the Balkans to western China, has encouraged a new emphasis on Islam as well as nationalism, and will contribute to a re-assessment of Turkey's European bonds. On the other hand, in the European public and among its political elites, awareness may grow that the former 'community of fate' (Schicksalsgemeinschaft) between western Europe and Turkey in the field of security policy no longer exists. The EC and Turkey will in future be confronted with quite different strategic challenges. All this may lead to a certain alienation between the two sides, of which the first signs are already visible. It is certainly not mere chance that Turkey has hardly been mentioned in the EC's public debate about 'deepening versus widening'. Efforts at normalisation of EC-Turkey relations 'in line with the prospect laid down in the Association Agreement of 1964' (Lisbon European Council) may become increasingly entangled in the task of defining the final political goal of the relationship beyond the establishment of a customs union. The prevailing uncertainty about the future development of the EC, of Turkey, and of the wider Europe raises the question whether strictly following the paths set out in a quite different past is really the best way to set about forging a common future. Finding an answer to this question may become the real challenge for the European-Turkish political dialogue at the highest level.

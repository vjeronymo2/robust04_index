			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech given by Malian President Alpha Omar Konare at </F> banquet given by Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli  on 16 June--recorded]    [Excerpt] Dear brothers and friends. The presence of  Blaise Compaore, Mahamane Ousmane, and I around our brother host  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi this evening is not a mere coincidence.  It is in the name of common history and our preoccupations now  and in the future, a future we want to build together. We all  reject the current misfortune of our continent. We all refuse  to believe that our continent is a continent of hatred and  violence. What is happening in Rwanda and elsewhere does not  reflect the reality of our continent. This misery and hatred  are not a fatality, and we have the means to end them. Our  presence here also expresses this loud and clear.    Dear friend al-Qadhdhafi, we have come here to express our  solidarity to you and to your people. [applause] The journey  here will never be too long or too uncomfortable. What we are  doing this evening has already been done by the 53 African  states in Tunis. This was already done by the Nonaligned  Movement, by the Arab League, and by the Islamic Conference last  year and this year. We hope that our voice will be heard. We  will do everything so the message gets through in every scene  tomorrow. We have the obligation to do so. The future of the  Libyan people concerns us. It is important that conditions be  created today to continue the march.    It is important that justice should be done today. We stand  by your side in this struggle, dear brother. You are aware of  our problems and the difficulties we are going through at the  moment. We will have to do everything in our power to prevent  our countries from sliding toward ethnic, racial, regional, and  religious conflicts. We cannot fight the battle for democracy  and nationalism on ethnic, racial, regional, and religious  basis. Our continent needs social justice and solidarity today.  It is with solidarity, hard work, and commitment that we will  be able to face this challenge. We need solidarity, and we  should move rapidly towards strong integration of our countries.  Regional integration should not be an empty word or a mere  slogan, otherwise, we condemn our continent to bankruptcy by the  end of the century. Regional integration is a must. We believe  in it, and we will work for it. If we fail to do so, we and our  children will be doomed. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At its June 14, 1994, teleconference meeting, the Committee unanimously recommended that the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year be increased. The Committee recommended that the Native spearmint oil salable quantity be increased from 897,388 pounds to 1,092,577 pounds, and that the allotment percentage, based on a revised total allotment base of 1,951,032 pounds, be increased from 46 to 56 percent resulting in a 195,189 pound increase in the salable quantity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interim final rule incorporating the Committee's June 14, 1994, recommendation was published in the August 26, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 44028). Comments on the interim rule were solicited from interested persons until September 26, 1994. No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to authority contained in sections 985.50, 985.51, and 985.52 of the marketing order, at its October 5, 1994, meeting, the Committee recommended by a unanimous vote to increase the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Scotch spearmint oil. The committee also recommended by 10 to 1 vote an increase in the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil. The person voting in opposition favored a smaller increase in the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the committee recommended that the salable quantities and allotment percentages for Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year be increased from 723,326 pounds to 811,516 pounds, and 1,092,577 pounds to 1,287,680 pounds, respectively. Based on a revised total allotment base of 1,763,795 pounds, the allotment percentage for Scotch spearmint oil is increased from 41 percent to 46 percent, resulting in an 88,190 pound increase in the salable quantity. Further, based on the same revised total allotment base published in the August 26, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 44028) the allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil is increased from 56 percent to 66 percent, resulting in a 195,103 pound increase in the salable quantity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,i1,s100,10,10 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scotch Spearmint Oil Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank;  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Oct. 6, 1993  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Oct. 5, 1994 <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> (1) Salable Quantity  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 723,326  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 811,516  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Total Allotment Base  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,764,209  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,763,795  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Allotment Percentage  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 41  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,i1,s25,10,10,10 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Native Spearmint Oil Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank;  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Oct. 6, 1993  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1June 14, 1994  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Oct. 5, 1994 <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> (1) Salable Quantity  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 897,388  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,092,577  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,287,680  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Total Allotment Base  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,950,843  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,951,032  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,951,032  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Allotment Percentage  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 46  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 56  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In making this recommendation the Committee considered all available information on supply and demand. As of October 5, 1994, the Committee reports that of the respective 1994&hyph;95 Scotch and Native spearmint oil salable quantities of 723,326 pounds and 1,092,577 pounds, and approximately 116,000 pounds and 87,000 pounds, respectively, remained available for handling. Handlers have indicated, however, that demand may approximate 200,000 pounds of Scotch spearmint oil, and 300,000 pounds of Native spearmint oil for the remainder of this marketing year. This level of demand was not anticipated by the Committee when it made its initial recommendation for the establishment of the Scotch and Native spearmint oil salable quantities and allotment percentages for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, nor was it foreseen when the Committee made its June 14, 1994, recommendation for an increase in the Native spearmint oil salable quantity and allotment percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Olivetti shifts Asia Pacific base to China Olivetti, the Italian computers group, is to lift its presence in the rapidly growing Chinese market by making Beijing the base for all its Asia Pacific operations, writes John Simkins in Milan. These operations have previously been directed from the group's Ivrea headquarters. The company plans to focus within China on bank automation. Olivetti is the leading European producer in this area. Olivetti has been active in China since the mid-1980s through offices in Beijing and Shanghai, and a regional base in Hong Kong. A joint venture with the Industrial Commercial Bank of China will produce automatic teller machines for the Chinese market. Olivetti will have a 40 per cent stake in the operation.</p>

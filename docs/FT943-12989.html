			<p>940722 FT  22 JUL 94 / Former B&amp;C chief Gunn faces bar as director Mr John Gunn, the former head of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, faces disqualification as a director after a highly critical Department of Trade and Industry report. The report, published yesterday, also censures merchant bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd and accountants Spicer &amp; Oppenheim over their role in B&amp;C's Pounds 400m acquisition of Atlantic Computers in 1988 which led to the financial services group's collapse in 1990. However, N M Rothschild, which floated Atlantic in 1983, escapes criticism. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is making a court application for the disqualification of Mr Gunn and five other individuals involved. B&amp;C collapsed in 1990 with debts of Pounds 1.2bn after writing off Pounds 550m against its investment in Atlantic, a computer leasing company, which the report concludes had probably never made a profit since it was formed in 1975. The long-awaited report criticised Mr Gunn and two fellow B&amp;C directors, Mr Peter Goldie and Mr Rusty Ashman, for failing to alert other board members or shareholders when they learned of a Pounds 160m 'black hole' in Atlantic's accounts in April 1989. They were also criticised for publishing a 'grossly misleading' set of accounts following the discovery. The inspectors added, however: 'We are satisfied that they were acting in what they perceived at the time (albeit in our view erroneously) to be the best interests of B&amp;C and that they did not act dishonestly in the sense of seeking to defraud any person.' Others facing disqualification are Mr David McCormick, a director of Atlantic at the time of the acquisition, Mr Nicholas Kennedy Scott, who was finance director, and Mrs Sien Yen Cheng Kai On, who was a board member. Mr Gunn said yesterday he was astonished at the report which was 'a shoddy piece of work' containing material inaccuracies. He is to 'vigorously defend' the disqualification action. He attacked the charge that B&amp;C had failed to investigate Atlantic adequately before the acquisition. 'It was the only deal where B&amp;C employed outside advisers.' He also defended the decision not to alert shareholders immediately problems were discovered at Atlantic. 'We were running a company based on the confidence of lenders and market participants and took a prudent approach.' Mr McCormick, who was appointed chief executive of Atlantic after the acquisition, said: 'Despite taking nearly four years to report their findings, the inspectors have criticised me for failing to solve all of Atlantic's problems in little over one year.' Individuals mentioned in the report said that criticism of City institutions in earlier drafts had been toned down. Mr Vernon Davies, co-founder of Atlantic with the late Mr John Foulston and a director and major shareholder until 1986, is criticised in the report but is not facing disqualification. Meanwhile, the administrators of B&amp;C have launched legal action against Spicer &amp; Oppenheim, auditor to Atlantic and now part of accountants Touche Ross. A writ lodged in the High Court on Wednesday claims damages from the firm in relation to negligent professional advice provided during its time as adviser and auditor to the group. The administrators - from accountants Ernst &amp; Young - have also started litigations against BZW and against the directors of the Atlantic companies. The writ does not specify the exact value of a claim, but it may seek redress for any compensation not available from the other actions up to the total of Pounds 416m lost plus interest and costs.

A final statement issued by the political forces  dialogue committee on 18 January 1994:    Praise be to God with whose blessings good deeds are done,  guidance is obtained, and success is achieved. May God's peace  be upon the prophet of love, brotherhood, and peace and upon his  family, companions, and followers.    O patient Yemeni people: The greatness of any people is best  seen in times of hardship and their cultural traits do not stand  out except when the approach they follow to remedy crises and  the methods they use to address and overcome their effects are  known.    In light of the political crisis the country is  experiencing,  and when even the most optimistic people were waiting for the  moment when the situation would explode, the Yemeni people were  wagering on their patience, endurance, and ability to overcome  and end the ordeal. After relying on God, the Yemeni people  pinned all their hopes on the dialogue going on between their  political forces.    O great people: The wisdom of your sons who are holding the  dialogue was confirmed and the wager of your enemies was  defeated. God has granted success to your political forces in  the battle of the greater jihad, the jihad of psyches. Reason  has had the upper hand in the dialogue, whims were defeated, and  everybody reached an agreement in which the devil alone was the  loser and the people were the winner. This agreement is in the  public interest. Its essence and spirit is the building of a  just, democratic society that believes in progress and in which  there is no place for injustice, oppression, violence,  despotism, monopolies of power and wealth, violations of the  constitution and laws, or violations of human rights.    The dialogue committee has reached full agreement on a  historic document that represents an important juncture in the  march of the Yemeni struggle for freedom and progress. This  document strongly bolsters a wise Yemeni approach based on  rejection of all forms of violence and adoption of dialogue as  the only way to settle differences.    The Document of Pledge and Agreement covers the overall  military, security, and political foundations that allow for the  establishment of a modern state with institutions capable of  development and of achieving prosperity and addressing the  people's concerns and problems. This state is also founded on  democracy, the peaceful rotation of power, and the broad  participation of the society on the basis of financial and  administrative decentralization.    O great Yemeni people: Experience has taught us that  violence only breeds destruction and that any concession we make  at the dialogue table is stronger and greater than any gains  made over a heap of bodies and a river of blood.    While declaring the points it had reached and which were  agreed on by all the political forces taking part in the  dialogue, the Political Forces Dialogue Committee thanks all  brothers and friends who have shown sympathy toward Yemen's  crisis and expressed willingness to cooperate. The dialogue  committee also expresses its appreciation for the Yemeni people,  who have been observing its steps and who have supported its  work through their popular conferences. The dialogue committee  urges every Yemeni, who loves his country and cares for his  future and the future of his children, to support the  committee's decisions and to cooperate to achieve those  decisions. Each Yemeni should also bravely side with the  well-intentioned forces that uphold justice, right, and public  interests. Each Yemeni should firmly oppose -- by adopting all  democratic methods -- all forces of evil harboring bad  intentions for Yemen.    The dialogue committee further urges all the sons of the  Yemeni people, civilian and military, to spread a spirit of  love, brotherhood, and tolerance. It also urges them to support  the agreement it has reached and to reject any attempt to use  any method, be it political or military, that aims at  undermining or departing from the agreement.    While declaring its finalization of this historic document  by  the second deadline it had announced, the dialogue committee  will continue to make preparations for a meeting between  political leaders during which the national document shall be  baptized. During this meeting agreement will be reached on  guarantees to implement the accord and an announcement will be  made on the beginning of its implementation and the Yemeni  people's transition to a stage of construction and progress  under the canopy of love, peace, unity, democracy, a state of  law and order, and respect for human rights.    We ask God for success and guidance. We also pray to him not  to lead us astray after he has given us guidance.    [Signed] The Political Forces Dialogue Committee    [Dated] 18 January 1994</p>

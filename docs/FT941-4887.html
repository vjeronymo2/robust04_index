			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: WPP WPP may have lost ordinary shareholders a bundle of money by paying too much for advertising businesses at the wrong time in the cycle. WPP's bankers, though, are likely to be a cheerier bunch after cashing in their convertible shares this year. The bounce in WPP's shares since its refinancing should enable them to make a tidy turn on the shareholding acquired at the time of the debt-for-equity swap. Martin Sorrell may join Rupert Murdoch as a bankers' pin-up boy. J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather are performing soundly. Revenue growth of 4 per cent in constant currency terms stacks up well against comparable agencies. Group operating margins have also improved from 6.9 per cent to 7.6 per cent before severance payments, yet staff costs remain high in comparison with those of rivals such as Omnicom. That suggests WPP could well attain its 10 per cent margin target even though the going gets tougher from here. WPP's bizarre balance sheet should also regain greater normality if the company succeeds in floating its market research business. Likely proceeds of Dollars 200m would certainly make a useful dent in average debt of Pounds 339m. The market seems to have forgiven all WPP's past sins and is discounting much of its future promise, too. WPP's shares again stand on a fancy premium, which may be fair given its margin recovery and prospects for advertising growth. Still, WPP's caution about the strength of recovery and the forthcoming share conversion may dull the immediate shine.</p>

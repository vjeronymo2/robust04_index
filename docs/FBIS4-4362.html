			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai is in favour of  setting up nuclear power plants, saying the growing demand for  electricity will inevitably force Thailand to adopt the nuclear  option.    "Nuclear power is a sensitive issue and something very new  for our country. People may not understand and accept it but we  should not overlook it," he said.    Chuan presided over a seminar entitled "Nuclear Power  Plants," held at Parliament yesterday. He said nuclear power  could not be rejected since it is a vital new resource for  generating electricity.    He said nuclear power had been used elsewhere for more than  20 years due to increasing demand for power worldwide.    Chuan said that 20 years ago, Thailand consumed only 1,000  megawatts of electricity. This year, demand has risen to 9,800  megawatts.    "And in 15-20 years, demand will be 30,000 megawatts," he  said.    At present, Thailand has to import electricity from Laos and  natural gas from Malaysia, Vietnam and Burma.    Although there were many other fossil fuels for electricity  generation, the world was concerned about their environmental  impact. He quoted the greenhouse effect, and acid rain as  examples of problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels.    "The government is interested in nuclear power as one of a  number of options for the future," he said.    He said he had instructed the Sciences Technology and  Environment Ministry to amend the laws concerning nuclear power  plants and to formulate an organizational structure to supervise  the new industry.    "Everything must comply with international standards. We  want to be sure people will be safe and that it will not affect  the environment," he said.    He stressed that public sentiment over the issue was the  most  important factor.    "The government will study the positive and negative aspects  of nuclear power plants. And we will pay prime attention to the  public's feelings," he said.    The chairman of the House committee on energy, At-ong  Chumsai  na Ayutthaya, recently insisted on the need to build nuclear  power plants and criticized an opposing conclusion reached by  the House environment committee.    "We have to select the best and safest system. Don't take  bad examples which rely on one-sided information," he said.    A Phalang Tham Bangkok MP, At-ong said before deciding  whether or not to build nuclear power plants, it is necessary to  study the size of the country's remaining energy reserves.    "We have to accept that the energy demand is rising. The  consumption of electricity increases by 1,000 megawatts yearly."    "We are not talking about a change which will happen today  or  tomorrow but we are focusing on the situation in 50 years, when  other energy sources have already gone," he said.</p>

Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 14 (CNA) -- Ever-increasing  investments made by domestic manufacturers in Mainland China  will have a positive impact on Taiwan's economy in the short  term, an official at the Council for Economic Planning and  Development (CEPD) said Friday [14 January].    K.C. Li, director of the CEPD Economic Research Department,  made the remarks at a public hearing on the influence of the  mainland investment fever.    The public hearing was sponsored by legislators P.H. Peng  and  T.J. Tsai of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.    Taiwan investors relocated their production lines to the  other side of the Taiwan Strait mainly due to the cheap labor,  low land prices, and easy land acquisition on the mainland, Li  pointed out.    The investment advantages make production costs on the  mainland much lower than on Taiwan, thereby benefiting Taiwan  investors, he elaborated.    Growing Taiwan investment in Mainland China, which in turn  pushed up mainland demand for Taiwan's products such as electric  and electronics parts as well as machinery, has fueled Taiwan's  exports, he added.    The mainland investment fever has therefore emerged as the  driving force behind Taiwan's economic growth in the past few  years, he noted, saying Taiwan's economy might post zero growth  without mainland investment.    Statistics show that approved investment in Mainland China  amounted to US$3.16 billion last year, while other outbound  investment totaled US$1.66 billion. Unofficial estimates put  aggregate Taiwan investment in Mainland China at roughly US$10  billion.    The CEPD official, however, expressed the worry that more  big  Taiwan enterprises might follow their small- and medium-sized  counterparts to the mainland.    Too many and too big investment projects in Mainland China  will eat away at Taiwan's capital, he said.    In the long run, he said, the government must work to  improve  the domestic investment climate and to expedite the upgrading of  the industrial base with a view to gaining an upper hand on the  international market.</p>

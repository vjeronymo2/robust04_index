			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Ukraine is ready to sell 42  strategic bombers which it inherited from the former Soviet  Union to Russia, but claims eight billion U.S. dollars for them  (15 trillion roubles), while Russia believes 217 billion roubles  are enough.    Although Russia needs the planes it will not pay such a  price  for them. "If Ukraine does not agree to our terms the planes  will remain on its territory," Liutenant-General Yuriy Merkulov  from the Defence Ministry told TASS.    Military experts told TASS on Tuesday that Russia needs the  bombers as they are not liable to reduction under the START I  Treaty. They will be decommissioned only after their service  time expires.    At present the Russian Air Force has 77 heavy bombers and it  is hard to build new ones because of financial difficulties. No  changes are planned by the Defence Ministry regarding the number  of bombers.    Defence Ministry sources also told TASS that Russian  estimates were made in 1993 prices and took into account  ammortization costs, but Ukraine objected to such an approach.    At the same time Kiev has no money and technical  possibilities to maintain the bombers in proper order by itself.</p>

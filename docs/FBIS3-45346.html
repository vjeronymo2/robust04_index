"The move proves that our government attaches great  importance to strengthening trade and economic cooperation  [words indistinct] Vietnam," said Sheu, who returned to Taipei  Thursday from a visit to Hanoi.    The five-year loan, with an interest rate of 7 percent per  annum, will be administered by the Vietnamese central bank to  help Taiwan land developers build a 200-hectare industrial zone  in Vietnam's capital city, Sheu noted.    The money will come from the International Economic  Cooperation and Development Fund established by the ROC  Government in 1989 to offer financial aid to needy developing  countries.    Taiwan has already lent Vietnam US$30 million to expand a  highway and another US$15 million to fund the development of  small- and medium-sized Vietnamese companies.    The planned Hanoi industrial park will be the second such  zone Taiwan has helped build in Vietnam. A similar industrial  park has been set up in Ho Chi Minh City to house  Taiwan-invested firms.    There are some 700 Taiwan-invested companies in Ho Chi Minh  City and more than 40 local manufacturers have expressed  intention to set up production lines in Hanoi, Sheu reported.    Taiwan businessmen have poured more than US$1.2 billion for  various investment projects in Vietnam since the late 1980s,  making Taiwan one of Vietnam's major foreign capital source.    Sheu said the government will send investment officials to  Vietnam in the near future to help that country simplify its  investment procedures.</p>

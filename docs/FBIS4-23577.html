			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yoweri Museveni has said there is now a  basis for a cease-fire in Rwanda and again called on the Rwanda  Patriotic Front [RPF] to accept the cease-fire and start  implementing the Arusha accord aimed at ending the massacre in  the Central African state. The Ugandan leader stated this in a  speech broadcast live on Radio Uganda from (Kisawera) in Mukono  District, where this year's Heroes Day was celebrated at the  national level. He told an attentive audience that he feels  there is now a basis for a cease- fire in Rwanda because of the  Arusha Accord signed in the northern Tanzania town last year and  the resolution passed by the United Nations Human Rights  Commission recently condemning genocide in Rwanda. The  resolution called for precaution for persecution of those found  responsible. He said the Arusha Accord, which provides for the  sharing of power, is a good basis. Maybe, he added, it now  needs modification because (?some) of the people who would have  taken part in power-sharing have been involved in genocide. On  the UN Human Rights Commission's resolution condemning genocide,  the president said genocide is not an internal issue and pledged  that the Ugandan Government will (?call) on the United Nations  to hand those responsible.</p>

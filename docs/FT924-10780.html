			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: LVMH shares fall on static sales SHARES in LVMH, the French luxury goods group, fell by FFr231 to FFr3,570 (Dollars 693.20) on the Paris stock market yesterday after the company announced static sales for the first three quarters of the year and forecast stable profits. The group, which owns a string of prestigious brand names, said it had been affected by the increasingly 'difficult and uncertain' economic environment and the instability of exchange rates. Sales rose by less than 1 per cent to FFr14.7bn, from FFr14.66bn in the same period of 1991. The only division to show growth was perfume and beauty products, which lifted sales from FFr3.86bn to FFr3.36bn. Sales of wines and spirits fell to FFr6.9bn to FFr7.45bn, reflecting the depressed state of the champagne market. Luggage sales suffered a negligible fall to FFr3.39bn from FFr3.42bn. However, LVMH said its 1992 results 'should be close' to those of 1991, when it made net profits of FFr3.74bn on sales of FFr22.04bn.</p>

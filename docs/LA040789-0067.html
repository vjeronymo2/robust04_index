			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: COMING ATTRACTIONS  </P> <P> Memorabilia from the Goldwyn era of Hollywood is going on display -- in  Hollywood. "The Goldwyn Age of Hollywood" exhibit will open Monday at the  Frances Howard Goldwyn Hollywood Library, 1623 Ivar Ave., showing a wide range  of items that span the life of legendary film-maker Samuel Goldwyn. On Sunday,  Samuel Goldwyn Jr. will host an invitation-only party that not only will kick  off the exhibit but also mark the publishing of a book about his father,  "Goldwyn: A Biography," and note the re-release of his father's favorite film,  "Wuthering Heights" on its 50th anniversary (the film opens locally Wednesday).  Sunday night's celebrity guest list includes Bette Davis, Sally Field, Charlton  Heston, Dorothy Lamour and several original Goldwyn Girls, including Virginia  Mayo. The exhibit continues through July 8. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

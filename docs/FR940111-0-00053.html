			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the comment of Illinois DOT that EPA can sanction less than an entire nonattainment area, the Agency agrees that under section 110(m)'s broad grant of authority for the imposition of discretionary sanctions, EPA may select an area smaller than the nonattainment area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IEPA comments that EPA is treating the geographic limitations of the highway and offset sanctions differently and that EPA should say that highway sanctions are also limited in scope. The EPA disagrees. First, we believe that both sanctions may be imposed on any portion of the State. However, by its method of application, the offset sanction will only have effect in those areas that must apply the emission offset requirements of section 173. Therefore, the offset sanction would have no effect in certain areas. The highway sanction is not self-limiting; therefore, it will have a broader effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the EPA did not rely on legislative history to override statutory language, but rather to support statutory language that grants EPA discretion to apply sanctions to other than nonattainment areas. The Illinois DOT bases its argument that the legislative history does not support the imposition of sanctions beyond the nonattainment area on an assumption that section 110(m) does not provide an independent grant of authority to impose sanctions. However, the Act does provide two separate grants of sanction authority with different geographic scopes; this is supported by the language of the Act, as described above, and by the legislative authority. The language from H. Conf. Rep. No. 101&hyph;952 that references the imposition of sanctions on an area that fails to attain the air quality standard appears to refer to the imposition of sanctions under section 179 because it discusses the required imposition of sanctions. The language cited by EPA in the preamble to the proposed rule addresses a different grant of statutory authority to impose sanctions, namely, that authority under section 110(m). In addition, Illinois DOT cites H. Rep. No. 101&hyph;490, which clearly provides that EPA may impose sanctions beyond nonattainment areas by stating that EPA ``*&blank;*&blank;* is empowered to apply sanctions to any portion of a State.'' The committee goes on to clarify how it believes EPA should use this broad grant of authority, indicating that EPA should impose sanctions on the governmental entity that is ``primarily responsible,'' and noting that a State legislature's failure to adopt an inspection/maintenance program is a circumstance where statewide sanctions are appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 110(m) Does Not Establish Independent Authority to Sanction  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Virginia DOT believes section 179 is the basis for imposing sanctions and is not superseded by section 110(m). Furthermore, the Virginia DOT comments that section 110(m) expands on section 179 by requiring that an additional minimum 6-month grace period must be observed after the initial 18-month period (i.e., 24 months) before sanctions may be imposed on a statewide basis where a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. The City of Chicago comments that EPA's proposed imposition of statewide sanctions under section 110(m) as an alternative to section 179 would vitiate section 179. Once EPA determines none of the political subdivisions meet the criteria, and thus the entire State is principally responsible for a section 179(a) deficiency, EPA is bound by the requirements of section 179. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The EPA agrees that sanctions cannot be imposed statewide within the first 24 months following a finding where a political subdivision is found principally responsible for the deficiency. However, EPA disagrees that section 179 provides the sole authority for imposing sanctions and, in doing so, allows for the imposition of statewide sanctions. As discussed in the response to Comment 2 above, section 179 does not refer to the imposition of statewide sanctions and, in fact, focuses on the imposition of sanctions in nonattainment areas. In fact, the EPA believes the reference to statewide sanctions under section 110(m) makes it clear that section 110(m) establishes a different authority to sanction States and that statewide sanctions are not required under section 179. Section 110(m) provides that statewide sanctions shall not be applied within 24 months of the time a finding is made if a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency; this provision means that statewide sanctions may be imposed earlier than 24 months if no political subdivision is found principally responsible. If section 179 required statewide sanctions after 18 months, it would be contrary to the section 110(m) provision that sanctions shall not apply within the 24 months following the finding if a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. Therefore, EPA believes that its ability to impose statewide sanctions during the 24-month period following a finding is based on a determination under section 110(m) that a political subdivision is not principally responsible for the deficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Water market flows Whatever their misgivings about the way yesterday's decision was reached, Nestle and BSN have reason to cheer the outcome. For both companies, approval of the deal opens the way to further expansion in a growing and immensely profitable business. Mineral waters have long been popular in much of continental Europe. But in the past decade, the habit spread rapidly to other countries including the US, Britain and Japan. Though recession has dampened growth rates, which were running as high as 15 per cent a year in the late 1980s, industry experts believe consumers' concerns with health and the quality of tap water still provide plenty of longer-term potential. Nestle first entered the market in 1969 by buying a share of the French Vittel company, of which it acquired full control two years ago. But though Nestle is the world's biggest producer of chocolate, dairy products and soluble coffee, it has remained until now a marginal player in mineral water. The business requires heavy investments in marketing, making it cheaper and quicker to grow by acquiring existing brands than by launching new ones. When Perrier became available earlier this year, it offered Nestle a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to achieve world leadership. Perrier owns some of the strongest brands in the business. But its performance has been depressed since a benzene scare savaged its profits two years ago, while the company has struggled for several years to make a go of the string of bottled water companies which it acquired in the US. Under Nestle's ownership, results are expected to recover sharply. There are substantial savings to be made by combining distribution of water from the Vittel and Contrexeville springs in eastern France, while Nestle's powerful marketing and distribution clout should boost Perrier's sales and profits, particularly in the US. The scope for improvement is indicated by the operating margins of 20 per cent or more which BSN has long earned on mineral water. However, Mr Sylvain Massot, drinks analyst with Morgan Stanley, points out that BSN's impressive performance masks a problem. Profits in mineral water depend heavily on being able to keep bottling plants fully loaded, and BSN's results have been so good partly because several of its springs are operating close to capacity. Output of its Badoit water can no longer be increased without risking damage to the spring, while Evian, BSN's biggest brand, is also expected to hit production constraints in a few years. BSN's planned acquisition of Volvic from Nestle will relieve some of the pressure. Not only is Volvic a firmly established brand, with about 11 per cent of the French market, but its spring is still operating well below capacity.</p>

The experience that Ukraine has accrued  in relation to small nuclear power plant-based district  home-heating systems in such areas as Zaporozhye and the  Yuzhno-Ukrainsk area has conformed that such systems are  reliable and safe and that it is technically feasible to create  high-performance nuclear power plant-based centralized heat  supply systems. The institute Ukraine Power Industry  [Ukrenergoprom] has conducted technical and economic, planning  and design, and exploratory studies regarding the use of  existing, as-yet incomplete, and planned nuclear power plants in  all regions of the former USSR and member countries of the  former CEMA for purposes of district heating of cities and  population centers within a 150-km radius around the said  nuclear power plants. The studies confirmed the economic and  technical feasibility of such a plan over a wide range of  thermal loads. Studies have also indicated that the  series-produced and modified condensation turbines that have  been developed for nuclear power plants at the Turboatom  Scientific Production Association in Kharkov make it possible to  provide the thermal loads required in all nuclear power  plant-based central heating systems. In Ukraine, the most  realistic scenario for heating the cities of Nikopol, Marganets,  and Zaporozhye is that of creating central heating systems based  on the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. Toward that end, the  Ukrenergoprom is collaborating with the institute  Atomenergoproyekt in Kharkov and the Turboatom Scientific  Production Association to conduct detailed technical and  economic studies this year. The said studies will be followed by  design and exploratory studies to substantiate the economic and  ecological feasibility and technical possibility of creating  Ukraine's first large-scale nuclear power plant-based district  home-heating system. According to calculations already  performed, by 2000-2005, the six units of the Zaporozhye Nuclear  Power Plant can, even if only bled of 230 MW (200 Gcal/h) heat,  cover the thermal load calculated for a central heating system  to meet the home-heating needs of Nikopol, Marganets, and  Zaporozhye. The projected central heating system will replace  more than 2.2 million metric tons of fossil fuel per year and  reduce toxic stack gas emissions in the three cities by 60-70  percent.

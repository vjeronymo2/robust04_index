This  was said when he met, in his office today at the Friendship  Hall, a delegation from Bara Province visiting Khartoum to take  part in the consultative meeting which convened recently between  the president and executive and popular leaderships to discuss  the redivision of the states.    Lt. Gen. al-Bashir explained to the delegation that the  government relies upon the project for the redivision of the  states because of the revenue that it will achieve in the field  of development, despite its exorbitant financial cost. Lt. Gen.  al- Bashir explained that the new states need an unleashing of  energies and the deployment of available resources to guarantee  the continuation of true development. He pointed out that there  is no way of building Sudan except by self-reliance and  concerted official and popular effort.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Dabbagh, secretary general of </F> Saudi Council of Chambers of Commerce, by Ahmad Rashwan; place  and date not given--first three paragraphs AL-ANBA'  introduction]    [Text] Perhaps the major trait of the budgets of the GCC  [Arab Gulf Cooperation Council] countries this year is their  general trend toward decreases. This is seen as a realistic and  wise step in adapting to the changes imposed by circumstances in  the global oil market.    This is according to 'Abdallah Tahir al-Dabbagh, secretary  general of the Council of Saudi Chambers, in a wide-ranging  interview with AL-ANBA', in which he said that the world is  today experiencing a period of enormous changes, which the  economic managers of all the GCC countries are trying to grapple  with. Their first priority is to maintain the strength of each  country's national economy, and their continued growth, through  local and foreign fiscal support and stability. The interview  also includes an assessment of the joint economic course of the  GCC states, from the signing of the unified economic agreement  until the present. Al-Dabbagh said that, despite achievements at  the economic level, there are some problems and difficulties  that hamper the economic course. The interview touched on the  GCC states' economic and trade relations with economic and  global factors, the development of the dialogue with the United  States, the European Community, and Japan, as well as the  importance of the commercial arbitration center, which the  Riyadh summit agreed to set up. He confirmed that this center  would be basic support for the protection of GCC citizens'  rights, and would conclude legal difficulties they face in  foreign arbitration centers.    Al-Dabbagh also shed light on the economic reform measures  that have been enacted in several Arab countries, and the extent  of their involvement in promoting trade and investment  cooperation among Arab countries, in addition to the biggest  obstacles to investment that still exist in the region.    The text of the interview follows:    [Rashwan] How do you assess current economic conditions in  the Gulf region? To what extent has the oil slump affected  economic activity in the region in general?    [Al-Dabbagh] To start with, I must say that we are living in  a period in which the world is experiencing enormous changes. So  the economic managers in all the Gulf countries are eager to  adapt to them in such a way as to maintain, first of all, the  strength of the national economy in each of the Gulf states, and  their continued growth, by supporting local and foreign fiscal  stability. The first tool is the maintenance of the value of the  currency of each country, and strengthening them, to handle the  prices of foreign currencies; that would be a basic guarantee of  the continuity of self-sustaining growth.    Naturally, the fall in oil revenues is having an effect on  the economies of the region, but not to a very large extent;  this is thanks to the Gulf states' policy during the years of  high oil revenues of building an infrastructure, raising the  citizens' standard of living, and raising the standard of public  services, especially educational, health, and social services.  This policy was a great success, as anyone who follows the  renewal movement of the Gulf states can see.    The Gulf states also succeeded, in the same time period, in  creating large financial reserves, easing the process of  adapting the Gulf states' economic policies to the reality of  reduced oil revenues. The governments have adopted wise fiscal  policies to adapt the economy gradually to the new level of oil  revenues. This can easily be seen in the development plans.  <H5>  Wise and Realistic Decision </H5>   [Rashwan] All the GCC state budgets announced cuts, as a  result of many global factors. How can this be dealt with, in  your view, in such a way as to maintain the energy of the  development process?    [Al-Dabbagh] In the beginning, we may point out that the  Gulf  states who have announced their budgets so far are Saudi Arabia  and the Sultanate of Oman. The budgets of the United Arab  Emirates and Kuwait are in the final review phase. Whatever the  position now on issuing GCC state budgets, the budgets' major  trait is the general trend toward reduction. This may be seen as  a realistic and wise measure, to adapt to changes abroad imposed  by conditions in the global oil market. In any case, even if  these budgets are being reduced, if we want to have a deeper and  more comprehensive understanding of the meaning of these  budgets, we must look beyond these numbers themselves, to the  long-term meanings of a number of local and global indicators  and data. If we look at the Saudi budget as a specimen of the  GCC states' new budgets, we can say that this budget is  excellent, given prevailing global conditions. This is because  Saudi Arabia has not become a debtor nation, nor is it unable to  meet its commitments; nor has it abandoned its large economic  projects; nor has it taken other routes that might have led to  doubts about the soundness of its economy. The decision to  reduce government expenditure is only an unforeseen, stand-by  measure in the Saudi economy; and it represents, in itself, a  strength hidden inside the economy, whether in terms of  allocating many government assets, or  rationalization--especially after the Kingdom's success in  creating and developing a national sector that is growing and  maturing every year, in a way that has enabled it to play a  leading role in stimulating the Saudi economy. This has led to  the reduction in the importance of government spending in  stimulating economic activity at the expense of that sector's  investments. In another sense, government spending now  represents just one factor--even if it is the most important  one--of a group of factors affecting economic movement in the  Kingdom and numerous other GCC states, too.  <H5>  The Private Sector </H5>   [Rashwan] How do you view the role of the private sector at  this stage, with Saudi resources dwindling due to the drop in  oil prices. More specifically, what is the role of the private  sector at this stage?    [Al-Dabbagh] As a result of ongoing conditions in the world  oil market, wise government policy has required us to adapt to  the drop in oil prices. This is because oil revenues represent  75 percent of the state's total public revenues, and as a  result, state spending has declined 20 percent in the new  budget. A realistic analysis of this decline is that, in the big  picture, it is consistent with the course set out in the  development strategy of the Kingdom's plan beginning with the  sixth development plan (1415-1420 [1995-1200]), which strongly  emphasized a clear policy opening the way for private sector  initiatives in the areas of investment and financing. This is in  line with the plan's intentions, and to a large extent opens the  way for the private sector to have a leading, even a commanding  role in the development process. So the decrease is not part of  a deflationary policy aimed at lowering total spending in the  capital economy; it is the expression of changing places between  public spending and private spending. More specifically, it is  an attempt to change places in development efforts with a  partial transformation of the government's role in funding the  development process, into a basic role of the national sector in  the future. This would encourage one of the main items in the  statement of the minister of Finance and National Economy: that  the national sector maintain its effectiveness in developing the  growth rates of the local product, despite the decline in oil  revenues. This means that one may expect the drop in public  spending to be compensated by an increase in private spending,  or, more generally, to boost the role of the private sector in  the development process, and its financing.  <H5>  Achievements and Difficulties </H5>   [Rashwan] How would you assess the joint economic course of  the GCC states since the signing of the unified economic accord?    [Al-Dabbagh] Before answering this important question, I  would like to say that, despite the short time that has elapsed  since the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council, its  economic achievements are clear. Its efforts have made great  strides on the road to economic integration, cooperation, and  coordination, and this success has led to new effectiveness and  increased success.    The GCC states' unified economic accord, with its policies  and joint economic programs, has had many significant economic  achievements. There are, as well, some problems in implementing  the accord, which GCC leaders are acting to redress, in order to  implement the accord implemented quickly. Perhaps the most  significant economic achievements are:    First, in the area of economic citizenship and equality of  treatment:     -  The natural and legal citizens of the GCC states are  allowed to pursue most economic activities, with gradual  equality with the citizens of the countries in which they engage  in these activities. All professionals and most vocational  workers, including consultants, may engage in their professions  and vocations in the GCC states. They will be accorded the same  treatment as the citizens of the host countries. This includes  wholesale and retail merchants.    -  It gives the citizens of GCC states the right to obtain loans  from banks and industrial funds.    -  It permits the citizens of GCC states to own land for  residential purposes.    -  It accords all GCC citizens equality in tax treatment, the  same  as that of citizens in the host GCC-member country in which they  are engaging in economic and investment activity.    -  It allows the citizens of GCC states to own shares in joint  ventures and new companies active in various economic  activities.    -  It achieves equality of treatment at the elementary,  intermediate, and secondary levels of education, and seeks to  achieve equality in university-level education and unification  of procedures in academic degrees and elementary, intermediate,  and secondary diplomas and certificates. In the same area, it  was decided that the citizens of GCC states resident in or  visiting any GCC state will receive equal treatment when going  to health centers, clinics, and public hospitals.    -  Customs tariffs were voided for agricultural and livestock  products, and natural resource and industrial products from  national installations, as from March 1983.    -  Natural and legal [citizen] producers may export their  products  directly to another member country, with no need for a local  agent.    -  In addition, production units will be allowed to open offices  to promote their products and services to their customers with  no need for a local agent.    -  In government projects and government purchasing, priority  will  be given to national products and products of national  origin.       Finally, the necessary facilities will be offered to ships  and boats owned by any of the member countries or their  citizens, and they will receive treatment equal to that of a  local ship.    Second: In the area of coordinating and unifying GCC states'  policies:     -  Goals and policies of development plans:    -  A joint agricultural policy.    -  A unified industrial development strategy.    -  An oil lending system.    -  A regional emergency plan for petroleum products and their  exchange among GCC states.    -  Goals and policies for negotiating with countries and  economic  blocs, in addition to a cultural development plan.    -  Policies and general principles for protecting the  environment  in GCC states.    -  A document on controls on foreign media.    -  A charter on media honor.    -  Unification of prices and fees on services, including  fuels.       Third: the area of joint ventures and the establishment of  joint institutions. This is an area in which the GCC states have  enacted numerous laws and measures aimed at encouraging joint  ventures, among them:        -  Regulations for coordinating the establishment of  industrial projects and the establishment of a permanent  committee for the encourgement of coordination in setting up  projects, studying any problems faced by existing projects, and  finding solutions for them.    -  Enacting a system for the joint protection of national  products.    -  Adopting unified standards for major commodities.    -  Organizing annual commercial exhibitions to coincide with  summit conferences.    -  Allowing citizens to own shares in some companies.    -  Establishing a permanent committee to encourage small  industry.       Since the founding of the GCC, a number of joint  institutions  have been founded: the Gulf Investment Organziation, the GCC  States Standards and Specifications Commission, the Technical  Liaison Office, the GCC Program to Support Development in the  Arab Countries, the Joint GCC Office with the International  Civil Aviation Organization, and the GCC Center for the  Protection of Intellectual Property.    Fourth: in the area of intensifying channels of contact and  networking, we have seen:     -  The establishment of the Gulf Marketing Association,  registered in Bahrain.    -  The High-Pressure Electrical Engineering Association,  registered in Qatar. There are also joint programs and camps to  foster youth-related, athletic, cultural, artistic, and theater  encounters.    -  Regular meetings with chambers of commerce and industry to  keep  them informed of the GCC's economic decisions, and for them to  discuss the formulas of decisions that affect them, listen to  any complaints, and give their views on collective action.   <H5>    Gulf Chambers </H5>   [Rashwan] Will there be a role for the Gulf chambers to play  in the future to increase cooperation and help achieve the stage  of economic integration among the GCC states?    [Al-Dabbagh] Despite the GCC's economic achievements, there  are still some problems and obstacles hindering the economic  course. So there is an important kind of cooperation and  coordination among the councils and federations of chambers of  commerce in the GCC states. This cooperation and coordination is  based on a partnership in solving the problems and obstacles  that are hindering the economic course, so that the  implementation experience does not hit stumbling blocks. The  councils and federations are working on liaison, coordination,  and cooperation among themselves in the area of consulting,  exchanging views, arranging meetings and conferences, preparing  joint studies in areas of economic activity, or through joint  cooperation on service and productive projects to whose capital  GCC businessmen can contribute. They are also simplifying the  procedures for GCC businessmen engaging in commercial,  industrial, and service activiities in other countries, all in  accordance with the accord, and with the help of the federation  of chambers of commerce.    Of course, the councils of Gulf chambers have an important  role in the next phase, which will require the GCC states to  face all the difficulties that stand in the way of implementing  the unified economic accord, on the way to the point of economic  integration among the Gulf states.  <H5>  Arbitration Center </H5>   [Rashwan] How do you view the importance of the Gulf  commercial arbitration center the Riyadh summit decided to  establish?    [Al-Dabbagh] The decision of the recent Riyadh summit to  establish a commercial arbitration center for the GCC states  came at the same time as the Saudi Cabinet's resolution that  Saudi Arabia would join the New York Agreement, to acknowledge  and implement the rulings of foreign arbitrators. Needless to  say, these two events are the beginning of a new era of  international commercial arbitration at the GCC level.    Turning to the importance of the Gulf commercial arbitration  center, this center will be a basic support for the protection  of GCC citizens' rights. It will conclude the legal efforts they  are enduring in foreign arbitration centers, because of the lack  of recognized Arab or Gulf arbitration centers. On another  front, the fact that Islamic law is the legal basis for settling  commercial disputes, and the law that must be applied in  disputes brought before the center, prevents the Muslim  merchants of the Gulf from being subjected to foreign legal  regulations that may contain outright contraventions of Islamic  law, as used to happen. Naturally, the establishment of this  center will encourage foreign firms to invest in the Gulf and  boost the volume of their commercial dealings in the Gulf  markets; they will have confidence in its legal foundation, and  commercial arbitration will be an acknowledged principle in the  settlement of any disputes between them an a Gulf entity. It is  enough that it will be possible to stipulate in contracts  ratified by two sides that disputes between the two sides will  be settled by arbitration, in accordance with the measures and  regulations of the Gulf commercial arbitration center.  <H5>  Investment Obstacles </H5>   [Rashwan] What are the chief obstacles to investment you  think still exist in the Arab region? Do you think the Gulf  region is a place that can absorb funds invested from abroad?    [Al-Dabbagh] Actually, the question of investment obstacles  in the Arab countries has become a basic subject at any  conference or Arab economic meeting. If we look at the laws that  promote investing in the Arab countries, we may say that these  laws have not had a practical and palpable effect at the  pan-Arab level. This is due to many basic factors, chiefly the  fact that these laws are just one factor out of many that make  up the general investment climate in a given country. There are  other economic, political, and social factors that play an  important role in attracting and guiding foreign investment.  There is evidence that the investment atmosphere in the Arab  world, particularly in the private sector, is still full of  obstacles. This has been confirmed by the results of a new  questionnaire produced by the Arab Investment Guarantee  Organization on the investment climate in the Arab world. It was  circulated among a select group of Arab investors in diverse  Arab countries. The results of the questionnaire indicated that  the greatest obstacle was bureaucracy, the difficulty of  registration and licensing measures, limited local markets, the  lack of clarity and stability of the investment laws in some  countries, and instability and slumps in the value of the local  currency of some other countries, in addition to the lack of  trained manpower. Turning to the investment climate in the Gulf  states, we may say that, in light of current circumstances, the  GCC states are seen as being among the most attractive areas for  investment, thanks to the political stability they enjoy; their  financial resources, which are sufficient to fund their  industrial activities, or to participate in them with foreign  investors; adherence to the principle of free economic activity;  and encouragement of private initiatives. I may add that the GCC  states have advanced infrastructures and a significant strategic  location, and they enjoy a high per capita income and a strong  consumer inclination.</p>
